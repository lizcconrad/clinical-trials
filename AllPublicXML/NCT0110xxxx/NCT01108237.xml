  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation is intended to provide clinical information about alignment using
      TruMatch™ and to compare the results to a conventional total knee replacement. TruMatch™ will
      be compared to a historical control study, which compares alignment results of computer aided
      surgery (CAS) and conventional surgical techniques.

      The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether TruMatch™ alignment is non-inferior
      to alignment achieved with conventional instrumentation. This investigation will compare long
      leg alignment in total knee replacement achieved by the two types of procedures. Radiographic
      analysis will be performed by the same independent radiographic reviewer as the historical
      control study.

      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, clinical investigation
      to determine whether TruMatch™ alignment is non-inferior to alignment achieved in a recently
      completed study (historical control) with conventional instrumentation.

      Each enrolled Subject will undergo a total knee replacement using the TruMatch™ surgical
      technique. This investigation will require the Subject to be followed once postoperatively to
      collect radiographs. Follow-up will occur typically 2 to 12 weeks after surgery and when the
      Subject can achieve full leg extension (+/-5 degrees) and can tolerate weight-bearing.

    <time_frame>12 weeks postoperatively (when subject has reached full knee extension)</time_frame>
    <description>Limb alignment in TKR is important for accurate implant positioning. It is measured by looking at the mechanical axis of the limb. This axis is an imaginary line that starts at center of the femoral head and ends in the center of the talus. In a knee with normal alignment, this line (axis) passes near the joint center. Before surgery, the planned joint angle is recorded. This study measured the difference between the mechanical axis angle reached after surgery and the planned angle. Subjects with a mechanical alignment within 3 degrees of the planned angle were considered a success.</description>

    <description>TruMatch™ Personalized Solutions is the brand name of DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. custom patient instrumentation. TruMatch™ is a pair of custom-made cutting blocks that allow distal femoral and proximal tibial cuts to be made according to a predefined surgical plan. The inner surface of the femoral block is manufactured to match the geometry of the patient's distal femur. The inner surface of the tibial block is manufactured to match the patient's proximal tibia. The geometric data is obtained from a CT scan and a preoperative plan approved by the surgeon.</description>

          -  Subject is male or female and between the ages of 18 and 80 years old, inclusive.

          -  Subject requires a primary total knee replacement and is considered by the
             Investigator to be suitable for the specific knee prosthesis identified in the
             protocol.

        <title>Mechanical Axis Alignment(Absolute Value Measured in Degrees)Using 51 Inch Long Leg Films</title>
        <description>Limb alignment in TKR is important for accurate implant positioning. It is measured by looking at the mechanical axis of the limb. This axis is an imaginary line that starts at center of the femoral head and ends in the center of the talus. In a knee with normal alignment, this line (axis) passes near the joint center. Before surgery, the planned joint angle is recorded. This study measured the difference between the mechanical axis angle reached after surgery and the planned angle. Subjects with a mechanical alignment within 3 degrees of the planned angle were considered a success.</description>
