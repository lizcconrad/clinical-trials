  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Pioglitazone as an adjunct to Citalopram is
      effective in treatment of moderate to severe depression
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pioglitazone as a Ppar-gamma agonist is an anti diabetic drug. It was also shown that, it has
      certain anti inflammatory and neuro-protective effects. In recent years it has been proposed
      that Ppar-gamma agonists may have effects on mood and cognition. In animal studies and in one
      human case report as well as a pilot study on human subjects these drugs improved symptoms of
      depression. A randomized controlled and double blind design will provide further evidence for
      the efficacy of these drugs in major depressive disorder.

    <description>Hamilton Depression rating scale is a 17-item scale. The questionnaire rates the severity of symptoms observed in depression such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss. The questionnaire is presently one of the most commonly used scales for rating depression in medical research. The primary outcome measure is Scores on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at the end (week 6)</description>
