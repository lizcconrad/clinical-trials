    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of gait training on ground level,
      combining BWS and FES in people following chronic stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The body weight support system (BWS) associated to a treadmill as well as to a functional
      electrical stimulation (FES) of the common peroneal nerve, has been proposed as a strategy
      for gait training in people following stroke. Moreover, it has also considered that the
      ground level is the most common locomotion surface, and that there is little information
      about the effects of gait training, on this kind of surface, in people with hemiparesis.

    <description>Participants were assessed walking freely at a comfortable self-selected speed before and after each training phase. The analyzed variables were: mean walking speed of locomotion; step length; stride length, speed and duration; initial and final double support duration; single-limb support duration; swing period; range of motion (ROM), maximum and minimum angles of foot, leg, thigh, and trunk segments of both paretic and nonparetic limbs.</description>
