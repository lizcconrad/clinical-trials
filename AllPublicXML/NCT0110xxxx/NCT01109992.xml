  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study of subjects undergoing clinically indicated heart scans for
      evaluation of known or suspected heart disease. We will also include 10 healthy subjects
      without known heart disease. We would like to study stress testing of the heart using
      exercise and a medication called regadenoson. Imaging of the heart will be performed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regadenoson is stress agent approved by the FDA for use with myocardial perfusion imaging
      with technetium-99m single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients that are
      unable to exercise adequately. We would like to study Regadenoson in conjunction with
      Exercise Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (PET MPI).
      Regadenoson is not approved by FDA for use with Rubidium-82 PET MPI. Also, we would like to
      study a novel stress protocol of Regadenoson combined with symptom limited exercise stress
      (not FDA approved).

      The objectives of this study are to assess the tolerability and safety of combined symptom
      limited exercise stress test with Lexiscan (Lexercise PET) compared to Lexiscan alone
      (Lexiscan PET), to assess image quality of Lexercise compared to Lexiscan PET and to compare
      relative and absolute myocardial perfusion imaging with Lexercise compared to Lexiscan PET to
      identify CAD.

    <description>Safety and tolerability of combined standard Bruce exercise stress testing combined with regadenoson infusion will be studied.
Side effects, ECG changes, blood pressure changes, will be recorded during Lexercise and compared to Lexiscan study.
Safety blood work will be drawn after the Lexercise PET study.
Radiation dose to the staff will be measured using personal dosimeters after the Lexiscan as well as the Lexercise PET study.</description>

    <description>Defect size, severity, extent and contrast with Lexiscan alone will be compared to exercise Lexiscan protocol
Left ventricular ejection fraction at rest and immediately post stress with Lexiscan alone will be compared to the Lexercise protocol.
Myocardial blood flow estimates and coronary flow reserve will be compared between the Lexiscan alone and Lexercise protocols.
