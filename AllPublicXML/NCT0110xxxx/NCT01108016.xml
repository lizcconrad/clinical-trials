      The study will answer two questions about women with breast cancer in rural communities:

        1. Will they find this support group format utilizing videoconferencing acceptable and
           rewarding?

        2. Will they report a greater sense of emotional and informational support, and less
           depression and traumatic stress, than the control groups of women who wait to
           participate until after the first groups have ended?

        Inclusion Criteria:To be eligible to participate, a woman must meet all of the following
        criteria:

          1. be a resident of one of nine rural counties in northeastern California (Modoc, Plumas,
             Siskiyou, Shasta, Lassen, Trinity, Sierra, Nevada, and Tehama),

          2. be able to travel to a rural health facility included in the Northern Sierra Rural
             Health Network to participate in videoconferencing meetings;

          3. be able to speak and read English well enough to be able to read, discuss, and
             comprehend the consent form;

          4. be 21 years of age or older;

          5. have been diagnosed with breast cancer by a physician; and

          6. who (in the judgment of the Local Coordinator) is not unduly distressed or otherwise
             not able to participate effectively in a support group.

        Women will be included with any stage of breast cancer as our pilot study demonstrated that
        in these rural communities, women wanted to include women with any stage of breast cancer
        in their groups. Also, our pilot study results showed that it worked fine to include women
        regardless of the period elapsing since they received their diagnosis, as our pilot study
        results showed that some women with a long period of time elapsing since receiving their
        diagnosis were still in need of a source of social support for coping with having had this
        experience and felt that they had a lot of help to offer women who had more recently
        received a breast cancer diagnosis. The 9 counties were selected because they are among the
        most remote counties in California, yet they have strong primary care systems in place, and
        most patients receive specialty care in-state, as opposed to out-of-state. Every effort
        will be made to include women of ethnic minority groups.

        The support group facilitator, community advisory board (CAB) members, and the local
        community coordinators will also be recruited for the interviews, with informed consent,
        identified by having played one of these roles for this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:Potential participants who do not meet all of the inclusion criteria
        listed above will be excluded.
