  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will trace the path of a natural plant pigment, (cyanidin-3-glucoside; C3G),
      through the human body after consumption. C3G is the most abundant of the naturally occurring
      anthocyanin family of plant pigments and is responsible for the red to purple colour of many
      fruits and vegetables. Anthocyanins are promoted as being potentially beneficial to
      heart-health and also have anti-cancer properties, however little is known about how the body
      processes these compounds after they are eaten or how they are cleared from the digestive
      system. The investigators study aims to answer these questions and, in doing so, unravel how
      they may benefit everyone's health.

      In this BBSRC funded study, 8 healthy (18-45y) male participants will be recruited to a one
      day feeding study (lasting 8 hours) to establish the routes of clearance of anthocyanins from
      the body. After consent has been obtained, participants will be screened to establish their
      health (by NHS clinical staff). Eligible participants will be asked to consume a low
      anthocyanin diet for 7 days and to attend a study day at the Clinical Research &amp; Trials Unit
      (CRTU, University of East Anglia). Participants will attend in a fasted state (at least 8h of
      water only) and will be asked to provide a urine (total morning void) and faecal (within the
      previous 72h) sample. Participants will then consume a C3G capsule and blood and breath
      samples will be collected at regular intervals after consumption (0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours).
      The capsule is roughly the size of a commercial vitamin-C tablet (500mg). Participants will
      then return in a fasted state on the following 2 mornings to provide further urine, faeces,
      breath and blood samples. Low anthocyanin meals will be provided throughout the study day and
      on the following 2 mornings. Participants will be reimbursed for their inconvenience

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males

          -  18-45 years old

          -  No allergies to fruits or vegetables containing anthocyanins or foods to be provided
             on the study day

          -  Those agreeing to restrict dietary intake of rich sources of anthocyanins

          -  Those agreeing to comply with a biological sampling protocol and have cannula inserted
             for the collection of blood samples on the study day

          -  Those agreeing to record their dietary intake over 3 days (1 weekend day and 2 week
             days)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Those judged by the study clinical staff (to be appointed) to have biochemical and /
             or haematological screening results which reflect compromised health or that may
             affect the study analysis

          -  Participants with a body mass index of less than 18.5 or greater than 30

          -  Taking food / dietary supplements containing anthocyanins e.g. grape seed extract,
             acai berry (unless prepared to cease intake during, and 7 days preceding the study)

          -  Parallel participation in another research project which involves dietary intervention
             and/or sampling of biological fluids/material

          -  Smokers or those who have ceased smoking within 12 months.

          -  Habitual drinkers of more than 4 units* of alcohol per day or more than 21 units per
             week (NHS guidelines). *A unit of alcohol is approximately equivalent to a half pint
             of full strength beer or cider or a small glass of wine (100ml) or a single measure
             (25ml) of spirits
