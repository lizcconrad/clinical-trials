  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anterior knee pain (AKP) is a common complication following intramedullary (IM) nailing of a
      tibial shaft fracture. The purpose of this prospective study was to determine if there is an
      association between AKP and nail position. The investigators have analyzed postoperative
      outcome results and the possible relationship between AKP according to the visual-analog
      scale (VAS) scale, and nail position marked as a distance from the tip of the nail to the
      tibial plateau (NP) and tuberositas tibiae (NT), measured postoperatively on L-L knee X-rays.

      The aim of this study was to determine the possible relationship between anterior knee pain
      (AKP) and nail position marked as a distance from tip of nail to tibial plateau (NP) and to
      the tuberositas tibiae (NT).

      We evaluated postoperative outcome results of 50 patients in the last 3 years with healed
      fractures initially treated with intramedullary (IM) reamed nails with 2 or 3 interlocking
      screws on both parts of the nail and with the use of medial peritendinous incision for nail
      entry portal. Patients marked a point on the visual analog scale (VAS) that corresponded to
      the level of postoperative AKP felt. Two groups of patients were formed on the basis of AKP
      (pain level was neglected): groups A and B, with and without pain, respectively.

      We found that the difference between the two groups concerning NP measurements was
      statistically significant, but not concerning NT measurements (P &lt; 0.05). Patients were
      classified by pain with high accuracy (98%) according to a classification tree.

      We conclude that the symptoms of AKP did not appear if the tip of the nail position was more
      than 6.0 mm from the NP and more than 2.6 mm from the NT. However, for better evaluation of
      these results it will be necessary to examine more postoperative patients with AKP.

    <description>Patients' operations were performed using the peritendinous approach. A medial longitudinal incision was made, with care being taken not to damage the patellar tendon or its sheath. Standard proximal and distal locking screws were used. All patients were given postoperative instructions for thigh muscle rehabilitation and the same physiotherapy was performed after IM nailing during hospitalization. Nails were removed from some of the patients with the presence of knee pain or pain at the insertion points of the locking screws, however, no nails were removed earlier than one year postoperatively. Proof of the healed bone fracture was confirmed by radiologic examination.</description>
