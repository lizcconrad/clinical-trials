  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the Enhanced Medication Management Program (eMMp) being developed by MedMinder
      Systems, Inc. is to increase the ability of frail elders to adhere to complex medication
      regimens for chronic conditions. Adherence will facilitate effective self-care and decrease
      personal and societal costs associated with disease progression and loss of independence.
      Multiple studies have shown that more frequent personal follow-up is the most effective way
      to maximize medication adherence, but such personal care is too costly to translate well to
      real life in a world of limited healthcare resources.

      Currently available &quot;smart pillboxes&quot; are too expensive, too limited in the number and types
      of medications delivered, and too technically complex for the large majority of senior
      citizens. The eMMp is designed to deliver prompts and reminders to the user, to be remotely
      programmable by caregivers, to allow the option of using pre-filled medication trays, to
      provide electronic adherence reports to family/caregivers and to provide personalized
      reinforcing phone calls from professional caregivers, all at a modest cost. The in-home
      ReMinder will use a familiar pillbox layout (4 doses/day for 7 days) and allow easy removal
      of medication cups by elderly, rheumatic fingers. Installation will require only an
      electrical outlet (no modems or dedicated phone lines). Once plugged in, the built-in pager
      will continuously download remotely programmed visual and/or aural prompts and reminders from
      a central server (RemoteMind). It will continuously upload the date and time when each
      medi-cation cup is removed and when weekly refill is carried out, enabling remote adherence
      monitoring, alerts to caregivers, and follow-up intervention(s) from personal and/or
      professional caregivers as needed.

      The hypothesis to be tested in this 2 year SBIR Phase I work plan is that the eMMp will
      significantly im-prove adherence and clinical outcome (blood pressure control) in a
      population of frail elderly who are hyper-tensive. SBIR Phase II will determine the minimum
      level of intervention needed to achieve sustained medication adherence and control of blood
      pressure in a larger group of hypertensive elders.
