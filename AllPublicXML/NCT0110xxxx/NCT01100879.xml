  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia and functional iron deficiency are common conditions in Multiple Myeloma (MM)
      patients, conditions which reduce significantly the quality of life and increase morbidity
      and mortality. Traditionally, Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESAs) have been used, but
      recently their use has been shown to have a negative impact on overall survival in different
      oncology populations. Recently published data suggest that intravenous (IV) iron can be
      effective in anaemia treatment, even without ESAs. This exploratory study is the first
      clinical project with ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with MM: the data generated may
      be used for further evaluations of the drug in larger populations. In this study, 1,000 mg of
      IV iron as FCM will be administered on the same day or within 24 hours before or after
      chemotherapy treatment. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of FCM given
      without ESA, in the correction of haemoglobin levels in subjects with MM, undergoing
      chemotherapy. Secondary objectives aim to describe the safety and tolerability of FCM, and
      the effect of FCM treatment on iron status variables in MM subjects.

    <description>Subjects will receive a single dose of 1,000 mg iron as FCM infusion at baseline.
Subjects of bw ≤66 kg will receive a single dose of 500 mg iron as FCM infusion at baseline (Week 0) and at Visit 3 (Week 2).
Ferric carboxymaltose will be administered on the same day with chemotherapy treatment or within 24 hours before or after the chemotherapy. For subjects with bw ≤66 kg, if no chemotherapy planned for the visit 4 (Week 2), the second FCM dose should be infused independent of chemotherapy.</description>
