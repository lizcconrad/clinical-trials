  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This repository will establish for the first time a system to carefully assess and monitor
      over time the general health and the amount of cholesterol in the arteries of U.S. children
      and adults with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (hoFH). Patients with this very rare
      disorder have very high blood levels of cholesterol from birth due to the inheritance of an
      abnormal gene from each parent. As a result, if untreated, heart attacks and sudden death
      occur in childhood. Treatments such as LDL-apheresis and liver transplant will lower the
      cholesterol level, but the best treatment and the best way to monitor the effect of the
      treatment on the arteries are unknown. The collection of clinical data and blood for analysis
      of known and yet-to-be discovered markers and predictors of arterial disease will yield new
      information about the natural history of the disorder and response to treatment. The
      repository will greatly aid the development of specific protocols that seek to learn more
      about this disease and new therapies.

      Detailed information of &quot;standard of care&quot; procedures will be compiled in a database. These
      include medical history and physical exam, lipid profiles and other standard blood tests,
      dietary evaluation and counseling, cardiology evaluation including EKG and
      echocardiogram,ultrasound of carotids and femoral arteries, CT angiogram and, if indicated,
      intracoronary angiography (ICA) with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and stress echo or
      nuclear stress testing.

      The recommendation for treatment will be individualized. Current options are a) FDA approved
      cholesterol-lowering medications: statins, ezetimibe b) LDL-apheresis c) liver transplant d)
      portacaval shunt e) investigational drugs. Treatment of vascular and/or valvular disease may
      include aspirin, beta blockers, clopidogrel, angioplasty with metal stent, coronary artery
      bypass surgery, aortic valve repair/replacement.

      Research procedures will include medical photos of skin xanthomas, blood assays
      (apolipoproteins A and B, LDL particle size, homocysteine, TNF, IL-6, insulin, glucose, ICAM,
      VCAM, P and E selectin, and endothelial progenitor cells), and DNA analysis of the genes for
      the LDL receptor and other lipid-related genes.
