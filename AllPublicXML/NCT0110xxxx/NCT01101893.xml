    <textblock>
      In this study, approximately 16 subjects will receive raltegravir 400mg twice daily for 5
      days (Treatment A) followed by a washout period. In Period 2, subjects will receive
      GSK2248761 200mg once daily for 5 days (Treatment B). There will be no wash out between
      Period 2 and 3. Subjects will then be administered raltegravir 400mg twice daily in
      combination with GSK2248761 200mg once daily (Treatment C) for 5 days. Subjects will be
      housed in the unit for the duration of the study. Safety evaluations and serial PK samples
      will be collected during each treatment period. A follow-up visit will occur 7-14 days after
      the last dose of study drug.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory
             tests, and ECGs. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 50 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential
             (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant) including any female who:

          -  Is pre-menopausal with a documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy
             (removal of the ovaries) or hysterectomy, or is post-menopausal defined as 12 months
             of spontaneous amenorrhea. A follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level will be
             performed to confirm a post-menopausal status. For this study, FSH levels &gt; 40 MlU/ml
             is confirmatory.

          -  Male subjects must agree to use one of the contraception methods listed in Section 8.1
             of the study protocol. This criterion must be followed from the time of the first dose
             of study medication until the follow-up visit.

          -  Body weight greater than or equal to 50 kg for men and greater than or equal to 45 kg
             for women and body mass index (BMI) within the range 18.5-31.0 kg/m2 (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  As a result of the medical interview, physical examination, or screening
             investigations, the Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.

          -  The subject has a positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that
             will be screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates,
             cannabinoids and benzodiazepines.

          -  Unwilling to refrain from the use of illicit drugs and adhere to other protocol-stated
             restrictions while participating in the study.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: An
             average weekly intake of &gt;14 drinks/week for men or &gt;7 drinks/week for women. Note:
             One drink is equivalent to (12 g alcohol) = 5 ounces (150 ml) of wine or 12 ounces
             (360 ml) of beer or 1.5 ounces (45 ml) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  Unwilling to abstain from alcohol for 48 hours prior to the start of dosing until
             collection of the final pharmacokinetic sample during each treatment period.

          -  History or regular use of tobacco- or nicotine-containing products within 3 months
             prior to screening.

          -  History/evidence of symptomatic arrhythmia, angina/ischemia, coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG) surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA) or
             any clinically significant cardiac disease.

          -  History/evidence of clinically significant pulmonary disease.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic or biliary abnormalities
             (with the exception of Gilbert's syndrome or asymptomatic gallstones).

          -  Subjects with a pre-existing condition interfering with normal gastrointestinal
             anatomy or motility, hepatic and/or renal function, that could interfere with the
             absorption, metabolism, and/or excretion of the study drugs. Subjects with a history
             of cholecystectomy should be excluded.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first
             dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the Investigator and GSK Medical
             Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise
             subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation. In addition, if heparin is used
             during PK sampling, subjects with a history of sensitivity to heparin or
             heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should not be enrolled.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500 mL within a 56 day period.

        Note: this does not include plasma donation.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5xULN
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Pregnant females as determined by positive serum hCG test at screening or prior to
             dosing.

          -  Lactating females.

          -  The subject's systolic blood pressure is outside the range of 90-140mmHg, or diastolic
             blood pressure is outside the range of 45-90mmHg or heart rate is outside the range of
             50-100bpm for female subjects or 45-100 bpm for male subjects at Screening and predose
             Day 1.

        Cardiac conduction abnormalities denoted by any of the following on a single 12-lead ECG at
        screening or predose Day 1 (a single repeat is allowed for eligibility determination)
        Evidence of previous myocardial infarction (Does not include ST segment changes associated
        with repolarization).

        Any conduction abnormality (including but not specific to left or right complete bundle
        branch block, AV block [2nd degree or higher], Wolf Parkinson White [WPW] syndrome).

        Sinus Pauses &gt; 3 seconds. Any significant arrhythmia which, in the opinion of the principal
        investigator and GSK medical monitor, will interfere with the safety for the individual
        subject.
