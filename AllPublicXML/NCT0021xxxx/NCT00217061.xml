  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background- Statins are a safe and effective therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in
      patients with type 2 diabetes; however some patients are not prescribed statins, others do
      not take it even after being prescribed, and others stop therapy prematurely. Lack of
      knowledge or misinformation about statins may be responsible for inadequate statin use.

      Objective- To test the hypothesis that a formal, structured decision aid could correct
      deficiencies in the current decision-making process, increase statin use, and improve
      outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Methods - The investigators will develop a decision aid called STATIN CHOICE and will pilot
      its efficacy in a blinded randomized controlled trial enrolling 98 type 2 diabetes patients.

      Outcomes- Primary outcomes: adherence to the decision to use or not to use statins three
      months after using STATIN CHOICE. Secondary outcomes: acceptability of STATIN CHOICE,
      knowledge about options, satisfaction with decisions, decisional conflict, encounter
      duration, and quality of life.

      Expected results- The investigators anticipate that this work will yield an effective and
      innovative decision aid for statin use in type 2 diabetes patients. STATIN CHOICE, along with
      a detailed users manual, will be directly applicable in clinical practice. Data and
      experience from this project will inform the planning and conduct of a randomized multicenter
      trial of the effectiveness of STATIN CHOICE in diverse practice settings.

      Significance- Patient participation in decision-making resulting in informed treatment
      decisions, as proposed in this study, will likely lead to improved quality of
      decision-making, more appropriate use of statins, and improved patient outcomes.

        Adult patients with type 2 diabetes attending a referral diabetes clinic, who are taking or
        not taking statins, and give consent to participate. Excluded were patients who had sensory
        or mental impairments or language barriers that preclude them from using the intervention
        and therefore participate in this trial.
