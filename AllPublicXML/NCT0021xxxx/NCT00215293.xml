      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical success of the Cervical I/F Cage in
      treatment of one or two adjacent levels of degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine
      compared with standard of care treatment using either autograft, autograft with a plate or
      allograft with a plate

      This is a prospective randomized multi-center clinical trial to assess the safety and
      efficacy of the investigational device, Cervical I/F Cage for fusion in one or two adjacent
      levels of the cervical spine. Patients will be randomly assigned in a ration of 1:1 between
      the investigational and control groups.

      Comparison: The device will be compared to a control group consisting of the 3 accepted
      standard of care treatments (autograft, autograft with an anterior plate, or allograft with
      an anterior plate). For two level fusions, the control group will be limited to autograft
      with a plate or allograft with a plate. Based on the current literature, it is believed that
      there is no difference between the three treatments in terms of clinical success, fusion
      success, or safety issues. However, amongst the investigators there are preferred treatments.
      Each investigator will choose one or more of the control treatments at study initiation.
      Patients will then be randomized in a 1:1 Cage:control randomization schema. Approximately
      240 subjects will be enrolled at 20 sites. Eligible patients will have symptomatic
      degeneration of one or two adjacent cervical discs, have failed six weeks of non-surgical
      treatment, have sufficiently severe enough symptoms to warrant surgery, and have had no prior
      fusion surgery on the cervical spine.
