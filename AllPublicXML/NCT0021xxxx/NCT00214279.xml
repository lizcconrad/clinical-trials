  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study is to gradually withdraw steroids in a group of 50 older renal transplant
      recipients, converting then from the 3 drug regimen to a 2 drug regimen (cyclosporine and
      MMF), while carefully monitoring their graft function. 25 subjects would serve as control
      patients in the study and would remain on the 3 drug regimen (steroids, cyclosporine and
      MMF). Immunologic status will be determined before and after IS withdrawal using a
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) transfer test previously described in the original
      submission. Both the steroid withdrawal subjects and the control subjects will undergo the
      DTH testing throughout the 3 years of study participation.
