      Protocol #1:The goals of this study was to examine whether increased weight loss in obese
      adolescent is induced when the weight loss medication sibutramine is added to a family-based,
      behavioral weight control program.

      Protocol #2: This study aims to improve the behavioral treatment of obesity during
      adolescence. A behavioral program using regular foods will be compared to a behavioral
      program using a structured meal plan (a portion-controlled approach with liquid-meal
      replacements [nutritional supplements]). This structured approach may be better for the
      promotion of weight loss compared to a diet of regular foods.
