  <brief_title>A Study to Treat Patients Whose Chronic Angina Symptoms Are Not Relieved by Medication and Have an Area of the Heart That Cannot be Treated by Standard Therapies</brief_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with an experimental gene
      therapy (BIOBYPASS®) will reduce angina in study participants by stimulating the growth of
      new blood vessels. This will be measured by testing whether participants are able to exercise
      longer without experiencing angina after treatment, as compared to before treatment.

      Additionally, this study will collect information about any side effects that might be
      related to the treatment with the experimental therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 80 years;

          -  Written informed consent obtained prior to any study dictated procedure;

          -  Moderate to severe angina (CCS Angina Class II-IV) despite optimal medical therapy;

          -  Treated with optimal unchanged antianginal medical therapy for at least 2 months prior
             to the first baseline ETT. Optimal medical therapy must include the following
             medications (unless hemodynamic parameters or intolerance contraindicate their use):

               -  Nitroglycerine;

               -  Antianginal medications: Long-acting nitrates, calcium-channel blockers,
                  potassium channel opener and beta-blockers (Note: All participants are required
                  to be on at least 2 of the 4 antianginal medications listed above);

               -  Platelet aggregation inhibitor (e.g., aspirin, ticlopidine, or clopidogrel)

               -  ACE inhibitor

               -  Statin (HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor)

          -  The participant must have, within 3 months prior to randomization, documented coronary
             angiographic evidence of significant 2- or 3- vessel disease, or equivalent disease in
             one dominant artery, and at least one remaining larger coronary vessel from which new
             collaterals/vessels could be supplied.

          -  Any participant who has undergone CABG or PCI within 6 months of entry must have
             angiography performed within 1 month prior to entry, and at least 4 months after the
             previous intervention to rule out early restenosis.

          -  Candidates must not be eligible for any other re-vascularization procedures. The
             participant and his coronary film must have been discussed with an independent cardiac
             surgeon and must have been denied for CABG or PTCA. Participants who are marginal or
             poor candidates for conventional revascularization will be considered eligible if the
             risks of performing a CABG or PTCA procedure outweigh the potential benefit and/or
             such a procedure is unlikely to offer a worthwhile clinical benefit. The criteria
             defining such cases may include, but may not be limited to, the following examples:

               -  Diffuse or distal vessel disease

               -  Chronic occlusions

               -  Unprotected left main stenosis

               -  Tortuous or severely angulated vessels

               -  Severely calcified vessels

               -  Small vessels (&lt; 2.5mm)

          -  Two baseline bicycle ergometry exercise tolerance tests (ETTs) performed meeting the
             following criteria:

               -  Able to exercise for a minimum duration of 2 minutes and no more than 8 minutes

               -  Exercise duration on the two ETTs must be within 15% of each other. (The second
                  test will be used for the baseline value. In the event of excessive variability,
                  a third test may be performed and the participant may be enrolled if exercise
                  duration on the third test is within 15% of either prior test. In this case, the
                  third test will be used as the baseline value.)

               -  ETTs must not be discontinued for any reason other than ETT Angina Level 3

               -  Note: Participant must NOT be informed of exercise restrictions required for
                  entry.

          -  Significant reversible myocardial ischemia on a single photon emission computer
             tomography (SPECT). Judgment will be made by an independent core lab. The size of the
             reversible defect must be &gt; 10 % of left ventricle.

          -  Ventricular wall thickness of the treatment zone &gt; 8mm as per baseline echocardiogram.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating women. It is required that both men and women use condoms or
             another barrier method of birth control for at least 8 weeks following administration
             of BIOBYPASS® and some form of birth control for at least one year;

          -  Clinically significant anemia (e.g. hematocrit &lt; 36% or hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL for men
             and &lt; 11 g/dL for women), leukopenia (WBC&lt;3,000/µL), leukocytosis (WBC &gt; 12,000), or
             thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 100,000 billion/l);

          -  Hepatic dysfunction (AST/ALT must be within normal limits);

          -  Hematuria, unless of known, non-malignant etiology (any unexplained hematuria would
             require the candidate to be excluded);

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure &gt;200 mmHg or diastolic blood
             pressure &gt;110 mmHg) or significant hypotension (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg);

             vascular disease, COPD);

          -  Ophthalmologic conditions pertinent to proliferative retinopathy or conditions that
             preclude standard ophthalmologic examination.

               -  Cataract surgery within 6 months of trial;

               -  Vascular lesions of the anterior segment of the eye (infection or ulceration of
                  the cornea, rubeotic glaucoma, etc);
