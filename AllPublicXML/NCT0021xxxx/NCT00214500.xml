  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether AT1001 (migalastat hydrochloride) is safe
      and effective in patients with Fabry disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This open-label study will be conducted in up to 20 patients at five clinical sites in the
      United States. Patients will undergo a 28-day screening period, including a 14-day run-in
      with AT1001 to assess eligibility for the study. Patients receiving enzyme replacement
      therapy or substrate depletion therapy for Fabry disease must undergo a 2-week washout of
      prior therapy before the 28-day screening period. Patients will receive a daily dose of
      AT1001 for 12 weeks during the treatment phase. The pharmacokinetics of AT1001 in plasma and
      urine will be assessed at regular intervals. Safety will be evaluated throughout the
      treatment period. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, the effect of AT1001 on
      pharmacodynamic parameters (alpha-Gal A in leukocytes, GL-3 in plasma and urine, and
      alpha-Gal A and GL-3 in skin biopsy samples) and functional parameters (cardiac function as
      assessed by electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and MRI, and renal function as assessed by
      blood and urine tests, and nerve conduction as assessed by QSART and CASE IV tests) will be
      evaluated. If the safety profile is acceptable, patients will be permitted to enter a 36-week
      treatment extension period and continue to receive AT1001, with safety, pharmacodynamic, and
      functional assessments performed at 12-week intervals.
