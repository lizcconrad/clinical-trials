      1. INTRODUCTION: Continuity of care (COC) occurs when separate elements of patient care are
      connected. COC is made up primarily of Continuity of Provider (COP) and Continuity of
      Information (COI). Many authorities believe that COC is essential to high-quality care.
      Previous studies have shown poor COC in varied populations. Many studies have shown that
      increased COC has been associated with improved intermediate outcomes. However, no study has
      definitively determined whether COC or either of its components is associated with important
      outcomes. The Ontario-Outcomes After the Hospitalization (Ontario-OAtH) study will enroll
      5900 adults who are discharged to the community from medical and surgical services from 13
      teaching and community hospitals in 5 regions across Ontario. Patients will be followed for 6
      months to record details about all interactions with the health care system. This information
      will give us a detailed measure of both provider and information continuity for all patients
      over time. The Ontario-OAtH study will have the power to precisely determine whether COC is
      associated with time to urgent readmission or death after hospital discharge. Since COC is
      potentially modifiable, the Ontario-OAtH study will give us essential information required
      for designing interventions to improve outcomes for patients after they are discharged from
      hospital.
