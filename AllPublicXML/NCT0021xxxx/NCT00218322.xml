  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescents with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often develop substance use
      disorders (SUD). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in
      treating adolescents dually diagnosed with ADHD and SUD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High rates of ADHD have been reported in adolescents with SUD. In addition, untreated ADHD is
      a risk factor for developing SUD. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and is
      currently used to treat adolescents with ADHD. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the
      efficacy of atomoxetine in treating adolescents dually diagnosed with ADHD and SUD.

      This study will last up to 18 weeks. Participants will receive six treatments of
      manual-driven, cognitive behavioral therapy for substance abuse over at 6 or earlier weeks.
      Participants and their parents will partake in therapy sessions. Subjects who have completed
      at least 2 weeks of CBT will be eligible to enter the controlled trial, at which point
      participants will be randomly assigned to receive either atomoxetine or placebo, which they
      will take once daily for 12 weeks. At the Week 12 study visit, participants will be assessed
      for symptoms of ADHD and SUD.
