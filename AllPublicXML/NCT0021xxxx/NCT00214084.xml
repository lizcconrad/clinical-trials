  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical problem whose importance is increasing in
      recognition and awareness. The National Commission on Sleep Disorders estimates that 15
      million Americans have OSA, many of whom remain undiagnosed (24). OSA is associated with the
      development of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases (1,2). Patients with OSA, like
      those with congestive heart failure, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, exhibit
      impaired EDV (25-32). OSA is also associated with impairments in endothelium-dependent
      cerebral blood flow responses, which may be a risk factor for stroke (33). Impaired EDV is a
      result of reduced production or inadequate action of nitric oxide. Since EDV worsens with
      disease progression and improves with disease treatment, it serves as a prognostic marker of
      vascular function (34-37). In OSA, hypoxia and neurohumoral disturbances increase generation
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that neutralize nitric oxide and impair
      endothelium-dependent responses (9,10,38). One source of ROS in endothelial cells is the
      enzyme xanthine oxidase (38). XO is an enzyme present in the vascular endothelium that
      significantly contributes to generation of ROS in congestive heart failure,
      hypercholesterolemia and diabetes (13-17). Inhibition of XO improves endothelium-dependent
      resistance vessel responses in these populations (13-17), but it is unknown if XO
      significantly contributes to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in OSA. The central
      hypothesis of this application is that inhibition of XO with allopurinol will reduce
      oxidative stress and generation of ROS, thereby improving nitric oxide bioavailability and
      EDV in OSA. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis that patients with OSA experience
      repeated hypoxemia that increases activity of XO and other enzymes, thus increasing the
      generation of ROS that negatively impact EDV. Hypoxia is detrimental to vascular homeostasis
      since it increases generation of ROS through direct mechanisms and via activation of XO.
