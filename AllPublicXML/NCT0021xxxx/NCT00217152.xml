  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to study the effects (good and bad) of taking CellCept based on
      blood concentrations versus taking a fixed dose of CellCept without measuring the blood
      concentration. CellCept is one of the three immunosuppressant drugs (drugs that suppress the
      immune system) which will be taken as part of this kidney transplant study. Cyclosporine or
      tacrolimus and corticosteroids are the two other drugs which will be taken.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open label study, which means the participant will know which drugs they are
      on. Participants will be put in one of three groups within 24 hours of the participant's
      transplant. The participant will be asked to return throughout the 24 months for physical
      exams, blood and urine tests.
