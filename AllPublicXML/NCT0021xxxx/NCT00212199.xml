  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of three different methods for
      delivering weight management information. Two methods utilize an obesity drug and the third
      method utilizes brief behavioral counseling sessions only.

  <detailed_description>

      There is a growing demand for effective obesity treatments that don't require much time to
      implement especially in a primary health-care setting where time is especially limited. Brief
      interventions that might provide benefits similar to those produced by more time-intensive
      and costly lifestyle interventions would be very useful. There is also increasing interest in
      the efficacy of primary drug therapies for obesity. The purpose of this 12-month study, and
      24-month follow-up, is to examine the efficacy of a brief behavioral counseling intervention
      alone or in combination with a drug already approved for the long-term management of obesity
      (orlisat)and compare both interventions to a drug alone condition.
