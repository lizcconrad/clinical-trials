    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find out if a drug called Rituxan (Rituximab) is safe and
      effective in treating people with chronic urticaria (hives) with persistent symptoms in spite
      of taking antihistamines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab (Rituxan®) is a recombinant chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule
      (CD20) that is present on the surface of B lymphocytes. The product is approved for the
      treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and has been investigated for the treatment of a number
      of autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (Edwards 2004) and lupus (Looney 2004,
      Leandro 2002). As in most rheumatoid arthritis studies, the medication will be administered
      in this study as a series of two intravenous infusions given 2 weeks apart.

      Many cases of chronic urticaria (hives) are though to be driven by an autoimmune mechanism
      (Kaplan 2002, Grattan 2002). It is our hypothesis that by interfering with the autoimmune
      process, potentially by decreasing the levels of autoantibodies or by interfering with other
      mechanisms that cause basophil and mast cell activation, improvments in signs and symptoms
      will be seen.

      Given the effectiveness demonstrated for Rituximab in other autoimmune conditions, we will
      conduct a pilot open label investigation of 15 patients with chronic urticaria to determine
      the safety and effectiveness of Rituximab in this disease. All patients will receive the
      medication; there will be no placebo group in this study. Rituximab is not currently
      indicated for the treatment of this condition however.

      We will evaluate the safety of the Rituximab in 15 patients with urticaria as well as studies
      of antibody levels and cellular function. We will also evaluate clinical outcomes such as
      itch score, sleep disturbance, and quality of life. After receivng the Rituximab treatment,
      we will begin to taper antihistamines and other medications used to control urticaria
      symptoms.

        Major Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic urticaria defined as symptoms &gt;50% of the days or 3 days per week for more
             than 12 weeks

          -  Previous requirement for sustained or recurrent use of corticosteroids OR requirement
             for immunomodulatory treatment for urticaria (eg hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine,

             antihistamine therapies

          -  Chronic therapy with stable doses of antihistamines for at least 4 weeks. Patients may
