      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of balloon
      kyphoplasty treatment for painful, acute, vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) as compared
      to standard non-surgical therapy in patients with cancer.

      1. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

      1.1. Objectives

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of balloon
      kyphoplasty treatment for painful, acute, VCFs as compared to standard non-surgical therapy
      in patients with cancer.

      1.2. Primary Endpoint

      The primary endpoint of the study is the improvement in functional status, as measured by the
      Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) at 1 month. The primary hypothesis of the study
      is that the mean improvement will be larger in subjects initially assigned to management with
      balloon kyphoplasty. Note that all subjects will undergo 12 months of follow-up after initial
      treatment assignment.

      1.3. Secondary Endpoints

      The following secondary endpoints will also be examined. Comparisons will be made at each
      follow-up visit.

      Safety:

        -  Rate of study treatment-related adverse events

        -  Change in neurological status

      Clinical:

        -  Change in functional status as assessed with Karnofsky Performance Scale

        -  Change in quality of life as assessed by the SF-36v2™ Health Survey

        -  Change in back pain, as measured by a 10-point Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)

        -  Change in back-pain analgesics used

        -  Change in ambulation status

        -  Changes in activities of daily living

        -  Time to treatment failure

      Radiographic:

        -  Change in spinal deformity, defined as the degree of spine angulation as assessed by an
           independent radiologist at the core laboratory

        -  Rate of subsequent vertebral body fractures, as assessed by independent radiologists at
           the core lab

      In each case, the study hypothesis is that treatment with balloon kyphoplasty will result in
      an improvement in clinical or radiographic outcomes compared to baseline and compared to
      non-surgical treatment, with a preservation of outcomes in long-term follow-up.

      <recruitment_details>Of 134 enrolled subjects, 70 were randomized to Balloon Kyphoplasty and 64 to non-surgical management (NSM).

      <pre_assignment_details>Crossover from the NSM group to Balloon Kyphoplasty group was permitted after completion of the 1-month evaluation.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The Activities of Daily Living assessment comprised three questions about the effects of back pain or back problems over the previous 2-week period. The patient was asked if they had cut down on usual activities, the number of days in which the patient had cut down on usual activities and the number of days that the patient had spent at least half a day in bed because of back pain or back problems.</description>

        <population>Subjects were analyzed in modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population, based on their randomized treatment group (regardless of crossover). This analysis included all subjects in the mITT population who provided evaluable data at both baseline and 1 month.</population>

        <description>The Activities of Daily Living assessment comprised three questions about the effects of back pain or back problems over the previous 2-week period. The patient was asked if they had cut down on usual activities, the number of days in which the patient had cut down on usual activities and the number of days that the patient had spent at least half a day in bed because of back pain or back problems.</description>

        <population>Subjects were analyzed in modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population, based on their randomized treatment group (regardless of crossover). This analysis included all subjects in the mITT population who provided evaluable data at both baseline and 1 month.</population>

          <title>Index Spinal Deformity Change Measured by Index Vertebral Body Height Ratio</title>
          <description>Index spinal deformity was measured by Kyphotic angle, local Cobb angle, thoracic and lumbar Cobb angle, and anterior, middle and posterior vertebral body heights for each index VCF. Index Vertebral Body Height Ratio (VBHR) was defined as index vertebra height divided by the average of normal superior and inferior adjacent vertebrae.</description>
          <population>The analysis population was per-protocol analysis, which was based on the treatment that subjects received. Of 61 subjects randomized into NSM group, 38 subjects crossed over from NSM to Kyphoplasty after the 1-month visit, and 23 subjects remained in NSM group.</population>

Related defined as the AE had a direct relationship to a Sponsor medical device used in the study patient.
Possibly related defined as the AE may have had a relationship to a Sponsor medical device but an alternative cause may be equally or less likely associated.
Unrelated defined as the AE was due to the underlying indication or disease state or to concomitant medication or therapy not related to any Sponsor device.
Unknown defined as the relationship of the AE to a Sponsor device could not be determined.</description>
