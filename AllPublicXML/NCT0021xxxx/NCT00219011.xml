  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to determine if patients, who have both high blood pressure and heart
      failure and are currently receiving drug treatment for heart failure, have an improvement in
      their heart failure signs and symptoms and other indicators of heart failure after being
      treated with aliskiren on top of their current heart failure treatment. Aliskiren is an
      investigational drug; its safety will also be evaluated in this trial.
