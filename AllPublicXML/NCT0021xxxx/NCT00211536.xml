  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of insulin delivered in the
      peritoneum (abdomen)by an implantable pump in Type 1 diabetics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Implantable insulin delivery pumps have been shown to reduce the occurrence of severe
      hypoglycemia in Type 1 DM subjects, as demonstrated in numerous European studies. Glycemic
      control is difficult to attain in subjects using exogenous insulin due to the risk of severe
      hypoglycemia. This study is aimed at comparing the efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) insulin
      therapy to intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy over a period of 12 months.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HbA1c and Compared Between Groups</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether Intra Peritoneal insulin delivery via MIP results in glycemic control that is equal to or superior (i.e. not inferior to) control with SC therapy (Ho : μ (IP) -μ (SC) ≥ 0.50% A1C), a repeated measures analysis of variance, adjusting for baseline A1C using SAS Proc Mixed was used to compare average A1C trends over time between the two treatment groups (19). Type 3 Least Square (LS) means for each group were assessed. The Estimate statement within SAS proc mixed was used to estimate contrasts among the LS means and confidence intervals for the contrasts.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Severe Hypoglycemia Events</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The total number of severe hypoglycemia events, defined as a clinical episode of hypoglycemia (resulting in seizure or coma, requiring hospitalization, intravenous glucose or glucagon administration), or any hypoglycemia that requires assistance from another person, compared between the two study arms from Baseline to 12 months.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Average Daily Blood Glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>average from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>For each subject, a minimum of two blood glucose readings per day was required for calculation of the average daily mean. The overall mean of the mean for each subject for the measure time frame was then calculated. The mean of the results for all subjects in each group were then analyzed and compared between groups both at Baseline and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Amplitude of Glycemic Excursions (MAGE)</measure>
    <time_frame>average from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>MAGE was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of BG excursions when both ascending and descending segments of the curve exceed one Standard Deviation of the average 24-hour BG value. MAGE was calculated for each subject using SMBG data from periods in which subjects had a minimum of 4 and maximum of 10 readings daily. The overall mean of the mean for each subject for the measure time frame was then calculated. The mean of the results for all subjects in each group were then analyzed and compared between groups both at Baseline and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI);</measure>
    <time_frame>average from baseline to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>4 to 10 daily blood glucose readings (BG) were required for this measure. LBGI was calculated from BG values collected for 30 days prior to Visit 2 and 30 days following Visits 5 and 7. The continuous measure was compared between the two treatment groups for the three periods with a repeated measures ANOVA using proc mixed. Type 3 least square means for each group were assessed and estimate statements used to make comparisons among the LS means and create confidence intervals on the contrasts.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Centers were either university or clinic based endocrinology centers. The centers were required to recruit from their current patient population. This ensured that they had knowledge of the medical and behavioural history prior to enrollment. The experimental pumps were to be implanted and so the study could not be blinded.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects trained on testing for Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI) and a baseline collection of this data for all subjects was collected prior to a block randomization plan. The randomization visit occured 14 days prior to the study start, to allow for scheduling of the implantation surgery for those randomized to the MIP arm.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>MAGE was calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of BG excursions when both ascending and descending segments of the curve exceed one Standard Deviation of the average 24-hour BG value. MAGE was calculated for each subject using SMBG data from periods in which subjects had a minimum of 4 and maximum of 10 readings daily. The overall mean of the mean for each subject for the measure time frame was then calculated. The mean of the results for all subjects in each group were then analyzed and compared between groups both at Baseline and 12 months.</description>

The continuous measure was compared between the two treatment groups for the three periods with a repeated measures ANOVA using proc mixed. Type 3 least square means for each group were assessed and estimate statements used to make comparisons among the LS means and create confidence intervals on the contrasts.</description>
