      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of treating insulin resistance on memory
      and attention, brain glucose utilization, and proteins in spinal fluid.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insulin resistant conditions such as impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      and hyperinsulinemia have been associated with an increased risk for memory decline and for
      Alzheimer's disease. The main study will determine whether treatment with pioglitazone or
      nateglinide will improve verbal memory and selective attention for older adults with impaired
      glucose tolerance or mild type 2 diabetes. The main study will also characterize changes in
      blood concentrations of insulin, inflammatory markers, and the beta-amyloid peptides that are
      related to Alzheimer's disease. In one sub-study, participants will undergo brain positron
      emission tomography (PET) imaging before and after 16 weeks of treatment with pioglitazone,
      nateglinide, or placebo. The purpose of this sub-study is to determine the effects of
      treatment on brain glucose utilization. In a second sub-study, participants will undergo a
      lumbar puncture procedure before and after treatment. The purpose of this sub-study is to
      determine the effects of treatment on spinal fluid concentrations of insulin, inflammatory
      markers, and beta-amyloid peptides. Together these main and sub-studies should characterize
      the effects of insulin resistance on cognition and suggest a mechanism by which insulin
      resistant conditions increase risk for memory decline and for Alzheimer's disease.
