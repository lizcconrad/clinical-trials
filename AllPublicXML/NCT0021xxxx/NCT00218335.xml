  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a peer-based HIV prevention intervention that
      targets active injection drug users and their drug and sex partners.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV seroincidence among injection drug users remains high, with unprotected sexual contact
      substantially contributing to new HIV infections among injection drug users (IDUs).
      Interventions that are culturally competent and target drug users' main sex and drug partners
      may be especially effective for HIV/STI and HCV control and prevention.

      The intervention to be tested in this study draws upon theoretical and empirical evidence
      suggesting that peer educator programs can have significant effects on the risk-related
      behaviors of both the educators and the peers whom they educate. Specifically, through group
      and individual focused sessions, participants learn and practice skills designed to reduce
      drug and sex related risk behaviors. Furthermore, individuals and their main risk partners
      attend a training session that focuses on risk reduction within their relationship.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Recruitment was conducted from March 2004 to March 2006. Two types of participants were recruited: Index and Risk Network Members. Recruitment methods for Index included: street-based outreach, word of mouth, ads and referrals from community agencies. During the Index’s baseline interview, a list of Risk Network Members was generated.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Two types of participants were enrolled in the study- index and networks. Networks did not go through the intervention or control condition. Index participants had to refer a network member AND show up for randomization in order to be enrolled in the intervention or control condition.</pre_assignment_details>
