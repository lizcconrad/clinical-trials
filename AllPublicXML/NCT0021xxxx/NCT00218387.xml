    <textblock>
      Cocaine addiction is a serious health problem with no available medical treatment for
      preventing relapse. Modafinil, a medication that enhances mood, increases energy, and
      improves concentration, may be useful in preventing relapse among individuals with cocaine
      addiction. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of modafinil, in combination with
      cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), to prevent drug relapse among cocaine addicts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of a medication to treat cocaine addiction specifically by lessening
      withdrawal symptoms has been a primary focus of research. Common cocaine withdrawal symptoms
      include depression, lack of energy, and poor concentration. Modafinil, a central nervous
      system stimulant, is a medication that can speed up physical and mental processes in the
      brain. It is currently used to treat narcolepsy, a condition that causes excessive
      sleepiness. Modafinil enhances mood, increases energy, and improves concentration in people
      with narcolepsy. Modafinil may also cause the same effects in individuals addicted to
      cocaine, thereby countering the symptoms of cocaine withdrawal. The purpose of this study is
      to compare the effectiveness of modafinil plus CBT versus placebo plus CBT for treating
      cocaine dependence.

      A 2-week screening period will be followed by an 8-week treatment phase. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either 200 mg of modafinil, 400 mg of modafinil, or placebo on a
      daily basis for the 8 weeks of treatment. During this time, participants will be asked to
      report the number of days that they use and do not use cocaine. This will be confirmed three
      times a week with urine tests. Mood, level of daytime sleepiness, and symptoms of cocaine
      withdrawal and cocaine &quot;high&quot; will be evaluated. Compliance with study medication will be
      assessed with urine and blood tests. Medication side effects will be monitored through
      physical examinations, routine lab tests, ECGs, and self-reports. Follow-up evaluations will
      occur 4 and 8 weeks following the end of treatment.
