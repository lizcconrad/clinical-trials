      The primary purpose is to determine whether infants with a unilateral congenital cataract are
      more likely to develop better vision following cataract extraction surgery if they undergo
      primary implantation of an intraocular lens or if they are treated primarily with a contact
      lens. In addition, the study will compare the occurrence of postoperative complications and
      the degree of parental stress between the two treatments.

    <textblock>
      Intraocular lenses are now a commonly accepted treatment for cataracts in older children and
      are used increasingly in younger children and infants. Intraocular lenses are superior to
      contact lenses in that they more closely replicate the optics of the crystalline lens, do not
      require daily ongoing care, and ensure at least a partial optical correction at all times.
      The simplicity and improved visual outcome of an intraocular lens correction may make caring
      for a child with a unilateral congenital cataract less stressful for parents. However,
      contact lenses remain the accepted treatment for children under 1 year of age due to concerns
      about the long-term safety of intraocular lenses and the potential for a large myopic shift
      developing in these eyes as they grow. Contact lenses provide excellent visual results in
      infants treated for bilateral congenital cataracts; however, two-thirds of infants treated
      with contact lenses for unilateral congenital cataracts remain legally blind in their aphakic
      eye. These poor visual outcomes are usually ascribed to competition from the sound eye and
      poor compliance with patching and contact lens wear regimens. Data from our pilot study and
      the literature suggest that superior visual results can be obtained if an intraocular lens is
      used to correct unilateral aphakia during infancy, but these eyes will experience more
      complications. Intraocular lenses will be increasingly implanted in infants regardless of
      whether or not we perform this trial. By performing this clinical trial, we can determine if
      the higher rate of complications with intraocular lenses is offset by improved visual outcome
      and decreased parenting stress.

      The Infant Aphakia Treatment Study (IATS) is a multi-center randomized clinical trial
      comparing intraocular lens and contact lens correction for monocular aphakia. Infants will be
      enrolled over a 4 year period. Infants 28 to 210 days of age with a visually significant
      cataract in one eye are eligible. Cataract surgery will be performed in a standardized
      fashion by a surgeon who has been certified for the study. Surgery consists of a lensectomy,
      posterior capsulotomy, and anterior vitrectomy. Infants will be randomized at the time of
      surgery to one of two treatment groups. Infants randomized to the intraocular lens group will
      have an intraocular lens implanted into the capsular bag. Spectacles will subsequently be
      used to correct the residual refractive errors. Infants randomized to the contact lens group
      will be fitted with a contact lens immediately after surgery. Both groups will receive the
      same patching therapy and follow-up. All children will be examined by Investigators at fixed
      intervals using standard protocols with the major endpoint assessed at age 12 months by a
      Traveling Vision Examiner.

      We are currently in a continuation of this project (beyond 5 years) in order to assess which
      of these patients have glaucoma or glaucoma suspect at age 10.5 years. Our goal is to
      understand which type of initial optical correction, an IOL or a CL, results in the best
      long-term visual outcome following unilateral congenital cataract surgery during infancy. Our
      central hypothesis is that primary IOL implantation will result in a better visual outcome.
      The rationale for this proposal is that final visual acuity cannot be determined by 5 years
      of age and the recommendation for early treatment can only be substantiated by adequate
      long-term assessment in this unique cohort. We chose a follow-up to age 10.5 years because it
      will provide a more accurate assessment of visual acuity and will allow us to diagnosis most
      cases of glaucoma.

    <description>Visual acuity was measured by standard objective testing procedures at 12 months of age. Monocular grating acuity was assessed by the traveling examiner with the Teller Acuity Cards. This test uses cards with black-on-white lines of varying widths and a set distance apart in a square with fixed dimensions, so the thinner the lines, the more there will be on any given card (cycles/cm). The ability to see thinner lines indicates better vision. The cards with lines are presented simultaneously with a gray card and the child's visual attention is noted. It is presumed that the child will preferentially look at the card with the stripes as it is more interesting. When the lines are too thin and close together so as to be indistinguishable from the gray card, no preferential looking will be noted. The card with the thinnest lines that the child will look at is recorded as the best visual acuity in logMAR units.</description>

    <description>Visual acuity estimates were standardized by using the Electronic Visual Acuity Tester (EVAT) at each clinical site. The IATS patients were tested at 4.5 years of age allowing the use of the HOTV recognition acuity test. The Amblyopia Treatment Study protocol for presentation and determination of best corrected visual acuity was followed. Monocular visual acuity was evaluated using single letter optotypes with surround bars presented on the EVAT. The staircase procedure of the ATS projects was followed as this has documented success and reliability with this age group. In order to familiarize the subjects with the HOTV matching test, this test was introduced at the 4.0 year visit and the 4.25 year visit by experienced site personnel.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Visually significant unilateral congenital cataract (central opacity equal to or
             greater than 3 mm in size).

          -  Cataract surgery performed when the patient is 28 to 210 days of age and at least 41
             post-conceptional weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The cataract is known to be acquired from trauma or as a side-effect of a treatment
             administered postnatally such as radiation or medical therapy.

          -  A corneal diameter less than 9 mm measured in the horizontal meridian using calipers.

          -  An intraocular pressure of 25 mm Hg or greater in the affected eye measured with a
             Perkins tonometer, tonopen, or pneumatonometer.

          -  Persistent fetal vasculature (PFV) causing stretching of the ciliary processes or a
             tractional retinal detachment.

          -  Active uveitis or signs suggestive of a previous episode of uveitis such as posterior
             synechiae or keratic precipitates.

          -  The child is the product of a pre-term pregnancy (&lt;36 gestational weeks). Screening
             for prematurity will be based on the clinician's best assessment of gestational age.
             If a physician is uncertain regarding the gestational age, review of medical records
             or contact with the pediatrician and/or obstetrician should be used to confirm
             gestational age at delivery. Unless a clinician is uncertain as to whether a child was
             born at less than 36 weeks or not, confirmation of gestational age via medical record
             review may be delayed until after enrollment.

          -  Retinal disease that may limit the visual potential of the eye such as retinopathy of
             prematurity.

          -  Previous intraocular surgery.

          -  Optic nerve disease that may limit the visual potential of the eye such as optic nerve
             hypoplasia.

          -  The fellow eye has ocular disease that might reduce its visual potential.

          -  The child has a medical condition known to limit the ability to obtain visual acuity
             at 12 months or 4 years of age.

          -  Refusal by the Parent/Legal Guardian to sign an informed consent or to be randomized
             to one of the two treatment groups.

          -  Follow-up of the child is not feasible because the child would not be able to return
             for regular follow-up examinations and the outcome assessments (e.g. transportation
             difficulties, relocation, etc.).

        <title>Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Visual acuity was measured by standard objective testing procedures at 12 months of age. Monocular grating acuity was assessed by the traveling examiner with the Teller Acuity Cards. This test uses cards with black-on-white lines of varying widths and a set distance apart in a square with fixed dimensions, so the thinner the lines, the more there will be on any given card (cycles/cm). The ability to see thinner lines indicates better vision. The cards with lines are presented simultaneously with a gray card and the child's visual attention is noted. It is presumed that the child will preferentially look at the card with the stripes as it is more interesting. When the lines are too thin and close together so as to be indistinguishable from the gray card, no preferential looking will be noted. The card with the thinnest lines that the child will look at is recorded as the best visual acuity in logMAR units.</description>

        <population>The number of participants was determined by the sample size estimate necessary to detect a 0.2 logMAR difference (2 lines on the Snellen chart) in the visual acuity between the two groups.</population>

INTERVENTION: use of an external contact lens (CL) to correct the large hyperopic refractive error produced by surgically extracting the natural cataractous lens. As the eye grows, the refractive error changes and the power of the CL can be changed accordingly.</description>

        <title>Visual Acuity - Subjective Assessment at Age 4.5 Years.</title>
        <description>Visual acuity estimates were standardized by using the Electronic Visual Acuity Tester (EVAT) at each clinical site. The IATS patients were tested at 4.5 years of age allowing the use of the HOTV recognition acuity test. The Amblyopia Treatment Study protocol for presentation and determination of best corrected visual acuity was followed. Monocular visual acuity was evaluated using single letter optotypes with surround bars presented on the EVAT. The staircase procedure of the ATS projects was followed as this has documented success and reliability with this age group. In order to familiarize the subjects with the HOTV matching test, this test was introduced at the 4.0 year visit and the 4.25 year visit by experienced site personnel.</description>
        <time_frame>Phase 2 - Age 4.5 Years</time_frame>
        <population>One patient in the intraocular lens group was lost to follow-up.at age 18 months. A second patient in that group had developmental delay and the visual acuity could not be assessed. Therefore, the visual acuity measurements at 4.5 years of age are reported for 55 of the 57 patients randomized to the intraocular lens group.</population>
