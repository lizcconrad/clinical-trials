  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem; an effective primary treatment for
      cocaine dependent individuals has yet to be found. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the effectiveness of levodopa and carbidopa in treating cocaine dependent individuals. In
      addition, this study will examine the effects of incentive rewards for treatment compliance.

    <textblock>
      Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is widely abused throughout the
      United States. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. Levodopa is a medication that is used alone or in combination with
      carbidopa to treat Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      possible interactions between behavioral interventions and carbidopa/levodopa in order to
      treat cocaine dependent individuals.

      This study will last 12 weeks and will involve two phases. The first phase will include three
      therapy conditions: 1) clinical management only, 2) clinical management and relapse
      prevention therapy, and 3) clinical management, relapse prevention therapy, and contingency
      management. All of the conditions in the first phase will be evaluated incrementally under
      active and placebo conditions while participants receive carbidopa/levodopa.

      The second phase of the study will examine the contingency management procedure applications.
      Each of the three contingency management procedure applications targets specific behaviors
      that, when reinforced, may interact with carbidopa/levodopa to produce clinical benefits.
      Participants will receive relapse prevention therapy combined with a contingency management
      procedure that targets clinic attendance, medication compliance, and cocaine abstinence.
      Study visits will occur weekly throughout the study. In addition, participants will complete
      a one-year follow-up visit.
