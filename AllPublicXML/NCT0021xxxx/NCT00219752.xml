      The aim of this phase II trial is asses the tolerability and the effectiveness of imatinib in
      patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase with age more than 70, diagnosis
      of cml is being performed within 1 year. Quality of life will be carefully assessed.

    <textblock>
      Patients will received Imatinib at a dose of 400mg daily. Tolerability and quality of life
      will be assessed Secondary objectives are : to evaluate the survival without progression, the
      survival without event, the overall survival, the hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular
      responses at various check points.

      Duration of responses and failure to respond will be evaluated.
