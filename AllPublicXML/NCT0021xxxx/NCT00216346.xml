  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptomatic Visceral Leishmaniasis(VL)is fatal; Due to the increasing resistance to standard
      therapy with antimonials, there is a need for new safe, efficacious, low-cost therapies for
      the treatment of VL. Paromomycin is an off-patent aminoglycoside antibiotic with
      anti-leishmaniasis activity. This study will test the safety and efficacy of paromomycin in
      the treatment of patients with VL in India.
