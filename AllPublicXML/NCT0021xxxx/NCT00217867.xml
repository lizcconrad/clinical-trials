  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a comprehensive hospital discharge toolkit to implement up-to-date
      guidelines for cardiopulmonary diseases. The study will also include a computer-based
      patient-education program and a telephone-based post-discharge program, both designed for
      individuals with limited health literacy. The purpose of this study is to reduce early
      hospital readmission.

      BACKGROUND:

      Limited health literacy is prevalent in America and has been identified as a cross-cutting
      priority area for transforming health care quality. This study will explore the effect of
      innovative patient-education and self-management systems on early rehospitalization for
      patients admitted to a general medical service.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This is a two-armed randomized study of patients with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases in
      three levels of health literacy. Patients will be tested with the 66 word version of the
      Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) test to allow us to analyze the data
      according to literacy categories ( 6th grade, 7th-8th grade, and 9th grade). Patients will be
      randomized to one of the following groups: 1) standard discharge (control group); 2) a
      experimental group receiving both the case management intervention plus educational and
      self-management support by Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) and post-discharge
      reinforcement of the discharge plan using a computerized telephone system
