      The purpose of this study is to attempt to find better tolerated doses and schedules of this
      highly effective combination chemotherapy regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combination chemotherapy has advantages over monochemotherapy due to the higher response
      rates that can often be obtained; by using agents with non-overlapping toxicity profiles,
      these responses can be achieved with less toxicity than maximally tolerated doses of single
      agents. One significant advantage of capecitabine/weekly docetaxel combination chemotherapy
      is that both agents appear to have a toxicity profile appropriate for palliative therapy of
      advanced breast cancer. This trial will utilize the usual schedule of capecitabine used in
      the USA, which is two times per day oral dosing for 14 days but at a reduced dose in hopes of
      decreasing toxicities. Docetaxel will be given weekly at a dose of 35 mg/m2 X 2 with a
      one-week rest to coincide with the 14-day schedule of capecitabine.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the overall response rate (complete and partial
      responses) according to the RECIST criteria of the combination of capecitabine and docetaxel
      with the selected schedule in patients with advanced and/or metastatic breast cancer. The
      secondary objectives are to evaluate tolerability, time to tumor progression, and time to
      treatment failure of the combination of capecitabine and docetaxel.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients with histopathologically proven metastatic breast cancer.

          -  Patients 18-75 years old

          -  Performance status: Karnofsky &gt; 70%

          -  Patients must have measurable disease. Patients with only blastic bone lesions are
             ineligible.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver, renal and cardiac functions defined as:

          -  Ability to understand the study and give informed consent.

          -  Patients may not have received more than one prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast
             cancer. 5-FU or Taxol given as part of an adjuvant regimen will not render the patient
             ineligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with brain metastasis, adequately treated and stable and not requiring
             continued steroid medication will be eligible if no progression for &gt; 3 months.

          -  Patients who have received any anti-cancer investigational agent in the month prior to
             inclusion.

          -  Patients previously treated with docetaxel(Taxotere)or capecitabine (Xeloda).

          -  Patients with lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract,
             inability to swallow tablets or those who have malabsorption syndrome.

          -  Patients with renal impairment (creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min calculated
             according to Cockcroft and Gault, see Appendix D), since capecitabine is
             contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment.
