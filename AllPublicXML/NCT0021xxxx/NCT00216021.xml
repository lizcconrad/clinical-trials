      In vitro data suggest synergy between oxaliplatin and 5-FU. The combination of oxaliplatin
      with 5-fluorouracil produced objective response rates ranging from 27-34% in two studies of
      patients with prior chemotherapy. Capecitabine was designed as an orally administered, tumor
      selective fluoropyrimidine, preferentially converted to 5-FU at the tumor site by the higher
      levels of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase) in tumor tissues compared to normal
      tissues. The end result is higher concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in tumor relative to
      surrounding normal tissue. This trial will investigate the activity of this novel
      capecitabine/oxaliplatin (CAPOX) combination in patients with advanced disease. In addition,
      an exploratory analysis will correlate response with thymidine synthase and thymidine
      phosphorylase expression in primary tumor samples.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      CAPOX (21 day cycle):

        -  Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily Days 1-14.

        -  Oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1

      Patients may continue combination therapy until progression or toxicity intervenes. Patients
      who discontinue either agent due to toxicity may, at the investigators discretion, continue
      therapy with the remaining single agent on study.

      ECOG performance status 0 or 1

        -  AST &lt; 2 x ULN (up to 5 x ULN in patients with known liver involvement)

      Renal:·

        -  Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN and estimated creatinine clearance &gt;50ml/min as calculated
           with Cockroft-Gault equation

      Cardiovascular:·

        -  No clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic
           coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication) or
