  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of recombinant interferon
      alfa-2b when given together with azacitidine in treating patients with stage III or stage IV
      melanoma or stage IV kidney cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Recombinant interferon alfa-2b
      may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Giving azacitidine together with recombinant
      interferon alfa-2b may kill more tumor cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the adverse event profile and maximum tolerated dose of interferon alfa-2b when
      combined with azacitidine in patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma or
      unresectable stage IV renal cell carcinoma.

      II. Determine the feasibility of this regimen for future phase II trials.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily on days 1-4 and 15-17 and
      recombinant interferon alfa-2b SC on days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, and 26 during course
      1. Beginning in course 2 and for all subsequent courses, patients receive azacitidine SC once
      daily on days 1-3 and 15-17 and interferon alfa-2b SC on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19,
      22, 24, and 26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 total courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interferon alfa-2b until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. After completion of study treatment,
      patients are followed every 2-4 months.
