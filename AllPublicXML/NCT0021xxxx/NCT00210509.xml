    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of almotriptan malate
      (AXERT®) 12.5 milligram tablets compared with placebo for the acute treatment of migraine
      headache at the earliest onset of headache pain. Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is approved for
      the treatment of migraine headache, with or without aura, in adults. Patients in this study
      will take either almotriptan or placebo oral tablets for 3 consecutive migraine headaches.

      Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is approved for the treatment of migraine headache, with or
      without aura, in adults. This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group study of adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine headache, with or without
      aura. Patients will be randomized (like with the toss of a coin) to receive almotriptan
      malate (AXERT®) or placebo for the treatment of 3 consecutive qualifying migraine headaches.
      After screening, patients will leave the study center with blinded study medication and an
      electronic subject diary (Personal Digital Assistant [PDA]). Patients will self-dose with
      study medication as soon as headache pain of any intensity begins (that resembles their usual
      migraine), but no later than 1 hour after headache pain begins. Patients will use their PDAs
      to record assessments such as pain intensity, symptom severity and ability to function as
      related to the headaches. The primary hypothesis of this study is that the percentage of
      patients who are pain free two hours after taking study drug at the earliest onset of
      headache pain is greater in the almotriptan malate (AXERT®) 12.5mg group than in the placebo
      group and almotriptan malate (AXERT®) is generally well-tolerated.

      Almotriptan malate (AXERT®) 12.5 milligrams or placebo tablets, one by mouth at the beginning
      of migraine pain (within 1 hour) for 3 consecutive migraine headaches
