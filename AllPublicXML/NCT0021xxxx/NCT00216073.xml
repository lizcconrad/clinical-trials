      In vitro data suggest synergy between oxaliplatin and 5-FU. The combination of oxaliplatin
      with 5-fluorouracil produced objective response rates ranging from 27-34% in two studies of
      patients with prior chemotherapy. Capecitabine was designed as an orally administered, tumor
      selective fluoropyrimidine, preferentially converted to 5-FU at the tumor site by the higher
      levels of pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNPase) in tumor tissues compared to normal
      tissues. The end result is higher concentrations of 5-fluorouracil in tumor relative to
      surrounding normal tissue. Trastuzumab is synergistic in vitro with multiple chemotherapeutic
      agents including the platinum compounds. Studies have shown the efficacy of trastuzumab
      combined with chemotherapy in patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer.
      This trial will investigate the activity of capecitabine and oxaliplatin administered with
      trastuzumab (CAPOX-T) in patients with HER2 overexpressing in patients with advanced disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  CAPOX-T (21 day cycle):Capecitabine 825 mg/m2 orally twice daily Days 1-14Oxaliplatin
           100 mg/m2 intravenously Day 1

        -  Trastuzumab : 6 mg/kg intravenously Day 1.8mg/kg loading dose should be given in cycle 1
           for patients without previous trastuzumab therapy only.

      Patients may continue combination therapy until progression or toxicity intervenes. Patients
      who discontinue either or both cytotoxic agents due to toxicity may, at the investigators
      discretion, continue therapy with the remaining agents on study until progressive disease
