      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a socio-aesthetic intervention on body
      image and quality of life in post-surgical patients with mastectomy or tumorectomy for breast
      cancer.Two groups of randomized subjects were constituted. Patients of the experimental group
      received 2 or 3 aesthetic care during the first post-surgical week, whereas those of the
      control group not. Body image, quality of life and diverse other personality variables were
      assessed at three different times: surgical operation day before, exit day before of
      hospitalization and three months afterwards. Our general hypothesis is that subjects who
      receive aesthetic care report levels significantly higher of corporal satisfaction and of
      quality of life at the end of the hospitalization and three months later than patients of the
      control group.
