  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out the effectiveness of the experimental
      combination of Docetaxel, Cisplatin, and radiation therapy administered prior to the surgical
      removal of your esophageal cancer.

      This study seeks to determine the safety and efficacy (the latter based on pathologic
      response rate, three- and five-year survival rates) of a three-phase multi-modality approach
      to adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. This study also aims
      retrospectively to determine if a specific tumor gene array profile would predict for
      pathologic complete response. Study schema is as follows. Patients are first staged, next
      they receive induction Docetaxel and Cisplatin on days 1 and 22, patients are then restaged,
      next they will undergo radiation therapy combined with Cisplatin and Docetaxel for
      approximately days 42 thorough 84, patients are again restaged, and finally surgery at
      approximately days 100 to 150.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological or cytological confirmed esophageal adenocarcinoma or
             adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (this diagnosis will be rendered by
             the gastroenterology endoscopist, and refers to tumors at the junction of the
             esophagus and the stomach, where &gt;50% of the tumor mass is above the diaphragm).
             Tumors must not have greater than 2cm extension into the the cardia.

          -  Stage T2N0M0, T3N0M0, T1-3N1M0, T1-3N0-1M1a as determined by imaging studies and
             endoscopic ultrasound staging. M1a disease (celiac nodal metastasis) is permitted if
             other eligibility criteria are met. Any lesion suspicious for metastasis should
             biopsied (either by tru cut or fine needle aspiration) to prove eligibility.

          -  The subject has been deemed an appropriate surgical candidate by one of the surgical
             subinvestigators (ie. Not T4).

          -  No medical comorbidity making the patient not a surgical candidate.

          -  Subject must be 18 years or older

          -  Subject must understand the consent and be willing to give written and informed
             consent to participate in this investigational protocol, and for a tumor biopsy to be
             performed for research purposes at the time of their staging endoscopic ultrasound
             (clinically required for their care), and for a portion of their resection specimen be
             subjected to experimental laboratory analysis

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;1 (Karnofsky &gt;80%; see Appendix A).

          -  Subjects must have adequate caloric intake, as determined by a nutrition evaluation by
             a registered dietician. Nutrition intake may be enteral, hyperalimentation by enteral
             feeding tube, or by parenteral nutrition.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined as: leukocytes
             &gt;3,000/mcL; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL; platelets &gt;100,000/mcL; hemoglobin &gt;
             8 g/dl; Creatinine clearance (estimated by Cockroft-Gault equation) &gt;50-mL/min/1.73 m2
             for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin must be &lt; ULN; AST and ALT and alkaline phosphatase must both
             be less than 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of
             therapy (female patients of childbearing potential).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 3 (CTCAEv3) greater than grade 1
             peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart
             failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well
             controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study. Women / men of childbearing
             potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method. Woman of
             childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at baseline.
             (Postmenopausal woman must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to be
             considered of non-childbearing potential). Patients will agree to continue
             contraception for 30 days from the date of the last study drug administration

          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel, cisplatin,
             or drugs formulated with polysorbate (Tween) 80.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with cisplatin and docetaxel or other agents administered
             during the study.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery.

          -  History of clinically significant interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  Treatment for other carcinomas within the last five years, except cured non-melanoma
             skin and treated in-situ cervical cancer.

          -  Clinical or radiographic evidence of a tracheobronchial fistula or invasion of the
             aorta (i.e. T4 disease).
