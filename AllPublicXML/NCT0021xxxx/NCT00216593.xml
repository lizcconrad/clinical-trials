      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of galantamine
      hydrobromide treatment in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, 1-year study that includes a randomized, 6-month, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled phase and a 6-month open-label extension of galantamine hydrobromide
      treatment in subjects with severe Alzheimer's disease. The open-label extension is optional
      for al patients. Patients eligible for the study will be randomized to treatment with either
      galantamine hydrobromide or placebo over 6 months for the first phase of the study. The
      principal measures include the results of the Severe Impairment Battery and the Minimum Data
      Set-Activities of Daily Living tests, to assess aspects of cognition and behavior, and impact
      on the patient's ability to perform normal daily activities. Additional evaluations include
      the Neuro-Psychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home Version measure and 2 subscales of the Minimum
      Data Set tests to further assess patients behavior, social and physical functioning, the
      level of caregiver support needed, and impact to the patient's caregiver; the Mini-Mental
      State Examination, to assess cognitive abilities; and external health-and social-service use.
      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated on the basis of adverse event reports, physical
      examination, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and laboratory parameters. The study hypothesis
      is that treatment with galantamine, compared with placebo, will significantly improve
      cognition and ability to function in patients with severe Alzheimer's disease, and is
      generally well-tolerated. Galantamine hydrobromide tablets taken by mouth two times daily: 4
      weeks at 8 milligrams (mg)/day, 4 weeks at 16 mg/day, increased to 24 mg/day for the
      remainder of the 6 months. Dose may be reduced at investigator's discretion. Galatamine
      hydrobromide for additional 6 months in open-label phase.
