  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed primarily to establish efficacy and estimate resource utilization. The
      short-term hypothesis is that the dose of capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice/day 5 days per week)
      during the course of radiation therapy is efficacious in locally advanced, non-metastatic
      rectosigmoid carcinoma and will improve resectability. The long-term working hypothesis is
      that if 3-D CRT is combined with the potentiating and additive effect of capecitabine one
      hopes to see improved and durable tumor response and survival with acceptable toxicity. In
      addition, it is expected that the simplicity of using an oral agent (capecitabine) will be
      associated with reduced cost and resource utilization.

      Patients will all receive the combined treatment of 3-D external radiation therapy plus
      Xeloda®. External Radiation Therapy to the pelvis, lower abdomen and rectal area will be
      given once a day, five days a week, Monday through Friday, for about five to six weeks using
      three dimensional techniques.

      Xeloda® (oral chemotherapy) is a pill taken by mouth. This medication will be taken during
      the course of radiation therapy on days that radiation treatments are given. Xeloda pills
      will be taken twice daily beginning with the first day of radiation therapy treatments and
      ending on the last day of radiation therapy treatment.

      The following tests and procedures are part of regular medical treatment (standard care) for
      the disease and are also required for this study:

        -  physical examinations, sometimes including a digital rectal exam

        -  blood tests including a (blood) pregnancy test will be done before starting treatment if
           the patient is a woman able to have children.

        -  urinalysis

        -  ECG (heart tracing)

        -  chest X-ray

        -  ultrasound, which produces pictures of the rectal area using sound waves· CT scan of the
           pelvis and abdomen

      Some people may need surgery, others may require more chemotherapy, and others may require no
      additional treatment depending on how their tumor responded to the Xeloda® and radiation
      therapy treatments.

      Patients will also be asked to complete two questionnaires about their fatigue, general
      quality of life, and bowel functioning.
