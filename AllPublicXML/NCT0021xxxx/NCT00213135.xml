      The purpose of the study is to determine if cladribine tablets are a safe and effective
      treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled, multi-center study. The
      study includes a pre-study evaluation period (up to 28 days prior to the start of treatment);
      an initial treatment period from Week 1 to 48; and a re-treatment period during Week 49 to
      96.

      During the initial treatment period (Week 1 to 48), eligible subjects are equally randomized
      by a central randomization system to receive either a) cladribine at a low dose (0.875
      milligram per kilogram per course [mg/kg/course] for two courses plus placebo for two
      courses); b) cladribine at a high dose (0.875 mg/kg/course for four courses); or c) placebo
      (four courses). During the re-treatment period (Weeks 49 to 96), subjects received either a)
      cladribine at a low dose (0.875 mg/kg/course for two courses); or b) placebo (two courses).

      For all randomized subjects, there is a rescue option of treatment with Rebif® (interferon
      beta-1a 44 microgram (mcg) given subcutaneously three times a week), if the subject
      experienced more than one qualifying relapse, and/or experienced a sustained increase in
      their EDSS score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 1 point, or &gt;=1.5 points if baseline EDSS
      score is 0, (over a period of three months or greater), during a calendar year beginning at
      Week 24.

      To maintain the blind, there is a treating physician who view clinical laboratory results and
      assess adverse events and safety information, and an independent blinded evaluating physician
      who will perform neurological exams. A central neuroradiology center, also blinded to
      treatment, will assess magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations.

    <measure>Annualized Qualifying Relapse Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>A qualifying relapse was defined as an increase of 2 points in at least one functional system of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) or an increase of 1 point in at least two functional systems (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function or cognition) in the absence of fever, lasting for at least 24 hours and to have been preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]) was calculated. The annualized relapse rate for each treatment group was calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study multiplied by 365.25.</description>

    <measure>Time to Disability Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>Time to disability progression was defined as the time to a sustained increase in EDSS score of at least 1 point if baseline EDSS score between 0.5 and 4.5 inclusively, or at least 1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was 0, or at least 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was at least 5, over a period of at least three months. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) was calculated. Tenth Percentile of time to sustained increase in EDSS score was reported using Kaplan-Meier survival curve.</description>

        <title>Annualized Qualifying Relapse Rate</title>
        <description>A qualifying relapse was defined as an increase of 2 points in at least one functional system of the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) or an increase of 1 point in at least two functional systems (excluding changes in bowel or bladder function or cognition) in the absence of fever, lasting for at least 24 hours and to have been preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis [MS]) was calculated. The annualized relapse rate for each treatment group was calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study multiplied by 365.25.</description>
