  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to (1) compare the response of civilians with Posttraumatic
      Stress Disorder(PTSD) currently receiving sertraline without an optimal response to
      risperidone augmentation vs. placebo, and (2) to evaluate the tolerability of risperidone
      augmentation, and (3) to identifiy predictors of response to risperidone augmentation. the
      hypothesis is that risperidone augmentation of sertraline treatment of PTSD is safe and
      effective.

      This is a multi-center, two-phase study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone
      augmentation to sertraline treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In the first
      phase, all patients will be assigned to take open label sertraline for 8 weeks (up to 200
      mg/d). Those who have not achieved a significant decrease in their PTSD symptoms by week 8
      will be entered into the second phase. In the second phase, patients will continue with the
      sertraline, but will then be randomly given either risperidone (up to 3 mg/d) or matching
      placebo in double-blind fashion.
