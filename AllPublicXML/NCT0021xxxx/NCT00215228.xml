  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low heart rate variability is a marker of increased risk of cardiac mortality, and is
      observed in depressed coronary artery disease patients. Some antidepressants may themselves,
      however, decrease heart rate variability. We will test the hypothesis that greater reduction
      in heart rate variability will be associated with duloxetine (which has noradrenergic
      activity) than escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). We will also test the
      hypothesis that changes in heart rate variability are related to the magnitude of
      norepinephrine transporter occupancy.

      Evaluation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been shown to be a valuable tool for measuring
      autonomic dysfunction associated with depression and with cardiac disease. Low HRV is a
      marker of increased risk of cardiac mortality, and is observed in depressed coronary artery
      disease patients and in anxious patients post-MI. Treatment with sympathomimetic
      antidepressants, such as MAO inhibitors and tricyclics, reduce HRV further, and have been
      associated with elevated heart rate, orthostatic hypotension, and with adverse cardiac
      events. Although there is increasing evidence that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) class of antidepressants have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system, the case
      is less clear with the SNRI antidepressants which block the reuptake of both serotonin and
      norepinephrine. It is possible that measures of the extent of norepinephrine transporter
      blockade or inhibition may relate to the HRV reduction seen with noradrenergic drugs. Given
      these considerations, we propose a study to compare the cardiovascular profile of the SSRI
      escitalopram (Lexapro), with the most recently available SNRI, duloxetine, in outpatients
      with depression. Using HRV methodology, we will test the hypothesis that greater reduction in
      HRV will be associated with duloxetine than escitalopram. In addition, we will measure the
      magnitude of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter occupancy produced by each drug. This
      will allow us to examine the relationship between changes in HRV to the magnitude of
      transporter inhibiting effects of each drug.
