  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the response rate obtained in an heterogeneous
      oncologic population treated by chemotherapy, and either by Darbepoetin alfa classic
      treatment or by association of Darbepoetin alfa -ferric saccharose systematic
      supplementation, administered concomitantly with chemotherapy.
