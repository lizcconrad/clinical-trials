  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive budesonide or placebo for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis.
      This study includes stool collections, blood draws, weekly questionnaires and a
      sigmoidoscopy. The study hypothesis is that budesonide will be safe and effective compared
      with placebo for the treatment of diarrhea in lymphocytic colitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microscopic colitis is an increasingly diagnosed cause of chronic diarrhea, with two main
      subtypes: collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. Uncontrolled reports have suggested that
      various drugs can be beneficial in treating microscopic colitis, but few treatments have been
      evaluated in randomized controlled trials. Thus, treatment is guided mostly by anecdotal
      reports, case series, and physicians' experience. In our uncontrolled experience,
      corticosteroids are one of the most effective therapies for microscopic colitis, but are not
      typically used as a first line therapy because of toxicity. Budesonide has been reported to
      be of clinical benefit in small, uncontrolled series of patients with microscopic colitis,
      and recent controlled trials showed that it is superior to placebo in collagenous colitis. We
      propose a study of budesonide in patients with the lymphocytic type of microscopic colitis.

      Patients will have stool specimen and blood drawn at the start of the study. Patient will
      take either Budesonide or placebo for 8 weeks. At the end of treatment, patient will have
      stool collection and sigmoidoscopy.

    <measure>Satisfactory Control of Diarrhea During at Least Three of the Last Four Weeks</measure>

    <description>Subjects were asked if they felt they had satisfactory control of their diarrhea, along with the number of stools and type of stool (loose, water, formed, hard) the patient were experiencing. The rating of &quot;satisfactory control&quot; of diarrhea was therefore a partially subjective measure. This outcome measure was to be recorded for three out of the last four weeks that a subject was on the study; subjects were to take part in the study approximately 8 weeks.</description>

        <title>Satisfactory Control of Diarrhea During at Least Three of the Last Four Weeks</title>
        <description>Subjects were asked if they felt they had satisfactory control of their diarrhea, along with the number of stools and type of stool (loose, water, formed, hard) the patient were experiencing. The rating of &quot;satisfactory control&quot; of diarrhea was therefore a partially subjective measure. This outcome measure was to be recorded for three out of the last four weeks that a subject was on the study; subjects were to take part in the study approximately 8 weeks.</description>

          <title>Satisfactory Control of Diarrhea During at Least Three of the Last Four Weeks</title>
          <description>Subjects were asked if they felt they had satisfactory control of their diarrhea, along with the number of stools and type of stool (loose, water, formed, hard) the patient were experiencing. The rating of &quot;satisfactory control&quot; of diarrhea was therefore a partially subjective measure. This outcome measure was to be recorded for three out of the last four weeks that a subject was on the study; subjects were to take part in the study approximately 8 weeks.</description>
