  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem; an effective primary treatment for
      cocaine dependent individuals has yet to be found. The purpose of this study is to determine
      the safety and effects of vanoxerine (GBR 12909) in treating cocaine dependent individuals.

    <textblock>
      Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is widely abused throughout the
      United Sates. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. Dopamine transporters (DAT) play an important role in the addictive
      nature of cocaine; the use of compounds that target DAT may be effective in treating cocaine
      dependent individuals. Research shows that GBR 12909 has a strong affinity for DAT. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety and potential interaction of GBR 12909 and
      cocaine in cocaine dependent individuals.
