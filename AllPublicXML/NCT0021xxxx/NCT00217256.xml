      To demonstrate the equivalency in in-segment late lumen loss at 8 months between the Endeavor
      Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System coated with ABT-578 (10 micrograms/mm) and the Cypher
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System for the treatment of single de novo lesions in native
      coronary arteries 2.5-3.5 mm in diameter.

      The ENDEAVOR III Trial is a prospective, multi-center, single-blind, randomized trial that
      enrolled 436 patients at 29 sites in the US. The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the
      equivalency of in-segment late lumen loss at 8 months between the Endeavor stent and the
      Cypher stent for the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries 2.5-3.5
      mm in diameter. Patients were randomized to receive the Endeavor stent or the Cypher
      Sirolimus-Eluting Coronary Stent System. Enrollment was completed in September 2004.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is at least 18 years of age.

          2. The patient must have clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable
             angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study.

          3. The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous transluminal coronary
             angioplasty (PTCA), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery.

          4. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within
             seven (7) days before the procedure.

          5. The patient has been informed of the nature of the study and agrees to its provisions
             and has provided written informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review
             Board of the respective clinical site.

          6. The patient and the treating physician agree that the patient will return to the
             treating research center, or an affiliated institution under the same IRB
             jurisdiction, for all required post-procedure follow-up visits. A research staff
             member who has been properly trained to the Endeavor III protocol must conduct all
             follow-up evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine,
             clopidogrel, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, or a sensitivity to contrast media,
             which cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          2. History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs similar to ABT-578
             (rapamycin or rapamycin analog).

          3. A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³, or a WBC &lt; 3,000

          4. A creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dL.

          5. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction within 72 hours of the intended treatment
             (defined as: Q wave or non-Q wave myocardial infarction having creatine kinase (CK)
             enzymes greater than or equal to 2X the upper laboratory normal with the presence of a
             creatine kinase myocardial-band isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevated above the Institution's
             upper limit of normal).

          6. Any previous or planned treatment of any vessel with a drug eluting stent.

          7. Previous or planned percutaneous coronary intervention of any vessel within 30 days
             pre or post procedure.

          8. Previous stenting anywhere in the target vessel.

          9. During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other
             than PTCA prior to stent placement (such as, but not limited to, cutting balloon,
             directional coronary atherectomy, excimer laser, rotational atherectomy, thrombectomy,
             etc.).

         10. History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack within the prior 6 months.

         11. Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months.

         12. History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions.

         13. Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

         14. Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with anti-restenotic therapies
             including, but not limited to brachytherapy.

         15. Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or
             other coronary artery imaging procedures.
