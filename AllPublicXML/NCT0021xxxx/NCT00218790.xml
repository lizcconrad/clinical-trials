  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major component of this study is to test a novel application for a safe, non-pharmacologic,
      cost-effective intervention that is already in use in clinical practice - using cool
      dialysate during hemodialysis to help stabilize the sleep/wake cycle of chronic hemodialysis
      patients. We will also evaluate its effects on selected sleep-related physiologic,
      psychological, behavioral, and general health outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary results demonstrate that, after one treatment, using cool dialysate instead of
      warm dialysate markedly normalized the rhythm of body temperature and improved indices on
      nocturnal sleep quantity and quality. Therefore, a major component of this study is to test a
      novel application for a safe, non-pharmacologic, cost-effective intervention that is alreay
      in use in clinical practice - using cool dialysate during hemodialysis to help stabilize the
      sleep/wake cycle of chronic hemodialysis patients. We will also evaluate its effects on
      selected sleep-related physiologic, psychological, behavioral, and general health outcomes.

      To test the efficacy of this intervention, a randomized, single-blinded, pretest-posttest,
      control group design is being used. The major independent variable is dialysate temperature.
      The major dependent variables are measures of sleep, body temperature, rest/activity
      patterns, and general health outcomes.
