  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary features of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are positive (inability to
      think clearly and distinguish reality from fantasy) and negative symptoms (reduction or
      absence of normal behavior or emotions). Other symptoms include reduced ability to recall and
      learn information, difficulty in problem solving maintaining productive employment.

      Asenapine is an investigational drug that may help to correct the above schizophrenia by
      altering the inbalance of brain hormones such as dopamine serotonin. This is a long-term
      extension trial to further test the efficacy and safety asenapine and a comparator agent
      (olanzapine) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia.
