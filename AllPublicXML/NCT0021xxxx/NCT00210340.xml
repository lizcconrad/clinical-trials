        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Lymphomatous meningitis documented by positive CSF cytology in either newly diagnosed,
             relapsed or refractory primary CNS or systemic NHL

          2. Pathologically diagnosed CD20-positive NHL

          3. Age â‰¥ 18 years

          4. ECOG Performance Status 0 - 2 (See Appendix A)

          5. Life expectancy of at least 1 month

          6. Informed consent must be given according to national/local regulations before
             enrollment (See Appendix B)

          7. Patients may have had prior CNS irradiation, intrathecal methotrexate, cytarabine or
             thiotepa for treatment of lymphomatous meningitis but these treatments must have
             completed at least two weeks before the study enrollment and the patients must have
             recovered from any reversible toxicity caused by prior treatments

          8. Concurrent systemic chemotherapy is allowed with the exception of high-dose
             methotrexate (&gt;500 mg/m2/day), high-dose cytarabine (&gt;2 g/m2/day), high-dose thiotepa
             (&gt;300 mg/m2/day) or investigational agents

          9. No concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy other than rituximab

         10. No severe impairment of bone marrow function (ANC &gt;1.5x109/L, PLT &gt;50x109/L), unless
             due to proven lymphoma involvement

         11. No major impairment of renal function (serum creatinine &lt; 1,5 x upper normal) or liver
             function (ASAT/ALAT &lt; 2,5 upper normal, total bilirubin &lt;2,5x upper normal), unless
             due to proven lymphoma involvement

         12. No evidence of active opportunistic infections

         13. No HIV infection

         14. No pregnant or lactating status

         15. Appropriate contraceptive method in women of childbearing potential or men

         16. Absence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial

         17. Absence of a obstructive hydrocephalus or compartimentalization of CSF flow.
