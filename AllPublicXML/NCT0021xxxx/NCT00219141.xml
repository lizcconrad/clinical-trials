    <measure>Change in Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 36)</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An increase in LVMI indicates hypertrophy of the left ventricle. This could be a normal reversible response to cardiovascular conditioning (athletic heart) or an abnormal irreversible response to chronically increased volume load (preload) or increased pressure load (afterload). Thickening of the ventricular muscle results in increased left ventricular pressure, increased end-systolic volume, and decreased end-diastolic volume, causing an overall reduction in cardiac output.</description>

    <description>Two 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) evaluations were performed, one at baseline and one at the end of the study. For each evaluation, the ABPM device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the patient. A correlation was made between the ABPM device readings and measurements taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. Following the correlation procedure, blood pressure was measured at study specified intervals.</description>

    <description>Patients in this arm initially received 150 mg of aliskiren for two weeks and were then force-titrated up to 300 mg of aliskiren where they remained for 34 weeks. In order to adequately blind the study, patients were required to take a total of 2 tablets and 1 capsule of study medication or placebo per day. In the first 2 weeks, patients took 1 tablet of aliskiren 150 mg, 1 tablet of aliskiren 150 mg placebo, and 1 capsule of losartan placebo. In the remaining 34 weeks, patients took 2 tablets of aliskiren 150 mg and 1 capsule of losartan placebo. Each dose was to be taken by mouth with water at approximately 8:00 AM, except on the morning of study visit when the dose was taken after all procedures and assessments had been completed.</description>

        <title>Change in Left Ventricular Mass Index (LVMI) From Baseline to End of Study (Week 36)</title>
        <description>Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An increase in LVMI indicates hypertrophy of the left ventricle. This could be a normal reversible response to cardiovascular conditioning (athletic heart) or an abnormal irreversible response to chronically increased volume load (preload) or increased pressure load (afterload). Thickening of the ventricular muscle results in increased left ventricular pressure, increased end-systolic volume, and decreased end-diastolic volume, causing an overall reduction in cardiac output.</description>

        <description>Two 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) evaluations were performed, one at baseline and one at the end of the study. For each evaluation, the ABPM device was attached to the non-dominant arm of the patient. A correlation was made between the ABPM device readings and measurements taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer and stethoscope. Following the correlation procedure, blood pressure was measured at study specified intervals.</description>
