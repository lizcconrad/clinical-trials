  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary features of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder are characterized by
      positive (inability to think clearly and distinguish reality from fantasy) and negative
      symptoms (reduction or absence of normal behavior or emotions). Other symptoms include
      reduced ability to recall and learn information, difficulty in problem solving or maintaining
      productive employment. Asenapine is an investigational drug that may help to correct the
      above characteristics of schizophrenia by altering the inbalance of brain hormones such as
      dopamine and serotonin. This is a 12-month trial that will test the efficacy and safety of
      asenapine using an active comparator (olanzapine) in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia. Patients who complete the 12-month trial will have the option of continuing on
      drug until the treatment code for the 12-month trial is unblinded.
