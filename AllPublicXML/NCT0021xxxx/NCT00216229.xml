      To compare the efficiency of protection against hepatitis-B virus by administration of the
      combined vaccine against hepatitis A and B using the schedule 0-1-12 months against the
      schedule 0-1-6 months.

        1. To compare the seroconversion (&gt;= 1 IU/l) and seroprotection (&gt;= 10 IU/l) rate at month
           6,7,12 and 13.

        2. To compare the distribution of anti-HBs at these different moments.
