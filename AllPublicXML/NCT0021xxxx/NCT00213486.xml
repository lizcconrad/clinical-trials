  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard non surgical therapy of locally advanced esophageal cancer is based on a
      definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen with fluorouracil and cisplatin. One of the
      alternative regimen which is being studied is the combination of a weekly cisplatin and
      irinotecan schedule with radiotherapy. This multicentric phase II clinical trial primarily
      aimed to evaluate the clinical complete response rate and secondary objectives were toxicity
      profile and survival.

      Chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin 30 mg/m2 AND Irinotecan 60 mg/m2 was administered at
      days1,8,22,29 and concurrently with radiotherapy t days 43,50,64,71. Radiotherapy was
      delivered day 43 to 75 with 50Gy in 25 fractions/5 weeks.
