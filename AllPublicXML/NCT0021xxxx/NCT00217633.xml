  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well pelvic exenteration works in treating patients with
      recurrent cervical cancer. Pelvic exenteration may be effective in treating recurrent
      cervical cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Correlate progression-free survival and overall survival with tumor size, time interval
      between primary cancer management and pelvic exenteration, and presence or absence of pelvic
      sidewall fixation by clinical examination in patients with recurrent cervical cancer treated
      with pelvic exenteration.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine quality of life of patients treated with this procedure. II. Correlate quality
      of life with reconstructive technique (e.g., no ostomy or ≥ 1 ostomy) in patients treated
      with this procedure.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo pelvic exenteration within 14 days after study entry. Quality of life is
      assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months after surgery. After completion of study
      treatment, patients are followed within 30 days, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months
      for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of cervical cancer

               -  Any histology

               -  Documented or suspected central pelvic disease with or without pelvic sidewall
                  fixation from tumor and/or radiation fibrosis

          -  Meets 1 of the following stage criteria:

               -  Recurrent disease, defined as reappearance of disease after a complete clinical
                  response lasting ≥ 1 month

               -  Persistent disease, defined as presence of disease by biopsy ≥ 3 months after
                  completion of primary therapy

          -  Must have received prior primary treatment, including any of the following:

               -  Surgery with or without post operative radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy

               -  Primary radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy

               -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery

               -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery with or without radiotherapy or
                  chemotherapy

          -  Plans to undergo pelvic exenteration to remove the pelvic disease within 14 days after
             study entry

               -  Deemed to be a good surgical candidate

                    -  No evidence of distant disease or disease that is felt to be unresectable by
                       physical examination

                    -  Patients with suspicious pelvic or para-aortic nodal disease as the only
                       site(s) of extrapelvic disease are eligible at the discretion of the surgeon

               -  Patients whose surgery is planned solely for managing complications (e.g.,
                  rectovaginal fistula, vesicovaginal fistula) of disease or prior therapy are not
                  eligible

               -  Patients whose surgery is planned as a prophylactic measure due to a slow or

                  therapy are not eligible

          -  No distant site of metastases by CT scan or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis OR
             positron-emission tomography
