      Study Objective:

      1. To evaluate whether combined therapy with folic acid 2.5 mg/day, vitamin B6 50 mg/day and
      vitamin B12 1000 micrograms/day vs placebo reduces the rate of atherosclerosis progression,
      as evaluated by quantitative B-mode carotid ultrasound (US).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The HART study is designed as a substudy of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-2
      (HOPE-2)trial which evaluates the effect of combined therapy ? folic acid and vitamin B6 and
      B12 on clinical events. The study is designed to enrol 900 study participants randomized to
      homocysteine lowering therapies or placebo. Follow-up will estimate over 5 years. Study
      participants will undergo yearly carotid B-Mode ultrasound examinations.
