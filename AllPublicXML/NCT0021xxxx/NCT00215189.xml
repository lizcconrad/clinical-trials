      This pilot study evaluates an individualized health promotion program for people with mental
      illness receiving services at a mental health center in Keene, NH. The study will test the
      following hypotheses:

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program
      will demonstrate increased physical activity as indicated by self-report and observed
      measures.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program
      will demonstrate improved fitness and health status as indicated by greater capacity on the
      6-minute walk test, one mile walk test, weight and body composition, and flexibility indexes.

      The following secondary (exploratory) hypotheses will be considered:

      Compared to baseline (pre-study) levels, participants in the In SHAPE program will
      demonstrate improved subjective health status, quality of life, mood, and self-efficacy. In
      addition, participants will demonstrate improved cardiovascular fitness as indicated by lower
      pulse rate and blood pressure.

      The In SHAPE program aims to improve the physical fitness and health of persons with mental
      illness. Participants in the program are assigned a health mentor who assesses individual
      lifestyle habits and health status, identifies goals for lifestyle change, and serves as a
      motivator and physical trainer. The individualized components of the In SHAPE program are
      supplemented with group-level positive reinforcement and motivational incentives. This
      evaluation project systematically evaluates the In SHAPE health promotion intervention.
