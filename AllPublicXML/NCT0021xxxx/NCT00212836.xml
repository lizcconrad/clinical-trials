  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment with conventional antipsychotics such as haloperidol has little effect or may
      sometimes even worsen negative symptoms (such as blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and
      poor rapport) of schizophrenia. The newer &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotics agents, such as
      olanzapine, have shown improvement in the treatment of negative symptoms in acute trials. The
      purpose of this study is to compare an investigational compound (asenapine) with a marketed
      agent (olanzapine) in the treatment of stable subjects with persistent negative symptoms of
      schizophrenia for 6 months. Patients completing this study may be eligible to participate in
      an extension 6 months of treatment. Patients are required to have stable symptoms prior to
      entry into study.
