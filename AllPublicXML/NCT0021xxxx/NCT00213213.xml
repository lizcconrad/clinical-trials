  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of sugar water to relieve pain in
      newborn infants during painful blood tests and injections. Infants of diabetic mothers who
      receive repeated blood tests will be compared to infants of healthy mothers who receive
      routine painful procedures.

      We believe that administration of sucrose analgesia for every painful cutaneous procedure
      performed after delivery will result in less pain during the newborn infant screening test.
