      The study hypothesis is that the addition of Mycograb to docetaxel will improve outcome in
      advanced carcinoma of the breast.

      Combination therapies that incorporate new agents have demonstrated the potential to improve
      outcome for patients with metastatic breast carcinoma. Docetaxel has been shown to be a very
      active drug in breast cancer, and anthracycline-based chemotherapy combinations represent the
      most active form of therapy generating objective response rates of between 40-70%. Mycograb®
      was most effective in breast carcinoma cell lines in combination with cisplatin, docetaxel
      and anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin).

      We propose that Mycograb® binds to hsp90, inhibiting hsp90 chaperone functioning and
      resulting in the destabilization of key proteins including estrogen/steroid receptors, nitric
      oxide synthase, ras1, MAP (Mitogen-activated protein) kinase, Src, Erb-B2,(erythroblastic
      leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) HER(human estrogen receptor) kinases and EGFR (epidermal
      grown factor receptor). Over expression of HER2 receptors are observed in malignancies such
      as breast cancer and reportedly have been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutic
      agents. Both maturing and fully mature forms of the receptor depend on hsp90 association for
      stability. Inhibition of hsp90 function down regulates AKT kinase and Src kinase which are
      non-receptor kinase. Therefore, Mycograb® may be of use in estrogen dependent and hormone
      independent breast cancers.

      Mycograb® has been demonstrated to have anti-tumor activity in cell culture. The 50%
      cytotoxicity of Mycograb® on its own is 50 Combination therapies that incorporate new agents
