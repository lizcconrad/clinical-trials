      The purpose of the study is to characterize intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (time
      between the start of vaginal intercourse and the start of intravaginal ejaculation) in men
      with and without premature ejaculation (PE) and to assess the validity of patient-reported
      outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, observational study in men with and without PE. The
      study consists of three visits: one visit for screening and enrollment, and two visits for
      observation after 1 and 2 months (total duration of 8 weeks). No study treatment for PE is
      administered to patients during the course of the study. Patients and their partners are
      expected to attempt sexual intercourse at least 2 times a week during the 8-week study period
      and to use a stopwatch to record the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) during
      intercourse. At visits during the observation period &quot;patients&quot; (and/or partners if partners
      are responsible for completing questionaires) also provide patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
      by answering several questionnaires that include the topics of control over ejaculation,
      satisfaction with sexual intercourse, personal distress, interpersonal difficulty, and
      self-esteem. The study will estimate the distribution of the average IELT values for men with
      PE and men without PE.
