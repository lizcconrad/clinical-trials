  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 3-month (cycle) study was to evaluate the effects of hormonal
      contraceptives containing a progestin and an estrogen on liver proteins and coagulation
      factors that are sensitive to estrogen. In this study, a contraceptive vaginal ring
      containing Nestorone® (a progestin with no androgenic properties) and ethinyl estradiol was
      compared to an oral contraceptive containing levonorgestrel (an androgenic progestin) and
      ethinyl estradiol.
