  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to come to a consensus about how to prescribe exercise training that actually
      helps overweight and obese people. Thus, the present study determines the effects of several
      types of exercise training to define the one with the largest effect with the least effort.

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Strength training</intervention_name>
    <description>a strength training regime of 4 series with 5 repetitions each, at approximately 90% of 1 repetition maximum (RM), in a leg press apparatus to develop maximal strength mainly from neural adaptation with minimal weight gain due to muscular hypertrophy.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>continuous moderate-intensity aerobic training</intervention_name>
    <description>The moderate-intensity group walked continuously for 47 min at 60-70% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) to ensure that the training protocols were isocaloric.</description>

    <intervention_type>Behavioral</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>high-intensity interval aerobic training</intervention_name>
    <description>High-intensity training consisted of a 10 min warm-up period at 50-60% of HRmax [maximal HR (heart rate)], followed by 4×4-min intervals at 85-95% of HRmax with 3 min active breaks in between the intervals, consisting of walking or jogging at 50-60% of HRmax. The exercise session was terminated by a 5 min cool-down period.</description>
