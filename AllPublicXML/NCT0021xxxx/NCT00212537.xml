      The total amount of blood drawn is approximately 5 tablespoons (75 ml). The blood sample will
      be processed to isolate &quot;genetic material&quot; (mainly DNA, RNA and protein). This genetic
      material will be used to try to identify the &quot;genetic factors&quot; or genes that a person
      inherits that make him or her more likely to develop asthma. The blood is used to test for
      allergies to weeds, trees, insects and molds (RAST) and a complete blood count.

        All individuals approached for participation in the Research Registry shall be able to read
        or comprehend English. Since participation in the Research Registry does not involve a risk
        of physical harm, women of childbearing potential will not be queried as to pregnancy
        status or tested for pregnancy unless they are requested to undergo a methacholine
        challenge test. There are no additional inclusion/exclusion criteria.
