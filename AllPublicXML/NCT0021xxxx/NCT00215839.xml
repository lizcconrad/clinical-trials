      Objectives:

      Primary To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Peginterferon a-2a plus
      Ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection in persons co-infected
      with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who have failed to achieve a sustained virologic
      response following previous interferon therapy.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the virological response to Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin at weeks 12
           and 24 as compared to baseline values.

        -  To evaluate the sustained virological response Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin at
           post-treatment weeks 4, 12, and 24 as compared to baseline.

        -  To evaluate the histological effects of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy through
           comparison of liver biopsy results following 96 weeks of Peginterferon a-2a therapy to
           baseline values.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy in
           patients who have previously failed to achieve a sustained virologic response following
           interferon therapy.

        -  To investigate the effects of long-term Peginterferon a-2a therapy on clinical outcomes
           of HIV disease.

      Study Design:

      All qualifying patients will enter the treatment phase and be dosed as follows:

      Peginterferon a-2a 180mg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus

      Ribavirin:

        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg

        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg

        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg

      Patients with undetectable levels of HCV-RNA at Treatment Week 24 will continue on previously
      assigned Peginterferon a-2a plus Ribavirin combo-therapy for an additional 24 weeks. Patients
      with detectable levels of HCV-RNA will be randomized to Peginterferon a-2a mono-therapy or no
      treatment for 72 weeks.

        -  Group A: Peginterferon a-2a 90mg mono-therapy for 72 weeks.

        -  Group B: No CHC therapy for 72 weeks

      All patients entering the study are required to have a baseline liver biopsy (within 18
      months of study entry). Patients entering the 72-week randomized arm of the trial will have a
      post-study liver biopsy upon completion of the trial.

      Study Population:

      100 HIV infected adults with chronic hepatitis C infection who have failed to achieve a
      sustained virologic response following previous interferon therapy.

      Dosage and Administration:

      Combo-therapy: Peginterferon a-2a 180mg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus

      Ribavirin:

        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg

        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg

        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg Mono-therapy: Peginterferon a-2a 90mg in 1mL
           solution administered subcutaneously once weekly.

      Efficacy Evaluations:

      Laboratory analysis, liver biopsies, quality of life assessments, and changes in
      Peginterferona-2a and Ribavirin dosages will be obtained.

      Safety Evaluations:

        -  Assessment of laboratory evaluations

        -  vital signs

        -  incidence and severity of adverse experiences

        -  dose adjustments

        -  premature withdrawal for safety reasons

        -  progression of disease as measured by HCV viral load

        -  AIDS defining events
