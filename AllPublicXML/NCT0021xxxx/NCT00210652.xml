  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary effectiveness of the
      novel compound RWJ-333369 in patients with partial onset seizures who are currently being
      treated with 1 or 2 concomitant antiepileptic drugs.

      333369EPY2002 is the open-label extension study that follows the double-blind study
      333369EPY2001. In an open label study such as 333369EPY2002, both the physician and the
      patient know the name of the assigned study medication. In a double blind study such as
      333369EPY2001, neither the physician nor the patient knows the name of the assigned study
      medication. Patients who complete the double-blind treatment phase of study 333369EPY2001
      will be eligible to enter the open-label extension study during which patients will
      transition through a blinded period to an open-label period with carisbamate (also referred
      to as RWJ-333369). RWJ-333369 is a new chemical compound with anticonvulsant activity that is
      currently under investigation as a treatment for epilepsy. Patients electing to enter the
      open-label extension phase will be supplied with both open-label carisbamate (RWJ-333369) and
      blinded study medication for the transition phase. During this transition phase (up to 21
      days in length), the patient's dose of double-blind study drug will be gradually reduced and
      stopped and treatment with open-label RWJ-333369 will be started. Throughout the remainder of
      the open label extension phase, investigators will be allowed to make further adjustments of
      the dosage and schedule of carisbamate, including independent adjustment of the morning and
      evening doses, but a dosage of 1,200 mg/day may not be exceeded and increases in dosage must
      be in increments of no more than 200 mg/day. Patients who, in the judgment of the
      investigator, continue to benefit from treatment with RWJ-333369 may continue to receive the
      drug with follow up clinic visits every 3 months until RWJ 333369 is available by
      prescription or the program is terminated by the sponsor. Initial dose RWJ-333369 is 1
      capsule (250 milligram (mg) taken twice daily. Dosage may be changed at weekly intervals. The
      maximum permitted dose will be 4 capsules (1000 mg), twice daily during dose titration.
      Double blind-treatment duration is up to 71 days with the option to continue treatment in an
      open-label study. Maximum dose in open-label study is 1200 mg/day
