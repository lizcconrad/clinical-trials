  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that propofol-fentanyl sedation for lumbar punctures in
      children with acute leukemia/lymphoma results in fewer adverse events than propofol sedation
      alone. Secondary hypotheses state that propofol-fentanyl sedation results in a better
      sedation induction, recovery profile and is preferred by patients/families. The study is a
      double blind, randomized, placebo controlled crossover study. Following the induction phase
      of chemotherapy, children will be randomized in a crossover manner to receive either
      fentanyl-propofol or propofol-placebo for future lumbar punctures. Patients will be studied
      on two separate occasions, once with propofol-placebo (normal saline) and once with
      propofol-fentanyl. Children will be monitored continuously by pulse oximetry,
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and direct nursing and physician observation during the sedation in
      accordance with the University of Wisconsin (UW) Pediatric Policy and Procedure. Propofol
      will be titrated to a Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) score of ≤ 7
      for all children. Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate and blood pressure will be
      recorded every 3 minutes by a study investigator during sedation.
