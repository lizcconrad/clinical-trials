    <description>An IPF Registry is being established to assemble sufficient patients with IPF (especially in its earliest stage) for phase I therapeutic protocols. The Registry will incorporate demographic and clinical data for natural history studies; second, research data on physiology, high-resolution CT scan, questionnaires, and blood samples for blood banking to be collected every 6 months for prospective studies on pathophysiology; and third, response to standard therapies will be monitored to determine cellular and molecular relationships to clinical outcome and predictors of survival. This is done in order to better determine cellular and molecular determinants of IPF. This cohort will be large enough to commence a separate phase I protocol with molecular strategies of intervention.</description>
