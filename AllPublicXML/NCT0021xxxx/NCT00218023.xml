    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem; an effective primary treatment for
      cocaine dependent individuals has yet to be found. The purpose of this study is to identify
      subpopulations and baseline conditions that are most responsive to treatment for cocaine
      dependent individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is widely abused throughout the
      United Sates. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is often effective when combined with
      drug treatment. Baseline condition (e.g., abstinence status) and population type (e.g.,
      ethnicity and gender) often affect how an individual responds to treatment for drug
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of baseline status and
      population type on treatment response in cocaine dependent individuals. In addition, this
      study will examine how various cocaine abuse medications target different neuronal systems,
      withdrawal symptoms, and relapse to drug use.

      This study will take place in two phases. Phase I will last 4 weeks; participants will
      receive MI and undergo contingency-based urine tests in order to achieve the desired baseline
      condition. Phase II will last 12 weeks. Participants in Phase II will be randomly assigned to
      receive one of four treatments: 1) 50 mg naltrexone, 2) 800/200 mg levodopa/carbidopa, 3) 400
      mg modafinil, or 4) placebo. During Phase II, all participants will receive psychotherapy and
      contingency management. Participants will complete urine drug screening tests 3 times each
      week. Follow-up study visits will occur between 3 and 6 months following Week 12, and will
      include objective and self-reported drug use.

    <description>The primary goal of motivational interviewing (MI) was to assist patients in achieving initial abstinence by increasing motivation and commitment to change. The MI intervention consisted of two 1-h individual therapy sessions on the first and eighth day of Phase I. The client-centered, MI-style sessions focused on building motivation for change, exploring ambivalence, obtaining a commitment to change, making a plan for abstinence (Session 1), providing personalized feedback, reassessing commitment for change, and reevaluating the change plan (Session 2). Masters-level therapists were trained and supervised by the therapy supervisor (ALS), an expert in motivation-based therapies.</description>
