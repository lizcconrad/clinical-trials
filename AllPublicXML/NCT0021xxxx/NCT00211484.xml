    <textblock>
      A compassionate method of treatment is offered to patients where lesions do not meet
      acceptable criteria for standard therapy. Visudyne (Photodynamic Therapy) and laser
      photocoagulation treatment (a treatment using heat from a fine point laser beam) have not
      been found to be effective in treating the lesions these patients have.

      Anecortave acetate is an experimental drug that is being tested to prevent the growth of
      blood vessels under the retina in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

      Patients will receive a sub-Tenon injection of 15mg of Anecortave acetate in their study eye
      with the use of a counter pressure device. Patients will then be followed for up to 24
      months. The patients will have the option of extending their participation in the study for
      an additional 24 months. Statistical analysis will include comparison of patient follow-up
      visual acuity and angiographic data.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of patients whose lesions do not meet acceptable criteria for

             access).

          6. Patient with significant liver disease or uremia.

          7. Patient with known adverse reaction to fluorescein and indocyanine green or iodine.

          8. Patient has a history of any medical condition which would preclude scheduled visits
             or completion of study.

          9. Patient has had insertion of scleral buckle in the study eye.
