  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the liquid
      formulation of CAIV-T against culture confirmed influenza illness in adults aged 60 years and
      older. In addition this study aims to demonstrate superiority of CAIV-T when compared with
      placebo and the effect on economic resources.

      To evaluate the efficacy over 1 year against culture-confirmed influenza-illness caused by
      community-acquired subtypes antigenically similar to those contained in the vaccine, in
      adults aged â‰¥ 60 years at enrollment, of 1 dose of an intranasally-administered (IN) liquid
      formulation of influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, types A and B, live, cold-adapted (CAIV-T;
