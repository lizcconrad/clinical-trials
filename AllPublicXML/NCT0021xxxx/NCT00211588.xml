  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether galantamine stabilizes or improves thinking
      abilities in individuals with Parkinson's disease. Individuals included in the study have
      minor complaints about thinking such as problems with concentration or memory but do not have
      dementia. This medication has been shown to have a positive effect on stabilizing memory in
      individuals with Alzheimer's disease. It is FDA approved for use in elderly individuals with
      Alzheimer's disease. It is hypothesized that galantamine will stabilize or improve executive
      and attentional functions in individuals with Parkinson's.

    <textblock>
      While several cholinesterase inhibitors have effectiveness in Alzheimer's disease (AD),
      galantamine is unique since it has a dual mode of action: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase
      and modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.As Parkinson's disease (PD) impacts
      frontal systems, executive cognition rather than memory function (mediated by medial
      temporal) would be the targeted area for potential improvement. This single center, double
      blind, placebo controlled study compares a group of PD patients treated with galantamine to a
      group of PD patients who are not treated with this medication on a series of cognitive tasks
      that examine attention and executive control.
