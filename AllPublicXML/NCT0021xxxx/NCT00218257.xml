  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Past research has demonstrated that cocaine dependent women experience less severe responses
      to cocaine during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone
      concentrations are high. The purpose of this study is to determine whether administered
      progesterone reduces subjective and physiological responses to cocaine in cocaine dependent
      individuals.

    <textblock>
      Changes in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle impact responses to cocaine in women.
      Studies have shown that cocaine's effects are dampened during the luteal phase of the
      menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone concentrations are high, relative to the
      other phases of the cycle, when concentrations of these hormones are relatively low. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether progesterone reduces subjective and
      physiological responses to cocaine in cocaine dependent individuals. In addition, this study
      will help to advance the possibility of hormonal progesterone and pharmacologically related
      drugs as potential treatment components for cocaine abuse.

      Participants will undergo two 4-day inpatient periods, totaling 8 days of treatment. For
      women, the inpatient periods will occur during two consecutive menstrual cycles; for men,
      they will occur during two consecutive months. On Day 1, participants will receive a first
      dose of either progesterone or placebo. On Day 2, participants will receive a second and
      third dose of study medication. They will also participate in an adaptation session, which
      will familiarize the participant with the smoking equipment that will be used the following
      day. On Day 3, participants will receive a fourth dose of medication 2 hours prior to a
      smoking lab session. Prior to beginning the smoking lab session, participants will be asked
      to rate their current cocaine craving, anxiety level, appetite, and premenstrual symptoms.
      Participants will then be given a sample of the cocaine dose for the given day. During the
      smoking lab session, participants will be asked additional cocaine craving questions at
      pre-determined intervals and will be given the option to trade in previously earned tokens
      for either money or a dose of cocaine. Following completion of the smoking lab session,
      participants will receive their fifth dose of medication.
