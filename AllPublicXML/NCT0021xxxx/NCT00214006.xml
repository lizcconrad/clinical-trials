      First, to establish a comparison of the pathophysiology of carotid atherosclerosis and the
      genetic and environmental variables that cause those plaques to become symptomatic. Second,
      to differentiate between vulnerable plaque and other types of plaque using ultrasound
      elastography, MRI data, trans-cranial doppler along with RF (radio frequency) analysis of
      back-scattered ultrasonic echoes.

      This is a multi-investigator study based on the pathophysiology of carotid atherosclerosis
      and the variables that cause certain plaques to become symptomatic.Patients enrolled in this
      study will be those patients undergoing a carotid endarterectomy. This will include both
      symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, and there are a variety of atherosclerotic risk
      factors representing this patient population.Patients may or may not have had strokes or
      transient ischemic attacks (TIAs).Pre-operatively patients will be reviewed for their medical
      history and atherosclerotic risk factors. Plaque removed during routine carotid
      endarterectomy will be examined for study purposes.

    <description>Comparison studies will be done using the lipid protein analysis and imaging studies. The primary comparison will be between those that are symptomatic and those that are asymptomatic. Secondary comparisons will be done using the lipid protein analysis and patient history.
Comparison of cognitive status between groups will be made using analysis of covariance in which the difference in follow-up score between groups (symptomatic/asymptomatic) is adjusted for baseline score. The baseline adjusted standard error is 6.4, which with 36 subjects per group will yield 90% power to detect a difference between groups of approximately 4.9 points at a significant level of 5%. We need 36 subjects per group to achieve the power stated. We have built in another 15% for projected dropout to insure we meet the final target.</description>
