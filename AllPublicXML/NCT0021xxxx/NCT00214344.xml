  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using the self-regulation theory, an intervention to prepare families for that experience was
      developed. This study will assess the impact of the intervention on a family's evaluation of
      their preparation and their short-term coping. The site used for this study will be the
      Trauma and Life Support Center (TLC), University of Wisconsin (UW) Hospital. After a decision
      has been made to withdraw life support, a member of the TLC staff will approach the next of
      kin of the patient to inform him/her about the study and inquire about his/her interest to
      participate. Using an experimental design, 10 family members will be assigned to the control
      group and 10 to the intervention group. Upon agreement, a research nurse will use a &quot;coin
      toss method&quot; for group assignment of the subjects until there are ten in each group.
      Experimental group subjects will receive the intervention after the family meeting.
      Demographics of the next of kin will be collected at this time. Patient information such as
      demographics, diagnosis, and time of withdrawal and death will be collected too. Two to four
      weeks after death, a telephone interview will be conducted with the next of kin using the
      &quot;Evaluation of the Experience of Withdrawal&quot; questionnaire and the Profile of Mood State -
      shortened version.

      Potential benefits are that the families will be prepared for the experience of the dying
      patient, which will help them cope better during withdrawal and after their loss. There are
      no major risks to the subjects but there might be an increase in psychological distress.
