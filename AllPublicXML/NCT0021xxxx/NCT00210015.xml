        Inclusion Criteria:

             sensitivity by the results of prick or intradermal skin testing.

          -  Have a self-reported history of at least mild, intermittent rhinorrhea and nasal
             blockage/stuffiness due to allergies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a physical obstruction in the nose.

          -  Will likely have an acute increase in severity of allergic rhinitis due to seasonal
             aeroallergens during the trial.

          -  Have acute or chronic sinusitis or had previous sinus surgery resulting in a
             significant change in the sinus or nasal anatomy.

          -  Have rhinitis medicamentosa or any other acute or chronic condition that could
             confound evaluations of nasal symptoms.

          -  Have asthma of sufficient severity to require use of excluded medications.

          -  Have taken any medications excluded as listed in the protocol.

          -  Have a clinically significant acute or chronic disease or clinically significant
