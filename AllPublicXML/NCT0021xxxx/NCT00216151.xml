  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence for the beneficial effects of bisphosphonates on bone resorption in multiple myeloma
      has been reported extensively, showing reductions in skeletal events and improvement of
      several biochemical variables in bone resorption. Zoledronic acid (Zometa®, CGP42446) is the
      most potent clinically available bisphosphonates, with the largest therapeutic ratio between
      the desired inhibition of calcium resorption and the unwanted inhibition of mineralization in
      vitro of all the bisphosphonates.

      This trial will investigate the efficacy of zoledronic acid in preventing skeletal events in
      patients with asymptomatic/early stage Multiple Myeloma

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned by study number to receive 4mg of zoledronic acid
           every three months or to be observed.

      Performance status: ECOG performance status 0-3 (KPS 30 - 100)

      Life expectancy: 12 months

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Hb &gt;10 g/dl within 14 days prior to registration

      Hepatic:

        -  Not specified

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dl within 14 days prior to registration
