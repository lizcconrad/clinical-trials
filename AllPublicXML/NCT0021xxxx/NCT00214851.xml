      An open labelled trial of Kineret (anakinra) induction therapy (100mg./day) in over a four
      week period in the treatment of Familial Cold Urticaria.

      Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) is a rare autosomal dominant condition manifesting symptoms
      triggered by exposure to cold and variable in expression. Currently there is no standard
      reliable agent available for the treatment of patients with FCU.This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of Kineret (anakinra), an interleukin 1 receptor antagonist in induction and
      maintenance therapy in patients with FCU.

      Product: Kineret (anakinra) Protocol title: The Use of Kineret (anakinra) in the Treatment of
      Familial Cold Urticaria (FCU) Target Disease: Familial Cold Urticaria Patients: 8 patients
      all previously diagnosed with FCU and living close to Moncton, N.B.

      Study Objectives:

        -  To assess the efficacy of Kineret (anakinra) 100mg. given subcutaneously daily in
           subjects with FCU.

        -  To demonstrate the use of CRP and SAA as objective laboratory markers of the
           effectiveness of treatment.

        -  To determine the effect of Kineret (anakinra)on the quality of life of patients with
           FCU.

      Study design: An open-labelled trial of Kineret (anakinra) induction therapy (100mg./day)
      over a four week period.

      Treatment regimens: After initial clinical and laboratory assessment, the patients will
      receive Kineret (anakinra) 100mg. daily for four weeks. They will be observed for two further
      weeks without the medication.

      Route of administration: Subcutaneous injection Interval between first and last dose of
      active study agent: 4 weeks Duration of study participation: 8 weeks Number of subjects: 8
      Number of sites: 1 Interim analysis: Daily patient diary; weekly follow-up phone calls; CRP
      reports

          -  Must react with at least one of the symptoms of FCU in the summer months at least four

          -  Have had any previous treatment with Kineret (anakinra) or any therapeutic agent
             targeted at IL-1 blockade.

          -  Have used any investigational drug within the previous 1 month or five times the half
             life of the investigational agent, whichever is longer, or 3 months for any biologic
             of unknown half life.

          -  Have received any systemic medication or treatments that could affect the symptoms of
             FCU such as antihistamines, corticosteroid drugs, NSAIDS, anabolic medications or
