  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that dapoxetine can prolong intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared with placebo in men with premature ejaculation (PE).

    <textblock>
      Premature ejaculation (PE) is a form of male sexual dysfunction. An objective measurement of
      PE in clinical studies is the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). This is a
      multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study in men with
      PE. The study will consist 2 phases: pre-randomization phase (a screening visit and a 4-week
      baseline period); 12-week double-blind treatment phase during which patients will receive
      dapoxetine or placebo for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis, with a post-study telephone contact
      approximately 2 weeks after the end of treatment. The total duration of the study is
      approximately 18 weeks. Assessments of effectiveness include the average intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (as measured by stopwatch) during sexual intercourse, during the
      treatment period; control over ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, and
      severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at monthly intervals through the treatment
      phase. Safety assessments include the incidence, severity, and type of adverse events during
      the study, as well as laboratory tests and questionnaires to monitor sexual function at
      specified times during the study. The study hypothesis is that treatment for 12 weeks with
      dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, compared with placebo, in men with
      PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine (30 milligrams[mg] or 60mg) or placebo taken as needed during
      12 weeks of treatment. No more than 1 dose within a 24-hour period.
