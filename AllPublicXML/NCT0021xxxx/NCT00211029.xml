  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to record the number of participants with chronic renal disease
      who are receiving treatment with epoetin alfa or other recombinant erythropoietins who
      develop pure red cell aplasia (PRCA, a rare form of anemia) during the study period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons over a
      sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the
      selection of the study group), observational (clinical study in which participants may
      receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does
      not assign participants to specific interventions) and cohort study. Study specific
      information will be collected from participants with chronic renal disease who are receiving
      recombinant erythropoietin and their treatment course will be followed for up to 2 years and
      participants will not receive any intervention in this study. Upon entering the study,
      information will be collected regarding disease history and recombinant erythropoietin
      treatment. Every 3 months thereafter, progress information will be collected, including
      recombinant erythropoietin treatment, number of red blood cells and presence of any signs of
      pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) development. The results of this study will be combined with a
      similar study (EPO-IMU-402) that also collects blood samples to observe the number of
      patients who develop antibodies to erythropoietin. Participants discontinuing erythropoietin
      will be followed only for an additional 12 months from the time erythropoietin is
      discontinued. Participants will receive standard-of-care treatment for their chronic renal
      disease from their individual Investigators. Participants will be primarily observed
      prospectively for PRCA. The study hypothesis is that these data will provide a framework for
      the expansion of the patient population to estimate the incidence of PRCA associated with the
      use of epoetin alfa or other recombinant erythropoietins for other therapeutic indications.
