  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rituximab has been demonstrated to sensitize drug-resistant NHL cells to the cytotoxic
      actions of several chemotherapy agents by enhancing sensitivity of tumor cells to
      chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog that is used in several
      other malignancies, has shown very promising activity in patients with refractory Hodgkin's
      disease and low-grade NHL. The combination of rituximab and gemcitabine may have synergistic
      cytotoxic action in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL and possibly lead to improved
      response rates and demonstrable clinical benefit.

      This trial will investigate the efficacy the combination of rituximab and gemcitabine in
      treating patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1 of 21 day cycle

        -  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 of 21 day cycle

      Subgroup 1. Relapsed after responding to first line chemotherapy, who are not candidates for
      salvage high-dose chemotherapy.

      Subgroup 2. Failure to achieve a complete response or relapsed after responding to salvage
      chemotherapy (any number of salvage regimens allowed), who are not candidates for high-dose
      chemotherapy.

      Subgroup 3. Refractory to first line chemotherapy and/or 1 (one) salvage chemotherapy
      regimen.

      Subgroup 4. Progression after high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with progressive disease
      within 3 months of high-dose chemotherapy are not allowed.
