    <textblock>
      Congenital Telangiectasia or Coat's disease is an uncommon disorder that involves the growth
      of blood vessels of the macula. These blood vessels msy extend beneth the retina to produce
      an area of sub-retinal neovascularization(growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina
      which &quot;leak&quot; fluid, causing reduction in vision). Limited forms of treatment are available in
      managing the neovascularization and its consequences. Anecortave Acetate injection will be
      considered as an attempt to control the growth of the abnormal blood vessels.

      After evaluation, the patient will receive an injection of anecortave acetate (15mg)
      juxtascleral with a special cannula in the study eye. the patient will be contacted via phone
      on the day following the injection. If problem arises patient has to come back to see the
      study doctor. if patient is stable, a 3 month follow-up visit will be st-up.if the patient
      does not show improvement, the patient may be offered either thermal laser or PDT. If patient
      is stable, on the month 6 visit ,the patient will again receive another injection of
      anecortave acetate. The succeding follow-up schedule will be followed for a total of 24
      months.
