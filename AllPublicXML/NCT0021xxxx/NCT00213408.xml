  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation of typical atrial flutter is a well established technique with a high acute
      success rate and very low complication and recurrence rates. It has also been shown that
      ablation of recurrent symptomatic typical atrial flutter led to a clear improvement in
      quality of life. We sought to evaluate the cost/effectiveness of catheter ablation as the
      first line therapy in patient suffering from their first symptomatic typical atrial flutter
      episode. This study is a multicenter trial in which patients with a first symptomatic episode
      of typical atrial flutter are randomized to undergo ablation or to receive antiarrhythmic
      drugs after electrical cardioversion. Clinical examination, quality of life questionnaires,12
      leads ECG and 24-hour Holter monitoring are performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months following
      randomization.The primary end-point is the absence of recurrence of typical atrial flutter at
      - and 12 months of follow up. The secondary end points are the cost and the
      cost/effectiveness ratio of these two approaches.
