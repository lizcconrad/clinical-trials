  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The exploration of evocative symptoms of esophageal reflux disease or dyspepsia is based on a
      relatively invasive endoscopic examination, often badly tolerated, and which, in France, is
      carried out in 50% of the cases under general anaesthesia. The development of a Capsule
      Endoscopy, of single use, of esophageal exploration (PILLCAM OESO), could allow a painless
      exploration of the oesophagus, without infectious risk.The aim of this study is to validate
      the information provided by the Esophageal Capsule Endoscopy compared to upper endoscopy in
      the screening of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease or dyspepsia . For that these
      patients, after being informed and to have given their signed assent, will initially have an
      exploration by Esophageal Capsule Endoscopy and then, the very same day or within 3 days
      maximum, a upper endoscopy'. The information provided by the Esophageal Capsule Endoscopy
      then by the upper endoscopy will be analyzed by investigators different. This study should
      make it possible to evaluate the parameters of specificity, sensitivity and predictive values
      of Esophageal Capsule Endoscopy in this indication.
