  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The IDEALL Project (Improving Diabetes Efforts Across Language and Literacy) is a 3-arm
      randomized controlled trial to explore contextual factors at the patient, clinician, and
      organizational level of two patient self-management support strategies. A communication
      technology-based intervention (automated telephone diabetes management) and an
      interpersonally-oriented intervention (group medical visits)will be compared to usual care
      for their ability to improve diabetes outcomes among vulnerable populations in 4 safety-net
      health centers in the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Collaborative Research
      Network.

    <measure>Changes in Diabetes Self-management Behaviors as Measured by Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) Measure is a brief self-report questionnaire on diabetes self-management behaviors. The questionnaire assesses the frequency with which a patient followed a diabetes routine over the prior 7 days in five domains: diet, exercise, blood-glucose testing, foot care, and medication adherence. Based on SDSCA measure's author's recommendations, two separate scores can be derived: a Diabetes Self-management Behaviors score and a Self-reported Medication Adherence score. The Diabetes Self-management Behaviors score is used in this study. For this score, all items pertaining to diet, exercise, blood glucose testing, and foot care are averaged. The result is an average score between 0 and 7 with higher score indicating better diabetes self-management behavior. Change is calculated as 1-year score minus baseline score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Minutes of Moderate Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of patients' physical activity is ascertained by asking patients the following question: &quot;In the last 7 days, how many total minutes or hours did you do physical activity? Like walking, house cleaning or gardening.&quot; Number of minutes may range from 0 to 10080, with greater number of minutes indicating more physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Minutes of Vigorous Exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of patients' vigorous exercise is ascertained by asking patients the following question: &quot;In the last 7 days, how many total minutes or hours did you do the kind of exercise that makes you breathe hard, such as swimming, walking fast, or biking?&quot; Number of minutes may range from 0 to 10080, with greater number of minutes indicating more vigorous exercise.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care (PACIC) is a 20-item patient report instrument that measures patients' perspectives on the structure of their care and collects patient reports on the extent to which they have received specific clinical services and actions during the past year that are aligned with the Chronic Care Model. The scale is intended to assess the receipt of care that is patient-centered, proactive, planned and includes collaborative goal setting, problem-solving and follow-up support. Each instrument item is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5 with higher score indicating better care. Scores are transformed to a 100-point scale and averaged across all items to create a total scale score. Change is calculated as 1-year score minus baseline score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Diabetes Self-efficacy as Measured by Diabetes Quality Improvement Project's Patient Self-Management Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Self-Management Scale was derived from a questionnaire used in the Diabetes Quality Improvement Project. The scale is designed to reflect patients' assessment of their ability to manage aspects of diabetes self-care in 5 separate areas (medication, diet, exercise, blood glucose monitoring, and foot care). Respondents are asked how difficult over the past year has it been to follow exactly as their doctor who takes care of their diabetes suggested. Possible scores for each scale item range from 0 to 100 with higher score indicating more self-efficacy. Total scale score is calculated as the average across all items. Change is calculated as 1-year score minus baseline score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Interpersonal Processes of Care (IPC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The Interpersonal Processes of Care (IPC) captures patient reports of providers' communication over the prior year. The scale is intended to measure patients' assessment of providers' communication within 3 broad domains: communication (e.g., lack of clarity), decision making (e.g., patient-centered decision making), and interpersonal style (e.g., friendliness). Each instrument item is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 to 5. Scores are transformed to a 100-point scale and averaged across all items to create a total scale score. Higher total scores indicate better communication. Change is calculated as 1-year score minus baseline score.</description>

    <measure>Changes in the Physical Component Summary of the SF-12 Health Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 Health Survey (SF-12) is a 12-item short-form survey used to measure health status and monitor health outcomes. The survey asks about various health aspects, including physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and mental health (psychological distress and psychological well-being). Two summary measures are derived: the Physical and the Mental Health Component Summary. For each component summary, survey items were weighted and summed to create a summary score between 0 and 100 with higher score indicating better functioning and outcome. Change is calculated as 1-year score minus baseline score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Patients Reporting Diabetes Interference of Normal Daily Activities</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>A measure of diabetes interference on patients is ascertained by asking patients the following question: &quot;In the last 12 months, how often has your diabetes kept you from doing your normal daily activities, such as going to work, grocery shopping, and taking care of yourself and others?&quot; Responses consist of 6 possible options: &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Almost Always&quot;, &quot;Often&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Almost Never&quot;, and &quot;Never&quot;. These responses are grouped into 2 categories, with one category consisting of &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Almost Always&quot;, and &quot;Often&quot; responses while the other category consists of the remaining responses. The proportion of patients reporting diabetes interference is the number of patients in the first category divided by the number of patients in the 2 categories combined.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Hemoglobin A1c Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Hemoglobin A1c is a form of hemoglobin that is measured primarily to identify the average plasma glucose concentration over prolonged periods of time. As the average amount of plasma glucose increases, the fraction of hemoglobin A1c increases in a predictable way. This serves as a marker for average blood glucose levels over the previous months prior to the measurement. Higher amounts of hemoglobin A1c indicate poorer control of blood glucose levels and have been associated with cardiovascular disease. Change is calculated as 1-year level minus baseline level.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic blood pressure is the pressure exerted on arteries and vessels by the heart when it contracts and pushes blood through the arteries to the rest of the body. Change is calculated as 1-year pressure minus baseline pressure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure exerted on the walls of the arteries and vessels in between heart beats, when the heart is relaxed and dilated, filling with blood. Change is calculated as 1-year pressure minus baseline pressure.</description>
