  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that dapoxetine can prolong intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared with placebo in men with premature ejaculation (PE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One form of male sexual dysfunction is premature ejaculation (PE), which is also referred to
      as rapid ejaculation (RE). An objective measurement of PE in clinical studies is the
      intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT). This is a randomized, double-blind study in men
      with PE. The study consists of 2 phases: pre-randomization phase (a screening visit and a
      2-week baseline period); 12-week double-blind treatment phase during which patients will
      receive dapoxetine at one of two dosages, or placebo, for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot; basis. The
      total duration of the study is approximately 14 weeks. Patients and their partners are
      expected to attempt sexual intercourse at least 4 times during the baseline period and at
      least 6 times each month during the treatment phase. Assessments of effectiveness include the
      average Intravaginal Ejaculatory Latency time (IELT), as measured by stopwatch, during sexual
      intercourse for the treatment period (12 weeks); control over ejaculation, satisfaction with
      sexual intercourse, and severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at monthly intervals
      through the treatment phase. Safety assessments include the incidence, severity, and type of
      adverse events throughout treatment (12 weeks), vital sign measurements (pulse and blood
      pressure) and laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis) at monthly intervals. The
      study hypothesis is that treatment for 12 weeks with dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time, compared with placebo, in men with PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine
      (30 milligrams[mg] or 60mg) taken as needed during 12 weeks of treatment. No more than one
      dose within a 24-hour period.

             acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study

          -  taking medications that are contraindicated for participation in the study

          -  currently using other forms of therapy for treatment of PE (for example, behavioral
             therapy or medications applied locally)

          -  previously participated in a drug study involving dapoxetine or in another drug trial
             within the last month
