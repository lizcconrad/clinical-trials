      The purpose of this study is to facilitate access to trabectedin for eligible previously
      treated patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS), who cannot be expected to benefit from
      currently available therapeutic options but who may benefit from treatment with trabectedin.
      The safety profile of trabectedin will be evaluated to further assess the potential risks of
      trabectedin treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      single-arm study. It will consist of 2 Phases: a Screening Phase (up to 21 days before the
      first dose administration), and Treatment Phase (for patients meeting the continuation
      criteria). During the Treatment Phase, patients will receive a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 trabectedin
      intravenous formulation administered as a 24-hour infusion on Day 1 of each suggested 21-day
      treatment cycle. All patients will receive 20 mg dexamethasone (or corticosteroid equivalent
      to dexamethasone). Number of cycles is not specified for this study. Patients may continue to
      receive treatment as long as they obtain an overall clinical benefit, ie, until there is
      clear evidence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, as judged by the
      investigator. Trabectedin is the first of a new class of antitumor agents. Previous studies
      with trabectedin in patients who had been previously treated for soft tissue sarcoma have
      suggested that treatment with trabectedin resulted in tumor shrinkage, disease stabilization,
      and improved survival rates. However, hematologic toxicity, hepatic toxicity, and renal
      impairment were also observed in these patients. The safety profile of trabectedin will be
      evaluated to further assess the potential risks of trabectedin treatment in patients
      previously treated for soft tissue sarcoma who are not expected to benefit from currently
      available therapeutic options for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Unresectable advanced or metastatic histologically proven soft tissue sarcoma (STS).
             Eligibility will include adult participants with desmoplastic small round cell tumor

          -  Must have relapsed or had progressive disease following standard of care treatment
             with chemotherapy prior to enrollment or intolerant to prior standard of care
             treatment with chemotherapy due to safety issues

          -  Recovery from toxic effects of prior therapies to Grade 1 or better according to
             National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events (criteria used
             to grade the severity of toxic effects on a scale from 0 to 5 - Grade 1 = mild in
             severity, Grade 0 = no severity)

          -  Clinical test results within acceptable limits (ie, hematologic, clinical chemistry
             and hepatic function test results)

          -  Female participants must be postmenopausal, surgically sterile, abstinent, or if
             sexually active, be practicing 2 effective methods of birth control (eg, prescription
             hormonal contraceptive, intrauterine device, double-barrier method [eg, condoms,
             occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam, cream, gel,
             film, or suppository]), before entry, and must agree to continue to use these same
             methods of contraception throughout the study and for 3 months thereafter. Male
             participants must agree to use an adequate contraception method as deemed appropriate
             by the investigator (eg, vasectomy, double-barrier, partner using effective
             contraception) and to not donate sperm for a minimum of 5 months after treatment
             discontinuation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma or osteosarcoma, less than 3 weeks from last dose of
             radiation, systemic cytotoxic therapy (or 4 half lives, whichever is longer)

          -  Active symptomatic viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease

          -  Significant uncontrolled cardiac condition, including New York Heart Association Class
             II or greater heart failure, uncontrolled angina pectoris, myocardial infarction
             within 6 months before enrollment, significant pericardial disease, or uncontrolled or
             arrhythmias

          -  Active infection

          -  Female participant who is pregnant or breastfeeding
