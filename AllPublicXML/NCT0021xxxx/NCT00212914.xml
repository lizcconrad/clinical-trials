  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 1998, The Canadian Diabetes Association published guidelines that recommended women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM,) should be screened postpartum for Type 2
      diabetes using a glucose tolerance test. We determined the rate of screening for Type 2
      diabetes at the Ottawa Hospital before and after the publication of this guideline and found
      that none of the women in either period had been screened following this recommendation. We
      believe a reminder letter outlining the recommended screening test sent to the patient and/or
      her family physician would increase screening for Type 2 diabetes in women with previous GDM.

      In 1998, the Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) published guidelines that recommended all
      women diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) should be screened 6 weeks to 6
      months postpartum for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) using a 2-hour 75g oral glucose tolerance
      test. We determined the rate of screening for type 2 DM at the Ottawa Hospital before and
      after the publication of this guideline and found that none of the women in either period had
      been screened following the CDA guideline recommendations although other screening tests that
      had not been recommended had increased in utilization. Since the publication of the CDA
      guidelines several studies have been published that demonstrate that identification of
      patients with an abnormal oral glucose tolerance test and early treatment prevents the onset
      of diabetes. This research and the recommendations need to be communicated to physicians.

      Methods:

      Overall Objectives:

        1. To test whether a reminder letter outlining the screening recommendations that is sent
           both to the patient and her family physician would increase screening postpartum for
           type 2 DM in women with previous GDM more than a letter sent only to the physician or
           the patient.

        2. To determine the patient and physician barriers that are impeding the adoption of this
           recommended screening strategy.

      Setting:

      The High Risk Obstetrical Clinics (HRU) at the Ottawa Hospital Civic and General Campus.

      Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:

      All women, who attend the HRU and who have been diagnosed with GDM will be considered for
      inclusion in the study. Women will be approached for participation in this study by the HRU
      health care team. If the patient agrees, then the research team will contact the patient to
      describe the study and obtain informed consent. (Appendix 1A)

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Patient does not have a Family Physician

        2. Patient's Family Physician already has a patient enrolled in the study

        3. Patient already enrolled in the study for a previous pregnancy

        4. Unable to give informed consent in English or French

        5. History of pre-gestational diabetes mellitus

        6. Intra-uterine fetal death or still birth

      Study design and Randomization:

      The design is a 2 X 2 factorial randomized controlled trial stratified by clinic location.
      Randomization will be performed by the Research Coordinator using a computer generated
      randomization number and a variable block size of 4 and 8. The HRU team, the investigators,
      and the patient will be blinded to the patient's group allocation. This process will decrease
      selection bias. Patients will be randomized postpartum by the research coordinator (to ensure
      that the patient does not have any of the exclusion criteria) to one of the following four
      groups.

        1. Physician and patient reminder

        2. Physician reminder with no patient reminder

        3. No physician reminder but a patient reminder

        4. Neither physician nor patient reminder. (Current standard of care)

      Pre-Intervention Data Collection:

      Baseline demographic data, maternal characteristics that have previously been shown to be
      associated with type 2 DM, and obstetric and reproductive history will be collected at the
      time of consent or at a maximum of two weeks after consent. The mailing address and telephone
      number of the patient and their family physician will also be obtained. A chart abstraction
      will be performed approximately 30 days after the expected date of confinement (EDC) to
      determine if a live birth occurred and the weight and gender of the baby will be abstracted.
      (Appendix 1B)

      Intervention:

      The screening recommendation strategy will be randomly allocated by the research coordinator
      after confirmation of a live birth and ensuring that the mother and her baby have been
      discharged from the hospital. In the unlikely event of a death, it was felt that the patient
      should be screened by the health care team with follow-up in the HRU postpartum as type 2 DM
      may be related to the cause of death. The physician reminder letter will consist of a patient
      specific recommendation to screen postpartum for type 2 DM using a 2-hour 75g OGTT and the
      evidence supporting this recommendation. The letter will inform the physician if their
      patient has or has not been given the requisition for the recommended screening test.
      (Appendix 1C) The patient reminder consists of a letter requesting the patient to proceed
      with screening, the requisition that is required for the screening test, as well as the
      instructions to follow for screening. (Appendix 1D)

      Primary and Secondary Outcome:

      Primary outcome:

      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients screened for type 2 DM using the
      recommended test, a 2-hour 75g OGTT. A Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic for overall
      comparison of the proportions in the 2 X 2 design will be used. As well Fisher's exact test
      for comparison of specific pair wise group proportions will be employed.

      Ascertainment of the Primary Outcome

      For patients who are randomized to the patient letter and requisition, the HRU health care
      team will receive the results of the test. For patients who are randomized to the physician
      reminder, the reminder will request that on the laboratory requisition that a copy of the
      results be forwarded to the HRU health care team. Also, for all patients screening will be
      ascertained by the following methods:

        1. At the patient follow-up phone interview, the patient will be asked if they were
           screened and what test was used.

        2. At the physician follow-up phone interview, the physician or nurse will be asked if the
           patient was screened, what test was used, and what were the results.

      All patients will have a similar process and similar intensity in the follow-up of the
      screening results. We expect with this method of ascertaining the primary outcome we will be
      able to determine whether the patient was screened or not. The investigator who is gathering
      the information from the physician or patient will be blinded to the patient's group
      allocation.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        1. Proportion of Patients screened with tests other than the recommended test A
           Mantel-Hanszel chi-squared test statistic for overall comparison of the proportions in
           the 2 X 2 design will be used. As well Fisher's exact test for comparison of specific
           pair wise group proportions will be employed depending on whether or not an interaction
           effect was found.

        2. Characteristics associated with screening:

           A univariate analysis of all continuous and categorical characteristics of the woman
           collected at baseline, the characteristics of the baby, birth complications, and
           characteristics of the physician will be performed. Any characteristics that are found
           to be statistically associated with (p&amp;lt;0.05) the dependent variable (Screen positive)
           will be considered for inclusion in a multivariate logistic model.

        3. Characteristics associated with screening for Type 2 DM or IGT:

           A univariate analysis of all continuous and categorical characteristics of the woman
           collected at baseline, the characteristics of the baby, birth complications, and
           characteristics of the physician will be performed. Any characteristics that are found
           to be statistically associated with (p&amp;lt;0.05) the dependent variable (Screen positive)
           will be considered for inclusion in a multivariate logistic model.

        4. Survey:

      The family physicians and patients will be contacted for a semi-structured interview once the
      patient is at least six months postpartum. The investigator who is performing the interview
      will be blinded to the patient's group allocation. They will be surveyed to determine their
      satisfaction with the screening method and qualitatively review their suggestions to evaluate
      barriers to adoption of the screening recommendation and increase adoption in their practice
      or experience. (Appendix 1E) For qualitative responses, the responses will be tabulated and a
      percentage reported. For responses that are reported as a Likert scale, a mean and a standard
      deviation will be calculated. These results will be used to aid in the planning process of
      future studies.

      Sample size:

      The design is a 2x2 factorial design and we will power the study to detect a difference in
      proportions between the four groups. If we assume a power of 80% and an alpha error of 5% we
      would require 67 patients in each group to detect a difference of proportions of 17%, 20%,
      and 35% in the groups that received either intervention or both combined. We assumed that the
      combination of patient and physician letter would lead to higher screening rates. A larger
      sample size is required when an interaction is suspected to ensure that the study has
      sufficient power to detect an interaction.16 The total sample size of the study would be 268
      patients.

      From our previous study that evaluated the screening rate using a 2 hour 75g OGTT in the year
      2000 at the Ottawa Hospital we found that 0% of patients were being screened. Conway et al14
      in their population of women diagnosed with GDM were achieved a 17% screening rate when the
      the women were given the requisition for screening but no reminder letter outlining the
      importance of the screening test.

      Feasibility Issues:

      At the Ottawa Hospital 168 and 149 women who delivered and had GDM in 1997 and 2000
      respectively. Averaging over the two years, we would estimate that approximately 160 women
      per year delivered at the Ottawa Hospital with GDM. Also, at the General campus of the Ottawa
      Hospital, approximately 30 patients per year are followed for GDM at the HRU but deliver at
      the Montfort hospital. Therefore, we would estimate that there would be a potential study
      population of 190 women at the Ottawa Hospital per year. We would also assume that 10% of
      women would decline to participate in the study, further reducing the potential population to
      171 women. Therefore we would anticipate the study would take almost two years to complete
      enrollment.

      Issues that may affect the success of this study are as follows: the acceptability of the
      study to the patient population of interest, whether the consent process itself would
      increase the screening rate as compared to the screening rate for the year 2000, and
      publication of new guidelines. It is unlikely that the consent process would be enough to
      increase screening rates alone as most studies on physician behaviour changes have shown that
      multiple interventions are required.11 The Clinical Practice Guideline Group of the CDA have
      started to meet to discuss an update of the guideline. Evidence published since the
      publication of the guidelines in 1998 lends more support to the recommendation to screen with
      a 2 hour OGTT.

      Ethical consideration This study has received approval by the Ottawa Hospital Research Ethic
      Board. All records paper and electronic will be stored within the Hospital under the
      jurisdiction of the Cinical Epidemiogy Program of the Ottawa Health Research Institute. All
      records are confidential and only the Investigators and the Research Associate will have
      access to the records.

      Knowledge Translation and dissemination plans The results of the study will be published in a
      peer-reviewed journal. The strategy that led to the highest proportion of patients being
      screened will be considered for adoption as part of routine clinical care at the Ottawa
      Hospital. The results of the survey will be utilized to improve the strategy if significant
      barriers to adoption were identified. The physician members of the team (Dr.'s Clark, Keely,
      and Karovitch) will be utilized as opinion leaders to encourage dissemination of the &quot;best&quot;
      screening strategy to other hospitals and physician groups involved in the care of patients
      with gestational diabetes.
