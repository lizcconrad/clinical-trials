  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the hemoglobin response rate in subjects with
      anemia, associated with chronic kidney failure, after receiving epoetin alfa (PROCRITÂ®)
      every 2 weeks

      This is a prospective study in non-dialysis subjects with anemia associated with chronic
      kidney disease. Subjects will be enrolled from multiple centers in the United States. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate hemoglobin response rate. The secondary
      objectives include evaluating the time to when hemoglobin responds, indicated by the results
      of the hemoglobin blood levels, the change in hemoglobin over time, the transfusion
      requirements and change in quality of life measurements. These measurements asks for the
      subjects views about how one feels, activity and energy level, etc. The subjects are
      administered study drug every 2 weeks through Study Week 27 unless dosing is held or the
      subject withdraws from the study. Each injection of study drug should not exceed 1 ml in
      volume.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the number of subjects who achieve a hemoglobin response after receiving PROCRIT every 2 weeks. Hemoglobin response is defined as achieving a target hemoglobin range of 11-12 g/dL for at least 2 consecutive weeks by Week 28.</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary endpoints include: the time to a hemoglobin response, the number of subjects achieving a 1 g/dL rise in hemoglobin, change in quality of life measurements, and the total study drug dose up to the time of response.</measure>
