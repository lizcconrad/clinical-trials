  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the most serious and frequent home accident amongst elderly. Most falls occur
      during walking. Vision is reduced with ageing and visual impairments affect balance.
      Uncorrected visual deficits and balance problems are reported to be risk factors for falls
      and fall related fractures. The present project uses a longitudinal design and aims at
      assessing the impact of cataract surgery on balance and gait as risk factors for falls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal design is used, where subjects referred to the Cataract Unit are tested 1-3
      weeks in advance of the surgery, and 4-6 weeks and 12 months after the surgery. Outcome
      measures are visual function, falls, balance and gait. Secondary outcome is quality of life,
      fear of falling and daily life functioning
