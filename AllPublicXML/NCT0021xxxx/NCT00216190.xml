    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine in ICU
      subjects who are initially intubated, mechanically ventilated and require sedation for beyond
      24 hours.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditional agents such benzodiazepines and propofol have long been used to sedate critically
      ill patients. Unfortunately, these agents have serious disadvantages that may have a negative
      impact on patient outcomes. These disadvantages include respiratory depression, prolonged
      mechanical ventilation, paradoxical agitation, myocardial depression, hypotension,
      tachyphylaxis, physical dependence, and an unpredictable duration of action following long
      term infusions. Additionally, concomitant use of an opioid or other analgesic is often
      required for ICU patients to achieve adequate levels of pain relief, which may also prolong
      awakening and possibly increase respiratory depression.

      Dexmedetomidine may offer a new treatment option that remedies many of the deficiencies of
      traditional sedatives. This agent would provide for accurate, titratable sedation and
      analgesia without the concurrent respiratory depression and accumulation common to other
      agents. It may permit greater patient interaction due to reduced impairment of cognition and
      may reduce risks associated with opioids due to its analgesia sparing property. Although such
      a drug may have important benefits for ICU patients requiring sedation for greater than 24
      hours, dexmedetomidine is not currently approved for such long-term usage.

          2. If female, subject is non-lactating, and is either:

               1. Not of childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal for at least 1 year or
                  surgically sterile due to bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
                  hysterectomy.

               2. Of childbearing potential but is not pregnant as confirmed by negative serum
                  pregnancy test at time of screening, and is practicing one of the following
                  methods of birth control: oral or parenteral contraceptives for three months
                  prior to study drug administration, a vasectomized partner, or abstinence from
                  sexual intercourse.

          3. Subject is initially intubated and mechanically ventilated, or is planned for imminent
             intubation and mechanical ventilation, sedation is anticipated to be required during
             mechanical ventilation, and mechanical ventilation is anticipated to continue for at
             least 72 hours.

          4. Subject or subject's legally authorized representative has voluntarily signed and
             dated an informed consent form, approved by the applicable Institutional Review Board
             (IRB), after the nature of the study has been explained and the subject or subject's
             legally authorized representative has had the opportunity to ask questions. The
             informed consent must be signed before any study specific procedures are performed.

          5. Subject is sedated within a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) range of -2 to +1
             at the time of initiation of study drug

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has been intubated for greater than 96 hours prior to the initiation of study
             drug (thus, the attainment of consent, screening evaluations, and randomization must
             all have been completed by the 96th hour post-intubation, so that the actual
             initiation of the study drug infusion may start by the end of the 96 hour window).

          2. Subject has serious central nervous system pathology/trauma that, per clinical
             judgment of the Investigator, precludes responsiveness or survival.

          3. Subject for whom opiates, benzodiazepines, or dexmedetomidine are contraindicated, or
             who has known or suspected serious allergy to any drug that might be administered
             during the course of the study.

          4. Subject for whom alpha-2 agonists are contraindicated.

          5. Subject requires neuromuscular blocking agents during the study for use other than
             intubation.

          6. Subject requires epidural or spinal analgesia during the study.

          7. Subject meets any of the following cardiovascular criteria:

               -  Acute unstable angina (defined during current hospital stay).

               -  Suspicion of acute myocardial infarction.

               -  Considered to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 30%.
                  Decision to exclude is predicated on the Investigator's opinion, and may be based
                  on any combination of acute presentations, recently performed diagnostic studies,
                  or a history that suggests poor cardiac function. Pulmonary congestion of a
                  non-cardiac origin or mild congestive failure primarily attributable to
                  etiologies other than poor ventricular function are not exclusion criteria.

               -  Heart rate &lt;50 bpm prior to infusion start.

               -  Systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg prior to infusion start.

               -  Conduction abnormalities except 1st degree AV block and rate-controlled atrial
                  fibrillation; subjects with functional pacemaker capacity may be enrolled.

          8. Subject is hospitalized primarily due to trauma and/or burns, has received general
             anaesthesia within the 24 hours prior to the start of study drug infusion, or is
             anticipated to require general anaesthesia within 24 hours after the start of the
             infusion.

          9. Subject has participated in a trial with any experimental drug within 30 days prior to
             enrollment in the study, or has ever been enrolled in this study.

         10. Subject is unable to undergo any procedure required by the protocol.

         11. Subject has laboratory results indicating the presence of liver disease consistent
             with a Child-Pugh score &gt;9 (Grade C).

         12. Subject has acute hepatitis, history or presence of chronic hepatitis, and/or has had
             a positive result for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen Test.

         13. Subject requires dialysis (eg, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, Continuous
             Venovenous Hemodialysis [CVVHD]).

         14. Subject has a known, uncontrolled seizure disorder.

         15. Subject has, per the Investigator's judgment, a known or suspected physical or
             psychological dependence on an abused drug, other than alcohol.

         16. Subject has a known psychiatric illness that could confound a normal response to
             sedative treatment.

         17. Subject is incarcerated.

         18. Subject is terminally ill with a life duration expectancy of ≤60 days.

         19. Subject has any other condition or factor which, in the Investigator's opinion, might
             increase the risk to the subject.
