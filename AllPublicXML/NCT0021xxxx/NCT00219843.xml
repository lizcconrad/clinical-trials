      The objective of this study is to investigate the safety of intralesional (IL) PV-10 for the
      treatment of metastatic melanoma. This study will also include a preliminary assessment of
      response of treated and untreated lesions by clinical evaluation at follow-up of 12 to 24
      weeks following IL PV-10 treatment.

      This is a two center, open label, ascending dose study. Subjects with at least two measurable
      melanoma lesions will receive a single intralesional injection of 10% PV-10 solution into
      each of one to twenty (20) target lesions. Additionally, one to three measurable untreated
      non-target lesions will be followed for assessment of bystander response. Systemic and
      locoregional adverse events will be monitored over the study interval. Dose escalation will
      be made only if no subjects at the first dose level have a Grade 3 non-hematological or Grade
      4 hematological toxicity over a period of two weeks after PV-10 administration. Subject
      accrual and PV-10 administration at the second dose level will be stopped if more than 1
      subject has a treatment related Grade 3 non-hematological or Grade 4 hematological toxicity
      within a period of two weeks after PV-10 administration.
