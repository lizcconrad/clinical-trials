    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the significance of an elevated quantitative EBV
      PCR and to determine the relationship between a EBV PCR value and the risk of developing
      PTLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The relationship between Epstein-Barr virus and lymphoproliferative disease has been
      established, particularly in the immuno-suppressed patient. Over the past several years a
      quantitative EBV PCR lab test has been established. Unfortunately, the significance of an
      elevated test remains unclear. The relationship of a particular EBV PCR value and the risk of
      developing PTLD is unknown. The primary aims will be to determine the significance of an
      elevated quantitative EBV PCR and to determine the relationship between a EBV PCR value and
      the risk of developing PTLD. The study will be conducted through a retrospective chart review
      of approximately 160 patients and we will look at postoperative data including Quantitative
      EBV PCR results, the presence / absence of PTLD and the treatment of PTLD and results of EBV
      PCR with treatment.
