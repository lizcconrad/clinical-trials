  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that women perceive intestinal stimulation (rectal balloon
      distention) differently in different phases of the menstrual cycle, i.e there is an effect of
      hormones on the sensory pathway, and that this difference is reflected in the Central Nervous
      System processing of this signal. We also hypothesize that there is a difference in
      perception between control subjects and subjects with the irritable bowel syndrome.

      There is discrepancy in the literature concerning the effect of the menstrual cycle on bowel
      function and pain syndromes such at irritable bowel syndrome. In addition, recent studies
      indicate a difference in the CNS processing of rectal stimulation in normal subjects and
      patients with IBS. This study will determine the differences in the perception of rectal
      balloon distention in the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle, in control
      subjects with no bowel symptoms and volunteers with IBS, and will compare the CNS processing
      of this signal using functional MRI , again in the two phases of the menstrual cycle.

      Comparisons: between control subjects without GI symptoms and those with irritable bowel
      syndrome.
