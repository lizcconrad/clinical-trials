  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This hypertension project is evaluating strategies developed to target problems underlying
      lack of blood pressure control among treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients in East
      and Central Harlem.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypertension project will tailor improvement strategies to the problems identified as
      underlying underuse among treated but uncontrolled hypertensive patients in East and Central
      Harlem, New York City. Along with the communities’ 6 major health providers, we will first
      combine qualitative and quantitative methods to identify specific patient, provider, and
      system problems, and customize interventions to address them. In a randomized controlled
      trial, we will then randomly assign 480 patients among 4 arms: nurse management, blood
      pressure monitors alone, usual care, and peer led chronic disease self-management course.
      During the 18-month trial, patients self-monitor their blood pressure or attend a
      self-management course, or nurse managers will assess patients’ needs, counsel them, address
      any access barriers, and follow up with regular telephone contacts; convey information,
      including blood pressures from patients’ self-monitoring, between patients and physicians to
      inform possible medication changes; and ameliorate any systems problems. We will assess
      differences in blood pressure reductions among the 4 arms as the primary outcome, and in
      quality of life, patient satisfaction, costs, and cost-effectiveness as secondary outcomes.
      The findings will provide new knowledge about the relationship between these changes and
      patient and clinician knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. The educational course is designed
      to teach patients tools for managing their chronic illness which will empower them to improve
      their overall health and is specifically tailored for patients living with asymptomatic
      chronic illnesses and will emphasize communication with health care providers. In partnership
      with community organizations and the policymakers, we will disseminate successful findings
      within these communities and throughout the state and the nation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Male and female, English or Spanish speaking African American and/or Hispanic patients with
        uncontrolled hypertension who have been seen in either the Cardiology clinic, Internal
        Medicine Associates (IMA) or Geriatric clinic at least twice in a given year at least 18
        years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        This study is about hypertension control among African Americans and Hispanics, these are
        the ethnic groups with disparities in CVD that we want to improve so other races are
        excluded. The study is for adults with hypertension; therefore, we are excluding anyone who
        is under 18 years of age.
