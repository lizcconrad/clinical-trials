  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of glucarpidase in patients with impaired methotrexate
      (MTX) clearance owing to MTX-induced renal failure following high-dose MTX therapy, or with
      intrathecal MTX overdose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent by patient or legally valid representative

          -  Patients receiving high-dose MTX (&gt;1 g/m2 body surface area (BSA) given as an infusion
             over 24 hours) for the treatment of ALL, NHL or a solid tumour (e.g. osteosarcoma)

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Serum MTX &gt;5 µmol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion, or serum MTX &gt;1
             μmol/L 42 hours or later after the start of MTX infusion together with renal
             insufficiency, or serum MTX &gt;0.4 µmol/L 48 hours or later after the start of MTX
             infusion together with renal insufficiency. Renal insufficiency was defined as serum
             creatinine &gt;1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) and/or oliguria (urine output &lt; 500
             mL/24 hours despite adequate hydration, diuretics and alkalinisation).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Unwillingness of patient or relative/legal representative to give informed consent
