      For congestive heart failure (CHF) patients with systolic dysfunction, a randomized
      controlled trial compared nurse-based disease management to address problems in patient and
      clinician management with usual care for effects on hospitalization and functioning among
      ethnically-diverse patients in ambulatory practices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congestive heart failure (CHF) disproportionately afflicts Black and elderly people, and is a
      leading cause of hospitalization &gt; 65 years. Although effective therapies can improve
      functioning and survival in patients with systolic dysfunction, many may not be receiving the
      full benefit of existing knowledge, including counseling on self-management and appropriate
      doses of medications. Patients play a critical role in managing a chronic condition such as
      CHF, but may not have the skills to do so. Clinicians may not provide counseling or
      medications consistent with evidence-based guidelines.

      Systematic reviews of clinical-behavior change have suggested that interventions targeted to
      specific problems are more likely to be successful. Based on shortfalls identified in patient
      self-management and clinical care in Harlem, a predominately non-white area in northern
      Manhattan, we tailored a nurse-management intervention to address the problems documented,
      and evaluated its effectiveness in a randomized controlled trial. This trial among
      primarily-minority patients addresses important gaps in this literature: the study targeted
      problems documented among CHF patients in Harlem, enrolled patients from ambulatory
      practices, randomly assigned patients between nurse-management and usual care, and evaluated
      their subsequent health-related outcomes. Hypothesis: the nurse-management program would
      result in nurse patients' having fewer hospitalizations and reporting better functioning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  • adults &gt;18 years,

               -  systolic dysfunction documented on a cardiac test (echocardiography, radionuclide
                  ventriculography, myocardial stress sestamibi/thallium testing, or left-heart
                  catheterization),

               -  English- or Spanish-speaking,

               -  community-dwelling at enrollment, and

               -  current patient in a general medicine, geriatrics, or cardiology clinic or office
                  at a participating site.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • medical conditions that prevented a patient's interacting with the nurse, including
             blindness, deafness, and cognitive impairment;

               -  medical conditions that required individualized management that might differ from
                  standard protocol, namely pregnancy, renal dialysis, and terminal illness; and

               -  procedures that corrected systolic dysfunction, such as heart transplantation.
