  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that b2 adrenergic polymorphisms affect b-receptor selectivity in patients
      with heart failure treated with either a b1-selective or a b-nonselective agent. b-2
      polymorphisms may contribute to differing responses to drug treatment with beta-blockers in
      heart failure. Characterizing these polymorphisms may help explain the variability in the
      degree of &quot;selectivity&quot; of action of b-blockers at the b receptor, namely if their action is
      specific for the b-1 or b-2 receptor. Part A was conducted at the University of Utah, and all
      subjects completed study related activities. Part B (sub-study) consists of genotyping of
      blood samples collected in part A, which will be completed at the University of Wisconsin.
      Sub-study (samples and DNA isolation) or Part B entailed analyzing an extra 10 mL of blood
      that was taken for DNA isolation. Genotyping (i.e. determination of genetic makeup) of beta
      adrenergic polymorphisms utilized polymerase chain reaction followed by pyrosequencing.
