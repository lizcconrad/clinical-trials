  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to demonstrate that dapoxetine can prolong intravaginal
      ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared with placebo in men with premature ejaculation (PE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One form of male sexual dysfunction is premature ejaculation (PE), which is also referred to
      as rapid ejaculation (RE). The study consists of 2 phases: pre-randomization phase (a
      screening visit and a 2-week baseline period); 12-week double-blind treatment phase during
      which patients will receive one of 2 doses of dapoxetine or placebo for use on an &quot;as-needed&quot;
      basis. The total duration of the study is approximately 14 weeks. Assessments of
      effectiveness include the average intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (as measured by
      stopwatch) during sexual intercourse, during the treatment period; control over ejaculation,
      participant and partner satisfaction with sexual intercourse, participant overall impression
      of change and severity of symptoms, based on questions asked at monthly intervals through the
      treatment phase. Safety assessments include the incidence, severity, and type of adverse
      events during the study, ECGs, as well as laboratory tests. At the end of the baseline
      period, patients from selected study centers will undergo blood sampling and ECG monitoring
      before and after the first dose of study medication. The study hypothesis is that treatment
      for 12 weeks with dapoxetine prolongs intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, compared with
      placebo, in men with PE. Oral tablets of dapoxetine (30 milligrams [mg] or 60mg) or placebo
      taken as needed during 12 weeks of treatment. No more than 1 dose within a 24-hour period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             least 6 months and plans to maintain this relationship for the duration of the study

          -  history of premature ejaculation in the 6 months before study initiation not due to
             distress, interpersonal difficulty or medication withdrawal

          -  history of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) of &lt; = 2 minutes in at least 3

          -  no history of any medical events that are associated with the development of PE

          -  not taken another investigational drug within 1 month
