  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare children's injury rates (arm fracture, head injury and other
      injuries) when playing on playground equipment on granite sand versus wood fibre playing
      surfaces.

      The hypothesis is that injury rates (arm fracture, head injury and other injuries) among
      school children are equal on granite sand and wood fibre playground surfaces.
