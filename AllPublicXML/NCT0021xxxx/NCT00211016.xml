      The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical response rate of doripenem versus
      comparator in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).

    <textblock>
      Doripenem is an antibiotic medication not yet approved by the US FDA. This is a phase 3,
      multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study of doripenem versus comparator to
      assess the effectiveness and safety of doripenem in the treatment of VAP in adult patients.
      The study consists of screening phase, open-label treatment phase, and follow-up. The
      treatment duration is from 7 to 14 days. The primary endpoint is the clinical response rate
      of doripenem at the early follow-up visit. The patients will receive either doripenem or
      comparator for 7 to 14 days.
