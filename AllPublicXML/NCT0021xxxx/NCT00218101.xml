  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opioids used to treat chronic pain have a high abuse potential. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the effectiveness of buprenorphine in treating opioid dependent individuals who
      abuse opioids that are prescribed for chronic pain.

    <textblock>
      Many individuals who take opioids for chronic pain abuse the opioid medication. Buprenorphine
      is an opioid partial agonist that may be effective in treating individuals who abuse opiate
      pain medication. The purpose of this study is to compare two buprenorphine dosing regimens in
      order to determine which regimen is more effective in reducing opiate pain medication use and
      facilitating successful opioid detoxification.

      This study will last 27 weeks. Participants will receive a maintenance dose of 8 mg of
      buprenorphine for 6 weeks, followed by a dose reduction in 2 mg increments over the course of
      the following 20 weeks. All participants will attend weekly clinical management sessions for
      the duration of the study.
