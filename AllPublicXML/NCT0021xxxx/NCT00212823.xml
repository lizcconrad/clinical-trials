  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of AXERT when treating
      a migraine at the onset of headache pain, as compared to treating a migraine only after the
      headache pain has reached at least moderate intensity..

      AXERT has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of migraine headache with or without
      aura in adults. Early treatment of a migraine headache, independent of headache pain
      intensity symptoms, may provide the optimal therapeutic response. This is a multi-center,
      open label study to test the efficacy (effectiveness) and tolerability of AXERT when treating
      a migraine at the onset of headache pain versus treating a migraine only after the headache
      pain has reached at least moderate intensity. Patients will self-administer 12.5 milligrams
      of AXERT for the treatment of 2 migraine headaches. Centers will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 treatment interventions in which patients will sequentially treat both migraine headaches
      with 12.5 milligrams of AXERT using either the early treatment regimen (ET; ie, at the onset
      of pain) or conditional treatment regimen (CT; ie, after the headache has reached at least
      moderate intensity). Data will be collected regarding treatment response during and after
      each migraine headache. For each headache, patients will record study information and data
      during 3 telephone calls using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) technology. It is
      expected that patients who take 12.5 milligrams of AXERT at the first sign of pain of any
      intensity due to a migraine headache will experience an overall shorter duration of their
      migraine than patients who take AXERT 12.5 mg when their migraine pain has reached at least
      moderate pain intensity. In addition, it is expected that almotriptan malate (AXERT速) is
      generally well-tolerated.

      AXERT 12.5 milligram tablet orally either at the onset of migraine pain (within 1 hour of the
      start of a migraine-ET regimen) or when migraine pain reaches at least moderate intensity (CT
      regimen).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of a confirmed diagnosis of migraine headache with or without aura that meets
             the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria of migraine headache for at least 1
             year

          -  Average frequency of 1 - 6 migraine headaches per month over the past 3 months

          -  History of migraine headaches of at least moderate pain intensity within the past year

          -  If taking a medication for migraine prophylaxis, taking a maintenance dose for at

             study

          -  In generally good health

          -  Capable of taking oral medication, perform study procedures and follow directions
             regarding collection of study information, e.g., subjects must be able and willing to
             read and comprehend written instructions, use a stopwatch, and comprehend and complete
             the telephone requirements, and must be willing to return to the office for a final

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Onset of migraine after age 50

             awakening in the morning

          -  Patients in whom triptans are contraindicated or who have previously discontinued
             AXERT therapy due to adverse events, history of substance abuse, or chronic alcohol
             abuse within the past 6 months
