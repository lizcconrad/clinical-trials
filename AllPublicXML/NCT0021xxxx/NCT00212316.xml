  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and clinical impact of
      15-grams daily of sodium phenylbutyrate (phenylbutyrate) in Huntington's disease and to lay
      the groundwork for possible subsequent trials designed to specifically address its ability to
      slow or halt the progression of the disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting in selective loss of
      neurons in the striatum—an area of the brain that controls movement, balance, and walking—and
      other areas of the brain. The disease is characterized by progressive motor and cognitive
      decline. There is no cure or even plausible treatment to offset the fatal course of the
      disease. Therefore, any treatment that ameliorates the disease would be of enormous
      importance.

      The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study—with open-label follow-up—is to
      determine the safety and tolerability of 15-grams daily of oral phenylbutyrate in people with
      HD. The study will enroll 60 individuals. Eligible participants will be initially randomized
      to receive either phenylbutyrate or the matching placebo for 4 weeks.

      After the placebo-controlled phase, all participants will enter the open-label phase to
      receive phenylbutyrate for 12 weeks. Participants will be followed for one month off
      phenylbutyrate.

      This combination of a short-term double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a longer
      open-label phase will favor the primary goals of detecting toxicity and intolerability while
      facilitating recruitment and maximizing number of subjects on study drug.
