  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the study were to assess the safety and acceptability of PC-515 when
      applied vaginally at least three times weekly for 12 months. Secondary aims were to gather
      preliminary data on Carraguard's effectiveness in preventing male-to-female transmission of
      HIV, and other STIs.

      The hypothesis was that Carraguard would cause little or no significant irritation, including
      lesions; and that women would find Carraguard acceptable. The study was not powered to
      determine effectiveness, but based on safety, acceptability and feasibility parameters, the
      outcome of the Phase 2 trial would enable a decision whether or not to proceed to a Phase 3
      trial.

      Carraguard™ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial fielded in one site in Chiang Rai,
      northern Thailand. The primary aims of the study were to assess Carraguard's safety
      (toxicity) - including signs of local irritation, such as itching or burning; changes in
      vaginal flora; and incidence of abnormal external genital, vaginal, and cervical findings -
      when applied vaginally for 12 months; to evaluate acceptability; to assess feasibility of
      conducting a large scale microbicide trial in a non-sex worker population; to gauge women's
      reactions to a non-contraceptive microbicide; and to explore microbicide use dynamics in a
      Thai population.

      Secondary aims were to investigate HIV infections averted (preliminary indications); other
      sexually transmitted infections averted - including C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T.
      vaginalis, and T. pallidum (preliminary indications); and effect on cervical cytology.
