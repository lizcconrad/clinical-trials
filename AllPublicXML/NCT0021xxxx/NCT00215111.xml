  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that a low-carbohydrate diet and a
      low-glycemic load diet will improve body mass index and result in more body fat loss than a
      control diet among overweight children ages 7 to 12. In addition this study is also designed
      to test the safety of diets with modified carbohydrate content as compared to a conventional
      weight management diet among younger overweight children.

      The treatment of pediatric obesity supported by the medical community is a moderate
      restriction in calories by modifying intake of fat and simple sugars, along with an increase
      in energy expenditure through more physical activity. However, this approach is associated
      with only limited success. As a result, overweight children and adolescents are seeking
      alternative approaches to weight management, such as diets that modify the type and amount of
      carbohydrates. However, at this time there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of
      these diets, particularly with younger children. This study is a controlled clinical trial
      that compares the safety and efficacy of a low carbohydrate and reduced glycemic load diets
      to a more standard dietary intervention for the management of pediatric obesity (i.e.
      portion-controlled, moderate fat, high carbohydrate diet). This study will involve 150
      overweight children (ages 7 to 12) who will be randomly assigned to one of the three diet
      groups for 12 months. The effects of each diet will be determined by measuring changes in
      anthropometric measures (body weight, height, body mass index, waist circumference, body
      composition), other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, fasting lipid profile,
      fasting glucose and insulin, and inflammatory markers of cardiovascular disease), and
      measures of psychological well-being and mental status. The results of this study will
      provide needed information to the public in their quest for safe, effective, and
      health-promoting weight management strategies for obese children. Such information is vital
      if we are to address the obesity epidemic in the United States.
