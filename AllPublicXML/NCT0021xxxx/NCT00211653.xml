      The purpose of this study is to determine if Acetylcysteine is effective in preventing renal
      failure associated with cardiac surgery

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative renal dysfunction is a predictor of significant morbidity and mortality among
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The mortality associated with coronary artery by-pass
      surgery increases from 2% to almost 19% in patients with renal failure and approaches 60% in
      patients who require hemodialysis. Patients with preoperative renal dysfunction referred for
      coronary artery by pass surgery have an extraordinarily high risk of requiring postoperative
      dialysis. For example, among those patients with preoperative creatinine &gt;2.5 mg/dL, almost
      50% require hemodialysis.

      Comparison: N-Acetylcysteine is superior to placebo in preventing renal failure after cardiac
      surgery
