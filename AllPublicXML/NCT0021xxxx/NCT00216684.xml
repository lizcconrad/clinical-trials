  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness, and safety in Japanese patients
      with chronic intractable pain after 4-week medication of fentanyl transdermal matrix patches
      containing either 12.5 mcg/hr, 25 mcg/hr, 50 mcg/hr, 75 mcg/hr, or 100 mcg/hr, who have been
      switched from existing formulations, such as codeine, morphine hydrochloride, or fentanyl
      injectable. Furthermore, the safety and effectiveness of long term treatment such as 48 weeks
      are to be assessed, if possible.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fentanyl transdermal matrix patch is a narcotic analgesic agent. Compared with the existing
      reservoir-type Durotep® Patch, fentanyl transdermal matrix patch is not liable to leakage of
      drug solution and does not contain alcohol, which becomes a cause of skin irritation. Also
      this new formulation has become available in a smaller dose of 12.5mg/hr while the smallest
      Durotep® Patch is 25mg/hr. While Durotep® Patch is currently indicated only for cancer pain
      in Japan, this clinical trial was planned to assess effectiveness, and safety of fentanyl
      transdermal matrix patch in Japanese patients with chronic intractable pain receiving
      codeine, morphine hydrochloride, or fentanyl injectable formulations. After pre-treatment
      period for seven to fourteen days for evaluating the eligibility of the patients for the
      study, patients will be treated for 4 weeks as Treatment period 1 and 48 weeks as Treatment
      period 2 followed by 3-day post-treatment observation period. One patch can be used for 72
      hours, which is the same as the existing Patch. Starting from the first day of treatment,
      fentanyl will be applied to the chest, the upper arm or other appropriate site, which will be
      replaced with a new patch every three days (ca. 72 hr). Starting dose should be between 12.5
      mcg/hr and 75 mcg/hr, depending on the prior opioid dose.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic intractable pain receiving any of the following treatments
             :(1)Codeine phosphate, (2)Morphine hydrochloride preparations equivalent to less than
             315 mg/day of oral morphine, (3)Fentanyl citrate injectable solution equivalent to
             less than 0.3 mg/day

          -  Patients with chronic intractable pain in whom lesions causative of pain cannot be

             of the existing medication

          -  Patients may be hospitalized during application of the initial transdermal dose of
             fentanyl transdermal matrix patches (patients may be ambulatory when the study
             starts).

          -  Patients with concurrent liver and/or kidney dysfunction according to the latest
             laboratory test values within 14 days before the start of the pre-treatment
             observation period

          -  Patients with organic brain disorder such as elevated intracranial pressure,
             disturbance of consciousness/coma, or brain tumor
