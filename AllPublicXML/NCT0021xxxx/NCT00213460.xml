  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel involvement is still recognized to be associated with great morbidity and
      mortality in SSc patients, leading particularly to malabsorption and intestinal
      pseudo-obstruction. Intestinal disorders directly related to SSc have, in fact, been reported
      to be one of the most common causes of death.

      In a previous prospective study, we have demonstrated the high prevalence of small intestinal
      involvement in SSc patients, using upper intestinal manometry; in turn, 88% of our SSc
      patients had upper intestinal motor disturbances. However, to date, no authors have yet
      analyzed the course of upper intestinal motor dysfunction in SSc.

      The aims of this study were therefore to assess the 5-year course of small bowel motor
      disorders, using manometry in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), and to investigate for
      an association between upper intestinal motor dysfunction outcome and other clinical
      manifestations of SSc.
