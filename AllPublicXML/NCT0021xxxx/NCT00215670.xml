  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to characterize the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of pegaptanib when given as 1 or 3mg/eye intravitreous injections every 6
      weeks for 54 weeks in patients with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to
      AMD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Best corrected visual acuity in the study eye between 20/40 and 20/320 and better or equal
        to 20/800 in the fellow eye.

        Subfoveal CNV, secondary to AMD, w/ a total lesion size [including blood, scar/atrophy &amp;
        neovascularization] of less than or equal to 12 disc areas, of which at least 50% must be
        active CNV.

        Patients of either sex, aged greater than or equal to 50 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Previous subfoveal thermal laser therapy. Any subfoveal scarring or atrophy &amp; no more than
        25% of the total lesion size may be made up of scarring or atrophy.

        More than one prior PDT w/ Visudyne is not permitted. Pts may not have rec'd their 1st PDT
        w/in less than 8 wks or more than 13 wks prior to the BSL angiography/photography for the
        study.
