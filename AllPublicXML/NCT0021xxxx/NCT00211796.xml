  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      12-week open label treatment trial of divalproex sodium extended release (Depakote ER) in 10
      patients with a diagnosis of autism. Our objective is to determine how well these patients
      can tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex
      sodium ER.

      Based on positive research with divalproex in children/adolescents with autism, we would like
      to extend this research to autistic adults with high levels of aggression, irritability,
      affective instability, or agitation. We aim to have 10 adult autistic patients enrolled in
      our study of the treatment of aggression/irritability with divalproex sodium ER. This will be
      an open treatment for adult patients to determine if the tolerability of divalproex sodium is
      better with the extended release. We propose this open label design because previous
      double-blinded studies of divalproex sodium were only done in children, not adults. These
      results will serve as pilot data for a future blinded study for autistic adults with the
      extended release formulation. This naturalistic design will allow for prior stable (3 months)
      use of concomitant medications. Our objective is to determine how well these patients can
      tolerate the prescribed doses and what added benefits can be attributed to divalproex sodium
      ER.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Meet DSM-IV, ADI, or ADOS criteria for autism spectrum disorder. 2. Age 18-65. 3.
             Be seen as outpatients 4. Demonstrate capacity to provide authorized informed consent
             or provide consent for participation by an approved surrogate on the autistic
             individual’s behalf 5. Sexually active females of childbearing potential must use an
             acceptable method of birth control and have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to
             entry into the study.

             6. Score at least “4” (moderately ill) on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity
             Scale for Autistic Disorder (CGI-AD).

             7. Subject meets the following criteria at pre-study diagnostic assessment and
             baseline assessment: OAS-M  6 (raw scores).

             8. Subjects on a stable dose of their current psychotropic medication for at least 3
             months before entering the study, with the understanding that they must remain on a
             stable dose throughout the trial. If a subject chooses to taper off their current
             medications, they will be closely monitored by the study psychiatrist and must be
             medication free for 2 weeks prior to beginning the study. Additionally, if a subject
             is currently taking a medication with a known drug interaction with Divalproex Sodium,
             he/she will be tapered off of that medication under the supervision of the study
             psychiatrist before undergoing treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing mothers. Sexually active women of childbearing
             potential who are not using adequate birth control measures.

             2. Subjects with active or unstable epilepsy. 3. Subjects with any of the following

                  anticonvulsant medication other than divalproex sodium or related formulations
                  (e.g., depakene) may participate, along with non-medicated subjects with a
                  history of seizures who have been seizure-free for 6 months. Subjects with
                  abnormal EEG but no clinical seizures are also eligible.

                  8. Treatment within the previous 30 days with any drug known to a well-defined
