  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that children listed to undergo solid organ transplant will experience (at the
      very most) a low rate (&lt; 5%) of serious vaccine-related adverse events within 42 days after
      immunization with live attenuated Oka/Merck varicella vaccine (VARIVAX™). We also hypothesize
      that the immunogenicity of two doses of VARIVAX™ in the study population will be similar to
      historical data in healthy subjects and that the efficacy of two doses of the vaccine in the
      study population will be similar to that of healthy subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children &gt; 9 months of age and adolescents &lt; 18 years of age.

          -  Pediatric transplant candidates who are in any of the following categories:

               1. listed to receive kidney, liver, heart, lung or other or solid organ
                  transplantation in a Canadian transplant centre

               2. not yet officially listed, but are regarded by their physicians as transplant
                  candidates by virtue of their underlying diseases

          -  No clinical history for varicella.

          -  Seronegative for antibodies to VZV except infants 9 - 12 months of age who may be
             seropositive due to maternal antibodies.

          -  Informed consent obtained

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous immunization with varicella vaccine.

          -  Any established immune deficiency (underlying disease or drug induced) or any
             neoplastic disease

          -  Children on any oral and / or intravenous steroids within 3 months prior to
             immunization. Children on inhaled corticosteroids in excess of 800 mcg of
             beclomethasone dipropionate ( or equivalent ) per day.

          -  Any exposure to varicella or herpes zoster in the previous 4 weeks involving
             household, playmate or hospital contacts.

          -  Inability to delay the transplantation for up to 6 weeks following the last varicella
             immunization.

          -  Presence of a person at increased risk for varicella infection in direct and
             unavoidable proximity with the vaccinees ( e.g. an immunocompromised sibling)

          -  Past history of varicella or known positive antibody titer for varicella except
             infants 9 - 12 months of ages who may be seropositive due to maternal antibodies

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the vaccine, including neomycin and
             gelatin

          -  Patients whose mothers are known to be seronegative and plan to become pregnant in the
             subsequent three months

          -  Administration of VZIG or any other blood products in the previous six weeks (packed
             red blood cells excepted).

          -  Any significant infection and/or fever at the time of vaccination

          -  Any patient receiving or planning to receive salicylates in the six weeks after
             immunization

          -  Any patient who has received any live vaccine for 6 weeks or killed vaccine for 2
             weeks prior to or after the scheduled VARIVAX™ vaccination.
