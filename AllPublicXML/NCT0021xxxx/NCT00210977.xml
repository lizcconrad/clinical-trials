  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the presence of anti erythropoietin antibodies (anti
      EPO Ab) in participants responding to any erythropoietin receptor agonist (ERA) therapy to
      treat or prevent anemia without loss of effectiveness to see if they will develop pure red
      cell aplasia or loss of effectiveness to recombinant erythropoietin and to measure the
      duration of effectiveness of ERA therapy.

      This is an observational (study in which the investigators/physicians observe the
      participant's data and measure their outcomes), international, multicenter (study conducted
      at multiple sites), cohort (group of individuals with similar characteristics) study. The
      study consists of prestudy phase, observational phase (2 years), and follow-up phase (1
      year). Approximately 50 participants who already receiving ERA therapy for anemia will be
      observed in this study. In the observational phase, participants' erythropoietin antibody
      status (positive or negative), clinical progress, treatment for anemia or prevention of
      anemia, and outcome will be monitored. During this study, enrolled participants will continue
      to receive standard-of-care treatment for their disease from their individual investigators
      as before enrollment to this study. Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse
      events which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be
      3 years.

    <description>An antibody is a large Y-shaped protein secreted into the blood and is used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria and viruses.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving any ERA therapy for any cause of anemia and having responded to the ERA
             therapy for at least 3 months

             radioimmunoprecipitation

          -  Maintained a stable hemoglobin within a 3-month period that has not decreased more
             than 2 g/dL in any 1-month period and with no increase in red blood cell transfusion
             requirement

          -  An ERA maintenance dose that has not increased more than 50 percentages from initial
             effective dose
