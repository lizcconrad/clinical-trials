      The aim of the study is to determine whether a low-cost home-based training programme can
      maintain the achieved effect of physical training on exercise capacity and QOL in patients

    <textblock>
      Guidelines recommend physical training in the treatment of patients with CHF. Several studies
      have demonstrated that even short-term training programmes can increase maximal oxygen
      intake, improve muscular strength, reduce neurohumoral activity and result in other effects,
      which are of potential benefit. Following 2-3 months training at 70 – 80% of maximal
      capacity, improved exercise capacity and oxygen uptake due to increased cardiac output and
      also better oxygen uptake in the peripheral muscles have been demonstrated. Moreover, studies
      have indicated an improvement of the quality of life (QOL). However, the effects of exercise
      training are rapidly lost without maintenance. Thus the crucial question is to identify a
      method to sustain the physical activity outside an expensive, enthusiastic and highly
      motivating protocol.

      The aim of the study is to determine whether a low-cost home-based training programme can
      maintain the achieved effect of physical training on exercise capacity and QOL in patients
      with Chronic Heart Failure.

      Comparison:

      Patients fulfilling specified criteria for Chronic Heart Failure are randomised to either
      eight weeks with supervised group-based training (1.5 hrs.) twice a week followed by
      home-based training according to a specified protocol with supervised group-based training
      every 2 weeks (1,5 hrs), or to eight weeks with supervised training followed by usual care.
      During the whole period patients in both groups can contact the Heart Failure Clinic when
      needed.

          2. Hæmodynamically significant valve insufficiency

          3. Recent Myocardial infarction (8 weeks)

          4. Significant arrythmia at exercise testing (NSVT, VT, VF or SVT with ventricular action
             &gt;150)

          5. Significant ischaemia or angina at low strain(£ 50 W)

         10. Lack of informed consent

         11. If the patient cannot train in a team supervised by only one physiotherapist, e.g. due
             to poor balance, the patient can be excluded within the first two weeks of inclusion.
