    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of individualized doses
      (50 to 200 milligrams) of topiramate tablets compared against placebo for the prevention of
      chronic migraine headaches over a period of 16 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that topiramate is effective in preventing chronic migraine
      headaches. This study will start with a 4-week baseline period in which no treatment is
      given, followed by a 12-week period in which each patient's dose is adjusted and then kept
      stable for the last 4 weeks of the 16-week double-blind phase. The individualized dose will
      start at 25 milligrams of topiramate per day and will be increased 25 milligrams per day once
      weekly and then raised to either the target--100 milligrams per day--or the maximum dose that
      is well tolerated up to 200 milligrams per day. Patients who are randomized to receive
      topiramate will remain on the optimized dose. The comparison phase of the study is a 16-week
      period in which the change in migraine days of patients on topiramate (taking at least 50
      milligrams per day) is compared with the change in migraine days for patients on the placebo.
      Also studied will be the patients' health-related quality of life as assessed by
      questionnaires filled out at specific visits as well as the patients' views of the safety and
      tolerability of topiramate. The study hypothesis is that the number of migraine days,
      periods, and attacks from the baseline period to the last 4 weeks in the double-blind period
      is reduced more in the topiramate group than the placebo group. During the 16-week comparison
      period, patients will take by mouth a dose of 50 milligrams to 200 milligrams of topiramate
      daily.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  History of migraine for &gt;= 1 year

          -  Headache type meets HIS (International Headache Society) criteria for migraine

          -  History reflects &quot;chronic&quot; headache--an average of &gt;= 15 migraine days per month in
             the 3 months preceding trial entry

          -  History of chronic migraine for &gt;=1 year&gt;=15 headaches per month with an average
             duration of 4 hours if not treated

          -  Patient is otherwise neurologically and physically healthy on a pre-trial exam.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any other type of chronic headache (besides migraine) from section 2 to 13 of the
             International Headache Society classification or headache resulting directly resulting
             some other factor (except for medication overuse)

          -  Onset of migraine after age 50

          -  Use of an anticonvulsant drug in the month prior to trial entry

          -  Use of an antidepressant unless dose has been used at a stable dose for &gt;=3 months

          -  Use of migraine prevention medicine in the 3 months prior to trial entry unless the
             drug has been used for at least 3 months and used at a stable dose for at least a
             month

          -  Use of a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide (used to treat high blood
             pressure, glaucoma and seizures) or triamterene (a &quot;water pill&quot; for swelling and high
             blood pressure).
