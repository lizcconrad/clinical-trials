  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) is now a major therapeutic option to manage patients with acute
      hypercapnic respiratory failure (AHRF). Otherwise, patient-ventilator interfaces are
      determinant to get an optimal NIV efficacy in parallel with ventilatory comfort.

      Facial masks during NIV are associated with deleterious consequences like gas leaks around
      the mask, skin breakdown (especially on the nasal bridge), claustrophobia and mask
      discomfort. In order to limit these side effects, a cephalic interface has been recently
      designed. Cephalic mask covers the whole anterior surface of the face and excessive mask fit
      pressure is therefore spread over a larger surface outside the nose area. However, this mask
      has a high volume that may interfere with NIV efficacy and may also induce claustrophobic
      sensations.

      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy and tolerance of a cephalic mask
      versus a conventional oronasal mask during AHRF.
