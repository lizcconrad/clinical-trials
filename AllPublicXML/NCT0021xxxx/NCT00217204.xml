  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PANCREASE MT
      (pancrelipase microtablets) to improve steatorrhea (excessive excretion of fat in feces) in
      infants and toddlers with cystic fibrosis who have pancreatic insufficiency, and to assess
      whether the consistency of the microtablets is acceptable for swallowing in infants and
      toddlers

      The objective of this randomized, Investigator-blinded, parallel group, multicenter, pilot
      study is to evaluate the preliminary safety, palatability and effectiveness of pancrelipase
      microtablets to improve fat absorption. The hypothesis is that PANCREASE MT will provide
      effective, safe and palatable pancreatic enzyme supplementation to be used for the treatment
      of fat malabsorption in a cohort of infants with cystic fibrosis-related pancreatic
      insufficiency. On Day 1 of the study, parents will be instructed to administer 500 units
      lipase/kg/meal for a full five days. Stool will be collected and analyzed during the last 72
      hours of this baseline period. On Day 6 of the study, subjects will be randomly assigned to
      one of four treatment groups. Parents will be instructed to administer the appropriate dose
      for a full five days and stool will be collected and analyzed during the last 72 hours of
      this randomized treatment period. Patients will receive PANCREASE MT 500 units lipase/kg/meal
      by mouth for a maximum of five doses per day for the first 120 hours. Patients will receive
      PANCREASE MT 500, 1000, 1500 or 2000 units lipase/kg/meal by mouth, for a maximum of five
      meals per day for the next 120 hours.
