    <textblock>
      Stress is one of the more common reasons cited by addicts for continual drug use and relapse.
      Treatment approaches that target both drug-induced and stress-induced relapse may prove to be
      more beneficial than targeting drug-induced relapse alone. Lofexidine is a drug that reduces
      the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal and may prove to have stress-reducing capabilites
      in drug addicts. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal safe dose of
      lofexidine tolerated in naltrexone-treated heroin addicts and to find an optimal lofexidine
      induction schedule.

      Stress is one of the more common reasons cited by addicts for continual drug use and relapse.
      Naltrexone treatment of opiate addicts suffers from high rates of drop-out and relapse. This
      may be a result of naltrexone's inability to reduce symptoms of stress during early recovery.
      Treatment approaches that target both drug-induced and stress-induced relapse may prove to be
      more beneficial than targeting drug-induced relapse alone. Lofexidine is a drug that reduces
      the physical symptoms of opiate withdrawal and may prove to have stress-reducing
      capabilities. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximal safe dose of lofexidine
      tolerated in naltrexone-treated opiate addicts and to find an optimal lofexidine induction
      schedule. The study will also assess any side effects that occur during a discontinuation
      phase of lofexidine.

      This pilot study will last a total of 8 weeks. Recently detoxified opiate dependent
      participants who are eligible for naltrexone treatment will enter a 4-week single-blind dose
      tolerability phase, during which participants will receive naltrexone and 1 of 3 twice-daily
      lofexidine induction schedules. All participants will be required to remain in the clinic for
      2 hours immediately following dosing in order to monitor vital signs and side effects. Study
      visits will occur three times each week, at which time naltrexone medication for
      self-administration will be handed out and participants will be evaluated in terms of
      tolerability to treatment. After the 4 weeks of treatment, a double-blind lofexidine
      detoxification phase using a 5-day taper will occur. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to one of two maintenance-taper schedules. The first group will undergo a 5-day tapering,
      followed by a placebo for three weeks, followed by a 5-day tapering during Week 4. Withdrawal
      symptoms and side effects will be evaluated.
