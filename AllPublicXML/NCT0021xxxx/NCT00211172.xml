  <brief_summary>

      The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of direct-to-patient mailings
      designed to increase patient's adherence to prescribed beta-blockers following an acute
      myocardial infarction (AMI).

      Prior to developing patient materials, focus groups were conducted with patient who had
      previously suffered an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to identify the issues and
      information that patients felt were important to include in our materials as well as the best
      way to present the information. Additionally, patient materials were &quot;pre-tested&quot; with AMI
      patients to ensure that the materials were clear and easy to read and that the key messages
      were understood.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Assess the persistence of beta blocker use for post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI)
           patients following a direct to patient intervention designed to increase rates of
           evidence-based long-term use of medications (beta blockers, lipid lowering agents,
           aspirin and ACE inhibitors) that increase survival following AMI.

        2. Describe patient and system characteristics associated with differences in impact of the
           intervention

      Research Design and Methods:

      We will conduct a randomized controlled trial within the 4 participating HMOs (Kaiser
      Permanente Northwest, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Health Partners, and Kaiser Permanente
      Georgia). Inpatient data will be used to identify patients with a primary discharge diagnosis
      of AMI 4-6 months before the extraction date. Practices will be block-randomized to the
      intervention group or to usual care. To increase repetition of the message, there will be two
      personalized mailings, occurring at 4-6 months post AMI, and at 9 months. The first message
      will include elements in the table below, and the repeat message will be shorter, but include
      similar information. The message will come from the patient's own health plan with the choice
      of specific individual (e.g. quality assurance department, medical director, or Chief of
      Cardiology) being informed by our qualitative work. This intervention will be done in
      collaboration with the cardiovascular care committees and quality assurance departments of
      participating Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs).

            <description>The intervention consisted of 2 mailed communications. A personalized letter was mailed first, followed approximately 2 months later by a similar letter and an accompanying brochure. Both mailings also included a wallet card that suggested questions for the patient to ask their clinician, space to list their medications, and space to record additional queries. The communications contained nearly identical information, stressing the importance of lifetime use of beta-blockers following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and that adverse effects can be managed and the importance of remembering to refill their prescription. They also included a brief mention of other therapies (statins, ACE inhibitors [ACEIs], and aspirin).</description>

          <description>The primary outcome measure adherence to B-blocker therapy post intervention. Adherence was measured by the degree of prescription filling in an interval derived from pharmacy prescription records by constructing a proportion-of-days-covered per-month measure, using the quantity dispensed and days supplied from each prescription</description>
