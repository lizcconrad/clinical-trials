  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that defecatory disorders can be described in mechanical terms which would
      allow a mechanistic description of disorders which would in turn allow better directed
      biofeedback mechanisms to treat disorders of defecation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disorders of defecation are very common and the process of defecation remains poorly
      described. This results in a limited approach to treatment of patients, with limited success.
      This study will simultaneously measure multiple components of the process of defecation - the
      abdominal wall and perineal muscle activity, the pressure within the rectum and in the anal
      canal and the change in shape of the anorectal region of the colon, in order to develop a
      biomechanical model which can describe the normal and abnormal defecatory process. It is
      anticipated that, by understanding the process in these terms will allow a new approach to
      categorizing and describing defecation problems which in turn will lead to more specific
      approaches of treatment which will be tailored to individual patients. These parameters will
      compared in volunteers with no defecatory disorders and patients with defecatory disorders
      who are being referred for defecography as part of their clinical evaluation.
