    <textblock>
      Radiation retinopathy is a disease of the retina. It occurs in people who have received or
      been exposed to radiation near the eyes. The blood vessels are abnormal and may grow which
      lead to scarring and a loss of central vision. Currently, the treatment for radiation
      retinopathy is laser photocoagulation. This treatment has been found to have limited use in
      this type of condition. Compassionate use of anecortave acetate injection is being considered
      to prevent the growth of the blood vessels under the retina.

      Patients will receive an injection of 15 mg of Anecortave acetate behind the eye to be
      treated (&quot;study eye&quot;). They will be evaluated every six months to determine if their
      condition is stable or worse. Following the injection of study medication, patients will not
      be required to come in to see the study physician. The investigator or study staff will call
      the patients on the day following injection to make sure there were no adverse effects to the
      injection. Patients will then come in for a Month 1 and a Month 3 follow-up visit. At the
      Month 3 follow-up visit, if patients are not showing stability or improvement, they may be
      offered either thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy. They will remain in the study and
      remain eligible for a repeat injection of Anecortave Acetate at the Month 6 visit.

      Patients will then been seen at Month 6 for a Re-treatment Evaluation Visit. If their
      condition is stable, they will be offered re-injection with the same study medication they
      received earlier. If Patients are not showing stability or improvement at the Month 6 visit,
      they may be offered thermal laser or Photodynamic Therapy in conjunction with the Anecortave
      Acetate injection.

      Patients will then come back again for a Month 1 and a Month 3 visit and an Exit Visit, if
      necessary. If the patient's condition is worse, patients will be exited from this study and
      offered standard treatment.
