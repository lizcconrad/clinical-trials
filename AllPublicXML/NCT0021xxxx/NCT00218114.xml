  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of divalproex sodium (Depakote)
      versus placebo in treating disruptive behavior disorder and explosive tempers in adolescents
      and adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disruptive behavior disorders among children and adolescents are readily diagnosed; however,
      few individuals with such disorders receive drug treatment. Depakote is a mood stabilizing
      medication that may be beneficial in treating individuals with disruptive behavior disorders.
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of Depakote in reducing temper
      outbursts and improving mood in individuals with disruptive behavior disorders. In addition,
      this study will determine the safety and effectiveness of Depakote in treating individuals
      with substance disorders who also have disruptive behavior disorders.

      This study will last 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive treatment
      with Depakote or placebo. Medication will be given in a single evening dose if tolerated;
      otherwise, medication will be given twice per day. Participants will be assigned to a
      fixed-flexible dosing schedule and dosages will increase based on weight. All participants
      will attend weekly psychotherapy and family counseling sessions throughout the study.
      Participants who are substance abusers will also receive substance abuse counseling. Weekly
      study visits will include a physical exam, blood collection, and drug tests. Teachers and
      guidance counselors will be contacted to assess the participant's behavior from week to week.
      Some participants will complete a follow-up study, in which they will take part in phone
      interviews.

    <description>Divalproex sodium (Depakote). This is a parallel groups design lasting a total of six weeks. Participants will be on a fixed-flexible dosing schedule. The dose of depakote will be raised to 750mgs or 1000mgs, depending on weight, in two weeks to achieve blood levels between 50-130 micrograms per milliliter. If a patient does not achieve this blood level on 750mgs or 1000 mgs, the dose may be raised during the second week.</description>
