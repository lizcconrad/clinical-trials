      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of combining juxtasclerally administered
      anecortave acetate 15 mg with triamcinolone acetate 4 mg administered intravitreally
      following photodynamic therapy with verteporfin for the treatment of exudative age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A male or female with evidence of exudative age-related macular degeneration with
             clinical/angiographic/optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings of subfoveal
             choroidal neovascularization (CNV) which has not responded to current therapy

          2. Baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 20/40 to 20/640

          3. Patient must be willing and able to comply with the protocol and provide informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients on intravenous, subcutaneous, or anticoagulant therapy (with the exception of
             aspirin and antiplatelet therapy) and cannot take a 5 day holiday from therapy prior
             to the injection procedure. Note: Patients on oral anticoagulant therapy may be
             considered to participate if the physician responsible for monitoring the
             anticoagulant therapy agrees that the patient may take a 5 day holiday from therapy
             prior to each anecortave injection. The attending doctor must notify the principal
             investigator and this notification will be made part of the source documentation.
             Anticoagulant therapy may resume either the evening of or the morning after the
             injection procedure.

          2. Patient with known glaucoma or steroid induced ocular hypertension

          3. Intraocular pressures of 21 mmHg or greater at time of entry into the study

          4. Patient with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to
             concomitant ocular conditions

          5. Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery within last 2 months or capsulotomy
             within last month in study eye

          6. Patient participating in any other investigational drug study

          7. Inability to obtain photographs to document CNV (including difficulty with venous
             access)

          8. Concomitant oral steroids or topical ophthalmic steroid use

          9. Sub-Tenon's injection of steroids within the past 6 months

         10. Patient with significant liver disease or uremia

         11. Patient with known adverse reaction to indocyanine green, iodine, verteporfin, or
             triamcinolone

         12. Patient is pregnant or nursing

         13. Age less than 50 years old
