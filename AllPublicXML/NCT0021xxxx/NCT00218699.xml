      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a single specialized pre-test counseling
      session in reducing HIV infection risk behavior in men who are not HIV infected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In San Francisco, HIV infection rates among men who have tested for HIV three or more times
      is almost triple the HIV infection rates of all other testers. Past research has shown that
      HIV uninfected gay and bisexual men who receive counseling are less likely to engage in
      high-risk sexual behavior. Counseling provided by trained mental health professionals within
      a clinical study setting helped individuals identify and re-evaluate their
      &quot;self-justifications,&quot; which are their thoughts, attitudes, and beliefs when deciding to
      engage in unprotected sex. This study will focus on implementing a &quot;real-world&quot; counseling
      intervention designed specifically for men who are at the greatest risk of becoming infected
      with HIV: men who engage in high-risk sexual activity with other men and who repeatedly test
      for HIV. This specialized intervention will be administered by trained paraprofessional
      counselors during a pre-test counseling session prior to an HIV test. The purpose of this
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the specialized pre-test counseling intervention
      versus a standard pre-test counseling intervention in promoting safer sexual activity among
      HIV uninfected men. The men will have reported having unprotected sex with males of unknown
      HIV status or known HIV infection.

      This 12-month study will enroll 300 men who will be recruited upon scheduling an anonymous
      HIV test at the participating clinic. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive
      either the enhanced pre-test counseling session or a standard pre-test counseling session
      prior to an HIV test. Outcome measurements will be assessed 6 and 12 months after the
      counseling session and will include self-reports of unprotected anal sex with non-primary
      partners and reported satisfaction levels with the pre-test counseling.
