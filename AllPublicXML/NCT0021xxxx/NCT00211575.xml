  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study was designed to help improve the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in
      young children. An interventional strategy using a scoring system based on risk factors and
      symptoms/episodes was tested to determine its ability to identify children likely to benefit
      from induction of asthma controller therapy at an early age. The score was derived through
      completion of a survey instrument referred to as the asthma risk questionnaire (ARQ). The
      utility of the ARQ along with the health care utilization and use of controller therapy for
      respiratory illnesses within one year were examined.
