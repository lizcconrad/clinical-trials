  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to conduct a randomized dose-ranging study to evaluate the
      safety and activity of orally administered low dose interferon alfa-n3 as an antiviral and
      immunomodulator in asymptomatic subjects with recent exposure to a person with severe acute
      respiratory syndrome (SARS) or possible SARS. The primary objective of this pilot study is to
      determine an Alferon LDO dose level that increases or upregulates genes known to be mediators
      of interferon response. Secondary endpoints include the development of SARS symptomatology,
      rate of hospitalization, and mortality rate. In the event that no subjects with recent
      exposure to a person with SARS or possible SARS are available, this study will be conducted
      with 10 normal volunteers.

      This study will be an open-label, randomized, outpatient study in subjects potentially
      infected with the SARS-CoV (SARS-associated coronavirus) or normal volunteers using two dose
      levels of LDO interferon.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive Alferon® LDO (natural interferon alfa-n3) in a buffer
      solution once each day for 10 consecutive days at doses equal to 650 IU or 1300 IU/day.

      Pretherapy baseline evaluations will be performed prior to randomization.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to each dose level, and both dosage levels will be started
      concurrently. Drug will be dispensed for a ten day treatment period, during which time any
      clinical symptoms and adverse events will be evaluated. Laboratory samples (2.5 ml blood) for
      microarray analysis evaluations will be made twice during baseline and 12-14 hours following
      doses 1, 5, and 10 on study days 2, 6, and 11, respectively.

      The conduct of this study will comply with International Conference on Harmonisation - Good
      Clinical Practice (ICH - GCP) and the 1996 or later version of the Declaration of Helsinki.
