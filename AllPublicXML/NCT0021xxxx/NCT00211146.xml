  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients
      receiving a perisurgical regimen of epoetin alfa (PROCRITÂ®) as compared to patients
      receiving standard of care blood conservation management.

      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that there is no clinically important additional
      risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in adult spine surgery using a perisurgical regimen of
      epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) versus the standard of care for blood conservation. Spine surgery was
      selected as the population to study because anti-coagulant therapy is not always administered
      in association with this surgery type. In addition, the efficacy of epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®)
      in protecting patients from receiving allogeneic red cell transfusion across adult spinal
      procedures will be studied. Patients scheduled for elective spinal surgery, who agree to
      participate in the study, and meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to epoetin
      alfa (PROCRIT®) or standard of care. No perioperative anti-coagulation therapy is to be
      administered during the study. The study hypothesis is that there is no increased risk of DVT
      in patients receiving perisurgical epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®) treatment. Epoetin alfa (PROCRIT®)
      600U/kg administered once per week for 3 weeks prior to surgery and on the day of surgery.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects scheduled for elective spinal surgery (with a minimum of 3-weeks lead time)
             with significant anticipated perioperative blood loss (2-4 units of blood)

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;10 and &lt; 13 g/dL at screening

          -  Female subjects must be post menopausal for at least one year, surgically incapable of
             childbearing (hysterectomy or tubal ligation), or practicing an acceptable method of
             birth control (e.g., hormonal contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or barrier and
             spermicide). The subject should continue with the same method for the duration of the
             study. If a female subject is practicing an acceptable method of birth control, she
             must have maintained her normal menstrual pattern within the three months prior to
             study entry

          -  No clinically significant abnormal hematologic or serum chemistry values. Negative
             serum pregnancy test for female subjects not post menopausal for at least one year or
             surgically incapable of childbearing (hysterectomy or tubal ligation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No primary hematologic disease

          -  No clinically significant disease/dysfunction of the cardiovascular (NYHA
             Classification Class II-IV), neurologic (cerebral), pulmonary, endocrine,
             gastrointestinal, or genitourinary systems, which in the opinion of the investigator
             would put the subject at increased risk for a thrombovascular event, compromise the
             subject's ability to respond to r-HuEPO therapy, or otherwise impair their ability to
             participate in this study

          -  No history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE)

          -  No subjects who are to receive perioperative pharmacologic anticoagulation (e.g.,
             coumadin, heparin, lovenox, aspirin/ASA)

          -  No subjects prohibited from receiving blood transfusions
