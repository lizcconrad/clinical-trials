  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long-term working hypothesis is that if 3-D radiation is combined with the effect of
      capecitabine one hopes to see improved and durable tumor response and survival with
      acceptable toxicity. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      capecitabine used along with 3-D conformal radiation therapy.

      Capecitabine will be taken by mouth each day of radiation. The total daily dose should be
      taken as two divided doses approximately 12 hours apart, within 30 minutes after eating,
      ideally after breakfast and the evening meal. The overall total number of patients expected
      to participate in this study could be as high as 30 depending on how the treatment is
      tolerated.

      The first group (3-6 patients) on the study will receive the drug (Xeloda®) at 600mg/m²
      (level 1) and radiation. If the first group does well, the second group of patients on the
      study (3-6 patients) will receive 825 mg/m² (level 2) and radiation. If the second group does
      well, the third group will receive 1,000 mg/m² (level 3) and radiation. If the first dose
      level of 600mg/m² is NOT tolerated, we will reduce the dose to 500mg/m² and enroll another
      3-6 patients at the lower dose.

      After the highest tolerated dose is identified, 12 additional patients will be treated at
      that dose to further test the safety of the treatment and better understand the effects of
      the treatment on disease with more patients.

      The following tests and procedures are part of regular medical treatment (standard care) for
      the disease and are also required for this study.

        -  physical examinations

        -  blood tests including pregnancy test

        -  urinalysis

        -  ECG (heart tracing)

        -  chest X-ray

        -  CT scan of the abdomen

      Follow-up visits are done 1 month after radiation, then 3 months later, then every 3 months
      for 2 years.
