      Web-Based Support for Informal Caregivers in Cancer Brief Summary (including hypothesis):

      Informal caregivers need information, skills and emotional support to address physical,
      spiritual, and emotional needs associated with chronic illnesses including late stage cancer.
      Unfortunately, current conditions force clinicians to reduce their interaction time with
      patients and informal caregivers. Complimentary methods must be developed to provide needed
      information and support to caregivers. The proposed research will measure and explain the
      impact of two computer-based support systems that meet caregiver needs and facilitate
      information exchange with clinicians. The system, CHESS (Comprehensive Health Enhancement
      Support System) is a non-commercial computer system that provides patients with disease
      specific information, emotional support and skill building tools. In the expanded form to be
      tested in this study, CHESS with Caregiver Support (CGCHESS) will also provide the caregiver
      with more information, support and skills training related to palliative care. CGCHESS will
      be further enhanced to communicate essential patient and caregiver information to clinicians
      prior to a scheduled clinic visit and when patient symptoms exceed a threshold.

      The investigators' primary hypothesis is that CGCHESS + Clinician Report (CR) will reduce
      caregiver burden more than CGCHESS because of the additional support caregivers and patients
      receive from clinicians who have access to the CHESS clinician report. Secondary analyses
      will study the mechanisms of the CHESS effect. Specifically the investigators anticipate that
      the CHESS effect on caregivers will be mediated by the CHESS effect on interaction patterns
      with clinicians, satisfaction with clinical visits and by the CHESS effect on four patient
      outcomes (quality of life, negative affect, average severity of nine common late-stage
      cancers).
