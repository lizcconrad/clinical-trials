  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate
      for the prevention of migraine headaches in adults. Topiramate has been approved to prevent
      migraine headaches in adults.

      Migraine headaches can be disabling and can interfere with work and a person's quality of
      life. Preventing these headaches before they start is the best option. Topiramate, an
      anti-seizure medication, has been shown to help prevent migraine headaches from occurring.
      This is an open-label study that is an extension of a previous study (CAPSS-277) comparing
      topiramate and amitriptyline in migraine prevention. It includes patients who completed the
      previous study and elected to enter open label treatment with topiramate. The study will
      involve a 4-week Blinded Transition Phase during which patients will be titrated up to a
      daily topiramate dose of 100 milligrams (or the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is less).
      Then there will be a 12-week Open-Label Maintenance Phase during which the topiramate dose
      may be adjusted according to effectiveness and tolerance, but not to exceed a daily dose of
      400 milligrams. While on topiramate, patients will record daily entries in their headache
      records. Patients will be asked questions to help assess their quality of life. Patients will
      also have physical examinations and laboratory tests performed during the study. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of topiramate
      for the prevention of migraine headaches.

      Topiramate oral tablets, 25 milligrams per tablet, will be given in the morning and evening
      to a dose not to exceed 400 milligrams per day or to the maximum tolerated dose, whichever is
      less
