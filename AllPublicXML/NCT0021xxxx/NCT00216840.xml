  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether once daily topical treatment for up to 8
      weeks of calcipotriol 50 mcg/g plus betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) gel is safe and
      more effective than betamethasone 0.5 mg/g (as dipropionate) in the gel vehicle and
      calcipotriol 50 mcg/g in the gel vehicle in patients with scalp psoriasis.

      The primary response criterion is the number of patients with absence of disease and very
      mild disease after 8 weeks of treatment.
