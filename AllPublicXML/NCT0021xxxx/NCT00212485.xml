    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see whether power Doppler sonography (PDS) can be used to
      diagnose synovitis in patients with inherited bleeding disorders.

      Aim #1 - To determine if PDS can be used to diagnose synovial hypertrophy and inflammation in
      joint disease associated with inherited bleeding disorders. MRI will be used as a reference
      standard.

      Aim #2 - To determine if PDS can be used to assess therapeutic response to treatment.

      Aim #3 - To determine if PDS can be used as a screening tool for diagnosing early synovitis.
