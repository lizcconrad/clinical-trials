  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both pharmacotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions have domenstrated efficacy for PTSD.
      However, although these interventions can be helpful, many patients remain symptomatic
      despite initial treatment. In this study, we will examine the relative efficacy of the
      addition of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo for patients remaining symptomatic despite a
      brief and intensive course of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

      This is a systematic controlled study examining the use of augmentation with pharmaotherapy
      for PTSD patients remaining symptomatic despite CBT (exposure therapy). The aims of the study
      include examination of: (1) the efficacy of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo as additions to
      ongoing exposure therapy in patients who failed to respond to brief, intensive CBT; (2) the
      tolerability of paroxetine-CR compared to placebo as additions to ongoing exposure therapy in
      patients who failed to respond to brief, intensive CBT; (3) the outcome of patients at 6
      months follow-up to randomized treatment. Patients will initially have intensive (8 sessions
      over 4 weeks) prolonged exposure therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic will be randomzied
      to receive either flexibly-dosed paroxetine-CR (12.5 mg/d - 62.5 mg/d) or placebo in
      conjunction with additional 5 sessions of prolonged exposure over 10 weeks.
