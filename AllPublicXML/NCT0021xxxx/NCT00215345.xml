  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to find out the safety and effectiveness as well as
      patientâ€™s quality of life on the combination of Taxotere and celecoxib on patients with
      hormone refractory prostate cancer. Celecoxib (Celebrex) is an FDA approved drug to treat
      arthritis. Taxotere (Docetaxel) is an FDA approved chemotherapy drug to treat certain forms
      of cancer. Both drugs have demonstrated evidences of tumor blood vessel suppression and
      combination of these two drugs could possibly arrest further tumor growth or make the tumor
      decrease in size.

    <textblock>
      The standard hormone therapy for patients with metastases is androgen deprivation. This
      treatment leads to response in 75-80% of the patients, with median duration of response of
      only 14-18 months. Once the patient becomes hormone resistant, there is no effective therapy
      to prolong life. For patients with HRPC, the median life expectancy is 17 months.2 Thus
      palliative care remains the standard therapy for HRPC. The most widely used chemotherapy
      regimens are combinations of mitoxantrone with prednisone and taxanes with estramustine
      phosphate.3,4,5 Taxotere has also demonstrated activity in prostate cancer cell lines.6
      Several clinical studies have demonstrated its activity in patients with metastatic prostate
      cancer as a single agent or in combination.4, 5 Taxotere may exert its effects in part
      through anti-angiogenic effects.7 Recent work in animal models has provided additional
      evidence for the beneficial role of angiostatic agents in the treatment of malignant
      diseases. This is the first study of the two drugs used together in prostate cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland.

          -  Patient must have evidence of progressive metastatic disease (e.g., bone, pelvic mass,
             lymph node, liver or lung metastases) within 6 weeks prior to participation in the
             study.

          -  Patients who have evaluable but not measurable disease must not have an elevated PSA
             level as the only evidence of disease. While castrated, the patients should have
             rising PSA on two consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart. The confirmatory PSA
             must be obtained within 1 week prior to study registration and should be &gt;10ng/ml.

          -  Patients with bone metastases only (i.e., lacking soft-tissue disease) must have a PSA
             level of &gt; 10 ng/ml. Patients with soft tissue metastases and /or visceral disease
             must have either measurable disease or a PSA level of &gt; 10 ng/ml.

          -  Radiological evidence of hydronephrosis will not by itself constitute evidence of
             metastatic disease.

          -  Patients must have had prior treatment with bilateral orchiectomy or other primary
             hormonal therapy (e.g., estrogen therapy, LHRH analog + flutamide, etc.) with evidence
             of treatment failure.

        NOTE: patients who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue LHRH agonist
        therapy (e.g., depot leuprolide or goserelin) while receiving this protocol therapy. For
        these patients the testosterone level should be preferably checked before enrollment and
        should be &lt; 50 ng/dl.

          -  For patients previously treated with flutamide (Eulexin), nilutamide (Nilandron), or
             bicalutamide (Casodex): Patients must have discontinued flutamide or nilutamide &lt; 4
             weeks and for bicalutamide 6 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Patients must not have received prior treatment with chemotherapy within the last 5
             years.

          -  Patients must not have had prior radiotherapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to this protocol
             treatment.

             participate in this study.

          -  Patients must have the following chemistry values &lt; 4 weeks prior to participate in
             this study:

          -  Total bilirubin must be within normal limits.

          -  Creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/d. or creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min

             appropriate for the specific cancer.

          -  No serious concurrent medical illness or active infection should be present which
             would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the chemotherapy outlined in
             this protocol with reasonable safety.
