    <textblock>
      The objective is to obtain initial information regarding the safety and efficacy of the use
      of Filgrastim in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.

      The secondary objectives are to obtain information regarding the mobilization of relevant
      stem cell progenitor cells by Filgrastim in this setting and to obtain further clinical
      information that may be helpful in the assessment of safety and efficacy of this drug as
      utilized.

      It is a one center, randomized, placebo controlled, dose escalation, blinded study. It will
      be 2:1 randomization with 9 patients total.

      Filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day will be administered SQ for 5 days vs. placebo.

      Primary endpoint is death /or myocardial rupture or change in left ventricular ejection
      fraction from baseline to 30 days.

      9 pts. have already completed the first phase of the trial using Filgrastim 5 mcg/kg/day.
