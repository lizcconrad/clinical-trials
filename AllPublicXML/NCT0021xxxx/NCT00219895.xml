      Specific Aim: To determine whether neutrophils, active elastase, and cytokines measured in
      sputum induced using hypertonic saline are useful screening tests for determining if a
      particular agent with known anti-inflammatory properties is a suitable candidate for more
      extensive clinical trials in patients with CF. This aim will be addressed using an
      anti-inflammatory agent, ibuprofen, that has been shown to have clinical benefit in CF. A &quot;no
      treatment&quot; arm will be included as the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation clearly contributes to the progression of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease.
      Anti-inflammatory therapy with alternate-day corticosteroids and twice-daily high-dose
      ibuprofen in patients with CF has shown clinical benefit, but adverse effects and other
      considerations have markedly limited their use. Therefore, alternative anti-inflammatory
      agents are urgently needed. Results from the clinical trials of alternate-day corticosteroids
      and high-dose ibuprofen in CF indicate that anti-inflammatory therapy will probably not
      result in improvement in pulmonary function, but will slow the rate of decline. This
      expectation imposes constraints on the design of studies to test new anti-inflammatory
      agents, requiring that they use many patients over a considerable period of time (years,
      rather than the months that are necessary to evaluate anti-infective or anti-obstructive
      therapies). Thus, it is highly desirable to design a strategy for evaluation of prospective
      anti-inflammatory agents that will allow for the selection of only the most promising agents
      for further study in Phase III type trials. Of additional concern is the fact that some
      pharmaceutical firms have not pursued development of anti-inflammatory agents for CF because
      there were no early indicators of efficacy. This presents an insurmountable hurdle for
      translation of research advances into clinical treatments. Some means of screening candidate
      drugs is urgently required. This study will assess the measurement of inflammatory mediators
      in induced sputum as one such strategy. The hypothesis to be tested is that ibuprofen will
      reduce neutrophils, active elastase, and pro-inflammatory cytokines in induced sputum after 4
      weeks of therapy in patients with CF.
