      HRN-003 STUDY SYNOPSIS

      OBJECTIVE: To compare the Sustained Virologic Response (SVR) of PEGIntron plus ribavirin
      among patients receiving a fixed dose of PEGIntron versus weighted-adjusted dosing.

      OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN: This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label clinical trial using
      PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin by mouth twice
      daily for 48 weeks OR PEGIntron fixed dose by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin by
      mouth twice daily for 48 weeks.

      STUDY POPULATION: 600 Adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who have
      previously failed to achieve a sustained virologic response following interferon alfa or
      interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin therapy.

      DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Eligible participants will be randomized to receive PEGIntron
      weight-adjusted dose (1.5 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth
      twice daily for 48 weeks OR PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if
      weight &lt; 80 KG) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for
      48 weeks.

      EFFICACY EVALUATIONS: Laboratory analysis, quality of life assessments, and change in study
      medication doses will be obtained.

      SAFETY EVALUATIONS: Assessment of laboratory evaluations, vital signs, incidence and severity
      of adverse experiences and progression of disease, as measured by HCV viral load.

      STUDY DESIGN

      This is a treatment protocol to evaluate the antiviral efficacy, safety and tolerability
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated interferon alfa-2b (PEGIntron) for the treatment of
      chronic hepatitis C virus infection in patients who have previously failed to achieve a
      sustained virologic response following interferon alfa or interferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin
      therapy. Patients will be stratified according to their response to the previous course of
      therapy (i.e. non-reponse or relapse virologic pattern

      This is a multi-center, randomized, open-label clinical trial that will involve approximately
      25 sites with an anticipated enrollment of 600 patients over a six-month period.

      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive PEGIntron weight-adjusted dose (1.5
      mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks
      OR PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if weight &lt; 80 KG) by
      subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks.

        -  Group A: PEGIntron weight -adjusted dose (1.5 mg/kg) by subcutaneous injection weekly +
           ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for 48 weeks (Total therapy x 48weeks).

        -  Group B: PEGIntron fixed dose (150 mg if weight &gt; than 80 kg or 100 mg if weight &lt; 80
           KG) by subcutaneous injection weekly + ribavirin 400 mg by mouth twice daily for an
           additional 48 weeks (Total therapy x 48 weeks).

        meet the following eligibility criterion and are monitored as outlined in Section 11.2
        (Management of Depression During Study).

        Mild depression: to include either situational depression of a limited period or depressive
        symptoms, which do not significantly interfere with the patients work or daily functions.
        Any patient with a manic element to his/her previous symptom complex will be excluded.

        Detailed follow-up of each patient may be individualized according to his/her need; this
        would usually include further predetermined visits. Patients with a history of mild
        depression or patients undergoing successful treatment for mild depression will be managed
        as outlined in Section 11.2 (Management of Depression During Study).
