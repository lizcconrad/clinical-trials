      To assess motor function and quality of life (QoL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) subjects with
      end-of-dose wearing off, comparing immediate and delayed switch to carbidopa/levodopa and
      entacapone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label study with blinded raters to
      evaluate the effects of immediate versus delayed switch to carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone on
      motor function and quality of life in patients with Parkinson's disease with end-of-dose
      wearing off.

    <measure>Change in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III Score From Baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Motor function was assessed with the UPDRS part III. There are 14 items in the instrument, each measured on a 5 point scale (0-4): Speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, and body bradykinesia. The sum of scores can range from 0 to 56; a higher score indicates greater disability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Score From Baseline to Week 4</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life was assessed with the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Instrument (PDQUALIF), a 33-item self-reported questionnaire which includes seven domains: Social/role function, self-imaging/sexuality, sleep, outlook, physical function, independence, and urinary function. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The 1 to 5 range was recoded to 0 to 4 for the analysis. The total score can range from 0 to 132. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 4</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-39 is another instrument used to assess quality of life in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The questionnaire provides scores on eight scales: Mobility, activities of daily living, emotions, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The 1 to 5 range was recoded to 0 to 4 for the analysis. The total score can range from 0 to 156. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A negative change score indicates an improvement.</description>

    <description>Patients were switched the day after randomization from combined carbidopa/levodopa to combined carbidopa/levodopa/entacapone. Patients received the same doses of carbidopa (12.5, 25.0, or 37.5 mg) and levodopa (50, 100, or 150 mg) they were receiving prior to the switch, combined with 200 mg of entacapone.

        <description>Motor function was assessed with the UPDRS part III. There are 14 items in the instrument, each measured on a 5 point scale (0-4): Speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, and body bradykinesia. The sum of scores can range from 0 to 56; a higher score indicates greater disability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

The sum of scores can range from 0 to 56; a higher score indicates greater disability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change in Parkinson’s Disease Quality of Life Score From Baseline to Week 4</title>
        <description>Quality of life was assessed with the Parkinson’s Disease Quality of Life Instrument (PDQUALIF), a 33-item self-reported questionnaire which includes seven domains: Social/role function, self-imaging/sexuality, sleep, outlook, physical function, independence, and urinary function. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The 1 to 5 range was recoded to 0 to 4 for the analysis. The total score can range from 0 to 132. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The PDQ-39 is another instrument used to assess quality of life in individuals with Parkinson's disease. The questionnaire provides scores on eight scales: Mobility, activities of daily living, emotions, stigma, social support, cognition, communication, and bodily discomfort. Questions are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 3 (sometimes) to 5 (always). The 1 to 5 range was recoded to 0 to 4 for the analysis. The total score can range from 0 to 156. A lower score indicates better quality of life. A negative change score indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>Motor function was assessed with the UPDRS part III. There are 14 items in the instrument, each measured on a 5 point scale (0-4): Speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability, and body bradykinesia. The sum of scores can range from 0 to 56; a higher score indicates greater disability. A negative change score indicates improvement.</description>
