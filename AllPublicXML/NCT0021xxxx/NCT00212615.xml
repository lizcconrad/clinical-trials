  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XELOX (Capecitabine and Oxaliplatin) is an effective and convenient regimen for patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Chronomodulated therapy may reduce toxicity. Patients will be
      randomized to standard XELOX (Capecitabine 1000 mg/m² in the morning and 1000 mg/m² in the
      evening days 1-14 and short term Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² day 1 in 30 minutes) or
      chronomodulated XELOX (Capecitabine 400 mg/m² in the morning and 1600 mg/m² in the evening
      days 1-14 and short term Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² day 1 in 30 minutes).

      Bloodsamples will be collected and frozen and later examined for potential predictive factors
