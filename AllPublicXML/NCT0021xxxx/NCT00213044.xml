  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, controlled, double-blinded, cross-over trial of 60 HIV-infected women recruited
      from general medical clinics, family planning clinics, groups/organizations working with
      persons living with AIDS to assess product safety, effect on genital tract HIV shedding, and
      product acceptability with vaginal use of Carraguard gel among HIV-infected women. Women had
      to be abstinent or in a seroconcordant relationship with only one partner for the study
      period.

    <textblock>
      Carraguardâ„¢ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      randomized, controlled trial in Chiang Rai, northern Thailand. Safety of daily product use
      determined by symptoms of irritation, effect on vaginal flora, vaginal epithelial disruption
      as determined by naked eye inspection (Day 7 and Day 14 of each arm) and colposcopic
      inspection on (Day 7), and other adverse effects, which may include UTI or other unforeseen
      problems (Day 7 and Day 14).

      Genital tract HIV will be measured using samples collected by CVL (Day 7 and Day 14 of each
      arm) and vaginal swab (Day 7 and Day 14).

      Product acceptability will be assessed through an interview-administered questionnaire once
      each study arm at the first follow-up visit (Day 7 of each arm), after using the product
      daily for 7 days.
