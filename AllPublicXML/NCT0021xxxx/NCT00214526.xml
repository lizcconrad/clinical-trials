    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of the Alair System
      for the treatment of asthma.

      This will be a multicenter, randomized controlled study comparing the effects of treatment
      with the Alair System to standard drug therapy. One-hundred and ten subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to either the Alair Group (Medical management + Alair treatment),or Control
      Group (Medical management only).

      Multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted at 11 Investigational Sites in 4
      countries (Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Brazil).

      Subjects underwent Baseline evaluations, Alair treatments or Control Visits, and follow-up
      evaluations at 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months after the last Treatment or Control Visit.
      In order to maximize the power of the study, Baseline and Follow-up testing was conducted in
      2 parts. In the first part subjects continued to take their asthma maintenance medications
      (inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long acting β2-agonists (LABA) during the test period.
      This is designated as the &quot;ON-LABA&quot; Phase. Following ON-LABA testing subjects were asked to
      abstain from LABA for the second part of the testing, and these results are designated as the
      &quot;OFF-LABA&quot; Phase.

    <measure>Mild Exacerbation Rate (OFF-LABA) (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Average change from Baseline across 12-Week, 6-Month, and 12-Month (OFF-LABA) Follow-up visits. A mild exacerbation was defined as 2 consecutive days when at least one of the following occurs: 1. Morning peak expiratory flow falls at least 20% below the average morning peak flow recorded during the 7 days immediately prior to Enrollment testing; 2. More than 3 more puffs of rescue short acting bronchodilator are required than the average usage during the 7 days immediately prior to Enrollment testing; 3. Awakening at night with asthma symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Methacholine PC20 (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in &quot;PC20&quot; - provocative concentration of Provocholine (a brand of methacholine chloride) resulting in a drop of FEV1 of 20% or more from baseline. The patient inhales an aerosol of one or more concentrations of methacholine. The lower the concentration of methacholine that provokes a 20% (or greater) fall in FEV1, the more &quot;responsive&quot; or &quot;hyperresponsive&quot; the airways are. Conversely, a rise in methacholine PC20 indicates airways that have become less reactive.</description>

    <measure>Peak Expiratory Flow (Morning and Evening) (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks (ON-LABA) and 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in morning and evening Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF). The peak expiratory flow rate measures the maximal rate at which a person can exhale air.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks (ON-LABA) and 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) Score. The ACQ is a self-administered patient questionnaire that assesses individual subject asthma control. The ACQ comprises 6 questions that relate to the patient's asthma symptoms, activity limitations, and daily rescue bronchodilator use, and FEV1. Each question is scored from 0 (best) to 6 (worst) and averaged, resulting in a total score from 0 to 6. A decrease in the ACQ score indicates better asthma control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of Rescue Medications (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks (ON-LABA) and 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in use of rescue medications (short acting bronchodilators) measured in puffs per week. Subjects recorded their use of rescue medication for asthma symptoms in their Daily Diary throughout the study.</description>

    <measure>Use of Maintenance Medications (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visit in use of maintenance medications (inhaled corticosteroids and/or long-acting beta-agonists).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks (ON-LABA) and 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in AQLQ score. The AQLQ consists of 32 questions (scale from 1 to 7, where 7 reflects a higher quality of life). The AQLQ score is the mean of the scores from the 32 individual questions. An increase in the AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life. A within-subject change in score of 0.5 represents the minimal important difference (MID).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Symptom Score (Change From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks (ON-LABA) and 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in Total Symptom Score. Total Symptom Score comprises the sum of six asthma symptom measurements. Each symptom is scored on a scale of 0 to 3 each day by the subject. The sum of the scores for these 6 symptoms comprises the Total Symptom Score, which measures overall asthma symptoms. The maximum score possible is 18. A lower Total Symptom score represents better asthma control.</description>

        <title>Methacholine PC20 (Change From Baseline)</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline at 12-Weeks, 6-Months, and 12-Months (OFF-LABA) Follow-up Visits in &quot;PC20&quot; - provocative concentration of Provocholine (a brand of methacholine chloride) resulting in a drop of FEV1 of 20% or more from baseline. The patient inhales an aerosol of one or more concentrations of methacholine. The lower the concentration of methacholine that provokes a 20% (or greater) fall in FEV1, the more “responsive” or “hyperresponsive” the airways are. Conversely, a rise in methacholine PC20 indicates airways that have become less reactive.</description>

The ACQ is a self-administered patient questionnaire that assesses individual subject asthma control. The ACQ comprises 6 questions that relate to the patient’s asthma symptoms, activity limitations, and daily rescue bronchodilator use, and FEV1. Each question is scored from 0 (best) to 6 (worst) and averaged, resulting in a total score from 0 to 6. A decrease in the ACQ score indicates better asthma control.</description>

An increase in the AQLQ score indicates a better quality of life. A within-subject change in score of 0.5 represents the minimal important difference (MID).</description>

The sum of the scores for these 6 symptoms comprises the Total Symptom Score, which measures overall asthma symptoms. The maximum score possible is 18. A lower Total Symptom score represents better asthma control.</description>
