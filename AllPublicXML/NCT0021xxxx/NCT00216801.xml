    <textblock>
      This pilot study will explore the relationship of Ochratoxin A (OTA) levels in patients with
      upper tract transitional cell (TCC), renal cell, and testicular cancers by measuring levels
      of OTA in serum and tumor samples. Dietary exposure will also be analyzed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ochratoxin A (OTA, a ubiquitous mycotoxin) is a common food contaminant that enters the food
      chain from plants such as cereals. OTA can be inhaled or ingested and livestock and humans
      feeding on OTA contaminated food have been found to have detectable levels of this chemical
      in their sera, liver, and kidneys.

      There is risk for occupational and environmental exposure to OTA. Thus, exposure to this
      mycotoxin may be a poorly recognized problem in our society. OTA has been classified as a
      group 2b possible carcinogen. Exposure to OTA has been implicated in teratogenesis (fetal
      malformation), nephrotoxicity, gonadotoxicity and carcinogenesis. The mechanisms for these
      effects of OTA have not been fully explained. There is an increasing incidence of testis
      cancer in Western societies combined with the increasing OTA exposures being reported. As
      well as studying the relationship of OTA to TCC initially, we also plan to examine a possible
      relationship between OTA and testicular cancer as well as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). To
      date, very little research into the effects of mycotoxins in humans has been performed. We
      plan to apply proven techniques of serum analysis using:

        1. ELISA or Enzyme Linked Immuno-absorbent Assay which is used to measure the presence of
           an antibody or antigen in the bloodstream

        2. Immunohistochemistry (pathological analysis from resected tumors)

        3. High -pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) of tumor tissue to investigate the role of
           OTA in human genitourinary cancers. A group of subjects without cancer will be used as a
           control group.
