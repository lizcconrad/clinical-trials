      can be helpful in patients who want to stop using cocaine and alcohol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the role of Relapse
      Prevention (RP) and Contingency Management (CMP) combined with Naltrexone (NTX) for the
      treatment of cocaine-alcohol dependence. Patients will be randomly assigned to NTX (100mg/d)
      or placebo combined with one of two psychotherapy conditions (RP or RP +CMP). Following a
      standardized consent and intake procedure patients will participate in a 12-week trial with
      thrice weekly visits. Manual-guided RP therapy will be delivered in weekly 60-minute
      individual sessions. CMP will be based on cocaine-negative urine screens and negative breath
      alcohol tests. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 and 6 months after treatment.
