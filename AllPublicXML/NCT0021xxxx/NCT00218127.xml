    <textblock>

      Heroin is a highly addictive drug, and its abuse has both medical and social consequences.
      ORLAAM is approved to treat both opiate and narcotic dependence. The purpose of this study is
      to determine the efficacy of ORLAAM in treating heroin dependent individuals. In addition,
      this study will determine the most effective dosing regimen of ORLAAM.

      This study will last 20 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of three
      dosing conditions: 1) standard fixed dose, 2) dose-by-weight, and 3) dose effect. The dose
      effect condition will include a dose of ORLAAM dependent on opiate use and withdrawal
      symptoms associated with opiate use; doses may be adjusted throughout the study. All
      participants will receive cognitive behavioral therapy throughout the study.
