  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether folate and vitamin B12, physical activity
      and mental health literacy can prevent depression, and folate and vitamin B12 and physical
      activity can prevent cognitive impairment in older people. Also the study aims to assess the
      benefits for older people in improving their knowledge about mental health in relation to
      depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While preventive efforts for depression have tended to focus on adolescent and young adult
      populations, other stages of the lifespan also provide opportunities for prevention. With
      older people, there are certain risk and aetiological factors, which become more prominent
      and require preventive action at that point in the lifespan. The aim of this study is to
      determine the efficacy of various interventions in preventing depression and cognitive
      decline among older people who are at high risk of developing major depression because they
      are currently suffering from depressive symptoms.

      The study has three interventions; i) folate and vitamin B12, ii) physical activity; and iii)
      mental health literacy. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive each combination
      of the interventions (folate and vitamin B12 or placebo, physical activity intervention
      programme or physical activity no-intervention control, mental health literacy intervention
      [containing written modules with information about depression that is relevant to older
      people] or mental health literacy no-intervention control group). Participants will receive
      these interventions over a two-year period with regular assessments across that time period.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, 48-, and 51 month followups.</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ - 9) is a brief self-administered diagnostic instrument for depressive symptoms with items derived from the nine diagnostic criteria for Major Depression Disorder using the DSM - IV. The items are coded &quot;0&quot; (not at all) to &quot;3&quot; (nearly every day) for the most recent 2-week period, with possible scores ranging from 0 to 27, higher scores indicating greater depression severity. The PHQ - 9 is used in research and clinical settings, and can be administered via telephone. Studies support its reliability, validity, and ability to detect change over time.</description>

    <measure>Physical activity level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks, 6-, 12-, 48-, and 51 month followups.</time_frame>
    <description>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire - Short Form (IPAQ - SF) was used as a self-report measure of physical activity. The purpose of the IPAQ is to survey physical activity in large groups or populations. The IPAQ allows for a total of metabolic equivalent (MET) units expended in the most recent seven-day period.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12-, and 48-month followups.</time_frame>
    <description>The modified Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status has a max. total score= 39, and comprises 4 domains: orientation; recent memory and delayed recall; attention; and, semantic memory. It has excellent discrimination in cognitive performance in the general population. Processing speed was measured (Brief Test of Adult Cognition-Telephone) with the task to count backwards quickly from 100 by 1's for 30 seconds The Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly was given at 2yr FU to a person who had known the participant for &gt; 2yrs. It measures cognitive decline and dementia.</description>

    <description>The vitamin intervention was a daily oral dose of one tablet consisting of folic acid 400 mcg + vitamin B12 100 mcg. The folic acid dose of 400 mcg / day was selected as it has been shown to be the dose associated with 90% of the maximal decrease in plasma homocysteine concentration for older individuals. Participants received 1 bottle x 200 tablets in six-month supplies at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Adherence was monitored by telephone interviews (6 weeks, 6-, 12-, and 24 months) and 10 brief telephone tracking calls (1 - 5 weeks, and 4-, 8-, 13-, 18-, and 22-months).</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Individuals in the Physical Activity Promotion group received a manual designed to promote older individuals' physical activity participation to the level recommended to gain both physical and mental health benefits. The framework of the physical activity manual was informed by social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model, and comprised five sections that reflect stages of behaviour change, including; precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The manual contained evidence-based strategies and skills to assist people in increasing their physical activity levels. Participants received a pedometer at the commencement of the intervention as pedometry step / minute values are useful as an indicator of moderate to vigorous physical activity with total number of steps for one week recorded during the brief telephone calls at 1-5 weeks, and 4-, 8-, 13-, 18-, and 22- months.</description>

    <description>This MHL intervention comprised 10 modules, with nine of these specifically written for older adults. Modules 1 to 5 comprised information on depression and the evidence-based treatment for older adults. The additional MHL modules were booklets addressing evidence-based strategies and treatments for depression. It was delivered in a way to foster support and ensure that participants worked through the material systematically. Modules 1 to 5 were delivered in consecutive weeks as previous research indicates that the maximum impact of MHL on depressive symptoms may occur within the first six weeks of the intervention. Telephone interviewers contacted participants once a week for 5 consecutive weeks to motivate and support participants. There were an additional 5 check-in telephone calls, and Modules 6 to 10 of the MHL material that were delivered via postal mail at 4- (Module 6), 8- (Module 7), 13- (Module 8), 18- (Module 9), and 22- months (Module 10).</description>

    <description>The attention control intervention for the physical activity intervention was printed nutrition literacy and included information concerning the recommended dietary guidelines for older Australians, as well as strategies and additional information to facilitate beneficial dietary behaviours. The same procedure was adhered to as the physical activity intervention to ensure adequate attention control. Participants in the nutrition promotion intervention received 5 brief telephone calls from an interviewer to facilitate adherence to the intervention, and to offer support and clarification of the materials. Participants received five further brief telephone calls as well as nutrition newsletters that were delivered via postal mail at 4-, 8-, 13-, 18-, and 22- months.</description>

    <description>Pain and Arthritis Information was used as the attention control intervention for the MHL intervention and comprised 10 modules. Modules 1 to 5 were contained in an Arthritis Australia consumer guide for arthritis management. Modules 6 to 10 were a series of information pamphlets on pain management, osteoporosis and falls prevention. The delivery of the Pain Information was identical to the MHL intervention with Modules 1 to 5 distributed via postal mail in five consecutive weeks (1-5 weeks), while the remaining intervention modules were delivered at 4- (Module 6), 8- (Module 7), 13- (Module 8), 18- (Module 9), and 22- months (Module 10). Participants also received 10 brief calls from a telephone interviewer that coincided with receiving the print intervention materials.</description>
