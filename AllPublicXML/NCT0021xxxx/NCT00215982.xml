      The purpose of this study is to find out how effective the new combination of the drugs
      Capecitabine (Xeloda), Oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), and Irinotecan (Camptosar) are against colon
      and rectal cancer. All three of these drugs are approved by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for the treatment of colon or rectal cancer. This however is the first time that these
      three drugs have been combined in this schedule for the treatment of colon/rectal cancer.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the radiographic response rate in patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine and Irinotecan.
      Secondary objectives are to determine the time to tumor progression and the toxicity and
      tolerability of Oxaliplatin, Capecitabine and Irinotecan when administered in combination.
      Study schema is as follows. Cycles are 42 days long. Patients will receive Oxaliplatin and
      Capecitabine on day 1. Capecitabine is an oral pill that will be taken for 14 days. Patients
      return again on day 21 when they receive Irinotecan and Capecitabine. Capecitabine again is
      taken for 14 days. CT scans are performed at the end of the 6 week cycle to determine
      response.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histological or cytological confirmed metastatic colorectal cancer.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;20
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  No prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting (prior fluorouracil chemotherapy, if
             administered in the adjuvant setting, and if more than 6 months has passed since the
             completion of therapy, is allowable). Prior adjuvant radiation therapy allowable
             provided no greater than 30% total bone marrow included in the field (must be more
             than 6 weeks since completion of radiation therapy.

          -  Subject must be 18 years or older

          -  Life expectancy greater than 12 weeks.

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%).

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined as: leukocytes
             &gt;3,000/mcL; absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mcL; Platelets &gt;100,000/mcL; total
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits; AST(SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) &lt;2.5 X
             institutional upper limit of normal; Creatinine within normal institutional limits and

          -  Has a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7 days prior to initiation of
             therapy (female patients of childbearing potential).

          -  Woman of childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at
             baseline. (Postmenopausal woman must have been amenorrheic for at least 12 months to
             be considered of non-childbearing potential). Patients will agree to continue
             contraception for 30 days from the date of the last study drug administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior therapy for MCRC in the metastatic setting.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will be excluded from this clinical trial because
             of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Prior unanticipated severe reaction to fluoropyrimidine therapy, or known sensitivity
             to 5-fluorouracil.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements. Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart
             failure, symptomatic coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well
             controlled with medication) or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study. Women / men of childbearing
             potential not using a reliable and appropriate contraceptive method.

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with Oxaliplatin and Irinotecan or other agents
             administered during the study.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery.

          -  Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption
             syndrome.

          -  History of clinically significant interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary fibrosis.

          -  History of persistent neurosensory disorder including but not limited to peripheral
             neuropathy

          -  Treatment for other carcinomas within the last five years, except cured non-melanoma
             skin and treated in-situ cervical cancer.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within 4 weeks preceding the start of
             study treatment.
