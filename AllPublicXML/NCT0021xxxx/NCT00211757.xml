  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the efficacy of treatment with divalproex sodium (DS) vs.
      placebo in childhood/adolescent autism fulfilling DSM-IV and Autism Diagnostic Interview
      (ADI) criteria. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for this disorder, although
      behavioral and educational therapies and a variety of medications may play a role in the
      management of some autistic symptoms.

      This study compares divalproex sodium and placebo in the treatment of autistic disorder.
      Twenty six child or adolescent outpatients, with age ranges from 5-17, will be randomized
      into a 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel treatment study. During the 12
      weeks, patients will be monitored by the treating psychiatrist and assessed by an independent
      evaluator (IE). The IE will perform study assessments while remaining blind to medication
      regimens (including possible tapering) as well as any side effects. Study assessments will be
      administered at designated time points

        Meets DSM-IV, ADI, and ADOS criteria for autistic disorder

        Age 5-17.

        Outpatients

        Parent/legal guardian signing informed consent, and assent documented for patient with
        demonstrated capacity to provide it.

        Sexually active females of childbearing potential must use an acceptable method of birth
        control (oral contraceptive medications [the administration of which must be supervised by
        a parent or guardian], IUD, depot medication or tubal ligation) and have a negative serum
        pregnancy test prior to entry into the study.

        Subject scores at least &quot;4&quot; (moderately ill) on the Clinical Global Impression-Severity
        Scale for Autistic Disorder (CGI-AD).

        Subject meets the following criteria at pre-study diagnostic assessment and baseline
        assessment: OAS-M 13 or ABC-Irritability Subscale 18 (raw scores).

        Subjects with history of seizures, who have been seizure-free for 6 months on a stable dose
        of anticonvulsant medication other than divalproex sodium or related formulations (e.g.,
        depakene). Non-medicated subjects with a history of seizures who have been seizure-free for
        6 months. Subjects with abnormal EEG but no clinical seizures.

        State exclusion criteria for enrollment in study:

        Subjects who are pregnant or nursing mothers. Sexually active women of childbearing
        potential who are not using adequate birth control measures (detailed above in inclusion
        criteria).

        Subjects with overall adaptive behavior scores below the age of two years on the Vineland
        Adaptive Behavior Rating Scale.

        Subjects with active or unstable epilepsy.

        disorder, such as hypo- or hyperthyroidism; recent history or presence of any form of
        malignancy
