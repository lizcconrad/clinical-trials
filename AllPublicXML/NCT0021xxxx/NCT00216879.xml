  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to study the safety and efficacy of long term use of once daily
      applications, as needed, of calcipotriol plus betamethasone dipropionate gel, as compared to
      calcipotriol alone in the same gel.

      The primary response criteria will be the incidence of adverse drug reactions of any type,
      and the incidence of adverse events of concern associated with long-term corticosteroid use
      on the scalp.
