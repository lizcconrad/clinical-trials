    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a well established treatment modality for patients
      with coronary artery disease. For 30 years now CABG operations have been performed with the
      help of the heart lung machine (Cardiopulmonary bypass). However, the heart lung machine is
      believed to be responsible for many of the side effects and complications seen in patients
      following CABG surgery. The organs most commonly affected are the brain, blood constituents,
      lungs and kidneys.

      In the last few years, stabilising devices have been developed that allow CABG operations to
      be performed safely without the use of the heart lung machine. Our hypothesis was that CABG
      done without the heart lung machine may be better tolerated by patients resulting in lower
      morbidity, increased functional outcome and shorter hospital length of stay.

      Enrolment into the trial was from 1998 to 2003 and included 300 patients. The last patient
      was enrolled in June of 2003. The initial results from the study suggest that excellent
      results can be obtained with both techniques and contrary to others no advantages could be
      demonstrated in in-hospital outcomes of patients performed without cardiopulmonary bypass
      (Legare et al. Circulation 2005).

      We are now in follow-up to evaluate the medium term and long term outcomes of all 300
      patients originally enrolled in above mentioned randomized clinical trial. The follow-up of
      patients is approved by the Capital Health Research Ethics Board (CDHA-RS/2004-295).
