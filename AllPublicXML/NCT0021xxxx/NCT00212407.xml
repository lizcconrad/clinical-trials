      Umbilical cord blood is used as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for bone marrow
      reconstitution in patients who would be potential candidates for a bone marrow transplant
      from an unrelated marrow donor. The outcome of transplantation is obtained to assess cord
      blood myeloid and platelet engraftment, transplant related mortality, overall survival, graft
      vs. host disease and, for patients with leukemia, lymphoma or myelodysplasia, relapse.

      Umbilical cord blood donated to the New York Blood Center's National Cord Blood Program is
      collect, tested, processed, cryoprotected and frozen in liquid nitrogen for possible future
      transplantation to anyone who needs it. The Program has operated under a FDA IND exemption
      since 1996 and is licensed as a tissue bank by the New York State Department of Health.

      Candidates for transplant are patients who disease requires bone marrow transplantation but
      who do not have a suitable related bone marrow donor. Most patients are those with high risk
      of refractory leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplasia, severe aplastic anemia and certain genetic
      hematologic, immunologic and metabolic diseases.

      Patients are treated at bone marrow transplant centers in the United States and in other
      countries with active marrow transplant programs. Because the NYBC Program operates under
      IND, patients must sign an informed consent for cord blood transplantation.

      Transplant centers report on the transplant procedure (including immediate complications) and
      on transplant outcome at 3, 6 and 12 months post-transplant and annually thereafter. Data
      report to the New York Blood Center includes information about the patient's disease and
      pre-transplant conditioning regimen and post-transplant endpoints, primarily myeloid and
      platelet engraftment, transplant related mortality, overall survival, acute and chronic graft
      vs. host disease, relapse and other post-transplant complications such as infectious disease.
      The outcome data is used to assess safety and efficacy and will be used to apply for a
      license from the FDA.
