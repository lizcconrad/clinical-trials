      This pilot study is designed to determine the feasibility and safety of administering
      docetaxel at various dosing levels on a bi-weekly schedule in older men with hormone
      refractory prostate cancer.

      The information obtained from this trial will help determine the feasibility and safety of
      administering docetaxel at various dosing levels on a bi-weekly schedule in this patient
      population. If the data from this phase I trial are encouraging, a phase II trial will be
      conducted to further assess the efficacy of this dosing schedule.

          -  unresponsive or refractory to hormonal therapy, as defined by at least 1 of the
             following criteria: progression of bidimensionally measurable disease; progression of
             evaluable but not measurable disease (bone scan); at least 2 consecutive rises in PSA

             antiandrogen withdrawal within 4 weeks for patients treated with flutamide,
             ketoconazole, nilutamide and 6 weeks for patients treated with bicalutamide;

          -  chemotherapy naïve;

          -  adequate kidney, liver, and bone marrow functions;

          -  signed study-specific informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received an investigational drug within 4 weeks of registration;

          -  Prior or concurrent malignancies (other than surgically treated carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix and squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin) within the preceding five
             years;

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness which would prevent informed consent;

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 3 months;
