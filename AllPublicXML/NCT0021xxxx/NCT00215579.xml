  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As many as 75 percent of patients with schizophrenia have difficulty taking their oral
      medication on a regular basis. This may lead to worsening of symptoms. Clinicians commonly
      respond to these problems by adding adjunctive medications, despite the absence of systematic
      studies that support such practices. It is possible, however, that in many of these cases,
      the unstable course and/or unsatisfactory treatment response reflects incomplete adherence
      with the originally prescribed oral antipsychotic, rather than a need for adjunctive
      medications. This study will examine whether switching patients who demonstrate an unstable
      course and/or an unsatisfactory clinical response to a long-acting injectable preparation as
      the primary antipsychotic may enhance medication adherence and improve outcomes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients will be male or female

          -  Between 18-65 years of age and will meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia or
             schizoaffective disorder.

          -  The subject must have, in their physicians opinion, an unstable course and must have
             been treated with an oral antipsychotic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant and breast feeding females will be excluded.

          -  Because fluoxetine is known to change the plasma level of CONSTA, subjects taking
             fluoxetine within two weeks of starting the study will be excluded.

          -  Patients who are known to have a hypersensitivity to oral Risperdal will be excluded.
