  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will apply optical spectroscopy to intraoperative margin assessment during surgery
      for breast cancer. We hypothesize that a combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and diffuse
      reflectance spectroscopy will reliably detect involved surgical margins. Twenty patients with
      ductal carcinoma in-situ will undergo a standard lumpectomy followed by scanning with a
      sterile optical spectroscopy probe. Frozen sections from the surgical cavity will be used to
      evaluate the margins. Optical spectroscopy data will be categorized as benign or malignant
      using a statistical algorithm and the results will be compared with the frozen and permanent
      section results.
