    <textblock>
      The project evaluates an innovative educational intervention using telephone counseling based
      on self-regulation theory designed to address a problem heretofore overlooked in asthma
      self-management education: the unique needs of adult female patients.

      BACKGROUND:

      More than half of the adults with asthma in the US are female. Prevalence of asthma in women
      appears to be increasing, and morbidity and mortality rates for this group are significantly
      higher than rates for men. Recent studies point to unique features in women's management of
      asthma potentially attributable to gender. These include, for example, factors associated
      with hormonal cycles, (e.g. menses, pregnancy, menopause) and social roles (e.g. household
      tasks exposing one to environmental triggers, caregiving to children and relatives
      interfering with asthma management etc.) To date, no rigorously evaluated intervention
      expressly designed for women with asthma has been reported in the literature.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study is to assess the effectiveness of a gender-specific telephone counseling,
      self-regulation intervention for women with asthma. To test our hypothesis we employed a
      randomized controlled design utilizing an intervention group and a control group. The primary
      outcomes are gender-related asthma management problems, health care utilization, days having
      symptoms, self-regulation level, management skill, and quality of life. We measure at three
      time points: baseline before randomization; follow-up I, one year subsequent to
      randomization; and follow-up II, one year subsequent to follow-up.

        The study participants are a noninstitutionalized ambulatory sample of women who are
        willing to participate in the project and meet the following criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older,

          2. a diagnosis of asthma,

          3. presence of active symptoms,

          4. enrolled as a patient in one of the University of Michigan Medical Center
             asthma-related clinics,

          5. listed as having received face-to-face instructions by clinic personnel on peak flow
             monitoring and proper use of medicine and delivery devices, and

          6. not pregnant.

        Women who are found to have extenuating circumstances that would prevent them from fully
        benefiting from the program (e.g., mental illness or terminal illness) are excluded.
