  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the pain-relieving effects and safety of Tramadol
      HCl/acetaminophen as compared to placebo in patients experiencing acute low back pain.
      Tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is approved for short-term management of acute pain. The
      combination of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen has been shown to be effective for the treatment of
      acute musculoskeletal pain. Patients who experienced at least moderate acute low back pain
      for 2 to 10 days before study entry will be randomized to receive either tramadol
      HCl/acetaminophen or placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tramadol HCl/acetaminophen is approved for short-term (five days or less) management of acute
      pain. The combination of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen has been shown to be effective for the
      treatment of acute musculoskeletal pain. The current study is a multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. Patients with acute low back pain for
      2 to 10 days before study entry will be enrolled. At the screening visit, patients will
      complete questionnaires about their level of pain and disability. Patients will be randomized
      (like the toss of a coin) to receive either tramadol HCl/acetaminophen or placebo. Patients
      will take 2 tablets of study medication every 4 to 6 hours as needed for low back pain, but
      not more than 8 tablets per 24-hour period. Patients will call the Interactive Voice Response
      (IVR) system to complete a pain assessment prior to taking the first dose of study
      medication. Also starting on Day 1, patients will call the IVR system every night at bedtime
      for the remainder of the study, to complete assessments related to the following: low back
      pain and pain relief in the last 24 hours, current pain, pain interference with sleep and the
      number of study medication tablets and doses taken that day. The objective of this study is
      to compare the effectiveness and safety of tramadol HCl/acetaminophen versus placebo for the
      treatment of acute low back pain.

      2 tramadol/acetaminophen 37.5/325 milligram oral tablets or 2 placebo tablets every 4 to 6
      hours as needed for low back pain, but no more than 8 tablets per day, for 5 days, or until
      there is no further need for pain medication
