  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand the way the body uses amino acids and proteins in
      burned patient during the time they cannot eat normally. This study aims to understand the
      metabolism of the amino acid arginine in the body after burn injury. The results of this
      study will help determine the best composition of food needed during an acute burn injury so
      that body can more efficiently use the supplied nutrient for optimal burn wound healing and
      early recovery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle sources of plasma free arginine are (i) diet, (ii) release from protein
      breakdown and (iii) de novo synthesis directly from citrulline and the recycling of orthinine
      via the urea cycle. The major pathway of arginine disposal is i)oxidation via orthinine
      glutamate and subsequently the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle and ii)via formation of nitric
      oxide. The latter pathway plays an important regulatory role in the body's response to stress
      and is significantly increased after burn injury.

      Previous studies with burn patients show i)an increased rate of total arginine flux, ii)a
      limited rate of arginine de novo synthesis, and iii) an apparent increase in the rate of
      arginine catabolism as measured indirectly by increased orinthine oxidation. These changes
      render arginine a conditionally essential amino acid for burn patients. Studies have shown
      that feeding glutamine to healthy adults significantly alters the blood concentrations of
      urea cycle intermediates arginine, citrulline and orthinine. Therefore, we hypothesize that
      the availability of arginine can be improved in the burn patient by supplementing total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) support with glutamine.

      Using stable isotope tracer studies our specific aims are:

        1. To explore the dynamic aspects of arginine and citrulline metabolism. There will be an
           emphasis on arginine disposal via oxidation and urea nitrogen formation via nitric oxide
           production.

        2. To explore the effect of a) depleting arginine and its immediate precursors proline and
           glutamine, and b)glutamine supplementation on the metabolic pathways of burn patients.

        3. To estimate the rate of nitric oxide (NO) formation in burn patients using arginine and
           citrulline tracers

    <description>The subject is randomized into one of two groups - One receives TPN that does not have arginine, proline or glutamate. The other will receive TPN with extra glutamine. The subject takes part in 3 tracer studies while in the hospital. For each tracer study, the subject will receive a different randomly assigned diet. Blood and air are sampled and the patient receives a stable isotope after which the tests are repeated.</description>
