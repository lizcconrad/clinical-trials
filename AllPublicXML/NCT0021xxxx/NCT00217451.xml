    <textblock>
      Some antibiotics are also effective against malaria parasites. Fosmidomycin is an antibiotic
      that has been shown to be effective against malaria, although it cannot achieve a total cure
      in all patients. A previous small study has shown that in combination with clindamycin, an
      commonly used antibiotic, it is highly effective and safe, in asymptomatic carriers of
      malaria parasites. The current study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination
      given for three days in children with uncomplicated malaria in Gabon.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of malaria is becoming increasingly difficult due to the development of
      Plasmodium falciparum strains resistant to commonly used antimalarials. Fosmidomycin was
      shown to be well tolerated and fast-acting in paediatric outpatients and adults, but late
      recrudescences preclude its use as monotherapy. Clindamycin was identified as a suitable
      combination partner following the demonstration of synergistic inhibition of plasmodial
      growth by in vitro and animal studies.

      In this study, the safety and efficacy of fosmidomycin-clindamycin (30 mg/kg plus 10 mg/kg)
      twice daily for three days is assessed in children with acute uncomplicated P. falciparum
      malaria.
