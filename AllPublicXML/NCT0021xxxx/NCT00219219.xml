    <textblock>
      The present study will give information about the course over time in skeletal-related events
      (SRE) in prostate cancer patients with bone metastases treated with zoledronic acid 4 mg
      administered as a 15-minute infusion every 4 weeks for a maximum of 15 infusions. The
      protocol will enroll patients with recent diagnosis of bone metastases from prostate cancer
      who are hormone-refractory, hormone-naïve or still hormone-sensitive, that represent the
      entire population of prostate cancer patients
