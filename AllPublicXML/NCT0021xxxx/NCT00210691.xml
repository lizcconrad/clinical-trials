  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to document the long-term safety and tolerability of
      risperidone, formulated as a long-acting injectable, in the treatment of patients with
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder; in addition, to evaluate the long-term
      effectiveness of long-acting risperidone and its effect on quality of life

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although many schizophrenia patients currently take oral antipsychotic medications, it is
      estimated that up to 75% of them have difficulty adhering to the daily oral regimen.
      Long-acting injectable formulations may eliminate the need for daily medication and enhance
      patient compliance with the treatment regimen. This safety study is an extension of a
      randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel group study that investigates effectiveness
      and safety of risperidone injected intramuscularly in patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder. The present open-label study evaluates 3 different doses of a
      formulation of risperidone injected into the muscle at 2 week intervals for at least 1 year
      in patients with these conditions. Assessments of effectiveness include the Clinical Global
      Impression (CGI) overall severity of illness scale. Quality of life will be assessed by the
      SF-36 Health Survey. Safety evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical
      examinations, and evaluations of the injection site, clinical laboratory tests,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), a scale assessing
      muscle tone, gain, and abnormal movements. Injections every 2 weeks for at least 1 year,
      beginning at 25milligrams[mg] and increasing to 50mg or 75mg (maximum dose). Dosages may be
      increased or decreased at investigator's discretion. During the first 3 weeks, risperidone
      tablets (2mg) once daily to supplement injectable risperidone.
