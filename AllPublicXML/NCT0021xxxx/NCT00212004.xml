      To evaluate whether the pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction
      (MI) in patients with DM and old myocardial infarction

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a well-established risk factor for coronary heart disease and
      atherosclerotic change in coronary artery. So we designed a prospective randomized
      multi-center trial named the pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial
      infarction in patients with DM and myocardial infarction(PPAR study) to evaluate whether
      pioglitazone could reduce the recurrence of myocardial infarction in patients with
      DM(HbA1c&lt;6.5%) and myocardial infarction.

      More than 100 hospitals will participate in the PPAR study. Patients with DM who have history
      of prior myocardial infarction are randomly allocated to receive pioglitazone or (1)instructs
      weight reduction, appropriate diet, regular exercise and/or (2)prescribes sulfonylurea
      agents. The number of patients to be recruited is 720 and this study will continue at least 2
      years until 7 year or the end of the study. The primary end-points are (1) cardiovascular
      mortality and (2) hospitalization for cardiovascular events. Effects in suppression of new
      diabetes development also will be evaluated.

      We should recognize DM as important therapeutic target to decrease recurrence of
      cardiovascular events. PPAR study, a large scale multi-center trial in Japan, will provide us
      new evidence how to treat DM patients with prior myocardial infarction.
