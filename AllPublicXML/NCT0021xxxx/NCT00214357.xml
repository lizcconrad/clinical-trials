  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary research objective is to investigate psychological, behavioral, and physiological
      changes in school staff as a result of undergoing meditation and stress reduction training.
      Specifically, we hypothesize that school staff undergoing meditation and stress reduction
      training will show decreased emotional distress on self-report measures, increased sustained
      attention on a behavioral task, and decreased stress levels as indexed by salivary cortisol.
