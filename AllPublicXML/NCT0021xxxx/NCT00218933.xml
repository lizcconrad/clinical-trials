      Introduction: Moderate-intensity endurance-training is known to reduce symptoms, increase
      exercise tolerance, and improve quality of life in patients with chronic heart failure. The
      training benefits have mainly been attributed to adaptations in the peripheral circulation
      and skeletal muscle rather than to adaptations in cardiac performance. However attenuation of
      left ventricular (LV) remodelling has been documented in some studies. The effects of high-
      vs. moderate exercise-intensity on LV-remodelling and endothelial function in patients with
      post-infarction heart failure are not definitively established and were studied in the
      present study.

      Methods: Patients with post-infarction heart failure (45-87 yrs, 22-males, 5-females, all
      received b-blockers and ACE-inhibitors, EF 29%, peak oxygen uptake 13 ml/kg/min) were
      randomized to 12-weeks, 2-3 times per week, of either moderate exercise-intensity (70% of
      peak heart rate), high-intensity interval-training (95% of peak heart rate) or to a control
      group that received advise from their regular doctors. Patients in the two exercise-groups
      covered similar distance on the treadmill at each exercise-session so that only
      exercise-intensity differed; i.e. the duration of exercise was longer in the
      moderate-intensity group. Ultrasound was used to assess LV-dimension and function (including
      Tissue Doppler Imaging, TDI) and endothelial function in the brachial-artery.
