  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer and with measurable primary breast
      tumor will be treated with 70mg docetaxel combined with ketoconazole. Serial tumor biopsies
      and plasma samples will be taken for gene expression and proteomics studies to identify
      biomarkers that may predict for treatment response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that 70mg docetaxel co-administered with ketoconazole would result in similar
      clinical efficacy as conventional doses of docetaxel (75mg/m2 body surface area) in terms of
      clinical and pathological response rates in metastatic breast cancer. We further hypothesize
      that tumor genomic and proteomic changes and serum proteomic changes would correlate with
      tumor response. We are also looking to correlate drug pharmacokinetics with treatment
      toxicity, genotype of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, and peripheral mononuclear
      cell gene expression profiles. The primary objectives are to evaluate the clinical response
      rate of 70mg docetaxel with ketoconazole in metastatic breast cancer, and to evaluate the
      pathological response rate in the primary tumor following four cycles of docetaxel and
      ketoconazole.

    <description>Docetaxel will be obtained locally from the manufacturer. Storage conditions for unopened vials, reconstitution, and storage conditions for the reconstituted solution will follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Docetaxel solutions should be prepared and stored in glass, polypropylene or polyolefin containers. Non-PVC containing and polyethylene-lined administration sets should be used.
Ketoconazole is available commercially in 200 mg tablet. Ketoconazole is to be administered at a dose of 200mg BID orally for six doses, starting two days before docetaxel administration. The fifth dose should be administered on the day of and before administering docetaxel, while the sixth dose should be administered in the evening of the day of docetaxel administration.</description>
