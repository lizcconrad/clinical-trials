  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with schizophrenia are three times as likely to smoke cigarettes as individuals
      without schizophrenia. While a great deal of research has been focused on smoking cessation
      programs for healthy individuals, little attention has been directed towards developing an
      effective smoking cessation treatment for schizophrenics. This project will evaluate the
      effects of 0, 21 and 42 mg transdermal nicotine on smoking, urge to smoke, and nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms after 5 hrs abstinence in smokers with schizophrenia and heavy-smoking
      non-psychiatric control smokers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nicotine is the most commonly abused drug among individuals with schizophrenia; at least 60
      percent of schizophrenics smoke cigarettes. Nicotine withdrawal may cause a temporary
      worsening of schizophrenia symptoms, making it especially difficult for these individuals to
      quit smoking. Little research has been done on the most effective way to control nicotine use
      in schizophrenic individuals. Transdermal nicotine and bupropion reduce smoking in
      non-psychiatric smokers, but little is known about the effects of these medications in
      smokers with schizophrenia. This project examines the effects of 0, 21 and 42 mg transdermal
      nicotine on smoking behavior and related subjective effects (urge to smoke and nicotine
      withdrawal symptoms) in smokers with schizophrenia and non-psychiatric heavy smoking
      controls. Participants come to the laboratory at 9 am, at which time placebo or nicotine
      patches are applied. After 5 hrs of smoking abstinence, participants undergo a smoking cue
      reactivity assessment in which craving and withdrawal symptoms are measured after viewing and
      handling neutral cues and smoking cues. This is followed by 90 min period in which
      participants can smoke freely, and smoking topography variables are measured.
