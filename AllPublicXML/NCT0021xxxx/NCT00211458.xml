      The purpose of this study is to provide compassionate use of anecortave acetate sterile
      suspension of 15 mg for a series of five patients as a means to control classic
      neovascularization following failure of treatment with photodynamic therapy using Visudyne.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Clinical diagnosis of patients that previously had a failure of treatment with
             photodynamic therapy using Visudyne.

          2. Patients must be at least 50 years of age.

          3. Visual acuity of 20/30 to 20/320 in study eye on the Early Treatment of Diabetic
             Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) visual acuity chart

          4. Visual acuity of 20/800 or better in fellow eye on the ETDRS visual acuity chart

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with significantly compromised visual acuity in the study eye due to
             concomitant ocular conditions.

          2. Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery within the last 2 months.

          3. Patient participating in any other investigational drug study.

             within 30 days prior to receipt of study medication.

          5. Inability to obtain photographs to document choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
             (including difficulty with venous access).

          6. Patient with significant liver disease or uremia.

          7. Patient with known adverse reaction to fluorescein and indocyanine green or iodine.

          8. Patient has a history of any medical condition which would preclude scheduled visits
             or completion of study

          9. Patient has had insertion of scleral buckle in the study eye

         10. Patient has received radiation treatment

         11. Patient is on anticoagulant therapy with the exception of aspirin

         12. Patient is pregnant or nursing.
