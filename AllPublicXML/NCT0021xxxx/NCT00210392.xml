      The primary objective of this study is to assess the antitumor activity (in terms of overall
      response rate - ORR - i.e. sum of complete and partial responses) of bortezomib in pretreated
      MALT lymphomas with more than one prior systemic therapy regimen

          2. any stage (Ann Arbor I-IV)

          3. relapsed or refractory disease pretreated with &gt; 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and/or
             anti-CD20 immunotherapy

          4. no evidence of histologic transformation to a high grade lymphoma

          5. measurable or evaluable disease

          6. age &gt; 18 years

          7. full recovery from previous therapy, with life expectancy of at least 6 months

          8. ECOG performance status 0-2

          9. for primary gastric localized H. pylori-positive disease at diagnosis:

               1. persistent disease 1 year after documented H. pylori infection eradication

               2. clinical, endoscopic (or histologic) evidence of progression at any time after H.
                  pylori infection eradication

         10. no prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiotherapy in the last 6 weeks

         11. no corticosteroids during the last 4 weeks, unless prednisone chronically administered
             at a dose &lt;20 mg/day for indications other than lymphoma or lymphoma-related symptoms

         12. adequate renal function (calculated or measured creatinine clearance &gt;30 mL/minute),
             liver function (ASAT/ALAT &lt;2,5 upper normal, total bilirubin &lt;2,5x upper normal) and
             bone marrow function

         13. no evidence of active opportunistic infections

         14. no known HIV infection

         15. no active HBV and/or HCV infection

         16. no serious medical illness likely to interfere with participation in this clinical
             study

         17. voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure

         18. female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use an
             acceptable method of birth control (ie, a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study. Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for
             contraception for the duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. prior diagnosis of neoplasm within 5 years, except cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
             type 1. (CIN1) or localized non-melanomatous skin cancer

          2. other investigational drugs with 14 days before enrollment

          3. evidence of symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) disease

          4. severe impairment of bone marrow function (ANC &lt;1.0x109/L, PLT &lt;30x109/L within 14
             days before enrollment), unless due to lymphoma involvement

             post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women

          8. any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition potentially
             hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those conditions
             should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial
