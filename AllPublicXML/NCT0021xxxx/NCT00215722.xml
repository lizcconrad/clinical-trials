      The first phase II trial with cetuximab and FOLFOX, as 1st line therapy for MCRC, presented
      at ASCO 2004, showed a 81% response rate, with no unexpected toxicities for the combination.

      This study is aimed at establishing the efficacy and safety of the combination
      cetuximab/XELOX as first line therapy in patients with MCRC.

      The phase II trials with XELOX, demonstrated that is a highly effective first-line treatment
      for metastatic colorectal cancer, with response rates similar to the regimens with
      oxaliplatin and infusional 5-FU/LV (FOLFOX), but more convenient and likely to be preferred
      by both patients and health care providers.

      Cetuximab has a significant anti-cancer activity in the setting of chemo-resistant disease
      which suggests that a much greater degree of benefit may ensue when it is used at an earlier
      stage of the disease course.
