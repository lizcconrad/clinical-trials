  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if a behavioral program which includes a
      relaxation technique and lifestyle changes can improve seizure control and well-being in
      epilepsy patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The behavioral treatment approach studied aims to help epilepsy patients discover which
      circumstances and behaviors trigger their seizures. The most common seizure precipitants are
      irregularities of sleep, sensory triggers such as flashing lights and emotional stress.
      Patients will learn how to avoid seizure precipitants and how to stop seizures in their first
      beginnings. Study participants will continue their prior medications.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 16-50 years.

          -  Reliable diagnosis of partial epilepsy, including simple or complex partial or
             secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

          -  Average seizure frequency of at least one partial seizure per month for at least one
             year.

          -  Willing not to begin another new treatment other than anticonvulsants (acupuncture,
             botanicals or other mind-body interventions, ketogenic diet, vagus nerve stimulator,
             or epilepsy surgery) while enrolled in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unreliable history of seizure semiology.

          -  Average seizure frequency less than one seizure per month.

          -  Patients in whom it is anticipated that current standard of care would mandate a
             change in their conventional epilepsy treatment during the time period of the study
             will be excluded.

          -  Patients taking more than 2 anticonvulsant medications will be excluded.

          -  Patients with serious other medical problems, such as brain tumors, cancer, stroke,
             significant heart disease or psychiatric disorders will be excluded.

          -  Patients with a high likelihood of psychogenic or nonepileptic seizures will be
             excluded.

          -  Patients with progressive epilepsy syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders or
             significant mental retardation will be excluded.
