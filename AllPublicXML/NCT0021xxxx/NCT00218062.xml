    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence is a major public health problem; an effective primary treatment for
      cocaine dependent individuals has yet to be found. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the effects of d-amphetamine and modafinil, when given alone and in combination, in treating
      cocaine dependent individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine is a strong central nervous system stimulant that is widely abused throughout the
      United Sates. Due to its widespread use, it is important to develop an effective treatment
      for cocaine dependence. Modafinil is a glutamate-enhancing agent. D-amphetamine is a central
      nervous system stimulant that is approved to treat individuals with narcolepsy and attention
      deficit disorder. Both modafinil and d-amphetamine may be effective treatments for cocaine
      dependence. The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of modafinil and
      d-amphetamine, alone and in combination, in treating cocaine dependent individuals.

      This study will last 16 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups:
      1) 60 mg dose of d-amphetamine; 2) 400 mg dose of modafinil; 3) 30 mg dose of d-amphetamine
      combined with 200 mg dose of modafinil; and 4) placebo. All participants will receive 200 mg
      of modafinil over 4 days.

    <description>During the 16 weeks of outpatient treatment, participants took three capsules daily (two in the morning, one in the afternoon). All active and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and each contained 50mg riboflavin for subsequent evaluation of medication compliance. Medication administration was initiated during a 5 day run-up period. d-Amphetamine sustained release (SR) (Dexedrine Spansules) started at 15 mg (day 1-2), increased to 30mg (day3; 15mg, BID), 45mg (day4; 15mg, TID), and 60mg (day5; 15mg bid plus 30mg qd). A 5-day dose reduction schedule occurred at week 17.
Manual-based, cognitive-behavioral therapy was provided for 1 hour each week by master's-level therapists. The cognitive-behavioral therapy emphasized relapse prevention and coping skills.</description>

            <description>During the 16 weeks of outpatient treatment, participants took three capsules daily (two in the morning, one in the afternoon). All active and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and each contained 50mg riboflavin for subsequent evaluation of medication compliance. Medication administration was initiated during a 5 day run-up period. d-Amphetamine SR (Dexedrine Spansules) started at 15 mg (day 1–2), increased to 30mg (day3; 15mg, BID), 45mg (day4; 15mg, TID), and 60mg (day5; 15mg bid plus 30mg qd). A 5-day dose reduction schedule occurred at week 17.
Manual-based, cognitive-behavioral therapy was provided for 1 hour each week by master’s-level therapists. The cognitive-behavioral therapy emphasized relapse prevention and coping skills.</description>
