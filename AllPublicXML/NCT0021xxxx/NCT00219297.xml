  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of patupilone with respect to
      early progression and response of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) metastatic
      to the brain, who have progressed after chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 (corresponding to
             Karnofsky performance status of 50 or better)

          -  Patients with radiologically proven (by gadolinium-enhanced [Gd-] magnetic resonance
             imaging [MRI]) parenchymal brain metastases from histologically confirmed non-small
             cell lung cancer (the primary disease may be quiescent). Gd-MRI must be performed
             within 2 weeks of study entry.

          -  Patients should have at least one bidimensionally measurable intracranial lesion of a
             minimum of 2 cm as defined by Gd-MRI. If the patient has had previous radiation to the
             marker lesion(s), there must be evidence of residual disease &gt; 2 cm or the lesion must
             have demonstrated progression since the radiation.

          -  Those patients progressing on radiotherapy must have a 25% increase in the size of the
             previously radiated intracranial lesion based on the Neuro-Oncology Criteria of Tumor
             Response for Central Nervous System (CNS) Tumors or appearance of new lesions.

          -  Patients must be controlled on medication and neurologically stable: stable on
             steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 2 weeks prior to obtaining the baseline
             Gd-MRI of the brain, and/or at least 2 weeks prior to beginning study treatment.

          -  Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. (Not
             applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or to those
             patients who are postmenopausal.)

          -  All patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective method of
             contraception during the study and for three months following termination of
             treatment.

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical evidence of leptomeningeal disease

          -  Patients with extracranial disease in more than 3 organ sites including the primary
             tumor.

          -  Patients who have received any investigational compound within the past 28 days or who
             are planning to receive other investigational drugs while participating in the study

          -  Prior administration of epothilone(s)

          -  Patients with peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1

          -  Patients with unresolved diarrhea within the last 7 days before treatment.

          -  Patients receiving known diarrheogenic agents must stop treatment with these agents
             prior to enrollment in the study.

          -  Radiotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry

          -  Prior intracranial surgery &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry; patient must have recovered
             from surgery prior to study entry.

          -  Chemotherapy &lt; 3 weeks prior to study entry; &lt; 6 weeks from prior nitrosoureas.

          -  Severe cardiac insufficiency (New York Heart Association [NYHA] III or IV), with
             uncontrolled and/or unstable cardiac or coronary artery disease

          -  Radiotherapy not permitted while on study. Exception: palliative radiotherapy of
             metastasis in extremities is allowed, but such lesions cannot be used as target or
             non-target lesions.

          -  Patients receiving hematopoietic growth factors except for erythropoietin

          -  Patients taking Coumadin® or other agents containing warfarin, with the exception of
             low dose Coumadin® (1 mg or less daily) administered prophylactically for maintenance
             of in-dwelling lines or ports
