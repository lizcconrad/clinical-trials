    <textblock>
      Objectives:

      Primary To compare the sustained virologic response (SVR) of PEGIntron plus ribavirin among
      patients receiving 48 weeks versus 72 weeks of therapy (defined as undetectable HCV RNA level
      24 weeks after discontinuing therapy).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability PEG Intron in combination with ribavirin for
           treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) infection in patients co-infected with Human
           Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

        -  To determine the early virologic response of patients receiving PEGIntron plus ribavirin
           at Treatment Week 24

      Study Design:

      All qualifying patients will enter the treatment phase and be dosed as follows:

      Peginterferon a-2b 1.5mg/kg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus

      Ribavirin:

        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg

        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg

        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg and &lt; 105 kg

        -  1400 mg (600 mg a.m. and 800 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 105 kg

      At Treatment Week 24, all participants with detectable HCV-RNA will be discontinued from
      treatment and followed for a Post Treatment period of 24 weeks. Participants with
      undetectable HCV-RNA values at Treatment Week 24 will be randomized to either:

        -  Group A: an additional 24 weeks of previously assigned Peginterferon a-2b + Ribavirin
           therapy, for a total of 48 weeks of treatment.

        -  Group B: an additional 48 weeks of previously assigned Peginterferon a-2b + Ribavirin
           therapy, for a total of 72 weeks of treatment.

      Study Population:

      300 HIV infected adults with chronic hepatitis C infection who have not been treated
      previously with interferon therapy.

      Dosage and Administration:

      Peginterferon a-2b 1.5mg/kg by subcutaneous route once weekly plus

      Ribavirin:

        -  800 mg (400 mg bid) if body weight &lt; 65 kg

        -  1000 mg (400 mg a.m. and 600 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 65 kg and &lt; 85 kg

        -  1200 mg (600 mg bid) if body weight &gt; 85 kg and &lt; 105 kg

        -  1400 mg (600 mg a.m. and 800 mg p.m.) if body weight &gt; 105 kg

      Efficacy Evaluations:

      Laboratory analysis, liver biopsies, quality of life assessments, and changes in
      Peginterferona-2b and Ribavirin dosages will be obtained.

      Safety Evaluations:

        -  Assessment of laboratory evaluations

        -  vital signs

        -  incidence and severity of adverse experiences

        -  dose adjustments

        -  premature withdrawal for safety reasons

        -  progression of disease as measured by HCV viral load

        -  AIDS defining events
