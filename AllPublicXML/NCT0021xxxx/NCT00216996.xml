  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN)received as part of your routine burn care has optimal
      levels of protein and sugar, however the best mixture of amino acids for a patient with burn
      wounds is not yet known. Amino acids occur naturally in the body and the food we eat. The
      body combines amino acids to make protein. It uses the proteins to do things such as heal
      wounds, fight infection, and provide energy. We are studying if the body's use of protein is
      increased after receiving TPN containing the amino acid called glutamine. We hope to learn
      the best composition of TPN so that the body can more efficiently repair wounded tissues and
      recover earlier from an acute burn injury.

    <textblock>
      Human and animal studies have demonstrated that glutamine catabolism exceeds glutamine
      synthesis in burn patients, resulting in a glutamine-depleted status, which compromises liver
      function, including glutathione status, proline and arginine homeostasis and whole body
      protein balance (1). The purpose of this study is to directly quantify glutamine / glutamate
      kinetics in relation to glutamine / glutamate disposal and whole body amino acid balance, by
      using stable isotope tracers [1-13C, 15N]leucine and [15N2]urea.

      We hypothesize that the enrichment of amino acid mixtures with glutamine will attenuate
      overall body nitrogen catabolism and better maintain proline and arginine homeostasis.

      The purpose of this study it to 1) investigate the effect of glutamine supplemented total
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) on whole body metabolic and disposal rate of glutamine, and its
      rate of de novo synthesis in severely burned patients and 2)explore the impact of glutamine
      supplementation on whole body protein turnover, studied with L-[1-13C, 15N}-leucine, and on
      the metabolic homeostasis of urea cycle.
