      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical success of DePuy Spine Titanium
      Surgical Mesh with MOSS Miami Spinal Fixation System Pedicle Screws in the treatment of one
      or two levels of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. The observed success rate at
      24 months will be compared to an historical control group treated with the Lumbar I/F Cage
      with VSP System.

      This is a single arm multi-center study to determine the clinical success of the DePuy Spine
      Titanium Surgical Mesh with MOSS Miami Spinal Fixation System Pedicle Screws in the treatment
      of one or two adjacent levels of degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine (L2 - S1).

      Study Success is as a compound endpoint requiring:

        -  Radiographic Fusion,

        -  Improvement in Pain/Function,

        -  Maintenance/Improvement in Neurologic Status, and

        -  Freedom from Secondary Surgical Intervention.

        -  The rate of Adverse Events must be no worse than in the control group as well.

      Secondary Endpoints Include:

        -  Adverse Events

        -  SF-36 Health Related Quality of Life

        -  Disc Space Height

        -  Work Status

      Comparison:

      Results will be compared to an historical control group treated with the Lumbar I/F Cage with
      VSP System.
