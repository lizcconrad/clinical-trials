      RATIONALE: Herpesvirus is found in the cancer cells of patients with primary effusion
      lymphoma. Antiviral drugs, such as zidovudine and valganciclovir, may be able to act against
      the herpesvirus in the cancer cells to help kill the cancer cells. Bortezomib may help the
      antiviral drugs kill the cancer cells. Draining the effusion removes fluid that has built up.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      cancer cells by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      bortezomib together with antiviral therapy followed by effusion drainage, bevacizumab, and
      combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with antiviral
      therapy followed by effusion drainage, bevacizumab, and combination chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with primary effusion lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with previously untreated primary
           effusion lymphoma treated with effusion drainage and bevacizumab in combination with
           chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival, disease-free survival, and progression-free survival of
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in previously treated or untreated patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the biologic effects of targeted oncolytic virotherapy
           comprising bortezomib, zidovudine, and valganciclovir in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a 2-part, pilot study.

      Patients who are HIV-positive receive highly-active antiretroviral therapy during study
      treatment.

        -  Part 1 (targeted oncolytic virotherapy)*: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5
           seconds on days 1, 4, and 8, zidovudine IV over 1 hour twice daily on days 1-10, and
           oral valganciclovir (or ganciclovir IV) twice daily on days 1-14. One day after
           completion of zidovudine, patients begin treatment in part 2.

      NOTE: *Part 1 treatment may be omitted in patients who are acutely ill with primary effusion
      lymphoma at study entry AND a 10- to 14-day delay of starting part 2 treatment may pose a
      hazard to the patient.

        -  Part 2

             -  Effusion drainage: Patients undergo effusion drainage prior to each course of
                bevacizumab* and chemotherapy. The drainage tube may remain in place to allow for
                continuous drainage of effusion during treatment with bevacizumab* and
                chemotherapy.

             -  Bevacizumab* plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (iCDE): Patients
                receive bevacizumab* IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 6, cyclophosphamide,
                doxorubicin, and etoposide IV continuously over 96 hours beginning on day 1 and
                continuing until day 5, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning
                on day 6 and continuing until day 19 or until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim
                SC on day 6.

      NOTE: *Patients may receive iCDE without bevacizumab if they meet any exclusion criteria for
      receiving bevacizumab.

      Treatment with bevacizumab and iCDE repeats every 21 days for 4-8 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR)
      receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 2
      months for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
