      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate how effective ONTAK is in the treatment of
      cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL) and determine whether the presence of a type of protein
      called CD25 on the cancer cells makes a difference in how the body responds to the treatment.

      The hypothesis is that there is no difference in response rate for patients whose tumor cells
      are CD25 positive or negative.
