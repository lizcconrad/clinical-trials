    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of treatment
      with PROVIGIL in children and adolescents with excessive sleepiness (ES) associated with
      narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), when administered for up to
      6 months.

          -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) below the lower limit of normal at screening (NOTE: If
             the ANC is below the lower limit of normal at the baseline visit, the medical monitor
             will be consulted for continued eligibility in the study.)
