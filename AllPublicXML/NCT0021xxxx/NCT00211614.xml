  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is common in modern society, affecting up to 5% of working
      middle-aged adults in the United States. Obesity is the number one risk factor for the
      development of OSA. Consequences of untreated OSA are varied and significant and included
      numerous neuropsychiatric parameters such as mood alterations, depression, anxiety,
      diminished social interactions, and decreased quality of life. Mounting evidence suggests
      that treatment of OSA can improve many of these outcomes. The primary treatment modality for
      this condition is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). This device delivers positive
      pressure to the upper airway in order to prevent its collapse during sleep. Unfortunately,
      many patients do not choose to use CPAP or have difficulty with these devices. This results
      in many individuals with OSA either going without therapy or unable to reap the full benefits
      of treatment.

      Gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) is also common in the United States and may, in some
      instances, be directly related to weight gain. Survey studies have suggested that symptomatic
      GERD is more common in patients with OSA. Whether there exists a cause and effect
      relationship between these two conditions is not known at present. It has been suggested that
      GERD may contribute to OSA by narrowing the upper airway.

      This study will examine the effect of treatment of GERD on mild to moderate OSA. Fifty
      individuals identified as having mild to moderate OSA (diagnosed by overnight sleep study or
      PSG) and GERD (confirmed by an esophageal probe) will be enrolled. Both men and women will be
      included in this study and no “special populations” will be utilized. Subjects will fill out
      questionnaires to subjectively measure sleepiness, OSA-related symptoms, GERD-related
      symptoms, and sleep apnea-related quality of life. They will then be randomized to receive
      either 12 weeks of the proton pump inhibitor lansoprazole (Prevacid) or placebo (twenty five
      subjects per group). Upon completion of the 12 week trial, subjects will return and the
      following data will be collected; repeat all of the baseline questionnaires, repeat PSG and
      repeat pH probe.

      Results from this study will help to establish the relative effectiveness of a novel form of
      therapy for a common yet difficult to manage medical condition. . The risks to subjects
      enrolled in the study are minimal and therefore the benefit to risk ratio is heavily in favor
      of performing the study.
