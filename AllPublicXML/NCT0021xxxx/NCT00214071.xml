  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a medical problem whose importance is increasing in
      recognition and awareness. OSA is associated with the development of hypertension and other
      cardiovascular diseases (1,2). OSA has pathophysiologic characteristics that are known to
      negatively impact immune function. Both sleep deprivation and hypoxia, hallmarks of OSA,
      impair immune responses (6,8,11). In addition, patients with OSA are frequently obese and
      obesity may be associated with increased chance of infections and immune impairment (14,15).
      Adipose cells are known to secrete cytokines and hormones that are involved in the immune
      response such as leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-6 (16-19). Thus, it
      seems very likely that OSA may impact antigen-specific immune responses. Although it is known
      that characteristics of OSA impact immune function, it is not known what effects clinical OSA
      has on immunity.

      The central hypothesis of this application is that that patients with obstructive sleep apnea
      will have attenuated cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to influenza vaccine compared
      to matched control subjects. Our hypothesis has been formulated on the basis that patients
      with OSA are sleep deprived and experience repeated hypoxemia that negatively impact both
      humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.
