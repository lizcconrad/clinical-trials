  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study answers a U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirement for evaluation in people
      of the consistency of manufacturing of a vaccine. Subjects are randomized to one of three
      lots of vaccine. The antibodies in the blood measure the immunogenicity of each lot of
      vaccine, and typical vaccine safety information is also collected.
