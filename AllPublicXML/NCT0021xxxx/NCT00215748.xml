  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to explore the feasibility of an alternative dose of dexamethasone
      pre-medication in older breast and lung cancer patients who are receiving weekly docetaxel
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dose-limiting edema and effusions associated with cumulative docetaxel administraton have
      necessitated the recommendation that all patients should be premedicated with oral
      corticosteroids such as dexamethasone prior to docetaxel administration. Dexamethasone
      pre-medication may also decrease the incidence and severity of acute hypersensitivity
      reactions associated with docetaxel administration. However, administration of weekly
      dexamethasone can cause additional untoward side effects, especially in the older population.
      If the data from this phase II study is encouraging, a study to evaluate an even lower dose
      of dexamethasone can be conducted.
