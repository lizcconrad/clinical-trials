  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride injection in Japanese patients with Mullerian carcinoma. This
      clinical study is a multi-center, non-randomized, open-label study in Japanese patients with
      Mullerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian
      tube, peritoneal carcinoma) with a prior history of platinum-based chemotherapy. Eighty
      patients will be administered intravenously at least two cycles of 50 mg/m2 of pegylated
      liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride every 4 weeks to investigate the effectiveness and safety
      of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin hydrochloride is intended to change the pharmacokinetics of
      conventional doxorubicin in the blood and to improve the safety and effectiveness of the
      drug. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride has been approved in many countries
      including US and EU, becoming a standard drug for 2nd-line therapy in ovarian cancer and
      AIDS-related Kaposi's Sarcoma. This clinical study was planned to assess effectiveness and
      safety for Japanese patients with Müllerian carcinoma (including epithelial ovarian
      carcinoma, primary carcinoma of fallopian tube, peritoneal carcinoma), who had a prior
      history of receiving platinum-based chemotherapy such as Cisplatin (which is considered to be
      the standard chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma). In this study, at least two cycles of
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be intravenously administered to
      80 patients every 4 weeks. These patients include twenty 2nd-line &quot;platinum-sensitive&quot; and
      sixty &quot;platinum-resistant&quot; 2nd-line or 3rd-line patients. Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin
      hydrochloride 50 mg/m2 will be given by intravenous drip infusion on day 1. After this, a
      27-day drug-free period will be followed as one cycle. At least two cycles will be given as
      long as the patient does not meet the discontinuation criteria.
