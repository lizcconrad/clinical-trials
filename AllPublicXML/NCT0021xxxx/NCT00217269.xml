      The purpose of this study is to assess the equivalence in safety and efficacy of the Endeavor
      Drug Eluting Coronary Stent System when compared to the Taxus Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary
      Stent System for the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a
      reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.5-3.5 mm.

      The ENDEAVOR IV Trial is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, two-arm, single-blind trial
      that will enroll a total of 1,548 patients at up to 80 sites in the US. The ENDEAVOR IV Trial
      will assess if the Endeavor stent is equivalent in safety and efficacy to the Taxus stent for
      the treatment of single de novo lesions in native coronary arteries with a RVD of 2.5-3.5 mm.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease, stable or unstable
             angina, silent ischemia, or a positive functional study.

          -  The patient is an acceptable candidate for percutaneous transluminal coronary
             angioplasty (PTCA), stenting, and emergent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
             surgery.

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 7
             days before the procedure.

          -  The patient or patient's legal representative has been informed of the nature of the
             study and agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent as
             approved by the Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) of the respective
             clinical site.

          -  The patient agrees to return to the same research facility for all required
             post-procedure follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             ticlopidine or clopidogrel, cobalt, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, polymer coatings
             (e.g., Phosphorylcholine or Translute), or a sensitivity to contrast media, which
             cannot be adequately pre-medicated.

          -  History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to drugs such as ABT-578,
             rapamycin, tacrolimus, everolimus, or any other analogue or derivative.

          -  History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to paclitaxel or drugs in
             similar class.

          -  A platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm³ or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm³, or a white blood cell
             (WBC) count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm³.

          -  A serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dl within seven days prior to index procedure.

             QWMI or non-Q wave myocardial infarction (NQWMI) having CK enzymes &gt; 2X the upper
             laboratory normal with the presence of a CK-MB elevated above the Institution's upper
             limit of normal).

          -  Previous PCI of the target vessel within 9 months pre-procedure.

          -  Planned PCI of any vessel within 30 days post-procedure.

          -  During the index procedure, the target lesion requires treatment with a device other
             than PTCA prior to stent placement (including but not limited to, cutting balloon, any
             atherectomy, any laser, thrombectomy, etc.).

          -  History of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the prior 6 months.

          -  Active peptic ulcer or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months.

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood transfusions.

          -  Concurrent medical condition with a life expectancy of less than 12 months.

          -  Any previous or planned treatment of the target vessel with anti-restenotic therapies
             including, but not limited to brachytherapy.

          -  Currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that has
             not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the current
             study endpoints; or requires coronary angiography, IVUS or other coronary artery
             imaging procedures.

          -  Documented left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30% at most recent evaluation.
