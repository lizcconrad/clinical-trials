  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the baseline incidence of variant alleles in the ATM
      and/or other DNA repair genes present in the Native American population versus the non-Native
      American population. It is thought that a higher baseline incidence of the variant alleles in
      the ATM gene may correlate to higher rates and higher grades of radiation toxicities noted in
      the Native American population.
