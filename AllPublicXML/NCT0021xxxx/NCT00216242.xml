  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether Fluviral, an inactivated, injectable trivalent
      influenza vaccine (flu shot) is effective in preventing respiratory illnesses that are severe
      enough to limit normal daily activities and that are shown by virus culture to be caused by
      influenza viruses. The study will also examine the safety of the vaccine and collect
      measurements of the immune system responses produced by the vaccine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yearly influenza (flu) epidemics cause a large burden of lost work and school time among
      younger persons and excess hospitalizations and deaths among the elderly. Injectable flu
      vaccines are generally believed to be effective, but formal studies using modern culture
      methods to prove this are limited. This study will compare the rate of respiratory illnesses
      associated with positive influenza virus cultures in healthy younger adults (a group at low
      risk for serious influenza complications) who have received Fluviral (an injectable flu
      vaccine) with the rate of such illnesses in healthy younger adults who have received an
      injection of saline (salt water). The rate of local vaccine reactions and other symptoms will
      be compared between the vaccine and salt water groups, and the immune responses to the
      vaccine measured.
