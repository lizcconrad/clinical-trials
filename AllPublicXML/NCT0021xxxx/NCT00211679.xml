  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intra-articular injection of botulinum
      toxin is effective in the treatment of chronic knee paindue to arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic knee pain unresponsive to oral medications and intra-articular corticosteroids and
      viscosupplements is an important treatment problem, especially for the young, very old and
      those with complex medical problems that preclude joint reconstructive surgery. We
      hypothesized that intra-articular botulinum toxin could provide important joint pain relief
      in these patients. This is a prospective, double blined, placebo controlled 6month trial with
      an open label extension phase when pain returns to baseline levels (re-injection with
      100units of botulinum toxin and 6 months followup thereafter.

      Comparisons: Intra-articular injection of bootulinum toxin type a will be compared to
      intra-articular injection of lidocaine the saline.

                  and research study information have been obtained.

               -  Subject has chronic Knee pain for more than 1 year.

               -  Subject has pain &gt;4.5 on numerical rating scale of 0 to 10.

               -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.

               -  Negative urine pregnancy test on the day of treatment prior to the administration
                  of study medication (for females of childbearing potential if applicable)

               -  Patients previously treated with intra-articular corticosteroid or
                  viscosupplementation injections.

               -  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis must have failed therapy with standard DMARDs
                  (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) and anti-TNF agents unless they have a
                  contraindication to TNF blockers.

               -  Patients who were considered not to be candidates for Knee joint replacement
                  because of young age, abnormalities in periarticular tissues or because of
                  co-morbid conditions.

               -  Must be ambulatory and able to perform sit to stand.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, curare-like agents, or other agents that might
             interfere with neuromuscular function.

          -  Any medical condition that may put the subject at increased risk with exposure to
             botulinum neurotoxin including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome,
             amytrophic lateral sclerosis, any other disorder that might interfere with
             neuromuscular function or the presence of severe peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Females who are pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning a pregnancy during the study or
             who think that they may be pregnant at the start of the study, or females of

             months.

          -  Concurrent participation in another investigational drug or device study or
             participation in the 30 days immediately prior to study enrollment.

          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subject at
             significant risk, confound the study results, or interfere significantly with the
             subject's participation in the study.

          -  Patients whose pain is rated as less than 4.5 on a 10 point Numerical Pain Rating
             scale at the screening visit

          -  Patients on coumadin or heparin because of increased risk of bleeding in the joint

          -  Serious or unstable psychiatric disease or cognitive impairment that would limit
             evaluation of response to treatment.
