  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of anti-erythropoietin
      antibodies to the clinical course and outcome of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in participants
      currently or previously treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), observational (study in which the
      investigators/physicians observe the participant's data and measure their outcomes) study.
      Approximately 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of an
      initial observation phase and extended observation period. An initial observation phase
      starting at enrollment and ending when 24 months have elapsed since the date of loss of
      efficacy (LOE), supplemented with retrospective data collection for the period between LOE
      date and date of enrollment in the study. Participants remaining epoetin alfa (EPO-Ab)
      positive 24 months after LOE will enter a 2-year extended observation period. Study visits
      will take place every month during the initial observation phase and data will be collected
      every 6 months during the extended observation phase. Safety evaluations will include
      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and physical
      examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration for each
      participant will be approximately for 4 years.

    <measure>Number of participants with Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) outcome (Initial observation phase)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months after the date of loss of efficacy</time_frame>
    <description>The PRCA outcome is measured by anti-epoetin alfa qualitative test. Persistence of PRCA is defined as: 1) absolute reticulocyte count less than 30,000 per cubic millimeter; and/or 2) no reversal of erythroblastopenia on repeated bone marrow testing. Resolution of PRCA is defined as: 1) absolute reticulocyte count greater than or equal to 30,000 per cubic millimeter; and/or 2) reversal of erythroblastopenia on repeated bone marrow testing.</description>

    <description>The overall clinical outcome is evaluated by anti-epoetin alfa qualitative test. Overall clinical status will be recorded at each visit in the initial and extended observation phases using a categorical scale (improved, same, worsened, death). In case of death, the date and cause of death along with the the date and cause of death will be recorded.</description>
