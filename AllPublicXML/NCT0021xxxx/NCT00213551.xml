  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gut barrier plays a major role in defence of the organism. During catabolic states, like
      major surgery or inflammation, gut barrier could be altered. It has been reported that
      preoperative nutritional support may have beneficial effects on clinical outcome in patients
      with surgery on gastrointestinal tract. Glutamine, which is a conditionally essential amino,
      have been reported to modulate inflammatory, antioxidant responses and protein metabolism in
      intestine. In addition, glutamine supply improves clinical outcome in critically ill
      patients. Antioxidant micronutrients may also have some beneficial effects in intestine by
      improving antioxidant response and might also regulate protein expression. Nevertheless,
      effects of glutamine combined to antioxidant micronutrients have not been evaluated.

      Thus, the aim of this study will be to assess the influence of glutamine and
      glutamine-antioxidant micronutrients-containing solutions on intestinal response in humans.
