  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because of the high incidence of post-radiation erectile dysfunction (ED), up to 72% after
      external-beam radiotherapy, this patient category represents a most difficult therapeutic
      challenge. Therefore, prevention of ED could be more effective than treatment. Tadalafil, a
      new phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, has been recently introduced. No studies have
      investigated the efficacy of tadalafil in preventing ED in patients undergoing radiotherapy
      for prostate cancer. Efficacy of tadalafil can last up to 36 hours after intake. This will
      result in a prolonged and continuos enhancement of penile vascular responsiveness. This
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has been designed to evaluate the efficacy
      of 20-mg of tadalafil administered for 12 months in maintaining erectile function of potent
      patients undergoing external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.

      It will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Patients scheduled for
      external-beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer will start using tadalafil 20 mg or placebo
      the first day of radiation. The blinded medication (active drug or placebo) has to be taken
      once every two days starting the day of the first radiation up to 12 months (52 weeks) after
      radiotherapy. The active drug or placebo may be taken at bedtime unrelated to sexual
      activity. In case of side effects the dose can be reduced to 10 mg. Erectile function will be
      assessed every 3 months up to 6 weeks (week 58) after discontinuation of drug treatment by
      using questions 3 and 4 of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Responders
      (maintained erectile function) are defined as having a combined score of &gt;=8 for the IIEF
      questions 3 and 4.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men, at least 18 years of age, willing to participate in the study and willing to
             regularly attempt sexual activity.

          2. Patients with histologically proven prostate cancer.

          3. Provide signed informed consent.

          4. Patients with normal erectile function defined as a combined score &gt;=8 of questions 3
             and 4 of the IIEF.

          5. Agree not to use any other ED treatment during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of any treatment for ED before the start of the study.

          2. History of pelvic surgery (including radical prostatectomy)

          3. History of penile implant

          4. The presence of penile deformity that makes sexual intercourse difficult or
             impossible.

          5. Patients with chronic stable angina treated with long-acting nitrates, or patients
             with chronic stable angina who have required short-acting nitrates in the last 90
             days, or angina occurring during sexual intercourse in the last 6 months.

          6. Patients with unstable angina, history of myocardial infarction or coronary artery
             bypass graft surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention (eg, angioplasty or stent
             placement) within 90 days before screening.

             rate &gt;100 bpm) at rest despite medical or device therapy, or any history of
             spontaneous or induced sustained ventricular tachycardia (heart rate &gt;100 bpm for 30
             sec) despite medical or device therapy, or the presence of an automatic internal
             cardioverter-defibrillator.

          8. A history of sudden cardiac arrest despite medical or device therapy.

             cord injury) within the 6 months before screening.

         12. History of HIV infection.

         13. Any condition that would interfere with the patient's ability to provide informed
             consent or comply with study instructions, would place patient at increased risk, or
             might confound the interpretation of the study results.

         14. Treatment with cancer chemotherapy.

         15. History of drug, alcohol, or substance abuse within the 6 months before screening.
