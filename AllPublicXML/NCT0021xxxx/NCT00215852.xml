    <textblock>
      To conduct a randomized dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety and activity of orally
      administered low dose interferon alfa-n3 as an immunomodulator in subjects with asymptomatic
      HIV-1 infection. The primary endpoints of the study will include an increase or upregulation
      in genes known to be mediators of interferon response. Secondary endpoints will include the
      absolute CD4 count and plasma HIV RNA levels.

      This study will be an open-label, randomized outpatient study in HIV infected subjects using
      a range of doses of Alferon LDO. The first nine (9) patients enrolled will not be randomized.
      Instead, the first three (3) patients will receive 500 IU, the second three (3) patients will
      receive 1000 IU, and the final three (3) patients will receive 2000 IU. Once three (3)
      patients at a given dose level have received at least 8 doses without grade 3 toxicity,
      patients may be enrolled at the next higher dose level. Following enrollment of the first
      nine (9) patients, additional patients will be randomized to receive one of the three (3)
      dose levels of Alferon® LDO. The Alferon LDO (natural interferon alfa-n3) will be in a buffer
      solution and taken orally once each day for 10 consecutive days at doses equal to 500 IU,
      1000 IU, or 2000 IU.

      Pretherapy baseline evaluations will be performed within the three (3) week period prior to
      randomization.

      Drug will be dispensed for a ten day treatment period, during which time any clinical
      symptoms and adverse events will be evaluated. Laboratory samples (2.5 ml blood) for
      microarray analysis evaluations will be made twice during baseline and 12-14 hours following
      doses 1, 4, and 10 on study days 2, 5, and 11, respectively.

          4. Subjects must be asymptomatic with regard to HIV related clinical symptoms including
             the following opportunistic infections: Oral candidiasis (thrush), cutaneous herpes
             simplex, fever, diarrhea, weight loss ≥ 10% of body weight, seborrheic dermatitis,
