  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of galantamine on the attention of
      patients with Alzheimer's Disease, how an improvement of attention of Alzheimer's Disease
      patients affects their activities of daily living, and the global benefit of galantamine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that an attention deficit occurs at early stage of Alzheimer's disease
      and affects patients' activities of daily living. In other words, some patients without
      language or visuospatial dysfunction have severe impairment of activities of daily living,
      which might result from attention deficit. Another recent clinical study showed that
      galantamine is more effective in attention and vigilance of Alzheimer's disease patients than
      donepezil. The study hypothesis is that galantamine will improve attention and frontal
      executive function in Alzheimer's disease patients and is well-tolerated. 8 mg/day for the
      first 4 weeks, 16 mg for the next 8 weeks
