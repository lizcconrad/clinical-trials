  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 52-week randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multi-center, active-controlled
      (metformin) study of tesaglitazar in patients with type 2 diabetes, not adequately controlled
      on diet and lifestyle advice alone during the run-in period. The study comprises a 6 week
      placebo single blind run in period followed by a 52-week a double blind treatment period and
      a 3-week follow-up period. Tesaglitazar and metformin will be titrated to optimal effect or
      highest tolerable dose during the first 12 weeks.
