      One purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety in long term treatment
      for patients who completed preceding phase I/II study. The other purpose is to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of patients who are re-treated with this drug in recommended dose.

    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a kind of malignant disease in the organ which produce blood cells such
      as bone marrow. It has poor prognosis, especially in patients who are relapsed repeatedly.
      Effective treatment is strongly expected in such relapsed patients in Japan. This is a open
      label multiple center study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of bortezomib. This
      study is an extension or re-treatment study for patients who were administered with
      bortezomib in preceding Phase I/II study. For extension treatment, the same dose of the
      previous study will be administered into a vein as a bolus twice weekly followed by a 10-day
      rest (3-week cycle). For re-treatment, a recommended dose determined in Phase I/II study will
      be administered in 3-week cycle.
