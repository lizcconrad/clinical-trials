  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, in a five-year randomized controlled trial, the
      efficacy of an intervention (AMP - ACTIVE MOTHERS POSTPARTUM) to increase physical activity
      and promote a healthy diet (decreased calorie and fat intake) for weight loss among
      postpartum women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy. The hypothesis is that the
      proportion of women losing at least 10% of BMI from baseline to 12 months post-intervention
      will be significantly greater in the AMP intervention arm than in the minimal care arm.

    <textblock>
      Retention of weight gained in pregnancy contributes to the development of overweight and
      obesity in middle age, now at epidemic proportions in America. While interventions to reduce
      weight retention specifically targeting the postpartum period have been few, interventions
      that promote modest weight loss starting in early postpartum are safe and could be
      efficacious, particularly for women who were overweight prior to pregnancy. Moreover,
      postpartum-related changes in cognitive factors (risk perceptions), behavioral factors
      (physical activity, diet), self concept (self-esteem) and social role (work, food
      preparation, child care) may make this time a &quot;teachable moment&quot; that could be capitalized
      upon by formal interventions. Interventions could leverage natural weight changes to
      encourage adoption of a healthy diet and increase physical activity, which together could
      accelerate and/or increase natural weight loss in postpartum. Whether the postpartum period
      is a teachable moment for weight loss interventions can be investigated empirically.
