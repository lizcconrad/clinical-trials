      The purpose of the study is to confirm the safety and effectiveness of rabeprazole in the
      treatment of patients with erosive or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in
      routine primary health care.

    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux can result in mild to severe symptoms in some persons. Heartburn, a
      burning sensation or discomfort rising behind the breastbone, is a common symptom.
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be described as a condition with clearly
      identified clinical symptoms or the change in tissue structure that results from the reflux
      of contents from the stomach or small intestine into the esophagus. This is a study to
      confirm the safety and effectiveness of rabeprazole in the treatment of patients with GERD in
      routine primary health care. The study has two phases. Patients will receive treatment with
      rabeprazole tablets once daily for 8 weeks. In the second phase, patients will be monitored
      by their physician for a follow up period to end of study (12 months). Safety assessments
      include the incidence of adverse events throughout the treatment and follow up phases, and
      physical examination and laboratory tests at end of treatment and after 4 months. Assessments
      of effectiveness include the degree of relief of symptoms at beginning and end of treatment
      and at specific intervals during follow up. The study hypothesis is that rabeprazole is
      well-tolerated with long term treatment of patients with GERD in routine primary health care.
      Rabeprazole tablet (20 milligrams[mg]) once daily in the morning for 8 weeks. Dose may be
      increased to 2 tablets daily (40 mg maximum) at investigator's discretion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with symptoms of erosive or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
             during at least a period of 3 months prior to study initiation and symptoms of GERD
             for at least 3 days per week within the 2 weeks prior to study initiation. The
             symptoms of erosive or ulcerative gastroesophageal reflux disease includes the
             following: heartburn, aching behind the breastbone, a need for antacids, and
             difficulty in swallowing. Patients with evidence by endoscopy of erosive or ulcerative
             gastroesophageal reflux disease with no Barret-type tissue transformation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No narrowing or inflammation of the esophagus

          -  no known gastro-duodenal ulcer

          -  no infections (other than H. Pylori), inflammations or hemorrhage of the stomach,
             small or large intestine

          -  no prior surgery of the stomach or intestine

          -  no known history of primary kinetic disorders of the esophagus, other than GERD

          -  no history of enlarged veins of the esophagus or stomach

          -  no pregnant or nursing females, or those lacking adequate contraception.
