      The purpose of this study is to verify the effectiveness, safety and pharmacokinetics of
      fentanyl transdermal matrix patches containing either 12.5 mcg/hr, 25 mcg/hr, or 50 mcg/hr in
      Japanese patients with cancer pain who have been switched from minimum amount of existing
      morphine preparations, such as equivalent to less than 45 mg/day of oral morphine, or oral
      oxycodone preparations equivalent to less than 30 mg/day.

      Fentanyl transdermal matrix patch is a narcotic analgesic agent. Compared with the existing
      reservoir-type Durotep® Patch, it is not liable to leakage of drug solution and does not
      contain alcohol, which becomes a cause of skin irritation. Also this new formulation becomes
      available of smaller one of 12.5 mcg/hr while the smallest Durotep® Patch is 25 mcg/hr. This
      clinical trial was planned to assess effectiveness, safety and pharmacokinetics of fentanyl
      transdermal matrix patch at an initial transdermal dose of 12.5 mcg in Japanese cancer
      patients with pain receiving morphine preparations equivalent to less than 45 mg/day of oral
      morphine (less than 30 mg for suppository, less than 15 mg for injection), oral oxycodone
      preparations equivalent to less than 30 mg/day, or fentanyl citrate injectable solution
      equivalent to less than 0.3 mg/day. After pre-treatment period for one to three days for
      evaluating the eligibility of the patients for the study, patients will use 3 patches for 10
      days. Starting from the first day of treatment with 12.5 mcg/hr patch, fentanyl will be
      applied to the chest, the upper arm or other appropriate site, which will be replaced with a
      new patch every three days (ca. 72 hr). Total treatment duration is ten days, and dose
      adjustment can be allowed.
