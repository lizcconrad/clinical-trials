      This study is being done to create a kidney transplant database with information from many
      transplant centers for the purpose of studying ways to help improve transplant outcomes and
      the care of transplant recipients. This is also being done to learn why kidney transplant
      recipients have worsening of their kidney function, and whether there are specific findings
      that could result in future treatments.

      Data will be collected from the participant's medical records, local health care providers
      and participant's to clarify or add any information. Participants will have samples of blood,
      and urine obtained during their routine visits, that will be saved for testing in this study.
      In addition, participant's receiving a kidney biopsy performed as a part of their clinical
      care, will have a piece of the biopsy used for the study. This study will be followed for
      five years.
