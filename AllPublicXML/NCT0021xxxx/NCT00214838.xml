      The primary objectives of this study are to identify the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) and to
      evaluate safety of atiprimod in patients with advanced cancer.

      The secondary objectives of this study are 1) to measure the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod
      and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of atiprimod treatment in patients with advanced cancers and
      3) to compare the pharmacokinetics of atiprimod tablets and capsules at the starting dose,
      with the intent of switching to capsules for the dose escalation if the capsules pose no
      safety issues.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  histological proof of advanced cancer and must have failed or relapsed following
             standard therapy or have no standard therapy available.

          -  estimated life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  must have evaluable disease.

          -  ECOG(Zubrod) PS of 0 to 2

          -  sign informed consent.

          -  age 13 years or more at time of signing informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  renal insufficiency

          -  concomitant radiotherapy, chemotherapy or other investigational therapies.

          -  peripheral neuropathy grade 3 or greater (NCI CTC version 3 grading)

          -  evidence of clinically significant mucosal or internal bleeding

          -  any condition that in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.

          -  clinically relevant active infection or serious co-morbid medical conditions.

          -  as atiprimod is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, patients taking drugs that are
             substrates of CYP2D6(e.g. beta blockers, antidepressants and antipsychotics will be
             excluded.
