      To evaluate the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agents vinblastine and methotrexate in the
      treatment of two groups of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis. Group 1 will
      contain children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis who do not have structural heart
      disease, and Group 2 will consist of children with multivessel pulmonary vein stenosis and
      concomitant structural heart disease.

      The primary outcome variable for efficacy is patient status one year after the start of
      treatment, where status is classified as either failure or success. Failure is defined as
      death or evidence of progressive obstruction at any time over the course of treatment as
      defined in the protocol. Success constitutes complete or partial response to treatment or
      stability of disease. Secondary outcome variables for efficacy are survival, time from
      diagnosis of pulmonary vein stenosis until failure, and change in patient classification on a
      scale measuring the severity of the obstructive disease.

      1.2 To assess the safety of vinblastine and methotrexate in the treatment of multivessel
      pulmonary vein stenosis.

      The primary outcome variable for safety is any occurrence of toxicity related to the
      administration of the chemotherapeutic agents over the treatment period.

      We sought to develop a regimen that might successfully suppress myofibroblastic proliferation
      in infants and children with progressive pulmonary vein stenosis. A number of factors need to
      be considered when proposing novel treatment options for patients with multivessel pulmonary
      vein stenosis. Specifically:

        -  Treatment should be directed against a specific target, in this case excessive
           proliferation of myofibroblasts.

        -  Treatment should have known activity against the target cell.

        -  Treatment should be well-tolerated in the patient group. In this case, agents with
           minimal hemodynamic side effects would be preferred.

        -  Treatment should not preclude patients from participation in other potentially effective
           therapies. Specifically, agents that do not cause significant myelosuppression would
           allow listing for transplantation.

        -  Treatment should not interfere with normal growth and development, and should have
           minimal if any risk for long-term toxicity or second tumors.

      After considering these factors, we chose to administer two chemotherapeutic agents,
      vinblastine and methotrexate. Vinblastine and methotrexate have over 30 years of usage and
      are well-tolerated. The agents used are given in low-dose and do not usually cause nausea or
      vomiting, nor do they cause significant immunosuppression which, if present, could lead to a
      risk of infection and fever.

      Desmoid tumors, also referred to as infantile fibromatosis, overlap with infantile
      myofibromatosis. A combination of standard agents that has been successfully used to treat
      desmoid tumors in infants is vinblastine and methotrexate (24). As opposed to
      cyclophosphamide-based regimens, this combination has the distinct advantages of few acute
      side effects and no known long-term toxicities, such as infertility or second malignancy.
      These agents have been used for over 30 years to treat infant and childhood malignancies.
      Over the last five years, methotrexate and vinblastine have been used to treat 9 children
      with recurrent desmoid tumor, a lesion similar although not identical to the abnormality
      present in patients with pulmonary vein stenosis. This regimen had minimal acute toxicity
      limited to mild to moderate nausea (which is easily controlled with anti-emetic therapy),
      minimal alopecia, mild hepatic inflammation, and mild myelosuppression. An addition advantage
      is that these drugs do not interfere with listing for lung transplantation, an important
      factor in the overall treatment options for this patient population. Instead of high-dose
      administration of chemotherapy (that catches only those cells in cycle at the time of
      administration), the low-dose chronic weekly administration continues to catch proliferating
      cells as they continually come into cycle. This may explain why the only other trial of
      chemotherapy (with high-dose cytoxan) was unsuccessful. Of the 9 children with desmoid
      lesions who received vinblastine and methotrexate therapy, four patients were treated for 18
      months or longer. At the time of the last report, no patient had progressive disease during
      therapy. Two children had radiographically stable disease 1 and 2 years after treatment. Two
      children had stable disease for 1 and 2 years after treatment and then had disease
      progression. Thus, this drug combination is well-tolerated, has minimal side effects, and has
      demonstrated clinical activity against a closely related type of lesion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis can be based on clinical and radiographic grounds or at the time of biopsy
             or prior surgical procedures. The diagnosis must be consistent with multivessel
             pulmonary stenosis.

          -  There must be evidence of severe pulmonary vein stenosis in at least two pulmonary
             veins.

          -  Evidence of myofibroblast neo-proliferation, if biopsies were obtained.

          -  Staging must include a complete cardiovascular evaluation including echocardiogram,
             and EKG.

          -  Accepted organ function includes:

               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x normal for age.

               -  SGPT, Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x normal for age.

               -  ANC ³ 1,500/mm3, Hemoglobin ³ 10g/dl, Platelets ³ 100,000/mm3

          -  Placement of a permanent central venous line. CVL access is necessary in all patients
             as vinblastine is a vesicant and will cause a tissue burn if infiltrated into the
             skin. Because a CVL may interfere with proper cardiac assessment in this patient
             population, the study physician will be made aware prior to the placement of a line.

          -  Patients may be listed for a lung transplant while enrolled on this study.

          -  All patients must have given written informed consent according to institutional
             guidelines.
