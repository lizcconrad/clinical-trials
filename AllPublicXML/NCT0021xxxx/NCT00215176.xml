  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of the study are to: 1) evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of modafinil
      in atypical depression; and 2) to evaluate the efficacy of modafinil in preventing relapse of
      atypical depression. The hypothesis is that modafinil is safe and effective in the treatment
      of atypical depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study on the safety and efficacy of modafinil on atypical depression has an initial
      12-week open label treatment period with modafinil that is followed by a 12-week
      double-blind, randomized parallel treatment period with either modafinil or matching placebo.
      Patients who demonstrate at least minimal improvement after 12 weeks are randomly assigned to
      either continuing treatment at their current dose or switched to matching placebo for 12
      weeks.
