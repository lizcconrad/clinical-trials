  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Male patients between the ages of 18 to 100 years of age who entered the Mid Michigan Health
      Center were administered a patient demographic questionnaire, a Lower Urinary Tract Symptom
      (LUTS) questionnaire, and the Men's Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ) without exception. The
      purpose of this study was to better identify symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
      with the intent to prescribe better and more helpful treatment options for patients
      demonstrating these symptoms.
