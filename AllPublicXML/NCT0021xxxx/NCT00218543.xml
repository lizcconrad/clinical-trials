  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are
      at greater risk for having a substance use disorder compared to people who do not have ADHD.
      Rates of cocaine abuse in adults with ADHD are significantly higher than they are in adults
      who do not have ADHD. Some clinicians suggest that adults with ADHD may abuse cocaine in
      order to self-medicate their ADHD symptoms. Atomoxetine is a drug that has been effective in
      treating ADHD. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in reducing cocaine
      use in people with ADHD who abuse cocaine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ADHD is a neurologic disorder that is thought to be caused by chemical imbalances of certain
      neurotransmitters in the brain. The disorder can cause inattention, hyperactivity, and
      impulsivity. Cocaine abuse rates in adults with ADHD are significantly higher than they are
      in adults who do not have the disorder. This may be reflective of an attempt by individuals
      with ADHD to self-treat symptoms. Atomoxetine is an FDA-approved drug that is used to
      increase the ability to pay attention and decrease impulsiveness and hyperactivity in
      children and adults with ADHD. The drug is in a class of medications called selective
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine, a
      natural substance in the brain that affects a person's attention and impulsivity. It is
      possible that reducing ADHD symptoms in cocaine abusers with ADHD will help decrease their
      need for cocaine. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of atomoxetine in reducing
      cocaine use in people with ADHD who abuse cocaine.

      Participants in this open label study will receive atomoxetine for 12 weeks, and will take
      one dose each morning for the duration of the study. Doses will be increased gradually to
      minimize side effects and enhance treatment compliance. In addition, all participants will
      receive individualized relapse prevention therapy once weekly. Participants will be required
      to report to the study site three times a week to receive medication, complete questionnaires
      regarding ADHD symptoms and substance use behavior, and provide a urine sample while being
      supervised by study staff. Also, vital signs will be monitored and medication side effects
      will be assessed at each visit. Participants will report to the study site 6 months after
      starting in the study for a follow-up visit, at which time ADHD symptoms, substance use
      behavior, and social functioning will be assessed.

    <description>AARS is a self report that measures symptoms of adult ADHD. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving a 30% reduction from baseline on the AARS scale. The AARS is scored on a continuous, range 0-54. 0 being no symptoms and 54 being indicative of the most severe level of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Weekly AARS scores (continuous, range 0-54) were examined with the baseline score compared to that at the last assessment obtained and change in these scores over time. The AARS looks at adult ADHD symptoms. A score of 0 represents no symptoms and 54 would be indicative of the most severe level of symptoms.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants were seeking treatment for problems related to cocaine use and were recruited by local advertising/referrals in the New York City area. Two types of adS were placed: (1) ads for treatment of cocaine dependence, and (2) ads for treatment for cocaine dependence and possible problems with inattention and/or hyperactivity.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Initially, atomoxetine was administered at 20 mg/day for three days. This dose was then increased to 40 mg/day for four days. During the second week of the trial, the dose was increased to 60 mg/day and later increased to 80 mg/day at the start of Week 3. Patients were then maintained at 80 mg per day for four weeks. At the beginning of Week 7, patients were maintained at 80 mg/day or increased to the maximal dose of 100 mg/day if there was less than a 50% reduction of ADHD symptoms (as determined by the Adult ADHD Rating Scale; Murphy, 1996) and if the patients were tolerating the medication well. They were then maintained at 80 mg/day or 100 mg/day for the remaining six weeks of the trial. All patients received two capsules to be taken once a day in the morning.</description>

        <title>the Adult ADHD Rating Scale (AARS) (30% Reduction)</title>
        <description>AARS is a self report that measures symptoms of adult ADHD. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achieving a 30% reduction from baseline on the AARS scale. The AARS is scored on a continuous, range 0-54. 0 being no symptoms and 54 being indicative of the most severe level of symptoms.</description>

            <description>Initially, atomoxetine was administered at 20 mg/day for three days. This dose was then increased to 40 mg/day for four days. During the second week of the trial, the dose was increased to 60 mg/day and later increased to 80 mg/day at the start of Week 3. Patients were then maintained at 80 mg per day for four weeks. At the beginning of Week 7, patients were maintained at 80 mg/day or increased to the maximal dose of 100 mg/day if there was less than a 50% reduction of ADHD symptoms (as determined by the Adult ADHD Rating Scale; Murphy, 1996) and if the patients were tolerating the medication well. They were then maintained at 80 mg/day or 100 mg/day for the remaining six weeks of the trial. All patients received two capsules to be taken once a day in the morning.</description>
