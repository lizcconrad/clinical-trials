  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin is a heavy-metal complex widely used in the treatment of a variety of malignancies,
      including small cell and non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian, bladder, head and neck,
      esophageal, cervical and germ cell tumors. The administration of cisplatin is commonly
      associated with certain drug-induced toxicities that may limit their clinical utility and
      adversely affect the quality of life of patients undergoing treatment. Although many advances
      have been made in reducing some of the toxicities associated with platinum drug therapy, it
      is clear that dose-limiting nephrotoxicity remains a major stumbling block in the use of this
      compound. Subtle changes in renal function occur without overt renal insufficiency,
      consisting of a decrease in effective renal plasma flow and tubular dysfunction despite
      aggressive hydratation. Early tubular damage occurring within 1 to 3 hours after cisplatin
      administration has been demonstrated by measurement of urinary beta 2-microglobulin, a
      sensitive marker of tubular injury. The chronic lesion has become of greater concern in
      recent years as many patients have been cured or placed into long-term remission due to
      cisplatin treatment. It consists of a decrease in glomerular filtration rate, which is not
      necessary characterized by a remarkable increase in serum creatinine. Cumulative tubular
      damage has been demonstrated by increased urinary excretion of tubular enzymes such as
      alanine aminopeptidase and beta 2-microglobulin. In this setting, predicting the occurrence
      of chronic cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity remains a clinical challenge.

      Tc-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine (MAG3) is predominantly a proximal tubular secretion renal
      agent without cortical fixation indicated for dynamic renal studies to evaluate cortical
      tubular function and collecting system drainage. Tc-99m MAG3 and is the agent of choice for
      obstructive uropathy and diffuse functional abnormalities of the renal cortex. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate by means of Tc-99m MAG3 scintigraphy the acute and subacute
      impairment of tubular secretion after cisplatin administration in patients with head and neck
      cancer receiving chemotherapy.
