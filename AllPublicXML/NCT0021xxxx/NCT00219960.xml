      To determine the effect of North American ginseng on blood pressure in individuals with
      hypertension.

      Ginseng lacks proper clinical scrutiny for its effect on blood pressure (BP), in spite of
      observational evidence linking its intake to hypertension. This should be addressed
      considering the potential overlap between the prevalence of ginseng use and hypertension.

      We undertook a single centre, randomized, controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial to
      determine the effect of North American ginseng (NAG) on 24-hour BP and renal function. After
      a 4-week placebo run-in, we randomly assigned participants to NAG or placebo treatment for
      12-weeks at a dose of 3g/day. This was followed by an 8-week washout, and a subsequent
      12-week period in which the opposite treatment was consumed. At run-in, and at weeks 0 and 12
      of each treatment period, participants were fitted with an ambulatory BP monitor to assess
      24-hour BP and serum cystatin C was measured.
