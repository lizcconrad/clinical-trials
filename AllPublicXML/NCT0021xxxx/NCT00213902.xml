    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the effect of clonidine, a sympathetic modulator, to reverse cardiac
           remodeling and to improve hemodynamics in diastolic heart failure (DHF).

        2. To evaluate the effect of clonidine on neurohormones and quality of life in patients
           with DHF.

      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of clonidine
      compared to placebo in patients with DHF. A total of 70 patients with DHF will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to:

        1. placebo (n=35) or to

        2. clonidine (n=35) in a dose of 0.075 mg twice a day for the first 6 weeks followed by
           uptitration to 0.150 mg twice a day for 6 months.

      The primary outcome is the reversion of cardiac remodeling and hemodynamic parameters
      evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography.
