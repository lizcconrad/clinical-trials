  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, phase 2 randomized clinical trial of tamoxifen on mean percent
      predicted isometric muscle strength in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The
      purpose is to determine whether the triphenylethylenetamoxifen, used as adjuvant therapy in
      the treatment of breast cancer, can delay the loss of isometric muscle strength in ALS
      patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  clinically probable-laboratory supported, clinically probable, or clinically definite
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergic or idiosyncratic response to tamoxifen.

          -  Other active neurologic diseases that may produce weakness, sensory loss, or autonomic
             symptoms.

          -  Psychiatric, psychological, or behavioral symptoms that would interfere with the
             subject's ability to participate in the trial.

          -  Clinically significant cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hematologic, or endocrine
             (poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or hyperthyroidism) disease
             that may confound interpretation of the study results.

          -  Previous kidney or pancreas transplants.

          -  Significant hepatic or renal disease (AST &gt; 5 times normal, serum creatinine &gt; 2.0
             mg/dL for males or &gt; 1.8 mg/dL for females).
