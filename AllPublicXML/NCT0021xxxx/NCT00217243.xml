  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to be able to study the effects of evoked fields with magnetoencephalography (MEG)
      in two groups of patients, comparison is made with a group of healthy volunteers.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is directed at the (central and / or peripheral) mechanisms of pain and the
      cortical changes (plasticity) due to chronic non-malignant pain in two groups of patients and
      one healthy volunteer group.

      The aim of the study is further to evaluate cortical processes by MEG (and fMRI, if feasible)
      to quantify and qualify the responses, localise the generators and study the effects of a
      pain therapy.

      To search for patterns that may result in diagnostic criteria and have an indicative value
      for the treatment and the monitoring of the effects.

      Finally the study not only intends to support clinical diagnosis but also to provide tools to
      monitor treatment and support the choice (algorithm) between SCS and SAN. An algorithm,
      facilitating decision making between these two treatments, will be promoted. It should also
      provide a clinical decision tool for the use of SAN
