  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib mesylate is an inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases for platelet-derived
      growth factor (PDGF) and stem cell factor (SCF), c-Kit, and inhibits PDGF- and SCF-mediated
      cellular events. Docetaxel promotes cell growth arrest by inhibiting the deassembly of
      tubulin and by promoting at the same time microtubule assembly. Docetaxel has single agent
      activity in ovarian cancer with response rates of 30-40% in the platinum refractory setting.
      The combination of imatinib mesylate and docetaxel has potential synergistic effects, based
      on previous reports showing synergy in-vitro and in-vivo between PDGFR inhibitors or PI3K
      inhibitors and taxane chemotherapy.

      This trial will investigate the efficacy the combination of imatinib mesylate and docetaxel
      in treating patients with advanced, platinum-refractory ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal
      carcinomatosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Submit tumor and serum samples for central review

        -  Imatinib 600 mg (orally qd);

        -  Docetaxel 30mg/m2 (4 of 6 weeks);1 cycle = 6 weeks

        -  Evaluate every other cycle

      Each cycle will begin only when the granulocyte count is &gt; 1,500/mm3 and the platelet count
      is &gt; 100,000/mm3 and any other treatment-related toxicities are &lt; grade 1. If the toxicity is
      not resolved to grade 0 or 1 after three weeks, the patient will be withdrawn from the study.
      For days 8, 15, and 22 patients must have an absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/mm3 or greater
      and platelet count &gt; 75,000/mm3. Imatinib mesylate can be administered if platelets &gt;20,000
      and ANC &gt;500.
