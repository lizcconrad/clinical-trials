  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective drug treatment exists for cocaine dependence. Glutamate levels are
      disrupted with long-term cocaine use. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a drug that is metabolized
      by the body to form cysteine, an active compound that normalizes glutamate levels. The
      purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of NAC in treating cocaine
      dependent individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no effective pharmacological treatment exists for cocaine dependence. Long-term
      use of cocaine disrupts normal glutamate levels. If addicts stop using cocaine, glutamate
      levels drop, which encourages addicts to continue seeking the drug. NAC is a drug that
      increases intracellular cysteine levels, which in turn leads to normalization of glutamate
      levels. Currently, NAC is used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, heart disease, and
      acetaminophen overdose. Since NAC has the capability of restoring normal glutamate levels, it
      holds potential as a treatment for cocaine dependence. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the safety and effectiveness of NAC in treating cocaine dependent individuals. In
      addition, this study will evaluate cocaine craving and withdrawal symptoms in individuals
      taking NAC.

      Participants in this double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be randomly assigned to
      receive either NAC or placebo. All participants will undergo an initial evaluation, which
      will include a physical examination, an electrocardiogram, blood samples, urine tests, and
      cue reactivity measures. Participants in the NAC group will receive either 600 mg or 1200 mg
      of NAC, two times each day for 8 weeks. In addition, all participants will receive cognitive
      behavioral therapy throughout the study on a weekly basis. Cocaine use will be confirmed by a
      urine drug screen test, three times each week. Participants will be assessed on a number of
      biomedical and psychosocial variables known to influence cocaine treatment outcomes. After
      Week 2, participants will repeat the cue reactivity procedures, which will include measuring
      a participant's craving response when exposed to conditioned reminders of prior cocaine use.
