  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the incidence of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA
      [suppression of erythropoiesis with little or no abnormality of leukocyte or platelet
      production]) among participants with chronic renal failure (CRF), who were receiving
      treatment with epoetin alfa or other exogenous recombinant erythropoietin therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons over a
      sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the
      selection of the study group), observational (clinical study in which participants may
      receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the investigator does
      not assign participants to specific interventions) and cohort study. Study specific
      information will be collected from participants with chronic renal disease who are receiving
      recombinant erythropoietin and their treatment course will be followed for up to 2 years and
      participants will not receive any intervention in this study. Upon entering the study,
      information will be collected regarding disease history and recombinant erythropoietin
      treatment. Every 3 months thereafter, progress information will be collected, including
      recombinant erythropoietin treatment, number of red blood cells and presence of any signs of
      pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) development. Blood samples will be collected at study entry and
      every 3 months. Participants discontinuing erythropoietin will be followed only for an
      additional 12 months from the time erythropoietin is discontinued. Participants will receive
      standard-of-care treatment for their chronic renal disease from their individual
      Investigators. Participants will be primarily observed prospectively for PRCA.
