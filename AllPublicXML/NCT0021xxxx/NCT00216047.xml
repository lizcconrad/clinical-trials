  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HER2 gene amplification increases VEGF production in breast cancers; combined inhibition of
      HER2 and VEGF enhances response in xenograft models. The upregulation of VEGF in
      HER2-overexpressing breast cancers may contribute to the aggressive phenotype observed in
      HER2-positive breast cancer. New therapeutics targeting VEGF and/or its receptors may enhance
      the efficacy of trastuzumab monotherapy.

      This trial will investigate the safety and efficacy of combined HER2 and VEGF inhibition.

             history of poor compliance with antihypertensive therapy.

          -  No requirement for therapeutic anticoagulation, regular aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or
             NSAID use.

          -  No current breast feeding.

             study (at the discretion of the investigator).
