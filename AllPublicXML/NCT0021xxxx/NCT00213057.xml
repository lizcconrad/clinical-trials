  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the study were to assess the safety and acceptability of Carraguard
      applied vaginally prior to sexual intercourse for six months in both women and men; and to
      examine several dimensions of acceptability. Secondary aims were to gauge reactions to a
      non-contraceptive microbicide, to assess use dynamics among Thai couples and to observe
      preliminary indications of sexually transmitted infections and reproductive tract infections
      averted.

      The hypothesis was that Carraguard would cause little or no significant irritation, including
      lesions; and that women and men would find Carraguard acceptable.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carraguard™ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial fielded in one site in Chiang Rai,
      northern Thailand. The primary aims of the study were to assess Carraguard's safety
      (toxicity) in both men and women - including signs of local irritation, such as itching or
      burning; changes in vaginal flora (women); and incidence of abnormal external genital,
      vaginal (women), and cervical findings (women) - when applied vaginally prior to intercourse
      for 6 months; to evaluate acceptability; to gauge men's and women's reactions to a
      non-contraceptive microbicide; and to explore microbicide use dynamics in a Thai population.

      Secondary aims were to investigate sexually transmitted infections averted - including HIV,
      C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T. vaginalis, and T. pallidum (preliminary indications) in
      men and women; bacterial vaginosis and candidaisis in women; and balanitis in men; and effect
      on cervical cytology.
