           4.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for phase I patients

           The exclusion criteria are the same as above.

           The inclusion criteria are the same as above except for the following groups of
           patients, which are allowed in the phase I study:

             -  Patients with evaluable disease only (with no measurable lesions).

             -  Patients with one (and only one) line of chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC, excluding
                patients who had received prior platinium and/or gemcitabine.

             -  Patients with indicator lesions in previous radiation field.

           Measurability of indicator lesions

             -  Measurable: The lesion can be measured accurately in at least one dimension
                (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;
                10mm with spiral CT scan.

             -  Non-measurable: All other lesions including small lesions (longest diameter &lt;20 mm
                with conventional techniques or &lt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan) and truly
                non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered to be truly non-measurable include the
                following: bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/cutis/pulmonis,
                abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by imaging techniques, and
                cystic lesions.

             -  Target Lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions per organ and
                10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as
                target lesions and be recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions should be
                selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameter) and their
                suitability for accurate measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).
                A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and
                reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD is used as the reference by
                which to characterize the objective tumor response. If there are &gt; 10 measurable
                lesions, those not selected as target lesions will be considered together with
                non-measurable disease as non-target lesions.

             -  Non-target Lesions: All non-measurable lesions (or sites of disease) plus any
                measurable lesions over and above the 10 listed as target lesions. Measurements are
                not required but these lesions should be noted at baseline and should be followed
                as &quot;present&quot; or &quot;absent&quot;.

             -  Any tumour measurement relying solely on physical examination should be verified by
                a second physician.

             -  The same diagnostic imaging method must be used throughout the study to evaluate
                the lesions.

        5. TREATMENT PLAN

           5.1 Phase I study

           5.1.1 Carboplatin

           The starting dose of carboplatin is given at a fixed dose at a target AUC of 5 over 1
           hour on day 1 in both arms of the study. Carboplatin will be given before gemcitabine in
           all patients. The dose is repeated every 21 days and will be calculated using the
           Calvert formula:

           Dose of carboplatin (mg) = [calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) + 25] x 5

           The GFR will be calculated according to the Cockroft-Gault formula:

           GFR (ml/min) = (140 - age) x body weight (in kg) / 0.81 x serum creatinine (micromol/l)

           For female, the correction factor is 0.85 (x calculated GFR)

           5.1.2 Infusional gemcitabine

           Infusional gemcitabine is given at a constant rate of 10 mg/m2 per minute in all
           patients on days 1 and 8, the cycle is repeated every 21 days. Dose escalation is
           achieved by increasing the duration of infusion. The total dose of gemcitabine is
           re-constituted in 500 ml of normal saline and infused through a peripheral or central
           venous line.

           5.2.1 Treatment courses

           Prior to initiating treatment, eligible patients will be randomised to receive
           gemcitabine given either in the standard short 30 minutes infusion, or constant rate
           prolonged infusion over the duration determined in the phase I study. All patients in
           both arms will receive carboplatin at a dose of AUC of 5 over 1 hour.

           Standard arm

           Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 over 30 min,
           day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days

           Study arm

           Carboplatin AUC of 5 over 1 hour, day 1, followed by Gemcitabine 10 mg/m2/min at MTD,
           day 1 and 8 Cycle is repeated every 21 days

           Supportive treatment

             -  All patients should receive pre-medications to prevent nausea and vomiting
                according to local policy.

             -  No prophylactic growth factors are allowed.

             -  Growth factor is allowed only in the rescue setting, eg. prolonged grade 4
                neutropenia for more than 7 days, or for febrile neutropenia.

           5.2.2 Dosing in cycle 2 and subsequent cycles

           The next treatment cycle will begin on schedule providing

           • There is no evidence of tumour progression

             -  Neutrophils ~ 2 x 109/L

             -  Platelets ~ 100,000 x 109/l

             -  Absence of grade 2 or above non-haematological toxicity

           5.2.3 Dose modifications

           5.2.3.1 General rules

             -  No intra-patient dose escalation is allowed.

             -  Any patient who requires a dose reduction will not be eligible for any dose
                escalation for the remainder of the study.

             -  Treatment may be delayed up to day 35 to allow a patient sufficient time for
                recovery from treatment related toxicity. Any patient who cannot proceed to the
                next cycle by day 35 will be discontinued from the study.

           5.2.3.2 Dose modifications based on haematologic toxicity

           Adjustment based on day 8 count Platelets (x 109/l) ANC (x 109/l) Action &gt; 75 and &gt; 1.0
           Proceed with day 8 dose &gt; 75 and 0.5 - 1.0 Proceed with reduced dose 50 - 75 and ~ 0.5
           Proceed with reduced dose &lt; 50 and/or &lt; 0.5 Omit dose When day 8 dose is reduced, the
           same reduced dose will be used for the following cycle.

           When day 8 dose is omitted, the cycle is completed, and the next cycle will be scheduled
           on day 22, with dose reduction.

           Dose adjustment based on nadir count Platelets (x 109/l) ANC (x 109/l) Action ~ 25 with

           previous infusion duration Off study

           5.2.3.3 Dose modifications for non-haematologic toxicity

           Any grade 3 or 4 non-haematologic toxicity, except for nausea and vomiting and fatigue
           and reversible transaminitis, will render patient off study.

           Non-haematologic toxicity must be less than grade 2 before proceeding to the next cycle.
           If they are higher than grade 2, treatment is delayed for 1 week. Treatment may be
           delayed for a maximum of 2 weeks.

           5.2.4 Treatment duration

           Responding patients will receive up to six cycles of chemotherapy.

           After treatment completion or withdrawal, patients may continue to receive further
           treatment at the discretion of their physician.

             -  Serum pregnancy test, if applicable

             -  Dipstick urinalysis - if dipstick is positive for protein or blood, a complete
                microscopic examination is required

           8.3 Evaluation during treatment

           Prior to day 1 of each cycle

           • History and physical examination

             -  Assessment of performance status

             -  Full blood count, electrolytes and liver enzymes (if day15 levels are abnormal).

             -  Urine dipstick analysis, if the baseline result is abnormal

             -  Clinical tumour measurements should be obtained prior to every cycle of treatment

             -  Radiographic tumour measurements should be obtained after every 2 cycles of
                treatment.

             -  Modify dose of the next cycle if necessary (see section 5.2.3).

           Day 15 assessment

           • Full blood count, electrolytes and liver enzymes

           8.4 Evaluation of response

           Patients will be evaluable for response after 2 cycles of therapy. Clinical tumour
           measurements should be performed prior to every cycle of treatment. Radiographic tumour
           measurements should be obtained after every 2 cycles of treatment.

           If a patient meets the response criteria (see section 7) for CR, PR or SD for the first
           time, another clinical and radiographic tumour assessment will be performed 4 or more
           weeks later to document that the response has lasted at least 4 weeks.

           Clinical tumour assessment after every cycle and radiographic tumour response after
           every 2 cycles will continue until completion of treatment or patient withdrawal.

           8.5 Post-treatment follow-up

           Responding patients will be reviewed every 2 monthly after completion of chemotherapy.
           Clinical tumour assessment will be carried out 2 monthly. Radiographic tumour assessment
           will be done every 4 monthly. These will continue until disease progression is
           documented.

           Patients who never had a response, and patients with disease progression after a
           previously documented response will be followed every 3 monthly for survival data.

      9. TREATMENT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL

      A patient will be considered as completing the treatment if:

        -  Patient has completed 6 cycles of therapy.

        -  Patient has a confirmed CR or confirmed PR and received at least 4 cycles of therapy and
           the investigator does not feel further therapy is indicated.

        -  Patient maintained a status SD for at least 8 weeks on treatment and received at least 2
           cycles of treatment.

        -  Patient has PD after completing at least one full course of treatment.

        -  A patient is removed from the study due to unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients may be withdrawn from the treatment for the following reasons:

        -  Adverse experience, including intercurrent illness or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  If attending physician thinks a change of therapy would be in the best interest of the
           patient.

        -  Protocol violation (including non-compliance).

        -  Patient withdrawal at his/her request, for reasons other than those above.

        -  Lost to follow-up.

      All patients will be followed for status of disease and survival until death. 10. QUALITY OF
      LIFE (QoL) ASSESSMENT

      It is essential to explain to the patient that the QoL assessment is an important part of the
      trial, and that all sections should be answered even if the patient feels them to be
      irrelevant. It should be emphasized that the completion of these forms helps doctors find out
      more about the effects of treatment on patients' well-being.

      A named contact person other than the responsible clinician managing the patient in the
      context of the trial, must be appointed to take responsibility for the administration,
      collection and checking of the completed EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 questionnaire. The
      questionnaire must be taken before consultation with the clinician, according to the EORTC
      guidelines for QoL assessment. They should be checked to ensure that all questions have been
      answered; if necessary go back to the patient immediately and ask him or her to fill in any
      missing items. If an assessment is missed because of administrative failure, the patient
      should be contacted by telephone or letter and an arrangement should be made for the
      questionnaire to be taken within a week of the scheduled assessment.

      The questionnaire may be filled in by the patient if he/she is able to read and understand
      the language of the questionnaire. Otherwise, the named person for administering the QoL
      should read out the questions as written, in the language the patient understands, and record
      the response to each question without prejudicing his/her answer. The mode of delivery should
      be noted in the questionnaire.

      11. RANDOMISATION PROCEDURE

      Study participants will be randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine given in the
      conventional 30 minutes infusion, or protracted infusion, both in combination with
      carboplatin.

      11.1 Stratification

      Stratified randomization will be carried out using the minimization method based on the
      following factors:

      (i) Centre (National University Hospital, Sydney Cancer Centre, Johns Hopkins-NUH
      International Medical Centre) (ii) Karnofsky performance status (90 - 100% vs 70 - 80%) (iii)
      Stage of disease (IIIB vs IV)

      11.2 Registration

      Patients will be entered into the trial by a telephone call to the National Medical Research
      Council (NMRC) Clinical Trials &amp; Epidemiology Research Unit (CTERU), Singapore (+65 220-1292)
      between 0830 to 1730 hours Monday to Friday, and 0830 to 1230 hours Saturday (Singapore
      time), or by Fax (+65 220-1485), stating that the patient is to be entered into the CTRG L08
      or SQLU02 trial.

      Informed written consent for entry into the study should be obtained prior to randomization.
      All eligibility criteria and consent form will be checked, and the stratification factors
      stated before treatment is allocated. The patient will be randomized to long infusional
      gemcitabine (L) or 30- minute short infusion gemcitabine (S), and allocated a trial number.
      The design will involve equal allocation of patients to the two treatments. Confirmation fax
      will be sent to the investigator.

      12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      The sample size calculation is carried out based on the statistical selection theory
      criterion as detailed in Simon et al (62) and Gibbons et al (63). Assuming a 90% probability
      of correctly selecting the best treatment, and anticipating a baseline response rate of 40%,
      then to detect a 15% superiority of the best treatment over the other, a trial size of 37
      patients per treatment arm would be required. The total accrual target would thus be 74
      patients.

      13. STATISTICAL ANALYSES

      Statistical analysis of all study endpoints will be carried out on an intention-to-treat
      basis. In the event of lost to follow-up, patients will still be included in the analysis for
      the duration that they are observed. The inherent comparability of results in this randomized
      phase II design using the statistical selection theory assures that the two treatments can be
      reliably ranked when large differences are obtained.

      The best response will be used in the analysis of objective tumour response. In the case of
      adverse event, where multiple events of the same kind has occurred in a patient, only the
      maximum grade will be documented for the analysis. The tumour response rates and toxicities
      between treatment groups will be compared descriptively using estimates of proportions.

      The response duration and time to response for responding patients will be assessed using
      appropriate descriptive statistics. The evaluation of progression-free and overall survival
      will be carried out using the Kaplan-Meier technique at 1-year follow-up. In the case of
      progression-free survival, patients whose disease has not progressed will be censored at the
      date last known to be alive. Similarly, the analysis of overall survival censors patients who
      are lost to follow-up or who remained alive at the date last known to be alive.

      For each QoL dimension, changes in scores over time will be compared between treatment arms
      by means of appropriate graphical representation or descriptive statistics.

      No interim analysis is planned for this randomised phase II trial.

      14. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

      14.1 IRB/Ethics committee

      Before study initiation, the protocol will be submitted for review and approval by the
      hospital and Ministry of Health research and ethics committee or equivalent group. Approval
      of the protocol and informed consent must be obtained.

      14.2 Patient information

      The responsible physician will inform the patient about the background and current knowledge
      of the treatment under study with special reference to known activity and toxicity. The
      patient will be told about the investigative nature of this treatment and in particular, the
      randomization process involved in this study. The patient will be told of his or her right to
      withdraw from the study at any time without any penalty with regards to the continuation of
      care at this institution and by the same physicians as he chooses. Before accrual, all
      patients will sign a written, informed consent form.

      14.3 Informed consent

      Informed consent should meet the requirement of the latest revision of the Declaration of
      Helsinki and any applicable regulations and guidelines such as the Good Clinical Practice
      (Singapore).

      The study will be completely explained to each prospective candidate and the subject must
      give consent by signing and dating the consent form.

      Consent must be obtained before any protocol-required procedures are performed, including any
      procedures not part of normal patient care.

      Plasma dFdC and dFdU levels

      Ten millilitres of blood will be drawn at 0 hours (baseline), 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 10
      minutes before the end of the infusion, and 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours after the end of the
      infusion. The blood will be drawn into 10 ml tubes (green topped) containing heparin and 5
      micromol tetrahydrouridine. The tubes are then centrifuged at 3300 rpm for 15 minutes and the
      supernatant plasma is then transferred to plain tubes (red topped) for immediate storage at
      -80oC. Samples will be labeled with the patient's name, ID number, date, exact time of sample
      and protocol number. A pharmacokinetic form will accompany the plasma samples to the
      Pharmacology laboratory in the Department of Pharmacology, National University of Singapore,
      c/o Prof Lee How Sung.

      DFdC and dFdU levels in plasma will be measured using reverse phase HPLC, as described by
      Grunewald (22). Briefly, 20 microl to 50 microl of plasma is injected onto a C18 mBondapak
      analytical column (Waters Associates, Inc.). Components will be separated with a mobile phase
      consisting of a 30 minute linear gradient starting with 100% solution A (0.5M ammonium
      acetate, pH = 6.8) and ending with 60% solution B (50% methanol in deionised water). Flow
      rate is at 1.5 ml/min. Detection wavelengths are 275 nm and 262 nm for dFdC and dFdU,
      respectively.

      16.2 Intracellular dFdCTP levels

      Samples of blood will be collected to assay intracellular dFdCTP. Only 3 samples per patient,
      obtained 10 minutes after the start and 10 minutes before the end of the infusion of
      gemcitabine, and one in the middle of infusion, will be assayed for dFdCTP.

      Plasma is first separated from the blood by centrifugation at 3300 rpm for 20 minutes.
      Mononuclear cells are then isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and
      deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates are extracted with 0.4 NHClO4, and the acid-insoluble
      material is removed by centrifugation. The supernatant is then carefully neutralized to pH 7
      with potassium hydroxide, and the precipitated KClO4 is then removed by centrifugation. An
      ion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography method is then used to separate and
      quantitate the dFdCTP.

      17. STUDY ADMINISTRATION

      17.1 Drug accountability

      Stocks of gemcitabine will be supplied by Eli Lilly for trial purposes, and all these vials
      will be accounted for at the site pharmacy.

      17.2 Maintenance of patients records

      CTRG clinical report forms will be used to record data for this study. All patient clinical
      report forms will be faxed to the CTRG Office (+65 777-5545). A copy of each patients
      eligibility report form, randomization report form (for phase II), study schedule, consent
      forms, laboratory and radiological reports, and QoL assessment will be kept in the CTRG
      Office. All records will be kept for a period of 6 years following the date of study closure
      according to Singapore GCP guidelines
