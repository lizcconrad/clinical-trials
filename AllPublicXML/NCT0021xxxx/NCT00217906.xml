      This project will evaluate the effectiveness of a Head Start-based early intervention for
      designed to improve asthma management skill and practices of parents, pre-school children and
      Head Start staff.

      BACKGROUND:

      While increased asthma morbidity and mortality have been observed across all ethnicities,
      results from several studies have found that asthma morbidity has increased
      disproportionately in low-income African American children. Elementary school-based asthma
      education programs have shown promise in improving asthma management, and reducing asthma
      morbidity in this high-risk population, however, the fastest growing asthma risk is
      associated with children young than six. By elementary age many parents and children with
      asthma have well-established patterns of inappropriate asthma management that may be
      difficult to change. To date, no research has examined the impact of early intervention for
      asthma management in low-income, high-risk children.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Head Start sites will be randomized to either a minimal intervention control group or the A+
      Asthma early intervention program designed to educate and assist Head Start teachers and
      family service coordinators to: optimize classroom management of asthma, educate, facilitate
      and reinforce appropriate parental medical and behavioral management of asthma, and instruct,
      model and reinforce early asthma knowledge and age-appropriate skills for preschool age
      children.

      The primary outcome that the study was designed to evaluate Head Start absences/days
      enrolled, determined by review of Head Start attendance records.

      The secondary outcomes specified in the protocol are health care utilization (emergency
      department visits, hospitalizations, primary care visits), asthma symptoms (restricted
      activity, symptom-free days, day and nighttime symptoms), asthma medications, parents'
      asthma-related quality of life, and parent, child and teacher asthma knowledge and management
      practices.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the &quot;End Date&quot; entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
