      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine and topotecan, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving gemcitabine together with topotecan
      works in treating patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
      peritoneal cavity cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of gemcitabine and topotecan in patients
           with recurrent or persistent platinum-refractory ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary
           peritoneal cavity cancer.

        -  Determine the response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1
      and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond
      documentation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of courses 2, 4, and 6, and then at 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 3
      years.
