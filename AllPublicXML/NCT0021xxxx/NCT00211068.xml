  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect historical occurrences of risk factors that are
      potentially associated with the development of anti-erythropoietin (EPO) antibody positive
      pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) in participants with chronic kidney disease who have been
      recently treated with epoetin alfa (EPREX).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter (study conducted at multiple sites), case-control (study that compare
      individuals with a disease or condition [cases] to a group of individuals without the disease
      or condition [controls] to determine the possible factor which increased disease incidence),
      retrospective (a study in which the participants are identified and then followed backward,
      as time passes) study. Retrospective risk factor data will be collected for control
      participants matched to the subset of participants in Protocol EPO-IMU-301 identified as
      having chronic kidney disease and anti-EPO antibody positive PRCA that began while the
      participant was receiving treatment with EPREX (index participants). For each index
      participant, up to 4 matched non-PRCA control participants with chronic kidney disease will
      be enrolled in this study. Approximately 600 control participants will be enrolled in this
      study. Control participants will be selected from the same site as the index participant and
      the data will be collected from the date closest to the reference date (loss of efficacy
      [drop in hemoglobin of greater than 2 g/dL/month] was first seen) that the control
      participant satisfies all study inclusion and exclusion criteria. The optional
      pharmacogenomic part (testing for polymorphisms and haploid types of the erythropoietin gene)
      will be recorded for the control participants who will sign the pharmacogenomics part of the
      study. No drug administration or treatment will be mandated by this study. Safety evaluation
      will include assessment of adverse events.
