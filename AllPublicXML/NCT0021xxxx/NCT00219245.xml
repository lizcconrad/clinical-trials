  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who completed the 12-week double blind protocol may enter this 26-week, open-label
      extension. This extension will give patients who complete the study an opportunity to receive
      treatment with open-label rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day and further evaluation for the cognitive
      deficits related to traumatic brain injury. This extension will enable further evaluation of
      patients, as well as analyses to be conducted examining response to treatments in the
      original drug and placebo groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a deficit in the areas of attention and/or memory.

          -  Have current cognitive deficits which were present from the time of the injury, are
             persistent, and are deemed to be the result of the brain injury;

          -  Be at least 12 months post brain injury;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of a major brain surgery;

          -  A penetrating brain injury (e.g., gun shot wound);

          -  A current diagnosis of epilepsy;

          -  Had more than one seizure in the past year (patients who have had a single seizure
             within a year post-injury will be considered on a case by case basis);

          -  Previous exposure to rivastigmine.
