    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two antibiotics in
      the treatment of complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis (kidney
      infection). A 5-day course of 750 milligrams of levofloxacin given intravenously and/or by
      mouth once daily will be compared to a 10-day course of 400 milligrams of ciprofloxacin given
      intravenously and/or 500 milligrams of ciprofloxacin given by mouth twice daily.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Levofloxacin has been approved in both its oral and intravenous forms to treat a large number
      of infections caused by bacteria. Levofloxacin and other members of a class of antibiotics
      known as fluoroquinolones have been used successfully to treat urinary and kidney infections.
      This study will compare the effectiveness and safety of levofloxacin given for 5 days to that
      of another fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, given for 10 days in treating complicated urinary
      tract infection or acute pyelonephritis (kidney infection). A shorter course of antibiotics
      may help patients take all of their medication, which is critically important for curing the
      infection. A shorter course may also help prevent the development of bacteria that cannot be
      killed by antibiotics. Patients will take 750 milligrams of levofloxacin intravenously and/or
      by mouth once daily for 5 days or 400 milligrams of ciprofloxacin intravenously and/or 500
      milligrams of ciprofloxacin by mouth twice daily for 10 days. To prevent the study doctor,
      study staff and patients from knowing which study drug they are taking, all study drug will
      manufactured to look the same and patients on the 5-day regimen will be given placebo for the
      last 5 days of their participation in the study. The intravenous infusion bags will be
      covered so that the solution cannot be seen. The objective of the study is to demonstrate
      that 5 days of levofloxacin once daily is at least as effective as 10 days of ciprofloxacin
      twice daily in treating complicated urinary tract infection or acute pyelonephritis. Patients
      will take 750 milligrams of levofloxacin intravenously and/or by mouth once daily for 5 days
      or 400 milligrams of ciprofloxacin intravenously and/or 500 milligrams of ciprofloxacin by
      mouth twice daily for 10 days.
