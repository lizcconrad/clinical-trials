  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) of six different dosing
      regimens of epoetin alfa (PROCRITÂ®) in anemic critically ill subjects

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the optimal dosing regimen for achieving and maintaining target Hb concentrations
      in various clinical settings remains incompletely defined. Both IV and SC routes of
      administration are used in the clinical setting and have been shown to be effective despite
      different bioavailability and pharmacokinetic profiles. This study is designed to describe
      the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of several different epoetin alfa dosing
      regimens administered by both IV and SC routes in anemic critically ill patients admitted to
      a critical care area. The dosing regimens selected will be compared among themselves and
      against the 40,000 IU SC weekly dosing regimen (A) being used in a large registration trial.
      Specifically, the six dosing regimens were selected to gather PK and PD data about the
      following questions: 1) Will an early large Cmax, achieved by IV dosing, stimulate more
      reticulocytosis? (IV vs. SC dosing regimens A vs. B, C vs. D, E vs. F); 2) Do smaller more
      frequent doses of the same total dose result in the same PD profile? (A vs. C, B vs. D); 3)
      Does an IV load improve PD response? (E and F vs. C and D); 4) Do large frequent loading
      doses accumulate? (A vs. E and B vs. F). Results of this study will provide a pharmacokinetic
      foundation for understanding and potentially maximizing the pharmacodynamic effects of
      different dosing options in the critically ill patient. In order to maximize subject safety,
      all dosing will cease when subject's hemoglobin is &gt; 13g/dL. Group A:40 K SC Qw: Days 1,8,15;
      Group B:40 K IV Qw: Days 1,8,15; Group C:15 K SC QOD: Days 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15; Group D:15 K
      IV QOD: Days 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15; Group E:40 K SC Days 1 and 3, then 15 K SC QOD: Days
      5,7,9,11,13,15; Group F: 40 K IV Days 1 and 3, then 15 K SC QOD: Days 5,7,9,11,13,15
