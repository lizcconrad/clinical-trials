      The objective of the study is to identify and validate predictive markers of anakinra
      responsiveness in RA patients by a transcriptomic approach.

      Patients with active RA (ACR criteria) were given subcutaneous anakinra (100mg/d) 3
      associated with metotrexate. Anakinra efficacy was evaluated at week 12, using the EULAR
      response criteria.

      A blood sample was collected just before the onset of anakinra treatment and total RNAs were
      extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The [33P] radiolabeled mRNAs were
      hybridized (duplicate or triplicate) over a set of 10.000 human cDNA probes spotted at a high
      density on nylon membranes. Data were normalized and filtered to allow the comparison between
      RNA samples. Statistical analyses were performed with the R software and hierarchical
      clustering was performed with the Cluster and Tree View softwares.
