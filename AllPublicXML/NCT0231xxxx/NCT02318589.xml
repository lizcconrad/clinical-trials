      This Phase I trial will establish the recommended phase II dose of eribulin in combination
      with fixed doses of oral irinotecan in adolescents and young adults with relapsed or
      refractory solid tumors. Eribulin will be administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a
      21-day cycle, while irinotecan will be administered orally on days 1-5. Patients will be
      assigned an eribulin dose level at the time of enrollment using a 3 + 3 Phase I design.

             co-administration of eribulin and irinotecan and must not have had disease progression
             while receiving either eribulin or irinotecan. Patients must have fully recovered from

               -  Biologic (anti-neoplastic agent): At least 7 days since the completion of therapy
                  with a biologic agent. For agents that have known adverse events occurring beyond
                  7 days after administration, this period must be extended beyond the time during
                  which adverse events are known to occur. The duration of this interval must be
                  discussed with the PI of the study

               -  Immunotherapy: At least 6 weeks since the completion of any type of immunotherapy

                  above institutional normal

          -  Contraception: Because chemotherapeutic agents may be teratogenic, males and females
             of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration

                  eligible

               -  Investigational Drugs: Patients who are currently receiving another
                  investigational drug are not eligible

               -  Anti-cancer Agents: Patients who are currently receiving other anti-cancer agents

                  rifampin, voriconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, aprepitant, or St. John's
                  Wort are not eligible

             safety monitoring requirements of the study

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with eribulin and irinotecan. In
             addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy
