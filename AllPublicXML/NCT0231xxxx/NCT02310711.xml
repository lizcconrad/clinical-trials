  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a single-center, prospective, pilot, observation study to tabulate and
      measure the changes that occur during treatment and healing for breast conserving therapy
      (BCT) in women with non-metastatic breast cancer for comparison to the multiscale model of
      breast lumpectomy and healing in order to identify targets for improving BCT. The study will
      be comprised of 12 de novo breast cancer patients with non-metastatic breast cancer
      undergoing BCT. Subjects will be enrolled in the study during the 3 weeks prior to receiving
      their BCT surgery and will be followed for six months after the BCT surgery. A total of 6
      visits (not including the surgery) are planned.

      This is a single-center, prospective, pilot observation study. Eligible subjects who enroll
      in this study will begin at the time of informed consent, which will occur during the
      pre-operative, surgical evaluation time. Once consented, a 3-dimensional 180° camera surface
      image will be taken and a pain-scale score will be completed. Data from the medical history
      will be recorded. As standard of care, the surgery will be scheduled and performed. Following
      surgery, a series of 5 standard of care visits will occur over the subsequent 6 months, that
      will include research measures of local ultrasound x5 and 3-dimensional surface imaging x3.
      The pain scale score will be administered pre and post ultrasound on the 5 post-operative
      visits. A judging of the cosmesis will take place at weeks 10 and 26 by independent surgeons.
      The participant's role in the study will be completed after the week 24 visit.
