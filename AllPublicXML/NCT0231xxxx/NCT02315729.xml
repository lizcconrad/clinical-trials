  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify potential markers for curve progression in
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Despite its prevalence and impact on child health, the
      etiology of AIS and molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain
      poorly understood. Clinical criteria and features cannot adequately predict which children,
      diagnosed with mild disease, will undergo subsequent curve progression requiring
      intervention.

      The investigators hypothesize that alterations in specific genetic markers will be correlated
      with the progression of AIS curves over time. Thus, these markers could be used in the future
      to develop a reliable, inexpensive and relatively non-invasive cell based diagnostic test to
      (1) predict spinal curve progression in AIS, (2) select patients likely to benefit from early
      surgical intervention, and (3) potentially screen for asymptomatic children at risk of
      developing idiopathic scoliosis.
