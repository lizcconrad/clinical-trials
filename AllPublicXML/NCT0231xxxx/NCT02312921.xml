  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the payment and delivery system reform is to reduce disparities in oral
      health and dental care access of low-income mothers and children living in rural Oregon
      counties. The target population is children, pregnant women and new mothers enrolled in
      Oregon Health Plan (OHP) in rural Oregon.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To implement a payment plan model based on global budgeting and Alternative Quality Contract
      (pay-for-performance) for dental providers within Advantage Dental Services, LLC with the
      goal of incentivizing implementation of delivery system changes aimed at reducing disparities
      in access and oral health for low-income mothers and children living in rural Oregon
      counties.

      To implement delivery system changes where a team of dental providers (dentists, dental
      hygienists, case managers, community outreach workers and others) within Advantage Dental
      Services, LLC provide evidence-based screening, risk assessment and primary preventive care
      in non-conventional community settings (WIC, Head Start and similar settings) and seamless,
      timely and appropriate evidence-based care in Advantage dental clinics.

      To evaluate and document the payment and delivery system changes to assess whether the
      changes result in (1) reductions in disparities in access for low-income mothers and
      children; (2) efficiency in allocation of limited resources with the application of
      evidence-based screening; (3) seamless and appropriate care for mothers and their child at
      high risk of dental caries

    <description>Allied dental personnel provide screening and preventive services in community settings and case managers serve as patient navigators to arrange referrals of children who need dentist services. The intervention is paired with a compensation system for high performance (pay-for-performance) with efficient performance monitoring. PREDICT focuses on: 1) identifying eligible children and gaining caregiver consent for services in community settings (e.g., schools); 2) providing risk-based preventive and caries stabilization services efficiently at these settings; 3) providing curative care in dental clinics; and 4) incentivizing local delivery teams to meet performance benchmarks.</description>
