  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A critical issue of the clinical syndrome in liver failure is the accumulation of toxins not
      cleared by the failing liver. Based on this hypothesis, albumin dialysis is used to remove
      those substances. Albumin dialysis with recirculation (MARS) is the most used system but
      required specific system and expert environment. Alternative system without recirculation
      (SPAD) is less expensive and can be realised in critical care services trained to extrarenal
      epuration. The primary objective of this study is to compare biological and clinical
      efficacy, pulsatility index of middle cerebral artery modification and tolerance of both
      systems.

      This is a prospective, open, cross-over comparative study of two albumin dialysis system.
      Each patient will receive the two systems in an randomly assessed order. Patients are divided
      up according to bilirubin plasmatic level. (250µmol/L to 400 µmol/L and &gt;400µmol/L).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of total plasmatic bilirubin level before and after two albumin dialysis systems : with recirculation (MARS™ system) and without recirculation (SPAD™ system)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before and at the end of a MARS™ dialysis (8h) and before and at the end of a SPAD™ system dialysis (10h). Participants will be followed for the duration of critical care stay, an expected average of 1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Determination of total plasmatic bilirubin level will be performed by arterial sample and expressed in µmol/liter. Total plasmatic bilirubin purification will be compared between the two dialysis systems: total plasmatic bilirubin level will be measured before and at the end of MARS™ dialysis (8 hours) and before and at the end of SPAD™ dialysis (10 hours) ; the two variations will be compared. Each patient will receive the two dialysis systems separated by a free interval that will last between 12 and 48 hours.</description>

    <description>Determination of hepatic encephalopathy score will be performed by clinical evaluation. Hepatic encephalopathy score will be compared between the two dialysis systems: hepatic encephalopathy score will be measured before and at the end of MARS™ dialysis (8 hours) and before and at the end of SPAD™ dialysis (10 hours) ; the two variations will be compared.

    <description>Tolerance will be evaluated by effect of albumin dialysis on coagulation indices : prothrombin time (seconds) and international normalized ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time ratio, fibrinogen level (g/L), factor V level (%), platelet count (×10(9) /L), hemoglobin level (g/L), red cell count (10(12)/L), hematocrit level (%). Coagulation indices will be measured by an arterial sample before and at the end of MARS™ dialysis (8 hours) and before and at the end of SPAD™ dialysis (10 hours) ; the two variations will be compared. Each patient will receive the two dialysis systems separated by a free interval that will last between 12 and 48 hours.</description>
