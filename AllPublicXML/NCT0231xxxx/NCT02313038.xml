    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) pose a serious health threat to population. PCI using drug
      eluting stents (DES), as a well-proved and booming measure in CHD management, is invasive and
      of high cost, however the knowledge about the real-life DES use and the efficacy and safety
      in China is limited. By consecutively recruiting first-ever PCI patients in 30 geographically
      representative highest-rank hospitals, this study will examine the prognosis in groups with
      different brands of DES, and various real-life factors, that may affect patients recovery
      after the procedure. Evidence for clinical practice and health resource allocation will be
      established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes in future finally.

      In this study, 6000 patients who underwent the first-ever drug eluting stents (DES)
      deployment during the index hospitalization will be consecutively recruited in 30 tertiary
      hospitals scattered all over China. At study entry, participants will be interviewed during
      their index hospitalization, to collect information about symptoms, functioning, quality of
      life, and medical care. Demographic characteristics, medical history, clinical features,
      diagnostic tests, medications, procedures, and in-hospital outcomes of patients will be
      abstracted from medical records by well trained professional abstractors. And CAG imaging
      will be reviewed by national and international expert panels. At 1 month, 6 month, and 12
      month after discharge, participants will return to the clinic for follow up visits, a
      face-to-face interview will be conducted to get information about clinical events, symptoms,
      functioning, quality of life, and medical care during the recovery period. At 1-Month and
      12-Month follow-up visit, blood and urine sample will be collected. Participants' blood
      samples will be stored for future biologic and genetic studies. This study will examine the
      prognosis in groups with different brands of DES, and various real-life factors, that may
      affect patients recovery after the procedure. Evidence for clinical practice and health
      resource allocation will be established based on the findings, to improve patients outcomes
      in future finally.
