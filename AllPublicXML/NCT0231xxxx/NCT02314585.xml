      This study looks to see the effects of a home based exercise program on falls in people with
      MS.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this project are four-fold: 1) to determine if a 6-month home-based targeted
      exercise program results in immediate and sustained reduction in falls risk and incidence ;
      2) to identify the factors that contribute to a reduction in fall risk and incidence; 3) to
      determine if a decrease in physiological fall risk and/or fall incidence results in increased
      quality of life and participation in older adults with MS; and 4) to determine the
      association between cognition, environment and comorbidities on future falls and intervention
      efficacy.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of this investigation is physiological fall risk. Physiological fall risk will be determined by the short form of the physiological profile assessment (PPA). The PPA is a validated tool to assess physiological function related to fall risk by combining measures of vision, proprioception, lower-limb strength, postural sway, and cognitive function. It is predictive of future fall risk in persons with MS. The PPA provides a fall risk score that is based on the quantification of key physiological markers (e.g. vision, leg strength, proprioception, balance, cognition, etc) and comparison of those markers to age and gender matched normative data. The PPA provides a therapeutically relevant prognostic predictor of falls and this makes it an ideal outcome measure of investigations evaluating fall prevention strategies.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Identification of Fall Risk Factors</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome of fall incidence will be monitored prospectively for 6 months prior to and immediately following the 24 week intervention period via a fall diary A fall will be defined as an event where an individual unintentionally comes to the ground. Participants will receive a biweekly phone call and weekly text to inquire if they have suffered a fall and to remind them to complete the diary. If a fall is reported details of falls, information about injury, and other pertinent information will be attained. The fall diary will be contained in a brightly labeled binder and participants will be asked to mark if they have or have not fallen on a given day. At the end of each month participants will mail the dairy back in a preaddressed prepaid envelope to the research lab. The fall calls/diary will allow for the determination of number of falls, and fall rate per person year.</description>
