  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to characterize the effects of running-specific leg prosthetic
      stiffness and height during on performance during running and sprinting to optimize
      running-specific prosthesis prescription. The investigators will collect biomechanical and
      metabolic data from participants with unilateral and bilateral below the knee amputations
      while they run at different speeds on a treadmill. This data will be used to understand the
      effects of running prostheses. Then, these parameters will be used to develop prosthetic
      prescription techniques for people with below the knee amputations.
