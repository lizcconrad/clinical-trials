  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to monitor iodine nutrition in Switzerland in order to inform the
      authorities regarding iodine content in iodized salt. As a proxy for the entire population
      the investigators will study school aged children, pregnant women and women of reproduction
      age.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a national sample of school aged children (n=990), pregnant women (n=700) and women of
      reproductive age (n=700) urinary iodine will be determined in order to assess iodine
      nutrition in Switzerland. In addition, in both groups of women a blood sample will be taken
      for the determination of thyroid hormones, iron- and folate status. Questionnaires will be
      used for the determination of dietary iodine and salt intake as well as sociodemographic
      parameters.
