    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of ice pack to topical
      eutectic mixture of local anesthesia (EMLA) for pain control in diode 810 nm laser axillary
      hair removal.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.
