  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periorbital edema and ecchymosis are common morbidities in the post-operative period after
      rhinoplasty. Lateral osteotomy techniques used to reshape the bony nasal pyramid are large
      contributing factors to the degree of bruising and edema. This is due to injury to the
      angular vessels that are crossing the osteotomy sites. Depending on the degree of swelling
      and bruising, it can cause difficulty with visual acuity in the early post-operative period.
      Most importantly, this can be quite distressing to the patient and impact the time required
      to return to normal social activities. Numerous studies have examined various interventions
      to reduce periorbital swelling and ecchymosis. These include peri-operative steroids,
      lidocaine with epinephrine injections, fibrin sealant, permissive intra-operative hypotension
      and subperiosteal osteotomy techniques. Peri-operative steroids have been most extensively
      studied. Recent meta-analysis by Hatef et al, found that pre-operative steroids were
      effective for decreasing post-operative edema and ecchymosis. Steroids however, carry with it
      the risks of psychosis, immunosuppression, weight gain, uncontrolled blood glucose and
      avascular necrosis of the hip. As such, broadly applicable and cost-effective techniques to
      minimize post-operative edema and ecchymosis without the risk profile of steroids would be
      ideal. Taskin et al. recently examined the efficacy of the combination of intraoperative cold
      saline-soaked gauze compression and corticosteroids on rhinoplasty morbidity. The study group
      received compression with a cold saline soaked gauze to the nasal dorsum during the surgery
      and the control group received compression with a dry gauze. Both groups received a
      pre-operative dose of intravenous steroids. The study group had significantly less
      periorbital edema and ecchymosis on post-operative days 1, 3, 5 and 7. This study
      unfortunately did not examine the role of compression alone and the study was performed in
      the presence of steroids, which is not routinely utilized by all surgeons. As such, the
      proposed study will provide evidence for the use of direct compression intra-operatively
      after lateral osteotomy in order to reduce post-operative edema and ecchymosis. The findings
      of this study may provide a simple, effective and non-costly technique to minimize the
      morbidity of rhinoplasty.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is periorbital edema and ecchymosis. Post-operative photographs will be graded by two staff Otolaryngologists and two senior Otolaryngology residents. Each evaluator will be presented a photograph of a patient and be asked to grade the degree of periorbital edema and ecchymosis for the left and right side. Previously published grading scales will be used. The evaluators will be blinded to the allocated side of nasal pressure and to the post-operative day of the photographs.</description>
