    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to determine whether misoprostol administered 12 hours before
      office hysteroscopy can relieve pain more effectively compared with misoprostol administered
      3 hours before office hysteroscopy.

    <textblock>
      The interval between misoprostol administration and office hysteroscopy may have an influence
      on its effectiveness in pain reduction. There are limited data on the optimal interval from
      administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy. In previous studies, time interval
      from administration of misoprostol and office hysteroscopy ranged between 2 hours and 24
      hours.

      Till now no studies have yet investigated the optimal timing of misoprostol administration
      prior to office hysteroscopy or operative hysteroscopy. The aim of this study was to
      determine whether misoprostol administered 12 hours before office hysteroscopy can relieve
      pain more effectively compared with misoprostol administered 3 hours before office
      hysteroscopy

    <description>A small envelope including two labeled plastic bags (A &amp; B) (each bag containing either 2 misoprostol tablets(400µg) or 2 identically appearing placebo tablets) will be packaged in sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. In long interval misoprostol group, bag (A) contains misoprostol tablets and bag (B) contains placebo tablets. After signing the informed consent, the sequentially numbered sealed envelopes will be opened (according to the sequence of attendance of the patient) by the study nurse. Tablets in bag (A) will be inserted 12 hours before office hysteroscopy and tablets in bag (B) will be inserted 3 hours before office hysteroscopy.</description>

    <description>A rigid 2.9 mm hysteroscope with 30° forward oblique lens and outer sheath diameter of 5 mm will be used in the procedure. The uterine cavity will be distended by warm saline at a pressure between 60-80 mmHg. All the procedures will be performed during the proliferative phase using the vaginoscopic approach as described by Betocchi and Selvaggi in 1997. All the procedures will be diagnostic.Pain intensity will be assessed by visual analogue scale during the examination and 30 minutes after the procedure. A visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 will be used (zero indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible experienced pain).</description>
