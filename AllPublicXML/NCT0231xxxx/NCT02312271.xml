        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥18 years of age

          -  Currently tolerating enteral feeding

          -  Has enteral access

          -  Requires enteral tube feeding to provide 90% or more of their nutritional needs
             (without the use of modular(s)) for at least 21 days

          -  Having obtained his/her and/or his/her legal representative's informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Condition which contraindicates enteral feeding (i.e. intestinal obstruction)

          -  Lack of enteral access

          -  Any condition that would contraindicate use of the study product (i.e. need for severe
             fluid restriction, cow's milk protein allergy, other)

          -  Currently participating in another conflicting clinical study that would interfere
             with anticipated endpoints

          -  Judged to be at risk for poor compliance to the study protocol.

          -  Lack of informed consent.
