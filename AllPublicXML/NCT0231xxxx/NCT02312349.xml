    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder in genetically susceptible individuals
      characterized by inflammation of the small intestine due to gluten intolerance. This protein
      is found in cereals such as wheat, barley and rye. In Argentina, oats are also considered a
      toxic grain since are as highly contaminated as the previous three. For this reason, the
      acronym TACC (Trigo, avena, cebada y centono: wheat, oats, barley and centono) is used for
      their identification. An effective treatment for celiac disease consists in a gluten-free
      diet (GFD). For most patients, a gluten-free intake results in a symptomatic and pathological
      complete remission and decreases the risk of complications.

      The overall prevalence of CD is around 1% in several Western countries. An Argentinian study
      shows a 1.167 prevalence of CD in studied patients, being doubled for women than men. Another
      study in a closed population of the Health Plan of Hospital Italiano de Bs As estimated a
      prevalence of 0.22 CD diagnosis. In developed countries, for each diagnosed case there is an
      average of 5-10 cases that have not been diagnosed yet.

      CD patients and their families should be properly informed about GFD, since there are many
      factors, voluntary and involuntary, which can affect the treatment. Even though a strict diet
      is imperative, food handling awareness is equally important in order to prevent
      cross-contamination and gluten intake hidden in certain products.

      In recent years, several countries have shown an increasing interest in improving the supply
      of gluten-free foods in supermarkets, food factories and restaurants. In turn, a British
      study shows that chefs have less awareness about celiac disease than the overall population.
      Another Canadian study, which assessed the quality of life of people with CD, revealed that
      80% of them avoid eating in restaurants for fear of contamination, causing a decrease in
      their social life.

      In Argentina, there are associations that generate lists of marks and gluten-free products
      allowing safe intake of processed foods, however, it is unknown the food supply suitable for
      consumption for people with CD as well as the staff's knowledge in gluten-free food
      preparation in restaurants, pubs, pizzerias and fast food places. U.S. has quality assurance
      systems that certify good manufacturing practices and GFD handling in restaurants and selling
      local foods, although its application is not mandatory. In our country, there is no such
      certification, so food safety on restaurants can not be guaranteed.

      Eating behaviors are influenced by the reality in which people live, including food
      availability indoors and outdoors. The current lifestyle leads more and more people to make
      meals away from home, so that the variety and quality of food sold in restaurants and other
      stores conditions the consumption. Thus, the availability of &quot;safe&quot; foods in places where
      people with CD carried some of their meals, help improve adherence to the GFD.

      The aim of this study is to investigate gluten-free products' supply in elaborated food
      stores in Buenos Aires City and to discover the level of information possessed by
      manufacturers in the production of food.
