  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Mutanome Engineered RNA Immuno-Therapy (MERIT) study introduces a novel concept for
      Individualized Cancer Immunotherapy (IVAC®) to treat each patient with the relevant and
      immunogenic RNA vaccines for a given patient's tumour. The TNBC-MERIT trial uses two
      complementary strategies, the IVAC® WAREHOUSE and the IVAC® MUTANOME concept, resulting in
      two custom-made IVAC® investigational medicinal products (IMPs) (IVAC_W_bre1_uID and
      IVAC_M_uID) for each individual patient.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  The IVAC® WAREHOUSE concept is based on RNA drug products shelved in a warehouse and
           targeting shared tumour-associated antigens (TAAs). The BioNTech Group (henceforward the
           &quot;company&quot;) has identified a set of target antigens commonly expressed in TNBC. The
           selected breast cancer-associated antigens have been shown by immunogenicity testing to
           constitute suitable targets for immunotherapy and form the basis for the development of
           a novel RNA-based immunotherapy approach.

        -  The IVAC® MUTANOME concept is based on the identification of tumour-specific mutations
           by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and on-demand RNA manufacturing for use in single
           patients to target multiple neo-antigens derived from mutated epitopes. The novel
           therapeutic concept is supported by a series of research projects and high level
           publications that have led to a broad acceptance that mutation-specific T cells bear
           enormous potential to confer anti-tumoural activity in cancer patients1-5.

        -  The TNBC-MERIT study will introduce the novel therapeutic concept for the individualized
           treatment of breast cancer that is based on (i) treatment with a patient-specific
           liposome complexed RNA tailored to the antigen-expression profile of any given patient's
           tumour (IVAC® WAREHOUSE immunotherapy - IVAC_W_bre1_uID) and (ii) on treatment with de
           novo synthesized RNAs targeting up to 20 individual tumour mutations (IVAC® MUTANOME
           immunotherapy - IVAC_M_uID) following treatment with IVAC® WAREHOUSE. The scientific
           rationale for the combination of the two IVAC® approaches is based on the assumption
           that immunotherapies that (1) acknowledge tumour heterogeneity on a single-patient level
           and (2) target the whole range of antigens selectively expressed on tumours (&quot;cancer
           antigenome&quot;), including immunogenic shared and unique antigens, bear the highest
           potential to constitute an effective treatment of tumours.

    <description>• Patients enrolled in ARM1 will receive a treatment with four RNAs. This includes two to three variant RNAs selected from the IVAC®WAREHOUSE plus p53 RNA. The selection process of RNAs from the warehouse is based on RT-PCR-based profiling of RNA extracted from patient tumour sample specimens, pre-defined cut-offs and algorithms to select the three relevant RNAs for a given patient.</description>
