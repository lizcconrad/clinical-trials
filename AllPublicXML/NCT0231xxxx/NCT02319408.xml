  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient migration and activation of tumour specific effector T cells seems to be the one
      important reason for inadequate host anti-tumour immune response. Ionizing radiation can
      induce a variety of immune responses. The goal of this randomized trial is to assess if a
      preoperative single fraction low dose radiation is able to improve anti-tumour immune
      response in operable early stage lung cancer.
