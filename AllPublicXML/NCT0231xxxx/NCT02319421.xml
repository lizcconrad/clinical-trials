  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Context: Alarm fatigue is a threat to hospital patient safety. National surveys reveal that
      high alarm rates interrupt patient care, reduce trust in alarms, and lead clinicians to
      disable alarms entirely. Safety huddles offer an appropriate forum for reviewing alarm data
      and identifying patients whose high alarm rates may necessitate safe tailoring of alarm
      limits.

      Objectives: To evaluate the impact of a focused physiologic monitor alarm reduction
      intervention integrated into safety huddles that involves discussing safe monitor parameter
      adjustments on the physiologic monitor alarm rates of individual patients with high alarm
      rates who meet &quot;low acuity&quot; criteria.

      Study Design: A prospective, quasi-experimental pilot study of the impact of the huddle
      intervention on the alarm rates of low acuity high alarm rate individual patients discussed
      in huddles in the PICU. The huddle intervention will consist of a script to facilitate the
      discussion of the alarm data.

      Setting/Participants: Participants will include all low acuity patients and their providers
      in the PICU at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

      Study Interventions and Measures: The primary outcome is the rate of crisis and warning
      alarms per patient day for intervention cases as compared with others in the high alarm / low
      acuity cohort. Safety measures will include unexpected changes in patient acuity or code blue
      events within one week of monitor change or discharge.

    <description>The intervention will consist of a script to facilitate the discussion of the alarm data that will take place on weekday mornings. The script will be used by huddle participants as a structured outline to rapidly discuss the high alarm low acuity patients eligible for intervention. The patients who are identified will have further discussion on rounds to determine if there are appropriate ways to reduce the alarm rates of individual patients through the safe adjustment of physiologic monitor parameters.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Eligible primary participants will be the physicians and nurse practitioners caring for the
        PICU patients who are discussed as part of the huddle interventions. Eligible secondary
        participants will include all low acuity patients in the PICU at The Children's Hospital of
        Philadelphia.

        Inclusion Criteria Primary Subjects: Any physician or nurse practioner caring for an
        intervention patient or control patient in the PICU at CHOP

        Secondary Subjects:

          -  Low acuity patients as determined by Optilink Guidelines

          -  High alarm patients (top 10-20%)

          -  Admission to the PICU

        Exclusion Criteria Primary Subjects: None

        Secondary Subjects: Patients who are medically ready for transfer out of ICU or discharge
        home (status continuously tracked by charge nurse). Patients who are medically ready for
        transfer out have an accepting service in place and a bed ready on the floor.
