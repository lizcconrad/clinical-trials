  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the replacement of the standard fludarabine and cytarabine based
      therapy by azacytidine could result in an improvement of RFS and OS rates in the experimental
      arm. To fulfill the medical needs in such frail and elderly population, improvements in terms
      of atileukemic efficacy in the azacytidine experimental arm should be attained without
      increasing the therapy-related toxicity or decreasing the patients QoL.

      This is a multicenter, randomized 1:1, open, and at national level, Phase III clinical trial.

      This study will be conducted in 3 phases of different duration:

        1. Selection phase (up to 14 days from the signature of informed consent): informed consent
           and review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria performing the relevant assessments.

        2. Treatment Phase (from the start of treatment until the end of cycle 9): Induction phase
           (3 cycles) and consolidation phase (cycles 4-9). Study visits during treatment will be
           weekly during the induction phase (first 3 cycles) and every 2 weeks until the end of
           the consolidation phase.

        3. Follow-up phase: monthly monitoring will be performed on all patients until they have
           completed a minimum of 2 years from the start of treatment, whether or not they continue
           receiving azacitidine cycles or Mini-Fluga according to the protocol. Following these 24
           months, follow-up will be carried out at least quarterly. Patients suffering disease
           progression or relapse of the disease, or being early withdrawn due to any of the
           reasons specified in the protocol will be followed-up for survival until the end of the
           study or until the death of all patients, whichever comes first.

          6. - Other active concomitant malignancy or whose remission is less than one year from
             the screening day (except carcinoma in situ).

          7. - Presence of any psychiatric illness or medical condition that, in the investigator's
             opinion, prevents the subject participation in the study.
