  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of children participating in
      competitive sports. Adolescents involved in sports that require cutting, pivoting or body
      contact are at greatest risk for sustaining an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture of
      the knee, however, appropriate management remains controversial. The surgical technique is
      commonly performed in the adult population has been associated with risks for growth
      disturbance when performed on skeletally immature individuals. Therefore, the recommended
      standard of care in children is to initially follow a non-surgical management protocol that
      allows a patient to skeletally mature prior to ultimately receiving surgical reconstruction.
      Unfortunately, current non-surgical management protocols are ineffective at enhancing knee
      joint stability and dynamic function. There has been no research to indicate the most
      appropriate exercise program for the ACL deficient skeletally immature individual. A
      neuromuscular exercise program proven to be safe and effective in the ACL deficient adult
      population is perturbation training. In adolescents, research suggests neuromuscular
      exercises can reduce the rate of ACL injuries by 50%. However, currently there is no research
      investigating the benefits of a neuromuscular exercise on the management of a skeletally
      immature ACL-deficient individual. The results of this investigation will provide researchers
      and clinicians valuable information on the effect of neuromuscular perturbation exercises on
      knee joint stability and function immediately following injury. This has the potential to
      minimize the development of secondary meniscal tears and premature joint degeneration
      commonly demonstrated following an ACL injury.

      Following ethics approval by the University of Manitoba and the Winnipeg Regional Health
      Authority, 44 participants will be recruited for the study. During the intake session,
      subjects will complete informed and assent consent, participant information and knee
      demographic forms. A radiographic report of the knee confirming that the subject is
      skeletally immature will be obtained from the referring orthopedic surgeon or performed at
      the Pan Am clinic. For only the ACL-injured subjects, a clinical examination diagnosis and
      KT-1000 test will confirm the injury. Anthropometric data, such as age, height, weight, range
      of motion, leg circumference and the pubertal maturation observation scale (PMOS), will be
      collected. All subjects are required to pass the standardized screening protocol prior to
      continuing with the testing procedures.

      Testing Sessions:

      Each subject will participate in 4 follow-up test sessions after the initial intake;
      Pre-exercise session at the start of the study, Follow-up #1 at the mid-point of the study,
      Follow-up #2 at the end of the study and a Test-retest session during the no exercise phase
      of the study. Within the same week as completing the intake session, all subjects will
      complete the pre-exercise test session. All follow-up testing sessions will include: 1.
      Subjective evaluation of knee function via the Pedi-IKDC and Physical Activity Questionnaire
      for Children (PAQ-C), 2. Standardized warm-up on a stationary bike, 3. Dynamic balance
      evaluation using the SEBT and Y-Balance tests, 4. Strength testing using the Biodex
      isokinetic dynamometer and core stability tests, and 5. Knee laxity testing using the
      KT-1000. Both ACL-injured and healthy knee subjects will be randomly divided into two groups,
      Group A &amp; B. The week following baseline testing, Group A will begin the 5-week NMT protocol,
      complete a follow-up #1 testing session, then receive no intervention for 5 weeks, and return
      for a follow-up #2 testing session. The week following baseline testing, Group B will receive
      of no intervention for 5 weeks, then complete a follow-up #1 test session, complete the
      5-week NMT protocol and then return for a follow-up #2 testing session. The test-retest
      session will be conducted during the first week of the &quot;No Exercise&quot; phase.

      Neuromuscular Training (NMT) Sessions:

      The established Neuromuscular Training (NMT) protocol is supervised, progressive program in
      which the patient maintains balance on three different support surfaces while a clinician
      administers purposeful manipulations of the support system.1 The patient maintains a
      single-leg stance on the rollerboard and tiltboard surfaces, and a two-leg stance with one
      foot on a roller board while the other is on a platform. Participants will complete two
      training sessions per week, for five weeks for a total of 10 training sessions. During each
      session, both legs will receive training for 2-3 sets of 1 minute duration on each of the
      support surfaces. Subjects will complete all training sessions with a Certified Athletic
      Therapist or Physiotherapist at the Pan Am clinic.

    <measure>Change from baseline in Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) at week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The SEBT is a valid and reliable non-instrumented test to evaluate dynamic balance in healthy and ACL-injured subjects, however use in the skeletally immature population is lacking in the literature. The subjects perform a series of single-limb squats using the non-stance limb to reach maximally to touch a point along 1 of 8 designated lines on the ground. The reach distance is normalized to the subject's leg length to allow comparison of performance between limbs (injured vs non-injured), between subjects (healthy vs ACL-injured) and before &amp; after an intervention to quantify deficits or improvements in dynamic postural-control. Subjects will perform 4 familiarization trials in each direction, as indicated by previous research. Both limbs will be tested in each direction with the average of the 3 test trails being used for data analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Y-Balance Test at week 7</measure>
    <time_frame>week 7</time_frame>
    <description>The Y-balance test is a commercially available product that evaluates three components of the SEBT. The instrumented version was designed to improve the efficiency of the SEBT. Subjects maintain a one-leg stance on an elevated stance platform from which 3 pieces of plastic pipe extend in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral reach directions. With the non-stance foot participants push an indicator to a maximum distance along the pipe, which is marked with 5mm increments. Research indicates that the test is a feasible and reproducible measure of dynamic postural control in children, as well as adults, however testing within the ACL-injured population is lacking. Following the standardized testing procedures, 6 familiarization trials will be performed prior to collecting data for the test trials. The average maximal reach distance for each direction will be used for data analysis.</description>
