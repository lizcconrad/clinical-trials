      The value of procalcitonin change from the day before to the day when infection was suspected
      in predicting bacterial infection in intensive care patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Starting antibiotic therapy early in critically ill patients with suspected infection is of
      utmost importance with significant effect on survival. Procalcitonin is a reliable sepsis
      marker but results about its usefulness in initiating antimicrobials are conflicting. Our aim
      is to investigate the predictive value of 24 hours procalcitonin kinetics before starting
      empirical antibiotic therapy in intensive care patients as an indicator of the presence of
      bacterial infection.

        All patients with suspected infection during their stay on the intensive care unit were
        screened for eligibility. Patients were enrolled, when the attending intensive care
        specialist had a suspicion of infection and decided to start empirical antibiotic therapy
        and infalmmatory markers were available from the previous day.
