    <textblock>
      The aim of this observational study is to retrospectively collect current survival data for
      3995 primary rectal cancer patients who were extracted from 5097 rectal cancer patients
      admitted in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from January 2000 to
      December 2010. Moreover, based on a Cox model, we want to develope a nomogram that predicts
      local recurrence, distant metastases, and survival for patients with rectal cancer treated
      with pre- or postoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT).

        Clinical, pathological and routine laboratory characteristics for 3995 patients were
        extracted from 5097 patients with rectal cancer treated in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy
        of Medical Sciences from 2000 to 2010.The clinical data were reviewed and a prediction
        nomogram based on the Cox proportional hazards model were developed.
