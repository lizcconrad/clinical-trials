      The purpose of this study is to see if walking is effective for improving memory,
      concentration thinking abilities, physical function and quality of life of adults 50 years of
      age and older living with HIV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By 2015 more than half of persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the U.S. will be older than 50
      years of age. Two factors contribute to the &quot;graying&quot; of the HIV epidemic. The overwhelming
      success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has improved life expectancy and dramatically changed
      the trajectory of HIV; it is now a complex chronic condition, often associated with multiple
      comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive impairment (CI). Second,
      increasing numbers of middle-aged and older adults are becoming infected with HIV.
      Clinicians, patients, and society are currently ill-prepared to deal with the biomedical
      complexities and unique medical and psychosocial challenges associated with the growing aging
      HIV population.

      Aerobic exercise or exercise that speeds up the heart rate lowers CVD risk, and is known to
      improve physical and mental function with aging, but few well designed studies have reported
      use of aerobic exercise interventions in PLWH, and no studies have reported whether exercise
      improves cognitive function in this high risk for CI population. Regular aerobic exercise
      performed 5 times per week for 150 minutes has also been shown to improve aspects of
      cognitive function in community-dwelling older adults. Only one exercise study however, has
      examined the effect of exercise on cognition in PLWH and was limited by a self-reported,
      unreliable indicator of cognitive status; no studies have reported whether exercise improves
      cognition in this population using objective assessments, or examined the potential
      mechanisms involved.

      The home-based, 5 day per week moderate intensity walking intervention, the 'Let's Move
      Program,' has been tested and is effective for lowering CVD risk older caregivers and adults
      with advanced CVD. The proposed pre-post test pilot study will examine the feasibility of
      implementing the Lets Move Program among 40 PLWH over 6-months. Participants enrolled in the
      study will be ≥ 50 years of age, sedentary, have 2 CVD risk factors such as high blood
      pressure and obesity and demonstrate mild to moderate CI using standardized tests.
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) will be used to promote exercise confidence and optimize
      adherence to the intervention.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive function as measured by stop signal task (SST) of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>SST is a commonly used test of response inhibition. This test consists of two parts. In the first part, the subject is introduced to the press pad, and told to press the left hand button when they see a left-pointing arrow or press the right hand button when they see a right-pointing arrow. There is one block of 16 trials for the subject to practice this. In the second part, the subject is told to continue pressing the buttons on the press pad when they see the arrows, as before, but, if they hear an auditory signal (a beep), they should withhold their response and not press the button.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive function as measured by spatial working memory (SWM) of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>SWM is a computerized assessment of working memory and strategy performance. The subject is required to find blue &quot;tokens&quot; in various displayed boxes and use the &quot;tokens&quot; to fill a column on the right side of the screen. Subjects can only find &quot;tokens&quot; in new boxes, therefore they must remember where previous &quot;tokens&quot; were found. SWM scores including number of between errors, number of within errors, and number of double errors range 0-800 and SWM strategy scores range 8-56. Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Executive function as measured by attention switching task (AST) of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AST is a test of the participant's ability to switch attention between the direction or location of an arrow on screen. This test is a sensitive measure of frontal lobe and 'executive' dysfunction. The test begins with an arrow in the centre of the screen which points either to the left or to the right. The participant is introduced to two buttons, one on the left and one on the right, and is asked to press a button corresponding to the direction in which the arrow is pointing.
After this initial training, the participant is then told that the arrow might appear on the left or the right side of the screen, and depending on the cue given at the top of the screen, the participant must either press the left or right button to indicate on which side of the screen the arrow is displayed, or else press the left or right button to correspond with the direction in which the arrow is pointing.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory function as measured by delayed matching to sample (DMS) of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>DMS has 19 outcome measures, assessing latency (the participant's speed of response), the numbers of correct patterns selected, and statistical analysis measuring the probability of an error after a correct or incorrect response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Memory function as measured by visual recognition memory (VRM) of the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>During VRM, the participant is shown a list of words and then asked to recognize the words they have seen before from a list containing the original words and distractors. The five outcome measures for VRM cover correct and incorrect responses for the recognition and free recall parts of the test.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Information processing speed as measured by choice reaction time (CRT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Choice reaction time (CRT) is a computerized assessment that trains the subject in holding down a press-pad and releasing the press-pad in response to stimuli presented on the screen. The task requires the subject to react as soon as a yellow dot appears in one of five locations, and the subject must respond by lifting their hand from the press-pad. This is the reaction time (RT) and ranges from 100 to 5000 msec. Lower scores indicate better performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to contribute to the pathogenesis of risk of CVD and CI through inflammation and promotion of endothelial vascular dysfunction. IL-6 is measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reported as in picograms per deciliter (pg/dL). Higher concentrations of IL-6 raise CHD risk.</description>

    <measure>Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>BDNF is a protein that occurs naturally in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain—areas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking; an increase in BDNF in animal models and humans is thought to enhance neurogenesis.
