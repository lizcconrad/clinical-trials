    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 2 sequential parts. Part A is a study of the safety and
      tolerability of CAVATAK administered via intravesical instillation in patients with
      non-muscle invasive bladder cancer scheduled to undergo TUR. Part B will evaluate the safety
      and tolerability of CAVATAK administered in sequential combination with low dose Mitomycin C
      in the same patient population.
