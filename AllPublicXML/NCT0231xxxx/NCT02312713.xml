  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of standard physical therapy and an
      internet-based exercise program for people with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Both of these
      programs will be compared to a &quot;waiting list&quot; control group. The investigators hypothesize
      that both treatments will result in greater improvement than the control condition and that
      the treatments will be similarly effective. The investigators also expect that some patients
      may do better with one treatment type or another and will explore this.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the Patient Health Questionnaire-8</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depressive symptoms and severity will be assessed using the PHQ-8, a reliable and valid measure of depression71. The PHQ-8 is an eight-item survey derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic tool, and consists of items corresponding to the depression criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Each of the eight questions is scored as 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), so that total scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to Month 12 in The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient's opinion about their knee and associated problems. Five KOOS subscale scores were administered: Pain (9 items), Function in daily living (17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (5 items), and knee-related Quality of Life (4 items). All items are scored on 5-point Likert scales. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in The PROMIS Sleep-related Impairment Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS adult sleep related impairment item bank focuses on self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. It assesses sleep-related impairment over the past seven days. This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Per PROMIS scoring instructions, raw scores are converted into standardized t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. T-scores can range from 30.5-77.6; higher scores indicate worse sleep impairment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in The PROMIS Fatigue Instrument</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities. It assesses fatigue over the past seven days, This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Per PROMIS scoring instructions, raw scores are converted into standardized t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. T-scores can range from 33.1-77.8; higher scores indicate worse fatigue.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the The Brief Fear of Movement Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Fear of Movement Scale is a six item scale for assessing fear of movement in OA. The scale specifically assesses activity avoidance due to pain-related fear of movement. All items are measured on a 4-point scale from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree.&quot; The score ranges from 0-24 with higher scores indicating more fear of movement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a self-report, 12-item scale that measures level occupational, household, and leisure activity during a one-week period. This scale was particularly developed for use among older adults; although all participants in the proposed study will not be age 65 or over, patients with knee OA typically have more limited physical activity than the general population. Therefore we believe this scale will be more applicable to our participant group than scales that were developed for younger adults.
The typical range for the total PASE score is 0-400, with higher scores indicating greater activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the Satisfaction With Physical Function Scale</title>
        <description>This is a validated, 5-item questionnaire that assesses patients’ satisfaction with their ability to complete basic functional tasks that are often affected by lower extremity OA, including stair-climbing, walking, doing housework (light and heavy, and lifting and carrying). All 5 items are rated on a 7 point scale ranging from Very Dissatisfied (-3) Very Satisfied (+3). The total scale ranges from -15 to +15,with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction with function.</description>

The content of these visits will be “semi-standardized,” meaning that they will include some common core components (e.g., evaluation, prescription of home exercise program), but the therapists will have flexibility in terms of how many visits are appropriate and the details of the visit content.
Physical Therapy: Participants assigned to the internet-based exercise training arm will be given access to a program that aims to tailor exercises based on individuals' functional levels. The program assigns specific exercises, progresses these exercises as appropriate over time, and shows individual video clips to demonstrate appropriate performance of exercises.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in Objective Physical Function - 2 Minute Step Test</title>
        <description>One of 4 tests that objectively assessed physical function. These 4 tests included: unilateral stand time; time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position for 30 seconds; timed up and go- rise from a seated position, walk a short distance and return to seated position; and a 2 minute step test. For this outcome measure, the 2 minute step test, the minimum is 0 steps and there is no maximum scale score (participants complete as many steps as they can in 2 minutes); greater steps indicate better function.</description>

        <description>One of 4 tests that objectively assessed physical function. These 4 tests included: unilateral stand time; time to rise from a chair and return to the seated position for 30 seconds; timed up and go- rise from a seated position, walk a short distance and return to seated position; and a 2 minute step test. For this outcome measure, the 30 second chair stand test, the minimum is 0 stands and there is no maximum scale score (participants complete as many stands as they can in 30 seconds; greater numbers of stands indicate better function.</description>

        <description>Depressive symptoms and severity will be assessed using the PHQ-8, a reliable and valid measure of depression71. The PHQ-8 is an eight-item survey derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) diagnostic tool, and consists of items corresponding to the depression criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Each of the eight questions is scored as 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), so that total scores range from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms.</description>

        <description>The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient’s opinion about their knee and associated problems. Five KOOS subscale scores were administered: Pain (9 items), Function in daily living (17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (5 items), and knee-related Quality of Life (4 items). All items are scored on 5-point Likert scales. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>

Physical Therapy: Participants assigned to the internet-based exercise training arm will be given access to a program that aims to tailor exercises based on individuals' functional levels. The program assigns specific exercises, progresses these exercises as appropriate over time, and shows individual video clips to demonstrate appropriate performance of exercises.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to Month 12 in The Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</title>
          <description>The KOOS is a patient-reported outcome measurement instrument, developed to assess the patient’s opinion about their knee and associated problems. Five KOOS subscale scores were administered: Pain (9 items), Function in daily living (17 items), Function in Sport and Recreation (5 items), and knee-related Quality of Life (4 items). All items are scored on 5-point Likert scales. A normalized score (100 indicating no symptoms and 0 indicating extreme symptoms) is calculated for each subscale</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in The PROMIS Sleep-related Impairment Instrument</title>
        <description>The PROMIS adult sleep related impairment item bank focuses on self-reported perceptions of alertness, sleepiness, and tiredness during usual waking hours, and the perceived functional impairments during wakefulness associated with sleep problems or impaired alertness. It assesses sleep-related impairment over the past seven days. This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Per PROMIS scoring instructions, raw scores are converted into standardized t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. T-scores can range from 30.5-77.6; higher scores indicate worse sleep impairment.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in The PROMIS Fatigue Instrument</title>
        <description>The PROMIS Fatigue instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one’s ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. Fatigue is divided into the experience of fatigue (frequency, duration, and intensity) and the impact of fatigue on physical, mental, and social activities. It assesses fatigue over the past seven days, This scale includes 8 items, each measured on a 5-point Likert scale. Per PROMIS scoring instructions, raw scores are converted into standardized t-scores with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. T-scores can range from 33.1-77.8; higher scores indicate worse fatigue.</description>

The content of these visits will be “semi-standardized,” meaning that they will include some common core components (e.g., evaluation, prescription of home exercise program), but the therapists will have flexibility in terms of how many visits are appropriate and the details of the visit content.
Physical Therapy: Participants assigned to the internet-based exercise training arm will be given access to a program that aims to tailor exercises based on individuals' functional levels.

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the The Brief Fear of Movement Scale</title>
        <description>The Brief Fear of Movement Scale is a six item scale for assessing fear of movement in OA. The scale specifically assesses activity avoidance due to pain-related fear of movement. All items are measured on a 4-point scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” The score ranges from 0-24 with higher scores indicating more fear of movement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the The Brief Fear of Movement Scale</title>
          <description>The Brief Fear of Movement Scale is a six item scale for assessing fear of movement in OA. The scale specifically assesses activity avoidance due to pain-related fear of movement. All items are measured on a 4-point scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” The score ranges from 0-24 with higher scores indicating more fear of movement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Month 4 and Change From Baseline to 12 Month in the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</title>
        <description>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a self-report, 12-item scale that measures level occupational, household, and leisure activity during a one-week period. This scale was particularly developed for use among older adults; although all participants in the proposed study will not be age 65 or over, patients with knee OA typically have more limited physical activity than the general population. Therefore we believe this scale will be more applicable to our participant group than scales that were developed for younger adults.
The typical range for the total PASE score is 0-400, with higher scores indicating greater activity.</description>
