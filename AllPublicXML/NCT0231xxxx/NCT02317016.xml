  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, 2-part study in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive (EGFRm+) non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC), who have progressed following prior therapy with an approved EGFR tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI) agent.

      Part A will assess the effect of AZD9291 on the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      rosuvastatin, following multiple oral dosing of AZD9291 in the fasted state.

      Part B will allow patients further access to AZD9291 after the PK phase (Part A) and will
      provide for additional safety data collection. All patients from Part A who completed
      treatment may continue to receive AZD9291 80 mg once daily as a single agent until: disease
      progression; they are no longer deriving clinical benefit; or any other reason.
