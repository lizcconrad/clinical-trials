  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advances in the medical treatment of unresectable liver metastases from
      colorectal cancer there is currently no curative treatment option available for these
      patients. Decitabine is a cytidine analog with proven anti-neoplastic activity in patients
      with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. Decitabine causes demethylation of
      the DNA strands of replicating cells. Hereby decitabine treatment demethylates the promoter
      regions of tumor suppressor- and cancer testis antigen encoding genes leading to expression
      of these genes by the cancer cells. The hepatic arterial route for administration of
      cytotoxic drugs has been widely explored in treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases
      because these metastases depend for their blood flow from this artery (as opposed to the
      normal liver tissue that is mainly dependent from the portal vein). By investigating the
      administration of decitabine by hepatic arterial infusion the investigators intend to explore
      the potential advantage of minimizing the systemic exposure (and toxicity) and maximizing the
      concentration of decitabine within the liver metastasis. The primary objective of this phase
      I will be to establish the recommended dose for decitabine by HAI for further use in phase II
      trials. The most important secondary objective will be to document the effect of decitabine
      by HAI on the expression of cancer testis antigens by the colorectal cancer cells, serving as
      a reference for potential further exploration of decitabine by HAI in combination with cancer
      immunotherapy

      This clinical trial will recruit eligible patients diagnosed with unresectable
      liver-predominant colorectal cancer metastases who have experience progression of their
      disease following standard of care treatment.

      Unless patients already dispose of a hepatic arterial catheter, they will undergo placement
      of a permanent hepatic artery catheter (by laparoscopic surgery). During this surgical
      procedure a biopsy will be made of the colorectal cancer liver metastasis.

      Decitabine will be administered as a daily 1-hour IV infusion on 5 consecutive days, every
      4weeks.

      Two weeks after the first day of administration of decitabine, a CT-guided biopsy a liver
      metastasis will be performed in order to obtain tumor tissue for histopathological analysis
      and DNA/RNA extraction for the purposes of methylation specific Polymerase Chain Reaction
      (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR for assessment of demethylation and expression of
      cancer-testis antigen encoding genes.

      Blood samples for collection of &quot;cell-free DNA&quot; and White Blood Cell (WBC ) for the purpose
      of DNA/RNA extraction and analysis by methylation specific PCR and reverse transcriptase PCR
      for assessment of demethylation and expression of cancer-testis antigen encoding genes will
      be obtained weekly after decitabine treatment.

      The dose of decitabine will be escalated in subsequent patient cohorts enrolled to this phase
      I trial (see rules for dose escalation).

      Study treatment will be continued until unacceptable toxicity, progressive disease or patient
      refusal.
