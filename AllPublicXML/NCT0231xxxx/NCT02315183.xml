  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) complicates over 25% of cardiac surgical procedures where it
      increases mortality up to fourfold. The incidence of AKI is increasing, the pathogenesis is
      poorly understood, current diagnostic tests lack specificity and sensitivity, and there is no
      effective treatment. Improving outcomes in patients at risk of AKI has recently been defined
      as an NHS priority. The primary aim of this study is to determine how plasma derived
      microvesicles (MV) or more specifically MV associated microRNAs (miRNA) regulate survival and
      signalling in post cardiac surgery AKI. The study involves a clinical and experimental
      research project that will combine laboratory analyses of circulating MV and miRNA from
      clinical studies. The study will specifically consider how MV and miRNA alter inflammatory
      signaling in kidneys after cardiac surgery, how these are modified by important clinical risk
      factors, and whether they may serve as early biomarkers of injury.

      AKI is characterised by upregulation of competing pro-survival and pro- inflammatory/
      apoptotic signaling pathways whereby processes associated with renal recovery; tubular
      epithelial phenotypic change and proliferation occur simultaneously with those associated
      with diminished GFR, vascular inflammation, tubular dysfunction and epithelial apoptosis.
      Protection from AKI can be achieved by altering the balance of these pathways; for example
      upregulation of the pivotal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - serine-threonine protein kinase B
      (PI3K-Akt) pro-survival pathway following the administration of erythropoietin or insulin
      like growth factor inhibits experimental AKI following renal ischaemia and reperfusion in
      rodents and swine. In our own work we have shown that post cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) AKI
      in swine can be prevented by the administration of either a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5)
      inhibitor which promotes cell survival and endothelial homeostasis via augmentation of
      endogenous nitric oxide (NO) signalling, or by the inhibition of endothelin-1 (ET-1), an
      important pro-inflammatory mediator and promoter of oxidative stress in renal injury How
      these competing pathways are regulated in patients at risk of AKI is poorly understood
      however, and it is our belief that the identification of these processes will facilitate the
      development of new and effective prevention and treatment strategies for AKI and improved
      outcomes for patients

        The study will be carried out at a large tertiary academic cardiac surgery unit in the UK;
        the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. This unit performs over 1,200 major
        cardiac procedures per year, of which 300 are expected to develop acute kidney injury.
