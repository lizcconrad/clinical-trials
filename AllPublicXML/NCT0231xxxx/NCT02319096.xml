      Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line therapy recommended by NICE for the
      treatment of SUI. Due to poor motivation and compliance only 15-20% of women comply with the
      regimen. Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise has been developed as a new modality in the
      field of physiotherapy. The Galileo machine is a unique device for applying whole-body
      vibration. The investigators are currently using this therapy as an alternative to
      traditional pelvic floor muscle therapy. The investigators aim to audit the investigators
      treatment of whole body vibration.

    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the first line therapy recommended by NICE for the
      treatment of SUI. It was first described by Arnold Kegel almost 60 years ago. PFMT exercises
      help the patient strengthen the muscles of the pelvic floor by the repeated high-intensity,
      rapid pelvic muscle contractions of both slow and fast twitch muscle fibres. The training of
      these muscles is difficult particularly when women have trouble in the perception of their
      PFM. This results in poor motivation and compliance with a Cochrane review suggesting that
      only 15-20% of women comply with the regimen.

      Whole body vibration (WBV) exercise has been developed as a new modality in the field of
      physiotherapy. Whole body vibration (WBW) has a positive effect on muscle strength and rate
      of force. Stochastic WBV causes up to 12 muscle contractions per second which cannot be
      achieved by routine PFM exercise with supervision of a physiotherapist. The Galileo machine
      is a unique device for applying whole-body vibration. The investigators aim to audit their
      treatment of whole body vibration. This would be done using the patient global impression of
      improvement scale (PGI-I) and routine quality of life and symptoms questionnaires
      (International Consultation on Incontinence Female lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Questionnaire
      -ICIQ-FLUTS and Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory - PFDI) to be completed by the patient at
      initial appointment and 12 weeks after treatment and pelvic floor muscle assessment carried
      out at initial appointment and at 12 weeks. Patients will also have a qualitative interview
      with the Urogynaecology team to assess if therapy was found to be suitable and acceptable to
      patients.
