  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of CVac, an
      investigational cell therapy, in patients with resected stage I or II adenocarcinoma of the
      pancreas who have completed surgery with or without front-line chemotherapy or radiation
      therapy.

      After confirmation of non-measurable disease patients will undergo leukapheresis for
      manufacture of the study agent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 40 patients at up to 30 clinical sites will be screened for
      eligibility into the study within 6 weeks of completing treatment, including R0 (complete
      resection with no microscopic residual tumor) or R1 (complete resection with no grossly
      visible tumor but microscopically positive margins) surgery for stage I or stage II
      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with or without chemotherapy and radiation. Eligible patients
      must have no measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009) and tumor marker carbohydrate antigen 19-9 [CA 19-9] not
      greater than 2 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) following surgery with or without
      chemotherapy or radiation. Prior surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy,
      and radiation therapy are allowed.
