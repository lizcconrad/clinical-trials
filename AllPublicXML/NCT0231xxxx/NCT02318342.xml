  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study designed to evaluate the structural and functional integrity of
      transcatheter or surgical bioprosthetic valves with multimodality imaging. The study further
      aims to confirm resolution of the early bioprosthetic valve thrombotic changes with Vitamin K
      antagonists (warfarin) mediated anticoagulation therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a history of bioprosthetic valve replacement undergo cardiac contrast CT
      imaging and transthoracic echocardiography to evaluate structural and functional integrity of
      the aortic valves. The imaging studies will be performed at least 48-hours after
      bioprosthetic valve replacement. Patients with prosthetic valve abnormalities suggestive of
      thrombus will be administered anticoagulation therapy with Vitamin K antagonists (Warfarin)
      for 3 months with goal International Normalized Ratio (INR) 2-3, followed by repeat contrast
      CT of the chest and transthoracic imaging. Repeat imaging following 3 months of
      anticoagulation therapy is performed to evaluate the response to anticoagulation therapy. INR
      levels will be monitored and warfarin dose adjusted to maintain target INR 2-3.
