  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effectiveness of Polydextrose, a dietary fiber, at increasing
      Colonic Transit Time and decreasing the gastrointestinal symptoms of Functional Constipation.
      One quarter of the subjects will receive 12 g of Polydextrose daily, one quarter will receive
      8 g of Polydextrose daily, one quarter will receive 4 g of Polydextrose daily and one quarter
      will receive a placebo daily.
