  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 works in treating patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, or breast cancer that has spread to
      the brain and does not respond to treatment. Pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      Primary Objective:

      For cohort A and Cohort C, to determine the CNS disease control rate (number of patients with
      stable disease or partial response or complete response / total number of treated patients)
      at 12 weeks following treatment with etirinotecan pegol in patients with advanced NSCLC or
      with MBC with refractory brain metastases

      Secondary Objectives:

      Cohorts A and C:

        -  To measure the overall disease control rate and response rate for patients receiving
           study therapy

        -  To measure the systemic (non CNS) disease control rate and response rate for patients
           receiving study therapy

        -  To observe the progression free survival of the study population

        -  To observe the overall survival of the study population

      Cohort B:

      - To observe CNS and systemic disease control in SCLC

      Cohorts A, B and C:

      - To determine the safety profile of etirinotecan pegol (NKTR 102)
