  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - One type of cancer therapy takes blood cells from a person, changes them in a lab, then
      gives the cells back to the person. In this study, researchers are using an anti-CD22 gene, a
      virus, and an immune receptor to change the cells.

      Objective:

      - To see if giving anti-CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) cells to young people with
      certain cancers is safe and effective.

      Eligibility:

      - People ages 1-30 with a leukemia or lymphoma that has not been cured by standard therapy.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened to ensure their cancer cells express the CD22 protein.
           They will also have medical history, physical exam, blood and urine tests, heart tests,
           scans, and x-rays. They may give spinal fluid or have bone marrow tests.

        -  Participants may have eye and neurologic exams.

        -  Participants will get a central venous catheter or a catheter in a large vein.

        -  Participants will have white blood cells removed. Blood is removed through a needle in
           an arm. White blood cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned by needle in
           the other arm.

        -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.

        -  Participants will get two IV chemotherapy drugs over 4 days. Some will stay in the
           hospital for this.

        -  All participants will be in the hospital to get anti-CD22 CAR cells through IV. They
           will stay until any bad side effects are gone.

        -  Participants will have many blood tests. They may repeat some screening exams.

        -  Participants will have monthly visits for 2-3 months, then every 3-6 months. They may
           repeat some screening exams.

        -  Participants will have follow-up for 15 years.

      Background:

        -  Adoptive cellular therapy with T cells genetically modified using viral-basedvectors to
           express chimeric antigen receptors targeting the CD19 molecule have demonstrated
           dramatic clinical responses in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
           However, not all patients respond and CD19-negative escape has been observed following
           CD19 CAR therapy, as well as anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific antibody therapy. Thus, additional
           targets are needed.

        -  CD22 is a B-lineage-restricted, transmembrane phosphoglycoprotein of the Ig superfamily
           that is widely expressed on B-cell malignancies including 96% to 100% of pediatric
           Bprecursor ALL. Therefore, CD22 represents a promising target. Encouraging responses
           targeting CD22 with an antibody based immunoconjugate have been seen in patients,
           including children, with recurrent and refractory ALL. This will be the first in human
           testing of anti-CD22 CAR adoptive cell therapy.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the feasibility of producing anti-CD22 CAR cells meeting established
           release criteria.

        -  To assess the safety of administering escalating doses of anti-CD22-CAR engineered T
           cells in children and young adults with recurrent or refractory CD22- expressing B cell
           malignancies following a cyclophosphamide/fludarabine preparative regimen.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients 1-30 years of age, at least 15 kg, with CD22-expressing B-cell malignancies that
      have recurred after or not responded to one or more standard regimens and deemed incurable by
      standard therapy. Patients with a history of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (SCT)
      who meet all eligibility criteria are eligible to participate. Patients previously treated
      with anti-CD19 CAR engineered T cells are also eligible.

      Design:

        -  PBMC will be obtained by leukapheresis, CD3+ cells enriched and cultured in the presence
           of anti-CD3/-CD28 beads followed by lentiviral vector supernatant containing the
           anti-CD22 (M971BBz) CAR.

        -  On Day -4 (cell infusion is Day 0), patients will begin induction chemotherapy
           comprising fludarabine 25 mg/m2 on Days -4, -3 and -2 and cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m2 on
           day 2.

        -  The CD22-CAR cells will be infused on Day 0, with up to a 72h delay allowed for infusion
           of fresh cells or a 7 day delay if cells are cryopreserved, if needed for resolution of
           clinical toxicities, to generate adequate cell numbers, or to facilitate scheduling.

        -  A phase I cell dose escalation scheme will be performed using 4 dose levels (3 x 105
           transduced T cells/kg; 1 x 106 transduced T cells/kg; 3 x 106 transduced T cells/kg; and
           1 x 107 transduced T cells/kg ( 20%)). If 2/6 patients have DLT at dose level 1, safety
           will be evaluated in a de-escalated dose of 1 x 105 transduced T cells/kg ( 20%)). Once
           the maximum tolerated dose (or highest level evaluated) is reached, enrollment into an
           expansion cohort of a total of 17 patients at MTD in two strata will proceed to provide
           additional information regarding the feasibility, safety and efficacy of this treatment.
           Patients who have previously received CD19 CAR T cells will be evaluated separately from
           CARna(SqrRoot) ve patients as response may be different in these two groups.

        -  Patients will be monitored for toxicity, response and T cell persistence as well as
           other biologic correlates.

             lymphoma and must have relapsed or refractory disease after at least one standard
             chemotherapy regimen and one salvage regimen. In view of the PI and the primary
             oncologist, there must be no available alternative curative therapies and subjects
             must be either ineligible for allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT), have refused SCT,

             respiratory symptoms (e.g. dyspnea at rest, known requirement for supplemental oxygen
             therapy), pulmonary function tests are not required.

             For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, the criterion is: No evidence of
