  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates two L-Carnitine-based products on muscle function in healthy older
      adults (55 to 70 years old). These products are suspected to improve muscle function and
      possibly promote building of muscle mass. One third of the subjects will be on Carnipure
      Product 1, one third will be on Carnipure Product 2 and one third will be on placebo.
