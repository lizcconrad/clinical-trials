  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have already proven that absolute total thyroidectomy gives elimination of
      anti-TPO antibodies. Our hypothesis is that this elimination also eliminates the typical
      Hashimoto symptoms, namely: Serious tiredness, increased need of sleep, pain in musculature
      and joints and dryness in eyes and mouth. The prerequisite for this effect is that the total
      thyroidectomy is meticulously performed. There exists no other treatment that can eliminate
      the antibodies. The study is randomized between operation and ordinary conservative medical
      treatment with thyroxine control and supplementation. The symptoms in both groups are
      evaluated by 5 different Quality of Life schemes, internationally approved.

      The study hypothesis is that elimination of anti-TPO antibodies ameliorates the typical
      Hashimoto symptoms like tiredness,increased need of sleep, pain in musculature and joints and
      dryness in eyes and mouth. It is necessary that the total thyroidectomy is meticulously
      performed. We have proven the effect on the antibodies, and we have also proven that the
      operation procedure can be performed without more complications like recurrent nerve damage
      and hypocalcemia. Neutrality is secured by randomization done by a neutral institution,
      laryngoscopy by neutral doctors and instructions filling out the QoL-schemes performed by
      non-biased study nurses.

      The study runs for at least 18 months with controls every 6 months. Blood samples are taken
      and international approved QoL-schemes are filled in. In addition to the randomised main
      group a side group of patients fulfilling 2 of the 3 inclusion criteria are followed in
      parallel in order to elucidate the spontaneous development of the disease and showing
      critical values of antibodies making the symptoms turn up.

Standard Thyroxine supplementation maintained as in the control group.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients referred due to typical symptoms, believed to be related to HashimotoÂ´s
             disease, but not relieved by thyroxin substitution. Optimal thyroid substitution
             treatment is already provided.

          2. Anti-TPO&gt;1000

          3. Hypothyroidism with a need for thyroxin supplementation

          4. Written informed consent by the patient - information particularly emphasising and
             quantifying the risk of complications (e.g. recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy). The
             patient should be informed by a medical endocrinologist as well as a surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients &lt;18 years of age.

          2. Pregnancy.

          3. Unable to comprehend information adequately to give informed consent.

          4. General anaesthesiological contraindications.

          5. An unexpected finding of cancer in the surgical group is not a reason for exclusion
             per se, but this group should be analyzed separately. It is expected that any
             different loading in Quality of life would bias the medically treated group.
