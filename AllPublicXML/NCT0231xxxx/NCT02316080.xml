      The aim of this project is to evaluate in vitro and in vivo the effect of dental bleaching
      agents, carbamide peroxide 16% (T1) and hydrogen peroxide 35% (T2) together with
      desensitizers/remineralizer agents, Sensodyne® dentifrice (D1); experimental dentifrice with
      7,5% of Biosilicate micro-particles (D2); Odontis RX® dentifrice (D3); Sorriso® dentifrice
      (D4); Biosilicate micro-particles paste, 1:1 (D5), Desensebilize Nano P (D6), bioglass type
      45S5 paste, 1:1 (D7); GC= distilled water, in the experimental groups: T1/D1; T1/D2; T1/D3;
      T1/D4; T1/D5; T1/D6; T1/D7; T1/GC e T2/D1; T2/D2; T2/D3; T2/D4; T2/D5; T2/D6; T2/D7; T2/GC.
      In the in vitro study, microhardness and roughness measurements, and images using scanning
      electron microscopy (SEM) will be made on samples of bovine dental enamel and dentin
      (4x4x3mm; n=10 per group) before and after the treatment with the bleaching gels (T1= 14
      days/ 04 hours/day; T2=single session) and the desensitizers/remineralizer agents. In the
      clinical study, the volunteers (n=10 per group) will be evaluated regarding dentin
      hypersensitivity (DH), using visual analogue scale, before the beginning of the treatments
      (T1 and T2) and during the next 14 days (1º, 3º, 7º, 10 º e 14º days) in which the
      desensitizers/remineralizer agents (there´s no control group in the clinical experiments)
      will be applying. Data will be analysed intra and inter-group, statistically.

      Background. Tooth sensitivity (TS) is a common side effect of tooth bleaching. The authors
      conducted a study to evaluate the efficiency of experimental desensitizing agents in reducing
      TS caused by bleaching agents.

      Methods. To test experimental desensitizing agents in TS caused by dental bleaching the
      authors selected 113 participants without TS and randomly treated them with T1-16% carbamide
      peroxide (14 days) or T2-35% hydrogen peroxide (single session). The period of the study was
      14 days. Participants (in T1 and T2) used domestic-use (DU) or in office (IO) desensitizers
      (D): Control Group; (DU)- experimental dentifrice with 7,5% of Biosilicate
      micro-particles-(D1); Sensodyne® dentifrice-(D2); (DU)-Odontis RX Sensiblock®
      dentifrice-(D3); (IO)-Biosilicate micro-particles paste, 1:1-(D4); (IO)-bioglass type 45S5
      paste, 1:1 (D6); (IO)-Desensebilize Nano P-(D6). On days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 14, the authors
      received the participants to apply IO desensitizers and to record TS with Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS). Data was analyzed with two-way ANOVA (considering time and desensitizing as
      factors) and post-hoc Bonferroni test (α=0.05).

      Results. The use of experimental desensitizing agents G2 and G5 did not cause significantly
      difference in TS comparing to baseline. TS was not significantly different when G2 was used
      after 16% carbamide peroxide and G5 after 35% hydrogen peroxide application. Self-perception
      TS values were significantly (p&lt;0.001) higher than recorded VAS.

      Conclusions. Experimental desensitizing agents containing Biosilicate® can prevent TS caused
      by bleaching agents: in dentifrice form when associated to 16% carbamide peroxide and in
      paste, when 35% hydrogen peroxide is used.
