  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective observational study to determine the prognostic value of the timing of 50%
      reduction in metabolic activity (T50) during CCRT for NSCLC for treatment outcome (PFS).

      This is a single‐centre observational study. Patients with proven locally advanced NSCLC will
      be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy according to the standard clinical protocol of
      the NKI‐AVL. During treatment, the biological behaviour of the tumour will be monitored with
      serial quantitative FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET/CT scans. From these images, the time during
      treatment where a 50% reduction in FDG uptake relative to day 1 is reached (T50) will be
      derived. The T50 of progression‐free surviving patients will be compared with that of
      relapsed or deceased patients, in order to find a value that predicts early treatment
      failure. An additional FDG PET/CT scan at the same day as regular follow up CT scan will be
      made, two months after treatment, to have a baseline after treatment for follow up.
