  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ebola virus has infected and killed people, mostly in Africa. In 2014, the Ebola virus has
      affected several thousand people. There is no approved effective way to treat or prevent
      Ebola. Researchers are trying to develop a vaccine for it. This is a study of the anti-Ebola
      vaccine BPSC-1001 to see if it is safe and to see how it affects people's immune system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1994 and the present, there have been many Ebola viruses (EBOV) outbreaks affecting
      mostly central Africa. However, the 2014 West African outbreak significantly exceeds all
      previous outbreaks in geographic range, number of individuals affected and in disruption of
      typical activities of civil society.

      This is a Phase 1 safety and tolerability study to evaluate a novel vaccine to Ebola using a
      live replicating vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) replacing the gene encoding the G envelope
      glycoprotein with the gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein from the Zaire strain of Ebola
      (VSVΔG-ZEBOV also known as BPSC-1001).
