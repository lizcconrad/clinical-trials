    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended
      expansion dose (RED) of ASP2215 concomitant with cytarabine/idarubicin as induction
      chemotherapy based on the status of the onset of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) in newly
      Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Safety and tolerability of ASP2215 will also be
      evaluated. This study will also characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of ASP2215
      concomitant with induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as evaluate the PK
      parameters of cytarabine concomitant with ASP2215.

    <textblock>
      This study is composed of the dose-evaluation part and the expansion part.

      In the dose-evaluation part, at least 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at each dose (low,
      middle, and high) for determination of MTD and/or RED. Treatment of AML in this study is
      composed of 3 periods of therapy: remission induction, consolidation, and maintenance. The
      decision of whether or not to proceed to the next dose will be made based on the occurrence
      of DLT during Cycle 1 of the induction period.

      In the expansion part, a maximum of 3 subjects will receive ASP2215 at RED that has been
      recommended in the dose-evaluation part and the safety will be assessed based on the onset of
      DLTs during Cycle 1 of the induction and consolidation periods.
