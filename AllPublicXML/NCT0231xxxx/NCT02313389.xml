      Hypothesis

      Our hypothesis is that maintenance chemotherapy will prolong complete remission obtained
      after a standard induction chemotherapy with an acceptable toxicity in the elderly.

      Rationale

        -  Treatment of the elderly is challenging, indeed age over 60 is associated both with a
           poor prognosis and a high risk of treatment induced neurotoxicity with devastating
           consequences on quality of life. Therefore it has become standard practice to treat
           elderly in first line with high-dose methotrexate (MTX) based polychemotherapy alone,
           avoiding whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or deferring it for recurrence.

        -  There is a clear need to improve disease control after induction chemotherapy. Since
           consolidation with WBRT or intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue are
           either poorly effective and/or too toxic in the elderly population, maintenance
           chemotherapy is an interesting alternative approach. Several agents, such as high-dose
           MTX, temozolomide (TMZ), rituximab, with a reported activity in PCNSL and acceptable
           safety profile, as single agent or combined, are good candidates for maintenance

      Objectives

        -  The primary objective is to evaluate the benefit estimated by the PFS associated with
           maintenance chemotherapy compared to observation in patients ≥ 60 years having achieved
           a complete response after a high-dose MTX based induction chemotherapy

        -  The secondary objectives are to assess:

             -  Overall survival

             -  Safety of maintenance chemotherapy

             -  Neurocognitive outcome

             -  Quality of life of the patients

      Study Design

        -  This study is an open label multicenter randomized phase III trial comparing maintenance
           chemotherapy versus observation in complete responders to high dose MTX based induction
           chemotherapy.

        -  Patients are registered to participate in the study at time of initial diagnosis and
           study enrolment before the induction chemotherapy.

        -  Induction chemotherapy (R-MPVA protocol) includes 4 to 5 monthly cycles of high dose MTX
           (3.5g/m2, D1 and D15), procarbazine, vincristine, rituximab followed by one cycle of
           high dose cytarabine consolidation.

        -  Randomization to observation (arm 1) or maintenance (arm 2) will be carried out only for
           patients in complete response (CR) after induction chemotherapy Arm 1: Observation Arm
           2: Seven monthly R-MT cycles including high dose MTX (3.5g/m2, D1), TMZ, rituximab

      Sample size, duration of the study, feasibility

        -  295 patients need to be enrolled to randomize 192 patients

        -  Duration of the study: 6 years (accrual period= 4 years; minimal follow-up = 2 years)

           26 participating expert centers from the national LOC network

      The trial is supported by the neurooncology ANOCEF and the lymphoma LYSA clinical research
      groups.

      Ancillary study LOCALYSE:

      Role of [18F]-FDG brain PET in newly diagnosed primary cerebral lymphoma, in immunocompetent
      patient older than 60 years

      Rationale Patients older than 60 years account for half of cases of PCNSL and have a poorer
      outcome. No prognostic or predictive factors exist for survival after initial remission.
      [18F]FDG-PET (Fluoro Deoxy Glucose) plays a key role in grading and therapy monitoring of
      systemic diffuse large B-cell type.

      LOCALYZE is an ancillary PET/MR clinical study from BLOCAGE 01. The aim is to evaluate the
      usefulness of [18F]FDG-PET to monitor treatment response in PCNSL (Primary Central Nervous
      System Lymphoma) older than 60 years (n=56), in complement to multiparametric MRI.

      Hypothesis We assume that the development of new imaging biomarker extracted from PET imaging
      and multiparametric MRI, could improve the assessment of treatment response in PCNSL.

      Primary aim To evaluate the predictive value of [18F]FDG-PET assessment performed at the
      end-of-treatment (high-dose methotrexate based polychemotherapy), on progression free
      survival in newly diagnosed PCNSL with age ≥60 years (n=56).

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      Progression free survival calculated from the date of completion of the end of chemotherapy
      PET

      Study design

      Three [18F]-FDG PET/MR will be performed in the Department of Nuclear Medicine -
      Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital:

        -  prior to initiation of R-MPVA chemotherapy (Rituximab Methotrexate Procarbazine
           Vincristine Aracytine ) (PET#1),

        -  after two chemotherapy cycles (PET#2),

        -  at the end of the first-line chemotherapy regimens (PET#3).

      Inclusion criteria (=Blocage-01) Blocage01 eligibility

      Exclusion criteria

        -  Uncontrolled diabetes with fasting glycaemia &gt; 200 mg/dL

        -  Sensitivity to active substance in [18F]-FDG

        -  Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 40 ml/min

        -  No contraindication to MRI
