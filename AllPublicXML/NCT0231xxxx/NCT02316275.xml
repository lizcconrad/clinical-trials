      To determine the impact of unrestricted postoperative activity on intermediate- and long-term
      continence outcomes of mid-urethral sling surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence.

      To assess the natural return to baseline activity level when patients are unrestricted
      following mid-urethral sling surgery with or without concomitant anterior or posterior pelvic
      organ prolapse repair.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last decade, the mid-urethral sling has become the new gold standard in the
      management of stress urinary incontinence because of its high success rate and minimally
      invasive nature. However, postoperative management has not kept pace with the modernization
      of sling surgery. Although formal guidelines regarding the resumption of normal activity
      levels have not been established, it is general practice to restrict exercise for a minimum
      of six weeks after surgery.

      For the study, if immediate resumption of normal activity has no impact on intermediate- and
      long-term continence outcomes, it may result in improved quality of life and cost savings
      from a societal perspective.

    <description>Return to normal activity immediately after mid-urethral sling surgery could result in faster return to baseline health-related quality of life. Each questionnaire will be administered weekly following surgery until the patient returns to within 10% of baseline scores. Cost-effectiveness of early return to normal activity via Productivity Loss form as time spent recovering from surgery will be analyzed (incremental cost effectiveness ratio of net means by comparing the unrestricted and restricted groups).</description>

    <description>Patients are to resume regular activity immediately after mid-urethral sling surgery. The investigators will determine the impact of unrestricted post-operative activity on continence outcomes of mid-urethral sling surgery in women with stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Investigators will measure the effect of unrestricted post-operative activity on early health-related quality of life (HRQOL). A Productivity Loss form for cost-effective analysis will be asked of the patient.</description>
