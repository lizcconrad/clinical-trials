  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some women cannot have children because they cannot produce enough follicle stimulating
      hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). When this happens the ovaries fail to produce an
      egg during the menstrual cycle - a condition known as anovulation. Anovulation can be treated
      by giving replacement FSH and LH. Pergoveris is a medication that contains both FSH and LH.
      It is used for the treatment of anovulation in women who do not produce enough FSH and LH.

      A new, liquid formulation of Pergoveris is being tested in this study. It will be compared
      with the current freeze-dried marketed formulation to see if the new formulation gets into
      the blood stream as easily as the current formulation.

      This study will involve 38 healthy female subjects and 2 treatment periods and will last for
      approximately 77 days. Each subject will receive a single dose of the new liquid formulation
      and a single dose of the current marketed formulation separated by an interval of two weeks
      in a randomised (by chance) order. Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals over 2
      weeks after each dose to measure levels of FSH and LH.

      To participate female subjects must have normal ovaries on internal ultrasound scan, a normal
      result from a cervical smear test, be taking the combined oral contraceptive (OC) pill.

      Eligible subjects will have their usual OC pill replaced with another called Marvelon
      throughout the study. After 14 days subjects will have their levels of FSH and LH checked and
      if sufficiently reduced will only then proceed to dosing.

      Subjects will then receive one of the formulations. An ultrasound scan of the ovaries will be
      performed 7 days later, and another one 7 days later just before the next dose. Subjects
      whose ovaries show signs of stimulation will not be given the second dose. The ultrasound
      scan will be repeated 7 days after the second dose.
