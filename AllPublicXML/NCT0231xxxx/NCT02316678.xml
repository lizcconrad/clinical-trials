      The investigators will test the hypothesis that that greater efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis
      factor (antiTNF) therapy results in reduced need for bowel resection surgery, fewer serious
      infections, and reduced short term mortality risks, and therefore has a more favorable
      benefit to harm profile than corticosteroids for inflammatory bowel disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a comparative effectiveness study among Medicare Parts A, B,
      and D beneficiaries with inflammatory bowel disease. The investigators will compare the
      incidence of severe infection, bowel resection surgery, and death among new users of
      anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies and corticosteroids. The investigators will compute
      propensity scores to describe the propensity for treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor
      drugs compared to corticosteroids, and will match corticosteroids and anti-tumor necrosis
      factor drug treated patients on the propensity score. Cox regression will be employed to
      assess the hazard ratio for each of the outcomes.

    <description>Incidence of death per 1000 person-years
Outcome Measure Time Frame:Follow-up was from the date that the participant first met the criteria for either prolonged corticosteroid use or new anti-TNF use until either the patient died, discontinued enrollment in Medicaid or Medicare Part A, B, or D, reached age 90, was newly diagnosed with other immune-mediated diseases or AIDS, or reached the end of the available data, whichever came first, assessed up to 13 years. Follow-up of patients with UC also ended if they were diagnosed with a fistula, as this would usually change the diagnosis to CD.</description>

        The investigators will use Medicare data from 2006-2011. Patients will be required to have
        at least two diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease within the 6 months prior to
        initiating anti-TNF therapy or coritcosteroids as defined below. To assure full coverage,
        patients will be required to have Parts A, B, and D Medicare coverage.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients will be required to have at least two diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease
        within the 6 months prior to initiating anti-TNF therapy or corticosteroids. To assure full
        coverage, patients will be required to have Parts A, B, and D Medicare coverage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, or psoriatic
             arthritis in the 6 months period prior to initiation of the therapy.

          2. Less than 6 months of follow-up time within the data source prior to initiation of the
             therapy.

          3. Diagnosis of cancer in the 6 months prior to initiation of the study medication.

          4. Initiation of anti-TNF therapies within the first 6 months following surgery.

          5. Patients who are in managed care plans (Medicare Part C).
