    <textblock>
      CRAD001AAU13 is a substudy of CRAD001A2433. The core study CRAD001A2433 is a 2-year,
      randomized, multicenter, open-label, 2-arm study evaluating graft function with everolimus
      and reduced CNI versus MPA and standard CNI in adult de novo renal transplant recipients.
      Patients in this study may use cyclosporine or tacrolimus as the CNI.

      Patients enrolled in the core study CRAD001A2433 in Australia will be eligible for
      recruitment into CRAD001AAU13. These patients will undergo additional tests (including 4
      kidney allograft biopsies) as part of the substudy that will be conducted during core study
      CRAD001A2433 visits. At Day 0 (day of transplant /TX), Month 2, Month 12 and Month 24
      additional samples (serum, whole blood and kidney biopsy) will be taken for the purposes of
      this substudy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Structural kidney damage</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 24.</time_frame>
    <description>Kidney allograft biopsies will be taken at baseline, months 2, 12 and 24 to assess the structural kidney damage using the BANFF 2013 criteria.
Development of structral allograft damage (Banff classification) over 24 months will be compared between treatment groups using modelling techniques that take into account the repeated measures, nature of the data and all available data.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of de novo Donor specific antibodies formation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Serum blood samples analysed to assess presence and evolution of anti HLA donor specific antibodies.
The number and percentage of patients with anti HLA and donor specific antibodies at each study visit will be presented using a generalised linear mixed model framework as well as a Kaplan-Meier curve to portray the change over time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impaired glucose tolerance and new onset diabetes</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects' diabetes status is collected at baseline as part of medical history. At month 2, serum blood test taken pre glucose drink and 2 hours post glucose drink. Subjets classified based on the level of glucose as: No diabetes (fasting plasma glucose &lt;6.1mmol/L or 2 hour OGTT &lt;7.8mmol/L) Prediabetes (fasting plasma glucose 6.1-6.9mmol/L or 2hr OGTT 7.8-11mmol/L) Diabetes (fasting plasma glucose &gt;/= 7.0mmol/L or 2hr OGTT &gt;/= 11.1mmol/L) Shift tables will present the change in diabetes status between baseline and month 2. The odds of becoming diabetic by month 2 (new onset diabetes) will be compared using a generalised linear model, in particular logisitc regression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation between HbA1c and oral glucose tolerance test</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 2</time_frame>
    <description>Serum blood samples are taken pre and post glucose drink at month 2. Results are produced for plasma glucose levels and HbA1c in mmol/L. Correlation between the results will be investigated using a generalised linear model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Development of biochemical markers of viral infections</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline - month 24</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples are analysed at baseline months 2, 12 and 24. The following viral loads are measured in copies per ml: CMV (Cytomegalo virus) via PCR BK viremia via RT-PCR EBV (Epstein Barr Virus) via PCR Descriptive staistics will be presented for the viral load of each of the biochemical markers at each timepoint.</description>
