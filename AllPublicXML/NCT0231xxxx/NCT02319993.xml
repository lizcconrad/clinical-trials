      Design:

      Randomized, placebo-controlled trial comprising 3 arms: SZRT, placebo, TWBXD.

      Setting:

      The Chung Shan Medical University Affiliated Hospital and the Taipei City Hospital.

      Methods:

      A total of 128 subjects 20-80 years of age with a history of insomnia at least 1 month were
      recruited randomly assigned to SZRT (n = 48), placebo (n =32), TWBXD (n =48) and were
      instructed to take 6 gm 2 times per day of SZRT, TWBXD or placebo for a period of 4 weeks.
      The primary outcome measures were the mean component scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
