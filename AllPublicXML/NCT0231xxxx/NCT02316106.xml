      The purpose of this study is to evaluate three daratumumab dose schedules in participants
      with Smoldering Multiple Myeloma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label (identity of assigned treatment will be known to
      participants and study staff), 3-arm (3 treatment groups), multicenter study of daratumumab
      in participants diagnosed with intermediate or high-risk Smoldering Multiple Myeloma (SMM
      [ie, early disease without any symptoms]). Participants will be randomized (assigned by
      chance) to one of 3 treatment groups to receive daratumumab. Each treatment group will
      investigate 1 of 3 dosing schedules of daratumumab. The study will include a 28-Day Screening
      Phase, a Treatment Phase of 1 to 20 treatment cycles (each cycle is 8 weeks in duration for
      total period of 8 to 160 weeks), and a Follow up Phase of 4-weeks from the last dose of study
      drug. The Follow-up Phase will continue until death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal,
      or study end, whichever occurs first. The end of the study will occur approximately 4 years
      after the last participant enrolled receives a first dose of study drug. Disease assessments
      will be performed every 8 weeks in the first year and then every 16 weeks until disease
      progression. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
