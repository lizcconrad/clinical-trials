  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to verify the effect of an online interactive tool on patient empowerment.
      The tool is based on a validated psychological questionnaire administrated to breast cancer
      patients before their first encounter with physician.

      The study is intended to develop an IEm (Interactive Empowerment) tool aimed at enhancing
      physician-patient experience by providing physicians a personalized patient's profile,
      accompanied by a list of recommendations to suggest him how to interact with that specific
      patient on the basis of his/her personal profile. Developed in the framework of the FP7
      project &quot;P-Medicine&quot;, the IEm tool uses the ALGA-BC questionnaire, a recent validated
      instrument specifically developed to perform a brief evaluation of the breast cancer
      patients' psychological status, to provide the physician a patient's profile based on 8
      factors. As soon as the questionnaire has been completed, the patient's answers are
      automatically elaborated and sent to the physician's computer. Provided to the physicians at
      the very beginning of the visit, such information is supposed to be crucial for them to find
      a tailored way to communicate with the patient. Moreover, in order to help physicians to
      correctly interpret the patient's score, any time the scores are out of a certain range
      (normal values) they will receive a recommendation that helps them to find the best way to
      interact with the patient. Supposing that the patient empowerment can be reached through the
      improved patient's participation in the clinical process, we argue that a more effective and
      personalized interaction between patient and physician may have a key role in promoting it.
