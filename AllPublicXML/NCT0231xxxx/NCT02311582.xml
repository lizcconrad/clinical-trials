  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a major obstacle to drug delivery in the treatment of
      malignant brain tumors including Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). MRI-guided laser ablation
      (MLA) has been noted to disrupt peritumoral BBB, which could then lead to increased access of
      new tumor antigens to the lymphovascular system and vice versa of immune effector cells to
      the tumor for effective activation of the immune system. Therefore the combination of MK-3475
      and MLA as proposed in this protocol is hypothesized to create a therapeutic synergy in which
      MLA increases material access to promote immune activation and then MK-3475 maximizes these
      tumor-specific immune reactions to impart effective tumor control.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Phase I: Histologically confirmed grade III or IV malignant glioma.

          -  Phase II: Histologically confirmed grade IV malignant glioma (GBM).

             *Note: GBM variants and suspected secondary GBM are allowed for both phase I and phase
             II.

          -  Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression as documented by biopsy or brain MRI scan
             per RANO criteria.

          -  There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of standard front
             line therapy to study registration unless there is unequivocal evidence for tumor
             recurrence per RANO criteria. When the interval is less than 12 weeks, the use of
             perfusion imaging and/or PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal
             evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression. Standard front line therapy is as
             described below:

               -  For grade IV malignant gliomas (GBM): Standard front line therapy for newly
                  diagnosed GBM must include maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone
                  allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially
                  diagnosed as either a grade II or III tumor and now has recurred or progressed as
                  a grade IV GBM, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade IV GBM and will
                  be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible
                  surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and temozolomide
                  chemotherapy.

               -  For grade III malignant gliomas with 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line
                  therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal
                  feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and
                  chemotherapy (PCV or temozolomide). If the patient did not receive any or all
                  components of the standard front line therapy as detailed above for newly
                  diagnosed grade III gliomas and the tumor then recurred or progressed, s/he must
                  first receive at least one prior standard therapy or any appropriate combination
                  of the components of standard therapy as detailed above and must experience
                  further recurrence or progression before s/he is deemed eligible for this study.
                  If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II glioma with 1p 19q codeletions
                  and now has recurred or progressed as a grade III tumor, it will be considered a
                  secondary recurrent grade III glioma with 1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible
                  for this study as long as prior treatment included maximal feasible surgical
                  resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (PCV or
                  temozolomide).

               -  For grade III malignant gliomas without 1p 19q codeletions: Standard front line
                  therapy for newly diagnosed grade III malignant gliomas must include maximal
                  feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed), radiotherapy, and
                  temozolomide chemotherapy. If the tumor was initially diagnosed as a grade II
                  glioma without 1p 19q codeletions and now has recurred or progressed as a grade
                  III tumor, it will be considered a secondary recurrent grade III glioma without
                  1p 19q codeletions and will be eligible for this study as long as prior treatment
                  included maximal feasible surgical resection (biopsy alone allowed),
                  radiotherapy, and temozolomide chemotherapy.

          -  Candidate for MLA based on the size, location, and shape of the recurrent tumor as
             determined by the performing neurosurgeon. Surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA
             is allowed per standard of care but is not required; if the patient undergoes
             resection or debulking, it must have occurred at least 3 weeks prior to the first dose
             of MK-3475. For Phase II: if surgical resection/debulking prior to MLA is not
             indicated, a biopsy of the tumor will be done at the same time of MLA to obtain tumor
             tissue for both diagnostic purposes and immune monitoring.

          -  Patients who have undergone a gross total resection for recurrence will be eligible,
             and MLA will be directed at treating a peritumoral margin of 0.5-1cm surrounding the
             resection cavity to disrupt the BBB and potentially increase access of MK-3475 to the
             peritumoral infiltrating glioma cells.

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 x IULN (or ≤ 5 x IULN for patients with liver
                  metastases)

               -  INR or PT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long
                  as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants

               -  aPTT ≤ 1.5 x IULN unless patient is receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT
                  or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants

          -  Sexually active women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use
             contraception (as described in the protocol) prior to study entry, for the duration of
             study participation, and for 120 days after last dose of MK-3475. Should a woman

                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: if a patient underwent major surgery, s/he must have recovered adequately

          -  Requires therapeutic doses of anticoagulants unless anticoagulation can be safely
             discontinued before surgery per standard practice (e.g. first DVD for which
             anticoagulation has been at least 3 months and repeat imaging demonstrates resolution
             of DVT) or an IVC filter can be used in place of anticoagulation. Subjects are

             virus vaccines and are allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. FluMist)
             are live attenuated vaccines and are not allowed.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents or has participated in a study of

             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.
