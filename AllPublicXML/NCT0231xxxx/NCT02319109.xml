    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-center study in healthy volunteers to establish a PT/INR
      reference interval for the Microvisk International Normalized Ratio (INR) Test System. The
      primary objective of this study is to establish the reference interval for the measurement of
      prothrombin time (PT/INR) using the Microvisk INR Test System. The second objective is to
      evaluate the safety of the device.

      Healthy volunteers who meet eligibility criteria, have been fully informed and provided
      written informed consent will be enrolled into this study. Each participant will be required
      to donate up to 3 finger stick samples for testing on one occasion. The maximum trial
      duration for each participant is one visit/occasion. This will be followed by a standard
      venipuncture for (1) a neutral tube (Red Top) for analysis by the on-test method, (1) one
      sodium citrate tube (Blue Top) for analysis by the comparative/reference laboratory method.
      Sample collection will take place within the clinic session. The maximum trial duration for
      each participant is one clinic session.
