      Prospective cohort study to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of the fragmented, inactivated
      trivalent Influenza vaccine produced at Butantan Institute in healthy adults and elderly. The
      study will include a total of 120 participants: 60 participants aged 18 to 59 years in the
      healthy adults group, and 60 participants aged older than 60 years in the elderly group.This
      study will evaluate the safety of one dose of the fragmented, inactivated trivalent Influenza
      vaccine in the first 3 days after vaccination, as well as its immunogenicity 21 days after
      vaccination.
