      To evaluate the use of a point of care device to measure markers of inflammation in various
      eye conditions. In particular, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) will be measured. MMP-9 is
      an enzyme that plays a role in inflammation. The value obtained with the point of care device
      will be correlated with values obtained using gel electrophoresis to measure MMP-9 from the
      same sample. These data will be compared to clinical exam findings and questionnaires to help
      the investigators better understand the role of this marker of inflammation in eye diseases
      and possibly improve diagnostic abilities.

      As a participant in the study a sample of tears will be collected in a non-invasive manner by
      sitting comfortably at the slit lamp (a slit lamp is the standard device used to examine the
      eye and merely requires the participant to sit upright and place their chin on a chin rest
      and their forehead up against the slit lamp apparatus). The participant will then be asked to
      look upwards and while gently lowering the lower eyelid, a sterile blunt glass pipette will
      be used to collect tears from the natural tear lake (the tear lake is a reservoir of tears
      that sits on the surface of the eye and above the lower eyelid). Collected tears will then be
      taken for analysis of inflammatory markers.

      In addition, a survey to evaluate the symptoms and the symptoms impact daily life (Ocular
      Surface Disability Index Survey of National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-
      25).
