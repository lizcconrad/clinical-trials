  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a costly public health problem that is associated with poor quality of life.
      Previous research has demonstrated extensive evidence showing that pain coping is not
      manifested by patients in isolation but within the context of significant relationships such
      as marriage. For instance, a partner may avoid or reject their partners' negative emotions
      about pain, provide unempathic responses to their partners' pain, or change their thoughts
      about pain. The patient's pain experience and the couples' relationship also have a cyclical
      relationship, in which both can affect each other and the overall quality of life for both
      partners. Currently, current clinical practice does not target both partners to alleviate
      pain. This is highly problematic given that a number of chronic pain patients—those with
      interpersonal distress—often do not complete, and thus, do not benefit fully from existing
      treatments. Even if treatment is completed, individuals may not maintain improvements if they
      return to distressed social environments that undermine individual coping efforts. Thus, it
      is clear that new interventions derived from integrative models of individual and dyadic
      coping are needed to alleviate pain and suffering in patients who are at risk for poor
      treatment outcomes. This research study aims to develop a novel psychological intervention
      aimed at couples in which one partner has chronic pain. Our central hypothesis is that a
      theoretically integrative intervention that improves both partners' psychological flexibility
      (i.e., acceptance, mindfulness, values-based action) and relational flexibility (i.e.,
      emotional disclosure, empathic responding) skills will be feasible and valid and that it will
      alleviate pain and improve quality of life. This is a departure from current practice, which
      focuses solely on the patient's individual functioning, does not address the spouse's
      psychological inflexibility, and does not address relationship issues.
