  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthocyanins, the water-soluble compounds that make plants appear different colors, have been
      shown to prevent insulin resistance, reduce the blood glucose and oxidative stress in
      rodents. The purpose of our study is to evaluate a potential protective effect of purified
      anthocyanins supplement on type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.

      The study was designed as a randomized, double-blind label, interventional study on patients
      with T2DM. The eligible Participants are randomly assigned to control and Anthocyanins
      supplement group. During the 12 weeks trial period,the participants were instructed to
      consume two anthocyanin capsules or placebo capsules twice daily (30 min after breakfast and
      supper).
