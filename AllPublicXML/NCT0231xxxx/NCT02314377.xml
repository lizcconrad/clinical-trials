      Bevacizumab Therapy for brain arteriovenous malformation that is not amenable to surgical
      intervention.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain AVMs are relatively rare, though their potential for ICH along with the existence of
      effective treatments makes their diagnosis and management essential to the community. The
      2-4% annual incidence of such secondary ICH creates controversy regarding treatment for
      asymptomatic patients. Brain AVMs thus require multidisciplinary evaluation for optimal
      management especially for surgical grades III - V lesions that often require some combination
      of embolization, microsurgery, and/or radiosurgical treatment. Currently there is no
      designated medical therapy for bAVM, though there is growing animal and human evidence
      supporting a role for bevacizumab to reduce the size of AVMs in the brain and liver,
      respectively. This proposal is a pilot study to assess the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab
      in humans with bAVMs.

    <measure>Our primary outcome will be change in AVM volume from pre-treatment MRI.</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 26 and 52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AVM volume will be assessed by review of standardized 1.5 mm slices in the axial plane. The contour of the vascular mass using time-of-flight MR angiography sequences will generate a cross-sectional area at each slice level. The volume will be estimated by summing the imputed volume of each slice. This is the standard method in radiation oncology used to assess bAVM volume for radiosurgery treatment planning using commercial software (Leksell GammaPlan). The source images and measurement images will be archived on a research workstation. After a baseline MR examination, follow-up MRs will be performed at 12, 26 and 52 weeks.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  bAVM deemed unsuitable for invasive treatment OR patient has elected to defer invasive
             treatment OR failed conventional therapy

          -  Progressive or disabling signs and symptoms as determined by the study investigators.
             In the case of sporadic bAVM, these would be referable to the lesion, e.g.,
             progressive neurological deficits, refractory headaches and seizures; for HHT
             patients, bAVM may be asymptomatic, but patient must have one progressively
             symptomatic manifestation of HHT that is referable to a vascular lesion, e.g.,
             epistaxis, GI bleeding; or another solid organ AVM

          -  Patients must have adequate bone marrow function (WBC &gt; 3,000/μl, ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3,
