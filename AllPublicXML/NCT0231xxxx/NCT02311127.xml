  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs ) are used for the administration of
      intravenous fluids and for blood sampling. PICCs may remain in place for weeks to months and
      are safeguarded from migration or accidental dislodgement by securement devices. Different
      types of these devices are available. StatLock速 (C.R. Bard) is a stabilization device with an
      adhesive anchor pad. The catheter wings of the PICC must be placed over the posts then the
      system is closed with &quot;gull-wings&quot; . StatLock速 has to be changed weekly. Healthcare providers
      have to pay attention to prevent accidental catheter dislodgement during the renewal
      procedure. SecurAcath速 (Interrad Medical) is a new securement device to the European market.
      The device uses a small subcutaneous anchor to secure the PICC. One of the advantages
      compared to adhesive stabilization devices, is a reduction in maintenance time by simplifying
      dressing changes and subsequently staff time. It is described that nurses report that care is
      left undone due to low staffing levels. Therefore, investigation of nursing time savings with
      the support of technology is imperative. SecurAcath速 remains in place for life of the PICC
      and therefore has the potential to reduce the time for dressing change as there is no need
      for weekly device change. The objective of this study is to measure nursing time for dressing
      change and explore inserting and removal issues and patient experiences.
