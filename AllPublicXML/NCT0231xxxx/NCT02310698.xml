  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast tumors are often detected on mammography but may be harder to see in women with dense
      breasts. This is why screening breast ultrasound is sometimes used as another test in women
      with dense breasts. Ultrasound has been shown to detect additional cancers that are not seen
      on regular mammography.

      Contrast Enhanced Digital Mammography (CEDM) is a FDA approved form of mammography. It is
      essentially a routine digital mammogram performed after iodine dye (the same that is used
      with CT scans) is injected into a vein in the arm. Like screening ultrasound, CEDM has been
      shown to detect breast cancers that are not seen on a regular mammogram. The purpose of this
      study is to compare whether CEDM or screening breast ultrasound is better at detecting
      cancer. Both will be done in this study and compared to one another.

    <description>With respect to imaging, a positive test is defined by a recommendation for biopsy (BIRADS 4 or 5). Negative imaging tests are those with BIRADS 1-3. The number of recommendations for short term follow up (BI-RADS 3) will also be recorded.</description>
