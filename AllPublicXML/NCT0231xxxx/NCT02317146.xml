      There are huge doubts as to how long to keep postpartum magnesium sulfate. Studies
      demonstrating the usefulness for 24, 12 or 6 hours are of little evidence and do not take
      into account the use of magnesium sulphate before delivery. Termination of pregnancy is the
      best option to prevent eclampsia and magnesium sulphate has proven effective, but do not know
      the minimum effective dose.The investigators believe that if the patient has received less
      than 8 continuous hours of magnesium sulphate before delivery, maintain magnesium sulfate for
      6 hours is as effective as keeping it for 24 hours.

    <textblock>
      The definitive treatment known for pre-eclampsia is the interruption of pregnancy. While the
      definitive treatment is the pregnancy interruption, management includes other measures that
      have proven effective, including the administration of antihypertensive drugs for severe
      hypertension and that the use of anticonvulsant such as the magnesium sulfate.

      There are multiple studies that prove the effectiveness of magnesium sulfate to prevent
      eclampsia in patients with severe / serious disorder. Unfortunately these studies used the
      drug before birth and continue after birth. Therefore the investigators can not conclude
      whether the administration just before pregnancy is sufficient to prevent seizure. That is,
      if the cure or definitive treatment of pre-eclampsia is the interruption, did not seem
      necessary to justify the administration of anticonvulsant drugs after birth. Obvious post
      delivery management sulfate arises from the large number of postpartum eclampsia reported in
      many studies. It is unknown if the administration of magnesium sulfate for a minimum period
      not yet determined before birth and delivery requires even keep the drug after
      discontinuation.

      For all these reasons the investigators propose the following: A randomized trial where all
      those patients who received magnesium sulfate for less that 8 hours before birth will be
      randomized to two groups of study: 1- Continue magnesium sulfate for 24 hours and 2-Continue
      magnesium sulfate for 6 hours postpartum.
