  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to assess whether a follow home visit after discharge of frail elderly
      patients from Nykøbing Falster Hospital reduces the risk of readmission within 180 days.

      Staff from the hospital ward identifies patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria and refers
      the patients to two project nurses at the hospital (follow home team). One of the project
      nurses gets the informed consent from the patient, or in case of a patient who is not able to
      give informed consent, from the family and general practitioner. The patient is then
      randomized to intervention (follow home visit after discharge) or control.

      In the intervention group, the hospital project nurse and the patient meets with the
      municipal nurse in the patient's home on the same day the patient is being discharged from
      the hospital. During this visit the discharge from the hospital and the actual functioning of
      the patient in his own surroundings is reviewed, using a structured assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two parts: First, the project nurse reviews the patients
      hospitalization and discharge together with the nurse from the ward. Next, the patient is
      discharged from the hospital and is driven by the project nurse from the hospital to the
      patient's home where they meet the nurse from the municipality. Together with the patient the
      two nurses review:

        -  Cognitive skills

        -  Medicine

        -  Nutrition

        -  Mobility

        -  Level of functioning

        -  Future appointments in the health care sector

      All patients in the project - both patients in the intervention group and patients in the
      control group - will receive treatment and care equivalent to normal applicable quality
      standards with discharge from the hospital.

      It is expected that the study will demonstrate a reduction of hospital readmissions within
      180 days in the intervention group with 14 % (with a power of 90% and a significance level of
      5%). There will be a need for 200 patients in both the control and intervention group, ie 400
      patients in total.
