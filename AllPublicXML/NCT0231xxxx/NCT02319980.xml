      The aim of this study is to investigate whether extracranial-intracranial(EC-IC) bypass
      surgery could prevent rebleeding and improve neurological function in adult moyamoya with
      hemorrhagic onset.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About one half of adult moyamoya patients present with hemorrhagic onset.As the bleeding
      events are potentially fatal, it often lead to particularly poor prognosis.However, the
      natural history is still poorly understood.Although the rebleeding rate is known to be
      extremely high,no effective therapeutic method has been established based on a worldwide
      consensus.

      The recently published Japanese Adult Moyamoya(JAM) Trial, which is the first
      prospective,randomized,controlled trial focused on hemorrhagic moyamoya,showed that direct
      bypass surgery could reduce the rebleeding rate and improve the prognosis.However,the result
      was statistically marginal with a small sample size and most importantly,it failed to assess
      the neurological function.The effect of bypass surgery on functional outcome was uncertain.

      Therefore,the AHMSS study in China is designed to compare the efficacy and safety of EC-IC
      bypass surgery with conservative treatment in adult moyamoya patients with hemorrhagic onset
      by comprehensive assessment of rebleeding rate, neurological function.
