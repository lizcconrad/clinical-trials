      This study aims to use validated tools as well as new technology to examine changes in
      bleeding patterns among women who are initiating the copper T380A IUD.

      New users of the intrauterine device (IUD) are most likely to discontinue use within the
      first six months after insertion. The most common reason for discontinuation of the copper
      IUD is symptoms related to bleeding. Research looking at disturbances in bleeding patterns
      among new IUD users is sparse and dated. Perceived changes in vaginal bleeding may impact
      method satisfaction, acceptability, and continuation. There is a need for updated research
      evaluating changes in bleeding patterns in order for providers to better counsel patients on
      what to expect during the months after initiation of an IUD.

      A variety of methods to evaluate bleeding profiles are available. The World Health
      Organization (WHO) published recommendations for methods of collection and analysis of
      bleeding patterns. The WHO method includes data collection on bleeding days (days when blood
      loss requires the use of a menstrual pad or tampon) and spotting days (when no protection was
      needed) using 90-day referent periods. A second tool, the pictorial blood loss assessment
      chart (PBAC) has been shown to be an inexpensive and objective method of assessing blood
      loss. The PBAC takes into consideration how heavy blood flow is as well as the number of
      sanitary napkins and tampons used. Additionally, new technologies (including mobile period
      tracking applications) have made retrospective collection of bleeding data more feasible and
      prospective data collection more accurate.

      This study aims to incorporate these validated tools as well as new technology to examine
      changes in bleeding patterns among women who are initiating the copper T380A IUD.
