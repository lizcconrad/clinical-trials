    <textblock>
      A phase 2b, placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multi-center study of GCS-100 in
      patients with chronic kidney disease caused by diabetes. The study will enroll approximately
      375 patients at multiple centers located in the United States. Study duration is 6 months.
      Patients will be randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to treatment with placebo (0.9% Sodium Chloride
      Injection, USP), 1 mg, 3 mg, or 9 mg GCS-100. All doses of study drug will be administered
      via intravenous (IV) push injection once weekly for 2 months (8 weeks), then every other week
      for an additional 4 months (16 weeks).

      Galectin-3 contributes to fibrosis, is elevated in patients with ESRD, and correlates with
      adverse outcomes (de Boer et. al., 2011, Dang et. al., 2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al.,
      2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3 demonstrate
      a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al., 2012,
      Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3
      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of
      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at
      treating patients with CKD caused by diabetes.
