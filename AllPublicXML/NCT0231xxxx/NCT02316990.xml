      Stress ulcers or stress-related mucosal disease (SRMD) is defined as &quot;acute superficial
      inflammation lesions of the gastric mucosa induced when an individual is subject to
      abnormally elevated physiologic demands.&quot;[1] Studies have shown that SRMD occurred in
      75%-100% ICU patients[1]. Gastrointestinal bleeding due to SRMD is an important complication
      in critically ill patients. The frequency of clinically important bleeding ranged from 5.3%
      to 33%.[2] The mortality in ICU patients with stress related bleeding approaches 50%, which
      is much higher than the patients without bleeding (9%). [3] In 1999, the American Society of
      Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) published guidelines on the use of stress ulcer prophylaxis
      in medical, surgical, respiratory, and pediatric ICU patients [2]. PPIs and H2RA are widely
      used in China current clinical practice for the prevention of stress ulcer bleeding. However,
      there is no epidemiology data to show the risk factors for stress ulcer bleeding and the
      bleeding rate of Chinese neurosurgical critically ill patients who are usually suffering from
      brain trauma, cerebral haemorrhage or brain tumour operation. Information is needed to know
      about the characteristics in Chinese critically ill neurosurgical patients.

      Objectives of this Non-Interventional Study Primary

        1. Primary objective: To estimate the overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal (GI)
           bleeding in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

        2. Main secondary objective

             -  To estimate the incidence of upper GI bleeding with clinically significant
                complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

             -  To estimate the incidence of any overt upper GI bleeding without clinically
                significant complications in critically ill neurosurgical patients in China.

             -  To assess time to upper GI bleeding after a cerebral lesion.

             -  To investigate potential risk factors associated with upper GI bleeding, and assess
                how common certain risk factors occurred in upper GI bleeding patients.

             -  To assess the overall incidence of upper GI bleeding in critically ill patients by
                different risk factors for upper GI bleeding.

             -  To investigate the drugs, the route of administration, the doses and the duration
                commonly used for stress ulcer prophylaxis.

             -  To investigate the proportion of ICU patients with nasogastric tube, and the
                duration of nasogastric tube.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject population that will be included in the NIS are the consecutive discharged
             patients ≥18 years old who were hospitalized to Neurosurgical departments. Those whose
             Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) ≤10[4] within 24 hours of lesion/admission will be defined as
             critically ill patients. Three kinds of cases will be included: brain trauma
             critically ill patients, cerebral haemorrhage critically ill patients or postoperative
             brain tumour critically ill patients.

        Exclusion Criteria:

                  trauma or epistaxis;

               3. Known upper GI lesions that might bleed (e.g., varices, polyps, tumours, etc);
