      A prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical study to establish clinical based evidence of
      PRP Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix and compare its performance with the usual and customary
      practice for the treatment of Wagner 1 or 2 DFUs.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, single-blind, controlled, multi-center study for subjects
      undergoing DFU treatment. Qualified subjects will be randomized (1:1); test group (PRP
      Concepts Fibrin Bio-Matrix) and control group (usual and customary practice). The study will
      consist of 3 periods: a screening period, an active treatment period, and a follow-up period
      (if healed). Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be â‰¥18 years of age
      with a chronic Wagner grade 1 or 2 DFU (greater than 1 month duration). Each subject will be
      enrolled in the active treatment period for up to 12 weeks, or to closure of wound with a
      confirmatory visit 2 weeks after wound closure, whether such closure occurs at 12 weeks or
      earlier.
