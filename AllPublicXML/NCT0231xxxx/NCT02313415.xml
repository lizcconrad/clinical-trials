      Study of the treatment of infertility caused by recurrent intrauterine adhesions (IUA) by
      collagen scaffold loaded with umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) to
      provide clinical evidence of safety and effectiveness for the treatment of uterine
      infertility.

    <textblock>
      Infertility is defined as a women fails to become pregnant after having a normal sex life for
      two years without contraception. There is limited treatment to the infertility caused by
      severe IUA especially recurrent IUA after adhesiolysis which hinders embryos implantation.
      The existing drugs, physical or surgical treatments had no significant effects to severe
      recurrent intrauterine adhesions. Collagen is the main component of the extracellular matrix
      with good biocompatibility, UC-MSCs have been used in the clinical treatment of diseases, and
      achieved good results. In this study, collagen scaffold and umbilical cord blood-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells are combined, and they showed good biological safety.

    <description>Before considering whether patients meet the inclusion criteria, they are diagnosed as intrauterine adhesions with at least one unsuccessful hysteroscopic surgery. And after that there will be history taking, physical examination, ultrasound examination and hysteroscopy examination. If they agree to participate, they will receive separation of adhesions by hysteroscopy surgery and endometrial biopsies, then a collagen scaffold loaded with UC-MSCs will be transplanted into the uterine cavity. The procedure was performed after taking 6 mg/day Ã— 10 days Progynova, continuous administration of the same dosage Progynova for 30 days and 60mg of progesterone were injected on the 30th day post-operation. Postoperative observation including ultrasound examination once a month for 3 times and hysteroscopy after 3 months. The doctor will select an appropriate time for pregnancy and follow-up including requiring patients to do some unscheduled visits.</description>
