  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Retinal oximetry can be measured with newly developed Oxymap (Oxymap ehf, Reykjavik,
      Iceland). Briefly, the device simultaneously acquires digital images at two wavelengths and
      automatically tracks retinal vessels on both images. Retinal vessel oxygen saturation is
      estimated by spectrophotometric analysis of light reflected from retinal vessels and from the
      immediately surrounding retina. Oxygen saturation measurements are made on major temporal
      arteries and veins. Briefly, the first and second degree vessels are used, with the addition
      of third degree vessels in images where peripapillary haemorrhage prevented analysis close to
      the optic disc. Vessel segments chosen for analysis are used consistently for consecutive
      measurements in the same retina.
