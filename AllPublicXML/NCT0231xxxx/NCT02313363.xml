    <description>patient-centered smartphone-based diabetes care system (PSDCS) is composed of 4 modules such as glucose module, diet module, physical activity module, and SNS module. Participants were instructed to use the PSDCS and to measure blood glucose levels with a Bluetooth glucometer, input daily food intake, and wear an activity tracker.</description>
