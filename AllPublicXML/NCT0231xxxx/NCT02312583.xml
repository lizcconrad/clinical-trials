      iFighDepression is an online self-help programme based on cognitive-behavioral therapy that
      could be useful for the treatment of mild to moderate depression

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression (MD) is a disease with a great impact on people´s functioning and is the
      second leading cause of disability worldwide. It is a condition with a high prevalence, about
      10% of men and 20% of women in the population will be diagnosed MD throughout their lives,
      and has an effect on high economic costs to health services.

      While there are many effective therapeutic options for the treatment of depression, many
      people with depressive episodes do not receive an appropriate treatment or, in fact, do not
      receive any treatment at all. The social stigma, difficulties to access mental health
      services, to integrate therapy sessions into working life, or problems to pay for treatment
      are some of the main barriers to receive adequate treatment.

      On-line interventions are easily accessible and low cost, and different studies suggest that
      these interventions have significant and lasting improvements in different mental disorders.
      These studies indicate that this type of treatment would be indicated for disorders that, as
      the case of MD, have a high prevalence and relatively low help-seeking for treatment.

      iFighDepression is an online self-help programme for mild to moderate depression that has
      been developed in the context of the European project Preventing Depression and Improving
      Awareness through Networking in the European Union (PREDI-NU) which is managed by the
      European Alliance Against Depression (EAAD). It involves the most complete integration of the
      cognitive-behavioral online programs available to date, which is a format of intervention
      that has been proven effective in reducing depressive symptoms in several randomized
      controlled trials. IFightDepression is currently in pilot phase in 7 European Union
      countries, including Spain.

      The purpose of this project is to study the therapeutic effect of the iFightDepression online
      programme in patients with mild to moderate depression
