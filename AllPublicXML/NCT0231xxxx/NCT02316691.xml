  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid eye disease (TED) is an autoimmune inflammation of the orbital tissues that develops
      in up to 50% of patients with Graves' disease. Although about 80% respond to IVGC initially,
      the relapse rate is high and about 75% require further surgery despite initial response.
      Although the natural history of TED is associated with spontaneous remissions after about 1
      to 3 years, many irreversible serious ophthalmic and orbital complications can arise during
      this time. Therefore, there is a need for improved intervention strategies in the early
      active inflammatory phase of TED, to avoid progression to the cicatricial stage where disease
      manifestations can only be addressed in a rehabilitative fashion. The primary
      immunopathogenesis of Graves' disease is considered to be activation of B cells that then
      produce autoantibody against thyrotropin receptors in the thyroid (TRAb). Like in many
      autoimmune diseases, the inflammatory CD4+ T cell subset known as Th17 cells is also
      increased in blood of patients with active Graves' disease; the putative Th17 cytokine,
      IL-17, is also increased in serum and tears of TED patients. There is also an emerging
      pathogenic role for Th17 cells that co-express the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and drive
      autoantibody production. The contribution of Th17 cells to TED is not well defined. This
      study is an observational, longitudinal, prospective study of patients receiving treatment
      for thyroid eye disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All enrolled subjects will receive Intravenous Glucocorticoid (IVGC) therapy, which is
      currently the standard of care for TED patients. Subjects will receive the IVGC therapy at a
      facility chosen by them and their physician. If their disease does not respond to IVGC
      therapy, they will receive rituximab and/or surgical decompression and/or radiation which is
      also currently standard of care at a facility chosen by them and their physician. Prior to
      initiation of treatment and during the course of treatment, study patients will get research
      labs done along with routine labs and fill out questionnaires regarding their disease
      symptoms.

      We will obtain 30 mL or 2 tablespoons of blood from subjects at initial evaluation and
      approximately Wk4, Wk 12, Wk 26, Wk 38, and Wk 52 (this may vary depending on when the
      patient comes in for their follow up visits, but the schedule approximates what is typical
      for standard of care in these patients) for mechanistic studies.
