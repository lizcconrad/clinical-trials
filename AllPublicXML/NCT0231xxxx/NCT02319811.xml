  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the long-term survivorship and clinical outcomes of
      all cryopreserved meniscus transplants performed by Dr. Frank Noyes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients receiving cryopreserved meniscus transplants will be followed at 1, 2, 5, 10,
      and 15 years postoperatively. Study examination will include comprehensive knee examination
      by Dr. Noyes, x-rays, and potentially MRI. Patients will complete the following forms of the
      Cincinnati Knee Rating System: Symptom Rating Form, Sports Activity and Function Form, and
      Occupational Rating Form. All patient identification will be kept confidential. Patient data
      will be entered into the Knee Registry database according to their unique study number by the
      clinical research assistant.
