    <textblock>
      This is an open, self-paired study of 200 patients with heart failure who have a diagnosis of
      chronic stable angina pectoris, who will be treated for 30 days with propatyl nitrate (10mg)
      . Treatment regimen is 3 sublingual tablets per day, at 8:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 8:00 PM. The
      study will include three visits the patient to the study center: Pretreatment / Assessment 1,
      Assessment 2 after 15 days of treatment, and the Assessment 3 after 30 days of treatment. At
      each visit, data will be collected on the medical history, physical examination and vital
      signs, and evaluation of episodes of angina pectoris, as well as the laboratory evaluation of
      adverse events and the use of concomitant medications.
