  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of a program of early mobilization
      in the functional capacity in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting in short
      and long- term.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypotheses this study is that patients if conduct the program of early mobilization
      during hospitalization achieve better performance in the walk test (distance) at hospital
      discharge and 60 days after the surgical procedure compared to patients who only carry out
      the program of respiratory exercises. Intervention and control groups will receive breathing
      exercises up to 24 hours postoperatively, and the intervention group will also receive early
      mobilization exercises.

    <description>Patients will perform deep breaths (3 sets of 10 repetitions), once a day, for 30 minutes until 7th postoperative day. Non invasive ventilation will be installed after orotracheal extubation for 30 to 60 minutes.Early mobilization protocol consist of upper and lower (cycle ergometer) limb exercises, chair transfer, deambulation for 10 to 20 minutes, step exercise (six times).</description>

    <description>Respiratory exercises will be performed and subsequently active upper limb exercises will be conducted (flexion-extension and adduction-abduction) of large joints (shoulder, elbow and wrist) Associated with upper limb exercises, patients will undergo a series of exercises ergometer with lower limb (LL). The mobilization will be conducted on a cycle ergometer in an active, lasting 20 minutes, divided into three steps: heat 5 minutes; 10 minutes of low intensity exercise, with a speed of 30 revolutions per minute (rpm); and 5 minutes recovery. The patient remains in the supine position with the head of the bed elevated to 45 degrees, while the lower limbs will remain planned. After positioning the patient, the ergometer is adjusted.</description>
