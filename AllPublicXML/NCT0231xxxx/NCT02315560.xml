      To determine the effects of electrical stimulation of the nerves in the foot on the incidence
      of nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) in children

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nocturnal Enuresis is a very common and difficult to treat problem in the pediatric
      population which can have significant negative impact on a child's quality of life. Apart
      from medications which can have significant side effects limiting their use, there is a lack
      of effective and safe treatment options for children with frequent nocturnal enuresis. If
      foot stimulation prior to bed does indeed improve the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, it may
      provide a safe and non-invasive therapeutic option.

    <description>The subject/parents will be instructed to record a night-time voiding log specifying the number of incontinent episodes per night. This log is included in the Institutional Review Board application. Subjects/parents will fill out the log for a two week period prior to foot stimulation to determine a baseline average of nocturnal enuresis episodes, during the two week foot stimulation period to measure any acute effect on nocturnal enuresis episodes and finally during the two weeks after stimulation to evaluate any post-stimulation residual benefit</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Children ages 5 to 16 years old without any specific neurological disorder or urinary
             tract infection, clinically diagnosed as having nocturnal enuresis AT LEAST 4 episodes
             per month by history

          2. Currently having no daytime overactive bladder symptoms, i.e. urinary frequency,
             urgency, or daytime incontinence

          3. Having been assessed for and treated if applicable for behavioral etiologies of
             nocturnal enuresis - consuming excess fluids or specific bladder irritants

          4. Having been assessed for and treated if applicable for constipation

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with known neurological disorders which may be contributing to nocturnal
             enuresis episodes

          2. Children found through history to have significant behavioral causes of nocturnal
             enuresis including consumption of excessive fluids or known bladder irritants

          3. Children with chronic constipation who are non-compliant with previous pharmacologic
             efforts to treat.

          4. Children who are not adequately potty trained

          5. Children with significant daytime symptoms of overactive bladder including frequency,
             urgency, and daytime incontinence

        5. Children who do not tolerate initial stimulation training session in the urology clinic
        upon enrollment

        6. Children with any implantable medical devices such as a pacemaker will be excluded from
        the study

        Note: Any patient currently taking medication such as an anti-muscarinic or a tricyclic
        antidepressant for overactive bladder at time of enrollment will be eligible to participate
        and will be continued on their usual medication and dosage throughout the study.
