    <description>A standard 3+3 design will be employed. Three dose levels of ibrutinib will be investigated. Patients will be treated in cohorts of size three to six and the dosage will be escalated if the clinical toxicity is acceptable. A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as in any of the following during cycle 1: any grade 4 hematologic toxicity, grade 3 febrile neutropenia and grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with bleeding or any grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity that does not respond to supportive therapy and at least possibly related to treatment with ibrutinib.</description>

    <description>This is an open-label, non-randomized, single center, dose escalation, phase I/II study to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of ibrutinib as a single agent in patients with refractory/recurrent PCNSL or refractory/recurrent SCNSL (Arm A). The defined MTD will then be used in an expansion cohort to further assess toxicity and clinical activity(Arm B). Arm C will investigate the MTD of ibrutinib in combination with HD-MTX and to determine the safety and tolerability of the ibrutinib/HD-MTX combination regimen in PCNSL and SCNSL patients. To minimize drug-drug interaction between HD-MTX and Ibrutinib, Ibrutinib will not be administered concurrently with HD-MTX.</description>

    <description>Arm A: Ibrutinib will be given once daily. The starting dose cohort (level 1) will receive 560 mg/day (4 x 140 mg capsules). During the dose escalation period of the study, the &quot;3+3&quot; design will be applied (see Table 3). Participants will be assigned to cohorts of increasing oral daily doses of ibrutinib (560mg, 840mg) until disease progression, intolerable toxicity or death. Three patients with recurrent/refractory PCNSL or recurrent/refractory SCNSL will be treated with daily oral ibrutinib for a 28-day cycle starting at dose level 1 and observed for toxicities during cycle 1. Arm B: Ibrutinib will be given at the MTD defined in Arm A.</description>
