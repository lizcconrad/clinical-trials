    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of the PulseRider in patients undergoing
      treatment for bifurcation basilar or carotid terminus aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Endpoints:

        -  Safety: Death or stroke in downstream territory to 180-days post-procedure

        -  Technical Success: Device placement success and ability to retain coils at the time of
           the index procedure

        -  Rate of aneurysm occlusion at Day zero (0) and 180 days

      Additional Evaluations to 180-days and at 365-day follow up:

        -  Rate of aneurysm occlusion at 365 days

        -  Device movement or migration

        -  Stenosis

        -  Rate of incidence of new neurological deficits

        -  Complication rate (neurological and non-neurological)

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who presents with an angiographically confirmed, wide neck intracranial
             aneurysms located at a bifurcation of the basilar artery or carotid terminus artery

          -  The target aneurysm is in a vessel with a diameter of 2.7 mm to 4.5 mm.

          -  The patient is 18 years or older at the time of consent

          -  The patient has signed the IRB/EC approved informed consent form

          -  In the opinion of the physician, placement of the PulseRider is technically feasible
             and clinically indicated

          -  Subject has mental capacity and is willing and able to comply with protocol
             requirements and follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable neurological deficit (condition worsening within the last 90 days)

          -  Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) within the last 60 days

          -  Irreversible bleeding disorder

          -  mRS score â‰¥3

          -  Patient has another aneurysm which, in the Investigator's opinion, will require
             treatment within the follow up period (365 days)

          -  Platelet count &lt; 100 x 103 cells/mm3

          -  Inability to tolerate, adverse reaction or contraindication to taking aspirin or
             clopidogrel

          -  A history of contrast allergy that cannot be medically controlled

          -  Known allergy to nickel

          -  Relative contraindication to angiography (e.g., serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg/dL)

          -  Woman with child-bearing potential who cannot provide a negative pregnancy test

          -  Evidence of active infection

          -  Other conditions of the heart, blood, brain or intracranial vessels that carry a high
             risk of neurologic events

          -  Evidence of disease or condition expected to compromise survival or ability to
             complete follow-up assessments during the 365-day follow-up period

          -  Extracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the parent artery requiring access to the
             lesion

          -  Intracranial stenosis greater than 50% in the treated vessel

          -  Extreme vessel tortuosity that prohibits appropriate control of the micro-guide wire
             and/or the PulseRider delivery wire
