  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interest on gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction in hemodialysis has been growing in the
      last years. it is now accepted that GI dysfunction in dialyzed patients may contribute to
      systemic microinflammation by promoting gut dysbiosis and bacterial translocation in the
      blood. Another mechanism by which GI dysfunction contributes to systemic symptoms is related
      to metabolic activity of the dysbiotic microflora growing in the gut of these patients to
      generate toxic compounds such as phenols, indoles, and amines. Epidemiological evidence has
      strongly linked one of these compounds, p-Cresol, to cardiovascular risk and mortality in
      hemodialysis patients. In the present paper the investigators investigated the effect of a
      probiotic/prebiotic mixture on plasma p-cresol concentrations and GI symptoms and in
      hemodialysis patients.

    <textblock>
      In patients with end stage renal disease, alterations in gut microbioma are posited to be
      responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms and generation of p-cresol, a uremic toxin, that
      has been associated to cardiovascular mortality.

      This double blind randomized placebo controlled pilot study evaluates whether
      Probinul-neutro®, a synbiotic preparation that normalizes intestinal microflora, may lower
      plasma p-cresol concentrations and reduce gastrointestinal symptoms in hemodialysis patients.

      Thirty patients on hemodialysis were randomized to receive either Probinul neutro® or placebo
      for four weeks. Total plasma p-cresol concentrations was assessed at baseline, and 15 and 30
      days after treatment start. At the same study times, ease and frequency of defecation, upper
      and lower abdominal pain, stool shape, borborygmi and flatus were quantified by subjective
      assessment questionnaires.
