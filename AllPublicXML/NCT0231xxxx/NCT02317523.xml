    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of Behavioral Activation (BA) therapy vs Support and
      Information for reducing risk for emotional and cardiovascular diseases in Alzheimer's
      caregivers. Half of participants will receive BA and the other half will receive support and
      information.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burden of caring for a loved-one with Alzheimer's disease is associated with adverse
      psychological and general health consequences for the caregiver. These consequences including
      risk for depression, cardiovascular disease, and earlier mortality. Because preliminary work
      has demonstrated that an educational programs for caregivers reduce the negative affect
      associated with caregiving, the investigators wish to determine whether improving mood can
      also modify pathophysiological changes that have been linked to risk for developing
      cardiovascular disease.

      The investigators aims are to determine whether a 6-week Behavioral Activation (BA)
      intervention, followed by 3 booster sessions over a period of 6 months, compared to an
      Information-Support (IS) intervention will be associated with significant improvement in
      indicators of vascular pathology, modification of psychobiological markers that have been
      associated with cardiovascular parameters, and to determine whether improvements in
      indicators of vascular parameters will be mediated by treatment related change in measures of
      distress and markers of cardiovascular disease risk.

    <description>Information and Support (IS) consists of providing education on Alzheimer's disease, coping with specific stresses prevalent in caregiving, and community-based services available for caregivers. Caregivers choose information most relevant to their current circumstances, and can discuss this with their counselor during the sessions. In addition, the IS condition encompasses elements of supportive therapy including empathy and active listening. The intervention consists of 6 total face-to-face sessions lasting 60 minutes each.</description>
