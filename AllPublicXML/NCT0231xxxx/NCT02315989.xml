      The main purpose of this study is to collect the safety data of Sumitomo Heavy Industries'
      proton therapy equipment for the treatment of solid cancer patients in Linkou Chang Gung
      Memorial Hospital, including the patients' early-stage adverse reactions and the efficacy on
      tumors, as well as to assess the operating functionality of the proton therapy system.

      The main purpose of this study is to collect the safety data of Sumitomo Heavy Industries'
      proton therapy equipment for the treatment of solid cancer patients in Linkou Chang Gung
      Memorial Hospital, including the patients' early-stage adverse reactions and the efficacy on
      tumors, as well as to assess the operating functionality of the proton therapy system.

      In this study, solid cancer subjects will be treated with Sumitomo's proton therapy system.
      Safety and operating functionality data will be collected during the treatment and
      following-up.
