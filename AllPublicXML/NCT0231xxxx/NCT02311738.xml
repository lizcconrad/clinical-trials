  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular exercise has several positive health effects including increased physical fitness and
      muscle mass. It is well known that increased muscle mass is associated with increased resting
      energy expenditure which may facilitate weight loss and maintenance. Previous studies have,
      however, failed to show any consistent association between the intensity of physical exercise
      and energy expenditure, or relate the variance in these adaptations to genetic variability.
      Whether high-intensity exercise (HIE) is associated with improved health related quality of
      life in severely obese patients remains unknown.

      This PhD-project is based on a planned randomised controlled study including 50 or more
      treatment seeking morbidly obese patients who will be randomised to either a 24 week
      moderate-intensity exercise (MIE) programme or a 24 week high-intensity exercise (HIE)
      programme. The investigators main hypothesis is that patients randomised to the HIE-program
      will achieve higher energy expenditure during rest and physical activity after treatment than
      those allocated to the MIE-programme. In addition, the investigators hypothesise that the
      HIE-group will achieve a better health related quality of life than the MIE-group after
      treatment. The investigators also hypothesize that inter-individual variability in adaptation
      to the two training regimens may be due to genetic factors. If the investigators hypotheses
      are confirmed, this project might have beneficial clinical implications for future obesity
      treatment strategies.

    <description>Resting energy expenditure and energy expenditure (EE) during volitional activity will be measured by indirect calorimetry one week before the exercise intervention period starts, and repeated after each exercise period. Increasing the aerobic work capacity is supposed to give the same proportional increase in energy expenditure at any given maximal intensity. Therefore, indirect calorimetry measurements will be performed at wk 8 and 16 in order to recalculate the EE</description>

    <description>We hypothesize that inter-individual variability in adaptation/response to the two training regimens may also be due to genetic factors. We have designed a gene panel consisting of recognized and previously reported risk genes/variants with flanking sequences relevant for exercise (VO2max), participation in physical activity, obesity, diabetes, asthma and obesity related sub-phenotypes. The panel covers 1.2 Mb and includes 299 genes (exons with exon-intron junctions) and 1468 intronic and intergenic SNPs. Next-generation sequencing will be performed using a gene panel of selected genes/genetic regions by Illumina Nextera technology. The method involves enzymatic fragmentation of DNA and probe-based enrichment. The samples will be sequenced (paired-end, 2x100 bp) on a HiScanSQ. All wet lab methods (with other gene panels) are ISO15189 certified and in routine use at Unit for Medical Genetics at Telemark Hospital.</description>
