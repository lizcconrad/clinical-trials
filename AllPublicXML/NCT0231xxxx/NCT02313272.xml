  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the addition of the investigation drug called
      pembrolizumab (Keytruda®) to radiation therapy and bevacizumab (Avastin®) is safe and can
      help with controlling the growth of tumors, in participants with recurrent high grade glioma.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The pembrolizumab dose used in the dose expansion cohort will be MTD determined from the dose escalation phase. Dose Escalation: The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is the highest dose of pembrolizumab in combination with bevacizumab after radiation therapy that does not cause unacceptable toxicity in more than one of six patients at that dose level. The MTD is defined as one dose level below the highest toxic dose (i.e., the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) dose).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Response Rate (RR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate of pembrolizumab given in combination with bevacizumab and hypofractionated stereotactic re-irradiation of recurrent high grade gliomas. Response to treatment will be assessed by the investigator and according to the Response Assessment Criteria for High-Grade Gliomas (RANO Criteria). Brain MRI will be performed every 6 weeks beginning at the end of Week 6 (± 1 week) for 3 cycles and then every 12 weeks (± 1 week) until disease progression or treatment discontinuation, whichever occurs later.</description>
