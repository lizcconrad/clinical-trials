  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this cohort is to evaluate the follow-up of morbidly obese patients treated by
      several types of bariatric procedures. In addition, this study could lead to the development
      of clinical trials on assessment of the bariatric surgery impact.

      The main objective is to prospectively evaluate long-term efficiency of bariatric surgery in
      terms of weight loss. Moreover, this cohort wants to assess the long-term effectiveness of
      bariatric surgery on comorbidities and quality of life, the medical and economic impact of
      bariatric surgery (before-after comparison using data from health insurance), estimates the
      incidence of mortality and morbidity of bariatric surgery and to finish describe the
      evolution of patients in case of new-surgery. From a methodological point of view, the
      Obesity cohort is a prospective cohort study, single-center, open, with aftercare performed
      during life of patients. The number of inclusions is to 1500 patients. After surgery ,
      patients will be followed at least 4 visits the first year and at least 2 visits a year then.
      The recommendations of the french health ministry (HAS), the frequency of visits may be
      increased according to the patient's progress. Follow-up visits of patients after bariatric
      surgery will be performed by physicians or surgeons of the multidisciplinary team responsible
      for the care of the patient (digestive and reconstructive surgery, anesthesiology,
      endocrinology, medical imaging, gastroenterology, immunology and physiology) . It will be
      insured for life, obesity is a chronic disease and because of the risk of late complications.
