  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether antibiotics is mandatory for the
      treatment of acute uncomplicated right-sided diverticulitis.

      The hypothesis is that patients having acute uncomplicated diverticulitis at right-sided
      colon will be recovered without antibiotics.

      All patients in the study were randomly allocated to one of the following two treatment
      groups; no-antibiotics group or antibiotics group.

      Patients of no-antibiotics group were admitted to the ward and administered intravenous fluid
      and bowel rest at least up to 5 days until clinical symptom and sign were stabilized. And
      then the patient discharge until oral intake was tolerated.

      In antibiotics group, the treatment was initiated with an intravenous combination of a third
      generation cephalosporin or quinolone and metronidazole until oral intake was tolerated. Oral
      antibiotics such as cefpodoxime together with metronidazole were initiated subsequently on
      the ward. The total duration of antibiotic treatment was an expected average 10days.

      Patients in both group were re-visited outpatient clinic after an expected average 7 days for
      check-up of serology test (including complete blood count and C-reactive protein), and after
      an expected average 6 weeks for CT. If the patients did not re-visit outpatient clinic, we
      checked the call.
