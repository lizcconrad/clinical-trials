  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1 study of RO6927005. The study
      will establish the safety and tolerability profile of RO6927005 and will be conducted in two
      parts.

      In Part A, the first dose escalations will be carried out using cohorts of 1 patient. Single
      patient cohorts will be used to investigate increasing doses until a first dose-limiting
      toxicity (DLT) is reached or until grade-2 related toxicity (except infusion-related
      reactions), whichever comes first. At least 3 patients will be enrolled in each cohort
      thereafter, which, if required, can be expanded with additional patients. Part B of the study
      will consist of a multiple ascending dose phase (multiple patients cohorts - &gt;/= 3 patients)
      followed by an extension phase of RO6927005 given in combination with
      gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel.

      Preliminary clinical activity will be explored throughout the study. Patients will be treated
      until disease progression and/or lack of clinical benefit, unacceptable toxicities,
      withdrawal from treatment for other reasons, death, pregnancy or termination of the study by
      the Sponsor, whichever comes first.

  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was prematurely terminated because the emerging benefit:risk ratio did not justify
    continuing dosing patients.
