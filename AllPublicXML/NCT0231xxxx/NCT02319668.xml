  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the effect of two week pre-surgical
      rinsing with an antimicrobial mouthrinse containing 0.2% w/v Chlorhexidine digluconate on the
      total number of plaque bacteria in the mouth 3 days post implant surgery. The study will be
      conducted at Eastman Clinical Investigation Centre (ECIC), University College London (UCL)
      Eastman Dental Institute. Participants will be those who require a single and simple surgical
      implant to be placed, and will be recruited from new patient referrals within the Eastman
      Dental Hospital

    <measure>Total Number of Detectable Plaque Bacteria Sampled 3 Days Post Implant Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The examiner identified three plaque sampling sites as follows: surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue. An individual cotton swab was used at each identified site for up to 20 seconds in order to harvest a plaque sample and immediately be placed into 1mL phosphate buffered saline in a sterile Eppendorf tube. The samples were analysed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which determined the total number of bacteria in a sample by quantifying the number of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes in the sample. The number of bacteria in each of the three identified plaque sampling sites (surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue) for each participant were summed to calculate the total number of bacteria for each participant.</description>

    <description>The examiner identified three plaque sampling sites as follows: surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue. An individual cotton swab was used at each identified site for up to 20 seconds in order to harvest a plaque sample and immediately be placed into 1mL phosphate buffered saline in a sterile Eppendorf tube. The samples were analysed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which determined the total number of bacteria in a sample by quantifying the number of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes in the sample. The AUC of the total count of detectable plaque bacteria was calculated using trapezoidal rule in the time range from immediately post implant surgery to 7 days post implant surgery</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Number of Recoverable Viable Bacteria in the Aerosol Generated During Dental Prophylaxis</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Thick settle blood agar plates (supplemented with 5% [volume by volume v/v]) defibrinated horse blood) were used to determine the bacterial load of the aerosol. Thirty (30) minutes prior to the participants had their procedure (dental prophylaxis), a total of 5 settle plates with lids removed were placed at set positions around the dental surgery. After 30 minutes, the settle plates lids were replaced. This was repeated during the dental prophylaxis procedure using 5 fresh settle plates. All plates were then sealed with parafilm and transported for incubation in an anaerobic chamber at 37°C for 3 days. The plates were inspected daily to access growth and after 3 days removed and stored at 4°C for subsequent colony enumeration and Colony Forming Unit/mL (CFU/mL) calculation</description>

        <title>Total Number of Detectable Plaque Bacteria Sampled 3 Days Post Implant Surgery</title>
        <description>The examiner identified three plaque sampling sites as follows: surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue. An individual cotton swab was used at each identified site for up to 20 seconds in order to harvest a plaque sample and immediately be placed into 1mL phosphate buffered saline in a sterile Eppendorf tube. The samples were analysed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which determined the total number of bacteria in a sample by quantifying the number of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes in the sample. The number of bacteria in each of the three identified plaque sampling sites (surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue) for each participant were summed to calculate the total number of bacteria for each participant.</description>

        <description>The examiner identified three plaque sampling sites as follows: surgical site, contralateral site to the surgical site and tongue. An individual cotton swab was used at each identified site for up to 20 seconds in order to harvest a plaque sample and immediately be placed into 1mL phosphate buffered saline in a sterile Eppendorf tube. The samples were analysed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) which determined the total number of bacteria in a sample by quantifying the number of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) genes in the sample. The AUC of the total count of detectable plaque bacteria was calculated using trapezoidal rule in the time range from immediately post implant surgery to 7 days post implant surgery</description>

        <title>Total Number of Recoverable Viable Bacteria in the Aerosol Generated During Dental Prophylaxis</title>
        <description>Thick settle blood agar plates (supplemented with 5% [volume by volume v/v]) defibrinated horse blood) were used to determine the bacterial load of the aerosol. Thirty (30) minutes prior to the participants had their procedure (dental prophylaxis), a total of 5 settle plates with lids removed were placed at set positions around the dental surgery. After 30 minutes, the settle plates lids were replaced. This was repeated during the dental prophylaxis procedure using 5 fresh settle plates. All plates were then sealed with parafilm and transported for incubation in an anaerobic chamber at 37°C for 3 days. The plates were inspected daily to access growth and after 3 days removed and stored at 4°C for subsequent colony enumeration and Colony Forming Unit/mL (CFU/mL) calculation</description>
