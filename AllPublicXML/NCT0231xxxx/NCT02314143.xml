  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-arm, open-label, randomised Phase II study to evaluate whether the different
      sequencing of dabrafenib and trametinib monotherapies and the upfront combination has an
      impact on translational or clinical activity in subjects with BRAF mutant metastatic
      unresectable stage IIIc or IV melanoma. Both dabrafenib and trametinib have demonstrated
      clinical activity as monotherapies and in combination in BRAF-mutant melanoma. However,
      duration of responses seem to be limited due to acquired drug resistance. The goal of this
      protocol is to study the sequential effects of BRAF and MEK inhibition on skin, blood and
      tumour biomarkers and to study the correlation between biomarkers and response to treatment
      and intrapatient toxicity. Approximately 54 eligible subjects will be randomised in the ratio
      of 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment arms.
