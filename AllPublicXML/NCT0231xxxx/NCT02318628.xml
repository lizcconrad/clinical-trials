      The aim of the 3A Study is to assess the role of MetS on the arterial mechanics and vascular
      health in different age groups using the Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) of the Vasera
      system and the &quot;classic&quot; carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV).

      Hypothesis The aim of thie 3A study is to assess the role of MetS on the arterial mechanics
      and vascular health in different age groups using the Cardio Ankle Vascular Index (CAVI) of
      the Vasera system and the &quot;classic&quot; carotid-femoral Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV).

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

        1. Objectives Primary Objective: Assess the influence of MetS on CAVI values (primary study
           endpoint) in 3 different age groups (40-54, 55-69, 70-85 years) of a European
           population.

        2. Secondary Objectives

             -  Establish the CAVI values in a European population according to the clusters of
                (MetS) components i.e. cardiovascular risk factors: abdominal obesity, high
                triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, elevated blood pressure (BP), systolic or
                diastolic, and elevated fasting glucose (and diabetes), as well as tobacco smoking.

             -  Assess the correlation between CAVI and the carotid-femoral PWV in the full
                population and in each age group; and compare the impact of MetS and its components
                on both the CAVI and PWV

             -  To establish, the relationship between cardiovascular risk factors and the
                evolution of arterial stiffness as evaluated by CAVI and carotid-femoral PWV over a
                2-year follow-up period.

             -  To assess changes and predictive value of CAVI on organ damages and CV events
                during the follow-up period.

             -  To assess 24h ABPM and its correlations and variations with the CAVI and PWV in
                patients with MetS and/or its different components.

      This is a multinational European prospective longitudinal study.

    <measure>Cardio-Ankle-Vascular Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>CAVI will be measured using the Vasera device (Fukuda Denshi co, Japan). This device is easy to use and calculates automatically the CAVI.
CAVI measurements will be performed according to the manufacturer recommendations Measurements will be performed after five to ten minute - period of rest in order to obtain a steady hemodynamic state and to limit measurements variability.
The details of the CAVI measurements are shown in a specific document, C.F. appendix
Ankle Brachial Index (ABI):
The Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) will be measured using the Vasera device (Fukuda Denshi co, Japan). This device will calculate the ABI automatically.
ABI measurements will be performed according to the manufacturer recommendations Measurements will be performed after five to ten minute - period of rest in order to obtain a steady hemodynamic state and to limit measurements variability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pulse Wave Velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of PWV will be performed using a validated automatic device (Complior®, Sphygmocor®, and PulsePen®). The method of &quot;simultaneous&quot; recordings of the pulse waves from 2 different sites (carotid and femoral arteries) will be preferred. Because of the use of several devices, normalisation of the measurement values will be performed according to the European Experts recommendations.</description>

    <description>Blood pressure will be measured in clinic according to the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) guidelines. BP should be measured in a standardized fashion using equipment that meets certification criteria.</description>
