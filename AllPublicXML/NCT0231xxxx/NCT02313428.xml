  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to observe the effect of application of topically administered oxygen on
      healing rate, cost of care and rate of amputations in diabetic patients with chronic
      wounds(s) . The proposed study is a pragmatic (comparative effectiveness research, CER)
      study, in which the effectiveness of topical oxygen (100%) administered 4 days per week, for
      16 weeks, for the treatment of diabetic wound(s) will be measure and compared with standard
      of care (SoC) treatment. There will be a 2 patient groups (including a comparison group and a
      treatment group) including: (1) Patients will only receive standard treatment (2) Patients
      will receive standard treatment plus Topical Oxygen Therapy (TOT). All of the Topical Oxygen
      Therapy will be provided in a home care setting or extended care facility. 140 patients will
      be recruited.

      There are two arms of the study. Arm 1 will enroll 100 subjects to assist the Ohio Department
      of Medicaid (ODM) and to provide efficient and effective administration of the Medicaid
      program. This is an observational and descriptive study that will seek to generate a
      hypothesis. Due to the small sample size this study will primarily be a feasibility study
      that will attempt to measure and evaluate differences in the relative costs of the
      intervention of topical oxygen therapy on this population and subsequently compare outcomes
      in areas such as overall health improvements and cost effectiveness. The patient population
      will consist of Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic wounds and below who are enrolled in the
      United Health Care Community Plan of Ohio (UHC).

      Arm 2 of the study will enroll 40 additional patients that are Medicare and Dual
      Medicare/Medicaid recipients with chronic wounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a total of 5 study visits including the initial baseline visit were they will be
      randomized into one of the 2 groups (comparison or treatment). At the baseline visit the
      following will be collected; history of the patient, physical examination of the patient
      including:, digital imaging of the DFU that is input into WoundMatrixâ„¢ software, and the
      patient will be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire. They will also be provided
      with teaching regarding diabetes, footwear, and wound care. Patients will return for study
      visits 2-5 on weeks 4, 8, 12, 16. At study visit 2-5 the research staff will collect digital
      imaging of the ulcer and at study visit 5 the patient will be asked to complete the quality
      of life questionnaire. These visits will be correlated with their regular scheduled visit at
      the CWC. If their wound heals before the end of the study, they will be asked to return for
      study visit 5 (week 16). The patient will complete the at home treatments, including the 90
      minute treatment, 4 consecutive days a week, 3 day of no treatment). The patient will have
      the study personnel come to their home to provide supplies, teach, and give support for the
      TO device. The study personnel will also go to the patient's home weekly to give support for
      the treatments.

      Participation in this study is expected to add no additional risk to the patient. The only
      risk expected to occur with any frequency is irritation of the skin while applying the TOT
      bag. This issue is anticipated in the protocol, which specifies appropriate treatment
      modifications and discontinuation of Topical Oxygen, if the problem does not improve. This
      problem, if it occurs, is expected to be self-limited and of minor significance. Oxygen
      although not combustible itself, supports combustion of other flammable materials. The use of
      oxygen in this protocol is essentially equivalent to that supplied by nasal cannula to
      patients in hospital or at home. To minimize the risk of fire the investigators will strictly
      enforce a no smoking and no open flame policy in any room in which Topical Oxygen is
      utilized. Treatment facilities will comply with local fire ordinances and study personnel
      will be familiar with fire safety protocols of each facility.

      The potential benefits however are dramatic. The disease state is highly morbid and typically
      involves prolonged medical care and multiple surgical procedures. Despite intensive
      therapeutic intervention the state of the art still results in high morbidity and mortality
      at a high financial cost. The application of topical oxygen to diabetic wounds has the
      potential to dramatically impact the effectiveness of wound healing and to therefore improve
      limb salvage, decrease infection rates and mortality, and generally improve the quality of
      life of study participants receiving topical oxygen as well as the general population if
      efficacy is proved. Patients enrolled in the comparison groups will benefit by close
      follow-up and treatment using accepted comprehensive wound cares protocol.
