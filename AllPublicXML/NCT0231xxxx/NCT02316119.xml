    <textblock>
      Background: About 5% of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have had previously
      ischemic stroke (IS) or transitory ischemic attack (TIA). This is a high-risk population,
      with a high incidence of ischemic events, and also of bleeding events. While the high
      ischemic risk in this population is attributed to a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk
      factors, their predisposition to bleeding events is not well understood. Hypothesis: The
      increased bleeding risk in ACS patients with history of cerebrovascular event may be
      justified by a low platelet activity. Methods: Unicentric, prospective, case-control study,
      which included approximately 100 post-ACS patients with history of IS/TIA previously to the
      acute coronary event (Case Group) and 100 patients without IS/TIA (Control group). The groups
      were matched for gender, age, and ACS type and year of occurrence. All patients were taking
      aspirin, and the main exclusion criteria were use of dual antiplatelet therapy, previous
      hemorrhagic stroke, severe renal dysfunction, thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy. Main
      analysis: Platelet aggregation was evaluated by 6 methods: VerifyNow Aspirin®, VerifyNow
      P2Y12®, PFA 100®, thrombelastography (ReoRox®), light transmission aggregometry with ADP (LTA
      ADP) and epinephrine (LTA EPI) as agonists. Additional analysis: genetic, HDL transport and
      inflammatory evaliation
