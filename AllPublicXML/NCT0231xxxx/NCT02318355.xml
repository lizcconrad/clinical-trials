  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial in volunteer blood donors to quantify the effect of
      blood loss and subsequent crystalloid infusion on hemoglobin and markers of resuscitation
      such as base deficit and lactate.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood donors were randomized to one of three arms after donation of 500cc of blood. The
      control group received no intravenous fluids, while donors in the two intervention arms
      wither received two liters normal saline or lactated ringers. Chemistries and blood gases
      were obtained before donation, after donation and after resuscitation. Donors hemoglobin
      levels were then compared over time and between study arms. Additionally, lactate and base
      deficit, which are markers of shock, will be collected at the time points as well to measure
      their response to resuscitation. Standard statistical tests were used to compare the
      laboratory values between groups.

    <description>obtain hemoglobin immediately before and after donation, and after resuscitation with intravenous fluids. From donation to end of resuscitation, the time frame will be 2 hours or less. Donors will not be followed after the third blood draw and will be discharged from the study. No follow-up was obtained.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lactate (mmol/L)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Obtain lactate immediately before and after donation, and after resuscitation with intravenous fluids. Lactate is a measure of aneorbic metabolism and increases with worsening shock and hypoperfusion as seen in hemorrhage. From donation to end of resuscitation, the time frame will be 2 hours or less. Donors will not be followed after the third blood draw and will be discharged from the study. No follow-up was obtained.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Base deficit (mmol/L)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Obtain base deficit immediately before and after donation, and after resuscitation with intravenous fluids. Base deficit is a measure of unmeasured acid in the blood, indicating acidosis and shock, and increases in worsening hypoperfusion. From donation to end of resuscitation, the time frame will be 2 hours or less. Donors will not be followed after the third blood draw and will be discharged from the study. No follow-up was obtained.</description>
