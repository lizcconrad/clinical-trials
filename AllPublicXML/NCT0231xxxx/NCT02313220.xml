  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a medical condition which increases the risk of other diseases, such as type 2
      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Obesity-related risk factors for the development of
      other metabolic diseases include unstable glucose levels and high blood pressure.
      Dapagliflozin and exenatide are both approved worldwide for treatment of patients with Type 2
      Diabetes. Dapagliflozin works by lowering glucose levels by inhibiting the renal reabsorption
      of glucose and thereby promoting its urinary excretion and energy loss and thereby reduction
      in body fat. Exenatide exhibits many of the same glucose-lowering actions of that of a
      naturally occurring hormone and leads to weight loss mainly via reduced energy intake, most
      likely via a central effect on appetite regulation. The purpose of this exploratory study is
      to investigate if a combination treatment with dapagliflozin and exenatide have a synergistic
      effect on weight loss in non-diabetic obese subjects. Subjects will be treated for 24 weeks
      with either active combination treatment or placebo (non-active treatment). Neither study
      personnel nor subjects will know what treatment is given. All subjects completing the 24-week
      double-blind study and who are willing and eligible will be offered to enter a 28-week
      open-label extension study. All subjects entering the extension study will receive unblinded
      active study treatment for an additional 28 weeks. Thus the total treatment period for
      subjects entering the extension study will be 52 weeks.

          3. Participation in another clinical study with an Investigational Product during the
             last 3 months prior to Visit 1.

          4. History of any clinically significant disease, disorder or condition which, in the
             opinion of the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of
             participation in the study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to
             participate in the study.

             Subjects with a fasting P-glucose of ≥7.0 mmol/L at Visit 1 or ≥11.1 mmol/L at 120 min
             of the OGTT at Visit 1 may be offered an extra visit before Visit 2 for a second
             fasting P-glucose measurement. If P-glucose is still ≥7.0 mmol/L at the second
             measurement, the subject will be excluded.

          8. Volume depleted patients. Patients at risk for volume depletion due to co-existing
             conditions or concomitant medications, such as loop diuretics should have careful
             monitoring of their volume status.

          9. Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) within 2 months prior to Visit 1. Hospitalization for
             unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction within 2 months prior to enrolment.

             or squamous cell skin cancer.

         12. Body weight loss greater than 5% within 3 months prior to Visit 1.

         13. Treatment with any drug known to affect body weight within the last month, e.g.
             systemic glucocorticoids, antipsychotics or orlistat.

         14. Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2.

         15. Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma.
