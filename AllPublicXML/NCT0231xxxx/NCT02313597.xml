  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal fistula is the most common Peri anal disease. It's a disease with an incidence of 9 in
      100,000. Anal fistula is classified on the basis of its location into high and low anal
      fistula, above or below dentate line respectively.

      Multiple series have shown that the formation of a fistula tract following anorectal abscess
      occurs in 7-40% of cases. There are typically 8-10 anal crypt glands at the level of the
      dentate line in the anal canal arranged circumstantially. These glands afford a path for
      infecting organisms to reach the intramuscular spaces. The cryptoglandular hypothesis states
      that an infection begins in the anal canal glands and progresses into the muscular wall of
      the anal sphincters to cause an anorectal abscess.

      According to internal opening many author proposed certain classification but the
      standardized in all of them is Park's classification, so this study categorized the patient
      through this classification. There are four types of fistula-in-ano in Park's Classification
      intersphincteric (between internal and external sphincters is 70%), transsphincteric (across
      external sphincters is 25%), suprasphincteric (over sphincters), and extrasphincteric(above
      and through levator ani).High anal fistula is considered to be difficult to treat because of
      its location.This study diagnosed the internal opening of high perianal with the help of
      endoluminal ultrasound and MRI.

      Classic method of its treatment are fistulotomy, fistulectomy and Setone placement but these
      are associated with lots of complication like fecal incontinence,recurrence,pain.Therefore
      many method have been recently devised including Ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract
      (Lift), glue repair and flap advancement.Another recently introduced method for its treatment
      is Video-assisted anal fistula treatment (VAAFT) proposed by P. Meinero which has been
      associated with less complications.
