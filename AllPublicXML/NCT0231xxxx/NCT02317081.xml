      Prospective, multicenter, open-label and single arm study, conducted in 3 interventional
      cardiology centers in The Netherlands. The objective is to assess the feasibility and safety
      of the Axetis Inert Stent for treatment of patients with de novo coronary artery stenosis in
      native vessels. In total, 35 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be treated with
      Axetis Inert Coronary Stent System. All patients will undergo repeat angiography at 6 months
      follow-up. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) assessment will be performed at baseline
      (pre- and post-procedure) and at 6 months follow-up. All patients will undergo Optical
      coherence Tomography (OCT) investigation at baseline (post procedure) and at 6 months
      follow-up. The primary endpoint is in-stent Late Lumen Loss (LLL) at 6 months after stent
      implantation as assessed by off-line QCA. Clinical follow-up will occur at 6 and 12 months
      post-stent implantation.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 85 years

          -  Evidence of myocardial ischemia without elevatedTroponin / cardiac biomarkers (e.g.

        stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia demonstrated by positive territorial functional
        study). NSTEMI patients are allowed, as long as Troponin is within the normal limits before
        the start of the procedure.

          -  The patient has a planned intervention of up to two de-novo lesions in two different
             vessels (previously untreated vessels)

          -  Lesion must have a visually estimated diameter stenosis of ≥50% and &lt;100%.

          -  Lesion length must be ≤ 28 mm

          -  RVD must be between 2.4 and 3.8 mm

          -  The patient and the patient's physician agree to the follow-up visits including
             angiographic follow-up and OCT control at 6 months

             mg/dL, or subject on dialysis)

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy

          -  The patient is a recipient of a heart transplant

             ticlopidine) or stainless steel

          -  Other medical illness (e.g. cancer, stroke with neurological deficiency) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) as per physician judgment

             is associated with a limited life expectancy

             contraceptives

          -  Severe tortuous, calcified or angulated coronary anatomy of the study vessel that in
             the opinion of the investigator would result in suboptimal imaging or excessive risk
             of complication from placement of an OCT catheter

          -  Target lesion in left main stem.

          -  Target lesion involves a side branch &gt; 2.0mm in diameter

          -  Aorto-ostial target lesion (within 3 mm of the aorta junction).

          -  Total occlusion or TIMI flow 1, prior to wire crossing

          -  The target vessel contains visible thrombus

          -  Restenotic lesion

          -  Target vessel with previously placed stent or with graft

          -  Located within an arterial or saphenous vein graft
