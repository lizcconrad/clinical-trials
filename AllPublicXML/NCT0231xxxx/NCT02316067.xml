  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an exercise program proposed by the
      CHORDATA® Method on the functionality, maximal isometric torque, muscle activity and muscle
      thickness of trunk muscles in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury.

      The hypothesis is that the CHORDATA® Method could reduce the deleterious effects of the
      traumatic spinal cord injury.

      Participants were allocated into one of two groups (rehabilitation or control).
      Rehabilitation group (8 weeks of rehabilitation; CHORDATA® Method) Control group (patients
      with up to three years of traumatic spinal cord injury): Participants maintained their
      daily-life activities routine during the same eight weeks period and were tested before and
      after this control period. At the end of the control period, patients interested at
      participating on the training program were included in the intervention group

    <description>The CHORDATA® Method (16 sessions; 50 minutes each; twice a week) consisted of three exercises: (1) anterior pendulum, with the patient seated on a chair, upper limb suspended by springs and straps, and actively moving the trunk forward; (2) posterior pendulum exercise, on a similar position as exercise (1) but now moving the trunk backwards and recruiting the abdominal wall muscles during a posterior pelvic tilt motion; and (3) stand-up and sit-down exercise, patient with knees fixed anteriorly, initiating the standing-up movement by pulling back and down the springs, trying to maintain the standing position for as long as possible, balancing the trunk and transferring the supporting force from the upper limbs to the lower limbs.</description>
