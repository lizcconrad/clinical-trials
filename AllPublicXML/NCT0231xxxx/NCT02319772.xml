  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, first-in-human dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of BCX4430 administered via intramuscular (IM) injection
      in healthy subjects. In part 1, subjects will receive a single dose of BCX4430; in part 2
      subjects will receive BCX4430 for 7 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single,
      ascending doses of BCX4430 versus placebo in healthy subjects. Up to 6 ascending dose cohorts
      will be enrolled in a sequential manner. Eight subjects will be treated with a single dose of
      study drug per dose cohort: 6 subjects per cohort will receive BCX4430, and 2 subjects per
      cohort will receive matching placebo.

      Part 2 of the study will be initiated following review of all available data from Part 1 by
      an independent Safety Monitoring Committee

      Part 2 of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 7 days of
      daily dosing with BCX4430 versus placebo in healthy subjects. Up to 4 ascending dose cohorts
      will be treated in a sequential manner. Ten subjects will be treated with study drug per dose
      cohort (8 subjects will receive BCX4430 and 2 subjects will receive placebo per cohort). The
      planned doses and dosing regimens for each of the Part 2 cohorts will be determined based
      upon data collected during Part 1.
