      Background:

      - Researchers want to learn about people s beliefs and values. They also want to learn about
      how people respond to information about cancer risk. They have created two short studies.
      They have combined these studies for convenience.

      Objective:

      - To learn about people s beliefs and values, and about how people respond to information
      about cancer risk.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults age 40-70 who are overweight, have never had cancer, and have an opposite-sex close
      relationship with someone in that age group who is also overweight.

      Design:

        -  This study will take place online or in a laboratory.

        -  Participants will take part in two studies. One is Values Study. The other is Cancer
           Risk Information.

        -  In Values Study, some participants will choose the most important value from a list.
           They will write about why that value is important to them. Others will choose the least
           important value from a list. They will write about why that value may be important to
           someone else.

        -  In Cancer Risk Information, participants will read a health message about a cancer risk
           relevant to themselves or to a close other. Some will wear special glasses that track
           their eye movements as they read.

        -  Participants will then answer questions about their beliefs about cancer risk and their
           intentions to lose weight.

        -  Both studies will take 30 minutes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-affirmation, a process by which individuals reflect on cherished personal values is a
      potent means of augmenting the effectiveness of threatening health communications.
      Individuals tend to be defensive against information suggesting their behavior puts them at
      risk for disease or negative health. Previous evidence suggests that self-affirmation may
      reduce defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message
      and resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, intentions to
      engage in preventive behavior, and actual behavioral change. One mechanism by which
      self-affirmation may be effective is by reducing self-focus and expanding self-concept. If
      this is the case, self-affirmation may not be effective in reducing defensiveness against
      information that is threatening to one s close other. We are proposing two studies to examine
      whether self-affirmation is equally effective at reducing defensiveness against threatening
      information for the self and for a close other. These studies will not only highlight
      conditions under which self-affirmation is effective, but also shed light on mechanisms
      underlying the effect.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA

        For Study 1

        -Knowledge Networks panel members will be eligible if they are aged 40-70, overweight, and

        have never been diagnosed with cancer (to ensure relevance to breast and prostate cancer
        risk, the topic of

        the health message). Individuals will also be screened for inclusion based on whether they
        report having

        an opposite-sex close relationship with another adult age 40-70 who is also overweight
        (e.g., opposite-sex

        spouse, close friend, or family member).

        For Study 2

        -Community individuals will be subject to the same inclusion criteria.
