  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the feasibility of a preoperative, single dose,
      ablative partial breast radiation treatment in patients with early-stage breast cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of twenty-five patients will be treated with a single dose preoperative ablative
      radiation treatment. After a vigilant follow-up with MRI, breast conserving surgery will be
      performed 6 months after the ablative radiation treatment. The total follow-up time is 10
      years.

      This study aims to present an ablative radiotherapy treatment approach that could resolve to
      some extent the disadvantages of current breast conserving treatment in elderly low-risk
      breast cancer patients who are currently not treated according to guidelines due to
      co-morbidity.
