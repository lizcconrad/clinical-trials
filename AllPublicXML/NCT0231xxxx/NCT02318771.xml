  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies radiation therapy and MK-3475 in treating patients
      with head and neck cancer, kidney cancer, melanoma, or lung cancer that has returned, has
      spread to other parts of the body, or cannot be removed by surgery. Radiation therapy uses
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Monoclonal antibodies, such as MK-3475, may block
      tumor growth by targeting certain cells and causing the immune system to attack the tumor.
      Studying the effects of MK-3475 with radiation therapy on the body may help doctors learn
      whether it may be an effective treatment for these solid tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the immunomodulatory activity of radiation therapy (RT) or RT in
      combination with anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD)-1 antibody (MK-3475) in patients with
      recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, renal cell cancer, melanoma and lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is associated with
      treatment response to the combination of RT and PD-1 blockade in renal cell cancer (RCC),
      head and neck cancer (HNC), lung cancer and melanoma.

      II. To explore whether circulating tumor cells can be used to determine PD-L1 expression.

      III. To explore other immune-related biomarker changes after RT: soluble PD-L1, cytokines
      etc.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

      ARM A1: Patients undergo radiation therapy on day 1 per standard of care and then undergo
      biopsy 3-10 days later. Beginning 0-7 days after biopsy, patients receive MK-3475
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses of MK-3475 repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM A2: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days 1-5 and then undergo biopsy 3-10 days
      later. Beginning 0-7 days after biopsy, patients receive MK-3475 as in Arm A1.

      ARM B1: Patients receive one dose of MK-3475 IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and then undergo 1
      fraction of RT. Patients then receive MK-3475 IV over 30 minutes in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B2: Patients receive MK-3475 as in Arm B1 and undergo 5 fractions of RT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 30 days and
      then every 8 weeks.

    <description>Within each cohort, the significance of change in PD-L1 will be assessed using an exact one-sided sign test. The null hypothesis is that the average change (post-pre) is less than or equal to 0 while the alternative hypothesis is that the average change is greater than 0. The proportion of patients with improvement will be estimated along with an exact 95% confidence interval. As an exploratory analysis, the proportion will also be estimated separately within each cohort for the head and neck cancer patients.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 2 weeks of the radiation therapy.

          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the radiation therapy.

          3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to radiation therapy or who
             has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to radiation therapy or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or
             at baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Prior radiation therapy does not necessary excludes patients. The index
                  lesion may be acceptable for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and this will be
                  determined by radiation oncologist.

               -  Note: If there are more than one symptomatic lesions, patients will be excluded
                  if the lesions can't be encompassed within one radiation portal.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting
                  therapy.

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin, superficial bladder cancer or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone
             potentially curative therapy.

          6. Has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks
             prior to the radiation therapy and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline),
             have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for
             at least 7 days prior to radiation treatment.

          7. Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that

             resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Subjects that
             require intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or
             Sjorgen's syndrome will not be excluded from the study.

          8. Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis.

          9. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.

         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         13. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation
             or checkpoint pathways).

         14. Has a known Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection (HIV 1/2 antibodies) or Acquired
             Immunodeficiency Syndrome((HIV/AIDS).

         15. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         16. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the radiation therapy.
