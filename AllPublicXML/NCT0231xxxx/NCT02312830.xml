      With the increasing successful use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
      (HSCT) to cure advanced hematological disease, it becomes essential to evaluate the long-term
      effects of such a drastic treatment.

      This study investigates the prevalence of several demographic, psychosocial and behavioral
      aspects of survivorship after an allogeneic transplantation. Income, return to work, social
      isolation, pain, medication adherence, influenza vaccination status, alcohol use, smoking
      habits, drug use, healthy diet, prevention of UV exposure, physical activity, functional
      status/Quality of life (QoL), couple life/sexual function, depression, anxiety, spirituality
      and resilience will be studied.

      This is a cross sectional study, where participants are interviewed and fill in a self
      reported survey. The interview and survey are only taken once. It is non interventional
      because the patients only give us extra information, which is not usually recorded in our
      medical records.
