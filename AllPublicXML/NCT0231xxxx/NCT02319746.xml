      General objective:

      To assess the effectiveness of a treatment program specific for cannabis abuse (cognitive
      behavioral treatment + pharmacological treatment) compared to standard treatment
      (pharmacological treatment + psychoeducation) in patients with first episodes psychosis (FEP)
      cannabis users.

      Design A multicenter single-blind randomized study with 1 year of follow-up. The
      effectiveness of a treatment program specific for cannabis abuse (cognitive behavioral
      treatment + pharmacological treatment) compared to standard treatment (pharmacological
      treatment + psychoeducation) in patients with first episodes psychosis (FEP) cannabis users
      will be assessed.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatments:

        1. Experimental group (N=50): Cognitive-behavioral treatment specific for cannabis abuse +
           pharmacological treatment

        2. Control group (N=50): standard treatment: psychoeducation + pharmacological treatment
