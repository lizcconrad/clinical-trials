  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of hyperpolarized (HP) 129Xe (xenon) gas
      MRI for regional assessment of lung function in a normal population of adults for the
      purposes of obtaining optimal images through MRI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hyperpolarized 129Xe will be produced, by trained staff, using a polarizer housed at
      Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Individual imaging sessions will be done on a
      single day and will involve administration of (maximum) 1 liter doses for up to four MRI
      scans. Subject will inhale hyperpolarized xenon gas and hold breath for up to 16 seconds
      during the MRI scans. In addition to 129 Xe MRI, a series of anatomical conventional proton
      MR images may also be collected. Follow up will be done one day and 30 days from the MRI
      date.
