    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be safely
      delivered to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA).
      Funding Source - FDA OOPD.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intrathecal injection of
      autologous MSCs in a dose escalation study in patients with MSA. Safety secondary goals
      include to monitor changes in peripheral blood and in components of CSF, and monitor for any
      changes of nervous system structures using MRI. Efficacy secondary goals include evaluating
      potential efficacy by providing a number of studies and instruments that will detect changes
      in the course of the disease in terms of autonomic and neurologic symptoms and deficits.

    <description>There will be three treatment groups of up to 8 patients each. Groups 1 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 2 and 3 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by one month. Intrathecal injections into new subjects will be timed so that there is a minimum of one week between subject injections. The cell dose per group is as follows:
Group 1: single intrathecal dose of 1 x 107 cells.
Group 2: one intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells followed one month (+/- 4 days) later by a second intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells.
Group 3: one intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells followed one month (+/- 4 days) later by a second intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Participants aged 30-80 years old with a diagnosis of MSA based on clinical criteria
             and standardized autonomic testing. This approach allows for identification of
             patients with MSA with very high specificity and is yet sensitive enough to allow for
             enrollment of patients at a disease stage at which an intervention on the natural
             disease course has a meaningful impact on patient outcome. Patients therefore have to
             fulfill Gilman Criteria (2000) for probable MSA of the parkinsonian subtype (MSA-P) or
             cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) and have findings on autonomic function testing suggestive
             of MSA (CASS ≥5 or a TST% ≥25%).

          2. Participants who are less than 4 years from the time of documented MSA diagnosis.

          3. Participants with an anticipated survival of at least 3 years in the opinion of the
             investigator.

          4. Participants who are willing and able to give informed consent.

          5. &quot;Normal&quot; cognition as assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). We will
             require a value &gt;24.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Any of the following conditions will exclude the participant from entering the study:

          1. Women of childbearing potential who do not practice an acceptable method of birth
             control. Acceptable methods of birth control in this study are: surgical
             sterilization, intrauterine devices, partner's vasectomy, a double-protection method
             (condom or diaphragm with spermicide), hormonal contraceptive drug (i.e., oral
             contraceptive, contraceptive patch, long-acting injectable contraceptive) with a
             required second mode of contraception.

          2. Participants with a clinically significant or unstable medical or surgical condition
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, might preclude safe completion of the study
             or might affect the results of the study. These include conditions causing significant
             central nervous system (CNS) or autonomic dysfunction, including congestive heart
             failure, recent (&lt;6 months) myocardial infarct, cardiopulmonary disease, severe,
             uncontrolled hypertension, thrombocytopenia (&lt;50 x 10(9)/L), severe anemia (&lt;8g/dl),
             immunocompromised state, liver or kidney disease (creatinine &gt;2.3mg/dl), uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus (HbA1c &gt;10g%), alcoholism, amyloidosis, uncontrolled hypothyroidism,
             sympathectomy, unstable peripheral neuropathies, concurrent infections, orthopedic
             problems that compromise mobility and activity of daily living, cerebrovascular
             accidents, neurotoxin or neuroactive drug exposure, parkinsonism due to drugs
             (including neuroleptics, alpha-methyldopa, reserpine, metoclopramide).

          3. Participants with malignant neoplasms.

          4. Participants who have taken any investigational products within 60 days prior to
             baseline.

          5. Medications that could affect autonomic function. If patients are taking those
             medications, those will be suspended prior to autonomic testing. Therapy with
             midodrine, anticholinergic, alpha and beta adrenergic antagonists or other medications
             that affect autonomic function will be withdrawn 48 hours prior to autonomic
             evaluations. Fludrocortisone doses up to 0.2 mg per day will be permitted.

          6. Diseases with features of Parkinsons Disease; e.g., diffuse Lewy body disease,
             progressive supranuclear palsy, essential tremor, hereditary olivopontocerebellar
             atrophy, or postencephalitic parkinsonism.

          7. Dementia (DSM-IV criteria - American Psychiatric Association 1994). The score on the
             Mini-Mental State Examination must be &gt;24.

          8. History of electroconvulsive therapy.

          9. History of brain surgery for Parkinsons disease.

         10. Patients with contraindication for MRI scanning, including those with MRI-incompatible
             pacemakers

         11. Patients with active systemic infection or local infection, which is close to the
             spinal injection site
