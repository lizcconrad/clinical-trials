      The aim of the study is to assess if implantation of a bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS)
      for intermediate coronary lesions with morphological signs of vulnerable plaque in patients
      prone for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) will stabilize the plaque, improve natural
      vasomotion and increase vascular diameter.

          -  Intermediate coronary lesion on CT scan (50-70% based on CT estimate) and a plaque
             with at least two of the following vulnerability criteria: Napkin ring sign, positive
             remodeling, low attenuation and spotty calcification

          -  FFR negative lesion at coronary angiogram

          -  lesions involving an epicardial side branch ≥2 mm in diameter by visual assessment

          -  the presence of thrombus or another clinically significant stenosis in the target
             vessel.

          -  Left main (&gt;50%) or known three vessel disease.

          -  Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, unstable arrhythmias, or
             patients who have a left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;30%

          -  Intolerance to Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor, Heparine or Everolimus and
             known true anaphylaxis to prior contrast media or known bleeding diathesis or known
             coagulopathy.

          -  Planned elective surgical procedure necessitating interruption of dual antiplatelet
             therapy during the first 6 months after inclusion.

          -  History of stent thrombosis

          -  Malignancies or other comorbidity with a life expectancy of less than one year or that
             may result in protocol noncompliance

          -  Pregnancy (present, suspected or planned) or positive pregnancy test (in women with
             childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test is mandatory)
