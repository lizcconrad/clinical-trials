    <textblock>
      Diabetic painful neuropathy a prevalent, disabling disorder. Currently, the only effective
      treatments are glucose control and pain management. Diabetic neuropathy is characterized by
      reduction of vascularity in peripheral nerves and deficiency in neurotrophic and angiogenic
      factors. Recent studies have shown that bone marrow (BM)-derived stem or progenitor cells
      have favorable effects on the repair of cardiovascular diseases. Since these BM-derived stem
      or progenitor cells contain various angiogenic and neurotrophic factors, these cells have
      been attempted for treating experimental diabetic neuropathy, and turned out to be effective
      for reversing various manifestations of experimental diabetic neuropathy.

      However, stem-cell therapy was not proven in human study. Therefore, we will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of autologous peripheral blood stem cell injection in diabetic
      neuropathy.

    <description>The pain scale was calculate by Numeric rating scale (NRS). We observe a change in NRS pain scores during the follow-up period.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The evaluation of changes in the specific neuro-sensory system</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 week, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The following tests was evaluated during the follow-up period. The pain intensity was evaluated by short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire and by sleep disturbance pain score. The quantitative change of sensory nerve was evaluated by quantitative sensory test (QST). We measure serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE), glucose, insulin and c-peptide. The amount of drug requirements will also assess at each follow-up period.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>The secondary effect of the procedure for the peripheral nerves and blood vessels</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Michigan neuropathy screening instrument (MNSI) is used for screening for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Changes in patient's mood is assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) system. Electrophysiological tests are used in the evaluation of nerve conduct velocity. Skin punch biopsy is used to evaluate the density of epidermal nerve fibers. Improvement of blood flow in the peripheral veins is evaluated by ankle brachial index (ABI), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and digital arterial plethysmography. We measure serum glucose, insulin ant c-peptide. The amount of drug requirements will also assess at each follow-up period.</description>
