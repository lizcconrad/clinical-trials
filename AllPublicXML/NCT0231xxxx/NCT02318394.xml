      This is a first-time-in-human (FTiH) Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and
      dose-expansion study of MEDI0562 to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      immunogenicity, pharmacodynamics and preliminary anti-tumor activity in adult subjects with
      selected advanced solid tumors.

    <time_frame>Estimated to be from time of informed consent up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The DCR is defined as the proportion of subjects with irCR, irPR, or irSD (subjects achieving irSD will be included in the DCR if they maintain irSD for â‰¥8 weeks)</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have confirmed advanced solid tumor and have progressed, are refractory,
             or are intolerant to standard therapy appropriate for tumor type. Subjects should not
             have received more than 3 prior lines of therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease
             including both standards of care and investigational therapies.

          -  Subjects must have at least 1 measurable lesion.

          -  Consent to provide archived tumor specimens

          -  Willingness to undergo pre-treatment and on-treatment biopsy.

          -  Adequate organ function.

          -  Use of highly effective contraception (females) or male condom plus spermicide
             (males).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with TNFRSF agonists.

          -  Subjects who have received certain prior immunotherapy or had toxicities relating to
             prior immunotherapy may not be permitted to enroll.

             o Must not have required the use of additional immunosuppression other than
             corticosteroids for the management of an adverse event.

          -  History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the
             study drug formulations.

          -  Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy within 28 days prior
             to the first dose of MEDI0562.

          -  Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or biologic or hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment.

          -  Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy.

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would interfere
             with evaluation of the investigational product.
