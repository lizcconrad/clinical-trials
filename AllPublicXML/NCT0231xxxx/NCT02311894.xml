    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study of somatropin (rDNA origin)
      (Nutropin AQ v1.1) in pre-pubertal children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) na誰ve to
      prior recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment. The study is designed to
      characterize the immunogenicity profile of somatropin (rDNA origin) injection when
      administered daily subcutaneously for 12 months. The clinical impact of immunogenicity will
      also be assessed.
