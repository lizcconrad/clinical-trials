  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic accuracy of PET/magnetic resonance and PET/CT will be compared concerning primary
      tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM) staging and therapeutic influence. Workflow scenarios
      will be evaluated to create imaging protocols which are time efficient and diagnostically
      accurate.
