  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBCST) is a commonly utilized, evidence-based
      psychosocial therapy (talk therapy) for alcohol dependence. By identifying the neural
      mechanisms through which CBCST changes drinking behavior, it may be possible to improve its
      efficacy. CBCST promotes abstinence by teaching &quot;coping skills&quot; for managing alcohol-related
      thoughts and emotions. In this pilot study, the investigators examine the neural systems that
      play a role in the learning of coping skills through CBCST, specifically focusing on the role
      of emotion regulation systems.

      The study combines 1) a 12-week clinical trial of CBCST in currently drinking alcohol
      dependent patients (target N=25) who are seeking treatment to reduce their drinking with 2)
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related
      to the utilization of copings skills taught in CBCST. The fMRI studies will be performed both
      before and after treatment with CBCST, with the goal of determining 1) the pattern of neural
      activity that is related to coping skills utilization prior to undergoing CBCST, with
      particular focus on neural systems known to play a role in emotion regulation; 2) how CBCST
      changes this pattern of neural activity; and 3) how these changes in neural activity predict
      changes in alcohol use during CBCST.

          -  Seeking treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder

          -  Agree to not seek additional treatment, apart from Alcoholics Anonymous

          -  English-speaking and able to provide informed consent and comply with study procedures
