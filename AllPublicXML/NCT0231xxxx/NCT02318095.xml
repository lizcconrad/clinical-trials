      This research protocol will evaluate the feasibility of administering neoadjuvant gemcitabine
      and nab-paclitaxel with hypofractionated, image guided, intensity modulated radiotherapy
      (HIGRT) in resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States
      and accounts for roughly 40,000 deaths each year. Despite the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      therapies, little progress has been made in the the last three decades, and the search for
      more efficacious treatment continues.In patients with a good performance status the
      combination of effective systemic therapy with gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and high dose local
      radiotherapy may improve disease outcomes. This is a prospective, single arm study in
      patients in newly diagnosed, previously untreated pancreatic cancer who are planned to
      undergo surgical resection The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the toxicity of
      a neoadjuvant approach incorporating gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel and Hypofractionated image
      guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (HIGRT) prior to surgical resection. Eligible
      subjects will recieve standard neoadjuvant gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel dosing is as
      follows:Nab-Paclitaxel (125mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles Gemcitabine
      (1000mg/m2) days 1,8,15 every 28 days for 2 cycles followed by HIGRT and surgical resection.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy may be given post surgery at the discretion of the treating medical
      oncologist.

    <description>CTCAE version 4 will be used for all toxicity assessments. The acute toxicity rate, defined as any non-hematologic grade 2+ toxicity occurring during treatment through 60 days post-treatment, will be estimated with its exact 80% confidence interval. Likewise, we will determine the rate of grade 2+ hematologic toxicity occurring during treatment through 60 days post treatment and the proportion of patients requiring treatment breaks longer than 5 days.</description>
