  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this program of research is to refine and test a newly developed
      storytelling video intervention (sTVi) for depressed primary care patients.

      The purpose of the proposed project is to establish the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary effects of the intervention for an eventual large-scale randomized clinical trial
      which would test the efficacy of sTVi in comparison to a control condition.

      To achieve the specific aims, the investigators will conduct a pilot randomized clinical
      trial (n = 40), with two treatment arms: antidepressant treatment as usual (aTAU) + sTVI vs
      aTAU + attention control videos.

    <textblock>
      The public health impact of existing treatments for major depression is limited by our
      ability to disseminate those treatments. There is a particular need to find innovative ways
      to disseminate key principles of empirically supported psychotherapy in primary care
      settings. Narrative communication is an alternative way to disseminate psychotherapy behavior
      change principles. Narrative communication refers to &quot;storytelling&quot; -real people talking
      about their struggles and successful ways of coping. An advantage of narrative communication
      is that it can be easily distributed (by video) and may reach people who do not have access
      to other technologies or who experience barriers to traditional psychotherapy. We propose
      that key principles of a type of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Acceptance and Commitment
      Therapy, or ACT) can be readily disseminated through a video storytelling intervention.
      Together with a video production firm with a record of working in healthcare and developing
      documentary-style videos, we will produce a storytelling video intervention (sTVi).

      Our specific aim is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (n = 40) with depressed
      primary care patients who will receive either antidepressant treatment as usual (aTAU) + sTVi
      vs aTAU + attention control videos. Assessments will occur at baseline, 4 (post-treatment)
      and 12 weeks (follow-up). We will examine feasibility and acceptability of sTVi (e.g., uptake
      and completion of sTVi, engagement with videos, and understanding of key ACT principles), the
      attention control videos, and this research design. We will examine treatment differences
      (within relevant confidence intervals) on outcomes (e.g., depression severity). We will
      examine change in potential mechanisms, i.e., ACT-consistent coping strategies derived from
      key ACT principles.

    <description>Antidepressant Treatment as Usual (aTAU): All participants will receive antidepressant treatment as usual provided by their primary care doctor during the study.
Storytelling Video Intervention (sTVi): We will develop a series of 4 videos, each episode approximately 30 minutes long, which will illustrate the key principles of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy.
In addition, we will develop an accompanying &quot;personal journal&quot; for participants that includes a brief self-help guide which encourages participants to write about what they learned in the videos and how they will take similar steps in their own lives to cope with depression.</description>

    <description>Antidepressant Treatment as Usual (aTAU): All participants will receive antidepressant treatment as usual provided by their primary care doctor during the study.
Attention Control Videos: Control participants will view videos about general mental health and well-being. Specifically, we plan to give participants 4 30-minute videos on topics including nutrition, stress reduction, movement and recreation, and becoming an educated patient. The series comes with an accompanying course guidebook. We will provide videos on the same schedule as sTVi.</description>
