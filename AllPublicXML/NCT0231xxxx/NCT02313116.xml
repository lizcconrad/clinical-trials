    <textblock>
      This intraoperative study is a prospective study analyzing specimens from fifty subjects.
      Patients scheduled to undergo breast-conserving surgery will be recruited in accordance with
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study period per subject is the time it takes to
      assess the ex vivo breast tissue sample using the study device. Image review will be
      conducted during surgery and compared to the margin status findings in the post-operative
      pathology report.
