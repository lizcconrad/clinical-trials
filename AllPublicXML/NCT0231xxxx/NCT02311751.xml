  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will be examining the effects of repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on executive function deficits in individuals with autism
      spectrum disorder. Half of the participants will be chosen by chance to receive active rTMS
      stimulation while half will be chosen by chance to receive sham rTMS. Sham rTMS will feel the
      same as active rTMS only there will be no direct brain stimulation. This is necessary to
      ensure that active rTMS is efficacious in the enhancement of executive function in
      individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Based on results from a recently published pilot
      study, the investigators propose that active rTMS treatment will result in a significant
      improvement in working memory performance compared to sham rTMS treatment.

      This study is a randomized, double blind, sham controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of
      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for executive function
      deficits in individuals with autism spectrum disorder between 16 and 25 years of age. The
      study duration is approximately 3 months, with the rTMS sessions lasting for 4 weeks, 5 times
      a week, for about 1 hour each. Several scales will be used to assess for symptom severity and
      adaptive functioning. Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery.

      This study also involves a type of brain imaging known as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at
      the beginning and at the end of the 4 weeks of daily rTMS to better understand the effects of
      rTMS on brain structure and function. Investigators will measure the size and connections of
      different parts of the brain to assess brain structure and blood flow while participants are
      completing some basic tasks to asses brain function.

    <description>Active treatment will be delivered at an intensity that is 90% of the resting motor threshold (RMT). Stimulation will be delivered at 20 Hz with 25 simulation trains of 30 stimuli each (i.e., 750 stimuli) and an intertrain interval of 30 sec. Treatment will be applied in sequential order bilaterally to the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The order of bilateral stimulation (i.e. right then left or left than right) will be held constant for all 20 treatments.

    <description>Sham stimulation will be delivered using the same stimulation parameters and at the site of active treatment, but with only the side-edge resting on the scalp. The coil will be angled 45 degrees way from the skull in a single-wing tilt position. This method produces sound and some somatic sensation (e.g. contraction of scalp muscles) similar to those of active stimulation, but with minimal direct brain effects.
