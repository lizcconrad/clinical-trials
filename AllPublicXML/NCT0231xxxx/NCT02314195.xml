  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have highlighted the potential therapeutic benefits of receptive individual
      music therapy as an adjunct to standard care, in a variety of psychiatric ailments including
      mood and anxiety disorders. However, the role of music in the treatment of obsessive
      compulsive disorder have not been investigated to date. The present study therefore aimed to
      investigate the efficacy of music therapy as an adjunct to standard treatment, on obsessions
      in patients with treatment-na√Øve OCD. Moreover, given the fact that a significant proportion
      of patients with OCD have other comorbid mood or anxiety disorders, the question of whether
      therapeutic benefits of music could be expanded to also affect concurrent depressive and
      anxiety symptoms was explored.
