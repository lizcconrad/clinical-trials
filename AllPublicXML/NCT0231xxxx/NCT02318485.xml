  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to conduct a multicentre human clinical trial to effectively diagnose and
      treat limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD) which can be caused by a number of different disease
      processes, all of which have a common denominator, i.e. a loss of the normal functioning
      epithelial stem cells of the cornea. A number of different diseases such as aniridia, steven
      johnson's syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, bacterial keratitis, or chemical and
      thermal injuries to the cornea can lead to gradual loss of its functioning epithelial stem
      cells. This leads to vascularization of the cornea with surrounding conjunctival epithelium
      growing over it resulting in its scarring and opacification. These corneas, since vascular,
      no longer retain their immune privilege and prove extremely challenging to the ophthalmic
      surgeon. Grafting donor corneas which in normal circumstances (non vascular corneas) would
      give excellent results, exhibit high rates of rejection. This can be very frustrating for
      both the patient as well as the surgeon. Since there are a number of different contributing
      disease pathologies, our estimate is that there are approximately 100 patients per year in
      Belgium that suffer from some degree of LSCD. These patients are very often not correctly
      diagnosed since this is a relatively new disease first described in 1990 after the discovery
      of limbal epithelial stem cells in 1989. The low rates of diagnosis could potentially be
      increased by in vivo confocal scanning microscopy as a non invasive screening test to detect
      early signs of LSCD and therefore offer conservative treatment options. In the cases where
      total limbal stem cell deficiency has already developed, conventional corneal grafting is not
      suitable due to the high vascularity of the host bed. In this situation we propose
      transplanting standardized limbal epithelial stem cell grafts generated from the patient's
      own ocular stem cells (from the good eye, where available) or from HLA matched donors. Tiny 1
      by 2mm superficial limbal (peripheral cornea) biopsy can be taken and the epithelial stem
      cells expanded in the laboratory on a biological substrate, until there is a graft measuring
      &gt;8mm in diameter generated in 2 a week period. This can then be transplanted onto the
      diseased eye after removal of scar tissue using a novel surgical technique we have developed.

      This project aims to conduct a multicenter, single-arm phase II study, in which we will
      assess the safety and efficacy of transplanting standardized, non-xenogenic limbal stem cell
      grafts for patients with LSCD. The Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) clean room facilities at
      the Centre for Cell Therapy and Regenerative Medicine (CCRG, UZA) will conduct tissue
      engineering, while the Departments of Ophthalmology at the University Hospitals in Antwerp
      (UZA), Brussels (UZB) and Gent (UZG) will enrol patients, perform pre-operative tests,
      harvest the limbal biopsies, perform the auto- or allogenic graft transplantation and
      follow-up. Based on the past experience from our phase I/II mono-centre human clinical trial,
      we have been able to document the safety and feasibility of the transplantation. 12/18
      patients (2/3 allogenic and 10/15 autologous) have shown decrease in corneal vascularization,
      complete epithelialization and incorporation of the graft into the anterior cornea post
      limbal stem cell transplantation. However our current results are limited with respect to the
      sample size, feasibility of allogenic transplantation (only 3 cases), long term follow-up
      (mean of 22 months, range 4-43 months) and disease monitoring strategies. Longer patient
      follow-up to determine long term success (especially following subsequent corneal
      transplants) and inclusion of a larger allogenic patient population need to be addressed
      before this treatment can be translated to the clinics and recognized by the RIZIV as a
      reimbursable cell therapy.

      It is pertinent to say that this cell based therapy has the potential to provide this orphan
      pathology with an effective treatment option. The Flemish society will benefit from this
      project by improved rehabilitation of patients suffering from corneal blindness due to LSCD.
      By providing this treatment option we can offer a ray of hope to patients that would formerly
      have to learn to live with their disability. By restoring vision for these patients it is
      possible to reintegrate them into society as socially accepted individuals. Even a small
      degree of visual rehabilitation can make all the difference. For example, a slight increase
      in visual acuity can restore a person's ability to drive rather than having them rely
      exclusively on public transportation. More independence and a better quality of life are the
      main objectives that we are striving to achieve as the major outcome of this project.
