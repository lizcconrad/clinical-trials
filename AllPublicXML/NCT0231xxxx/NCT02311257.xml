      The purpose of this study is to learn about the use of nutritional supplements in patients
      with mitochondrial disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to better assess which nutritional supplements are prescribed to patients with
      mitochondrial disorders, the monitoring obtained and whether any subjective improvements are
      noted by the patients or their caregivers.
