  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is the most common disorders of sex
      development (DSD).Therapy for IHH includes hormone replacement therapy, gonadotropin therapy
      and pulsed infusion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).In the present study, we
      compared the different efficacy and safety of pulsatile GnRH pump therapy with combination
      gonadotropin therapy on fertility and sexual development in male patients with IHH.

      Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) is the most common disorders of sex
      development (DSD).Therapy for IHH includes hormone replacement therapy, gonadotropin therapy
      and pulsed infusion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH).In the present study, we
      compared the different efficacy and safety of pulsatile GnRH pump therapy with combination
      gonadotropin therapy on fertility and sexual development in male patients with IHH.

      The primary endpoint was the achievement of pregnancy in female partner. Secondary endpoints
      were time to actual attainment of various sperm thresholds: sperm concentration&gt;0*10^6/ml ,
      &gt;1.0 *10^6/ml and &gt;15 *10^6/ml, respectively.

      The clinical and laboratory characteristics including testicular and prostatic volume, Tanner
      stage for pubic hair and genital, serum hormone levels [especially serum
      testosterone,luteinizing hormone (LH) , and Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels], sperm
      concentration per ejaculate, and adverse events at baseline and at the end of treatment were
      also evaluated.
