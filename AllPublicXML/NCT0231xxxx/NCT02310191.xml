  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New brain ischemic lesions are detected in about 50% of patients undergoing carotid artery
      stenting (CAS). The aim was to assess correlation between selected laboratory markers and
      occurrence of new brain infarctions after CAS.

      Methods: All consecutive patients 1) with internal carotid artery stenosis &gt;70%, 2) indicated
      to CAS, 3) with signed informed consent were enrolled to the prospective study during 16
      months. All patients used dual antiplatelet therapy (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA] 100 mg +
      clopidogrel 75 mg per day) at least 7 days before CAS. Neurological examination and brain
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed before and 24 hours after CAS in all
      patients. Venous blood samples were collected within 24 hours before CAS in all patients:
      hematology + reticulocytes, coagulation markers (PT, APTT, INR, Fbg, Clauss), vWF antigen,
      PAI-1 activity, PAI-1 polymorphism 4G/g, Multiplate (ASA and clopidogrel resistance test).
      Blood samples for the assessment of anti Xa activity were collected during CAS. T-test was
      used for statistical evaluation.

    <description>Procedures will be carried out via the femoral approach following a Seldinger technique. All patients will be on long-term aspirin (100 mg/day) and a 525-mg loading dose of clopidogrel. A dose of 10 000 units unfractionated heparin will be administered at the beginning of the intervention. A cerebral protection device (FilterWire EZâ„¢; Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts, USA) will be use in all patients if possible. The type of covered stent and other specific intervention strategies will be left to the discretion of the interventional radiologists. After predilatation of the stenosis (if needed), an appropriate stent for each stenosis will be implanted and then dilated using a balloon catheter.</description>
