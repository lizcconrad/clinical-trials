  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label trial to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of
      Cannabidiol Oral Solution as adjunctive therapy for pediatric and adult participants with
      treatment-resistant seizure disorders, including Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) or Dravet
      syndrome (DS). All participants have rolled over from previous trials: INS011-14-029
      (NCT02324673), INS011-14-024 (NCT02318537), or INS011- 14-025 (NCT02318563).

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 48 weeks or marketing approval, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's overall clinical condition is compared to the one week period just before the start of medication (the baseline visit). The participant's condition is compared to the patient's condition at admission to the project [prior to starting treatment] on a 7-point scale, where 1=very much improved since the initiation of treatment; and 7=very much worse since the initiation of treatment.
The CGI-I will be completed for all participants, regardless of chronological and developmental age.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 48 weeks or marketing approval, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of the participant's illness is rated on a seven-point scale, where 1=normal, not at all ill, and 7=among the most extremely ill patients. This rating is based upon observed and reported symptoms, behavior, and function in the past seven days. The score reflects the average severity level across the seven days.
The CGI-S will be completed for all participants, regardless of chronological and developmental age.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact of Pediatric Epilepsy Scale (IPES)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 48 weeks or marketing approval, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The IPES assesses the impact on academic achievement, participation in activities, health, relationships with family and with peers and siblings, social activities, self-esteem, and the caregiver's hopes for their child's future. It takes about 3 minutes for the parent to complete. Each of the 11 items is given a severity score of 0 (not at all) to 3 (a lot). The higher the score, the higher is the impact of epilepsy on that item. The highest total score possible is 33 (range 0-33).
The Impact of Pediatric Epilepsy Scale (IPES) is validated for subjects who are 2 to 16 years of age. Due to developmental delay characteristic of the study population, subjects through 18 years of chronological age will complete the IPES. Subjects over 18 years of chronological age will not complete the IPES.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 48 weeks or marketing approval, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales measures the personal and social skills of individuals from birth through adulthood. Because adaptive behavior refers to an individual's typical performance of the day-to-day activities required for personal and social sufficiency, these scales assess what a person actually does, rather than what he or she is able to do.
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Survey Interview Form) is a measure of adaptive behavior in children, adolescents and adults. It yields an overall standard score (Adaptive Behavior Composite, ABC) and age standard scores in four domains. ABC scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15 (range = 20 to 160). Higher scores suggest a higher level of adaptive functioning. A rise in standard scores from Baseline indicates improvement.
The VABS will be completed for all participants, regardless of chronological and developmental age.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, up to 48 weeks or marketing approval, whichever is earlier</time_frame>
    <description>For subjects 7 years of developmental age or older, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be administered to access suicidality. The appropriate adult version will be used in subjects 12 years of (developmental) age and older. The investigator will determine the participant's developmental age.</description>

    <description>Participants who completed INS011-14-029 will begin this study on the dose with which they were being treated previously, unless they experienced tolerability issues. When the dose is selected for INS011-14-024 and INS011-14-025, participants will be transitioned to that dose (a maximum of 40 mg/kg/day).
Participants who completed INS011-14-024 and INS011-14-025 will continue treatment with the dose at which they were being treated previously according to those protocols, unless they experienced tolerability issues. This dose will be based on the results of INS011-014-029 and established prior to recruitment of the first participant in these studies.
The total daily dose (mg/kg/day) will be evenly split between morning and evening doses (12 hours apart). If tolerability issues arise, the participant's dose may be changed at the investigator's discretion.</description>
