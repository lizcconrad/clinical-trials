  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence against women (VAW), the most extreme manifestation of the unequal power balance
      between women and men, is a major global public health concern. One of the most common forms
      of VAW is that perpetrated by a husband or other intimate partner. In Ethiopia, 70.9% of
      women reported having experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence (IPV) in
      their lifetime, demonstrating the pervasiveness of the problem. A growing body of evidence
      has also linked IPV and HIV risk.

      This study is a cluster randomized controlled trial assessing the impact of a community-based
      intervention focused on Intimate Partner Violence and HIV delivered in the context of the
      Ethiopian coffee ceremony, a culturally established forum for community discussion and
      conflict resolution. Villages will be randomly assigned to one of 4 study arms (3
      intervention and one control arm): 1) Women only participate in the intervention, 2) Men only
      participate, 3) Both men and women (couples) participate, 4) Women and men receive the
      control intervention comprising a short informational session on violence reduction.

    <description>The Ethiopian traditional coffee ceremony will be used as an entry point for a community based intervention to provide information, change behaviour around IPV and improve gender equity and intra-couple relations. The coffee ceremony is a culturally established forum for community discussion and conflict resolution and an integral part of Ethiopian life. The intervention will involve regular coffee ceremonies, during which approximately 20 members of the community will participate in education and discussions centred on gender issues, sexuality, communication and conflict resolution, HIV/AIDS and its link with violence, as well as HIV/AIDS prevention. Each coffee ceremony will be moderated by a female or male facilitator trained in participatory learning, moderation, HIV/AIDS prevention, counselling, and gender issues. The intervention will involve 14 two‚Äêhour session per group of participants.</description>
