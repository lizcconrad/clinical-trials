  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is designed to test the hypothesis that compared to conventional treatment;
      endothelial function-guided treatment reduces adverse cardiovascular events in patients with
      non-obstructive coronary artery disease documented at clinically indicated coronary
      angiography.

      Subjects with chest pain and non-obstructive coronary artery disease (20-70% luminal diameter
      narrowing) documented by coronary angiograms will be enrolled in the study 2 - 30 days
      following the coronary angiograms. Only subjects who have signed an Informed Consent Form and
      meet all of the eligibility criteria will be qualified for enrollment.

      Following the baseline EndoPAT testing subjects will be divided into two groups by their
      EndoPAT (EndoScore) results:

        1. Group A - normal EndoScore: Logarithmic value of RHI (Ln_RHI) &gt;0.7

        2. Group B - abnormal EndoScore: Ln_RHI ≤ 0.7 The subjects of Group B will be randomized in
           1:1 ratio (by envelopes with randomization numbers at each site) to Group B1 who will be
           treated conventionally i.e., &quot;usual care&quot; by the site study team; and Group B2 who will
           be treated with &quot;enhanced care&quot;.

      Staff prescribing treatment regime for subjects in group A and B1 (&quot;usual care&quot;) along with
      the subjects in these groups, will be blinded to the EndoScore value.

      Subjects of all groups will return for 4 follow-up visits: 180±14days, 360±14days, 720±14days
      and 1080±14days (study end).
