  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim was to assess the impact of a cell phone-based diabetes management application
      (Welltang) on HbA1c, blood glucose, lipids, physical activity, weight, and blood pressure
      during 3 months. And hypoglycemic events, the satisfaction of the patients with Boyibang,
      their diabetes knowledge and self-care behaviors were also evaluated.

      At baseline, all patients completed the Diabetes Self- Care Behavior Questionnaire and a
      Diabetes Knowledge Survey. Health, medical and demographic history, height and weight, waist
      and hip circumferences, and blood pressure were recorded. HbA1c and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) level were tested. All of these data were measured 3 months later at the
      conclusion of the study intervention.

    <description>The intervention group installed Welltang (downloaded from www.welltang.com for free) designed by Shanghai Geping Information and Technique Company Ltd (Shanghai, China) on their cell phones. Welltang is a cell phone- based diabetes management application that consists of three main parts: knowledge, self-management, communication between patients and clinicians</description>
