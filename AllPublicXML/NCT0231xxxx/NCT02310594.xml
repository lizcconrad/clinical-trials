    <textblock>
      This research trial studies the effect of radiation therapy on tumor immunity. Standard
      radiation therapy destroys tumor cells. In response to tumor cell death caused by radiation
      therapy, the body has an ability to stimulate an anti-tumor response (immunity), but this
      response is often ineffective in shrinking tumor tissue. Collecting samples of blood from
      patients before, during, and after radiation therapy to study in the laboratory may help
      doctors learn more about the effects of radiation therapy on anti-tumor response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the effect of radiation therapy on tumor immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Samples of blood are collected before, during, and within two weeks after radiation therapy
      and then stored for analysis of anti-tumor immunity.
