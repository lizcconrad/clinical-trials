    <description>Each subject will be given a total of 10 doses of OBI-833/OBI-821 subcutaneously at weeks 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,20,and 24 (Visits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and 10, respectively). Post treatment, subjects will be continually evaluated for safety and immune response every 4 weeks until the end of study, which is 12 weeks after the last dose, i.e., week 36. Subsequently, subjects will be followed for survival every 8 weeks up to 12 months after the end of study.</description>

          3. Dose escalation: Subjects with recurrent or metastatic incurable disease that failed
             to respond to at least one line of anticancer standard therapy and for which standard
             treatment is no longer effective or tolerable.

             Cohort expansion phase: Subjects with recurrent or metastatic NSCLC who have achieved
             stable disease (SD), or partial response (PR) status after at least 1 regimen of
             anticancer therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, or targeted therapy, or PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists
             either alone or in combination) , and there are no standard treatments available

             neurological symptoms possibly related to active CNS metastasis in Dose Escalation
             Phase.

             Cohort Expansion Phase: Subjects with asymptomatic CNS metastases for at least four
             weeks before study drug treatment
