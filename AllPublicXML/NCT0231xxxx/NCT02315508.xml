  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to demonstrate that the new medicine AUT00063 is effective and safe in the
      treatment of tinnitus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reduced activity at certain sites in the brain (called &quot;voltage-gated potassium channels&quot;)
      has been linked to hearing problems, like age-related loss of hearing or tinnitus (a
      'ringing' or buzzing noise in the ears).

      AUT00063 is an experimental new medicine that has been developed to improve the action of
      these specific channels and so treat the brain component of these hearing problems.

      The main purpose of this study is to try to demonstrate an improvement in the severity of
      tinnitus after 4 weeks of treatment with the study medicine or the placebo (dummy drug which
      does not contain the medication). Subjects will undergo a safety follow-up after the
      treatment period.

      Safety and efficacy will be determined by looking at a number of assessments (physical
      examinations, blood sampling, hearing assessments, questionnaires, etc.) and in case of any
      serious medical event during the study. The amount of drug in the blood will also be
      measured.

      It is expected that up to 152 people with tinnitus may take part in the study. The study
      participants will be recruited at around 16 Hospital sites in the UK.
