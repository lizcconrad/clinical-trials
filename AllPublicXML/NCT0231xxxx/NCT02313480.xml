    <textblock>
      To date, the benefits of massage in chronic neck pain patients has only been investigated as
      a singular treatment, rather than as part of a treatment package. The need for this research
      has been highlighted in the literature (Ezzo et al, 2007; Haraldsson et al, 2006) This
      research aimed to establish whether the addition of massage to a program of exercise and
      manual therapy offers any additional benefits over exercise and manual therapy alone in the
      treatment of patients with chronic neck pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      39 patients with neck pain of greater than three months duration were randomised to either a
      massage or non-massage group in a primary care setting in the Dublin region. One therapist
      administered all treatments. Randomisation was carried out by the use of sequential sampling,
      utilising permuted blocks. Patients were excluded from the study if they had severe
      co-existing disease, had neck pain due to fracture, tumour, infection or other non-mechanical
      causes, or if the patient had a diagnosis of osteoporosis anywhere in the body.

      Both groups underwent up to eight weekly physiotherapy sessions. The non-massage group
      received exercise, manual therapy and advice over the 30 minute intervention period, in
      conjunction with an exercise program to perform at home. The massage group received all of
      the above as well as Swedish massage. Follow up was for the duration of treatment only.

      A number of T-tests and non-parametric tests were conducted to establish if the two groups
      were comparable at baseline.

      A mixed ANOVA was then used to analyse between-group and within-group data simultaneously. No
      blinding was possible, although the questionnaires were self-administered which may have
      limited bias.

    <description>Used to accurately measure pain. On this, patients verbally rated their usual and worst (in the last week) pain from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). Its test-retest reliability in the chronic neck pain population was established as fair to moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) =.76; 95% CI, .51-.87) by Cleland et al (2008). Farrar et al (2010) found a difference of two points to be a clinically meaningful change in the chronic pain population.</description>

    <description>The NDI (Appendix 3) is the most widely used and most strongly validated instrument for assessing self-rated disability in patients with neck pain (Vernon, 2008).It includes ten self-report items covering activities of daily living, concentration and pain. Responses are on a 0-5 point scale, with a total score ranging from 0 (no pain or disability) to 50 (severe pain and disability; Gay et al, 2007).</description>
