      This study seeks to examine whether 12 weeks of home-based computerized cognitive training on
      Cognitive Motor Interference (CMI) will improve walking and cognitive function in persons
      with MS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Walking and cognitive impairments are common in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS).
      Approximately 85% of persons with MS report walking as a major limitation, whereas 65%
      experience cognitive dysfunction. Traditionally, walking and cognition have been viewed as
      unrelated, but there is evidence of cognitive-motor interference (CMI). CMI is believed to
      stem from damage to common neural substances responsible for cognitive and motor functions.
      Recent evidence supports cognitive-motor interference in persons with MS. For example, there
      is evidence that walking performance declines when performed in conjunction with a
      simultaneous cognitive task (i.e., dual task cost [DTC] of walking). This decline in walking
      performance is greater in persons with MS compared to healthy control and is associated with
      walking impairment. The degree of CMI during walking is associated with walking performance
      and cognitive function in people with MS. For instance, CMI has been found to be related to
      general cognitive function and self-reported everyday cognitive errors in people with MS with
      minimal disability.

      Cognitive-motor interference during mobility tasks is of practical and clinical importance
      because it has been linked to decreased community mobility and a greater risk of falls in
      other clinical populations such as stoke, Parkinson's disease and the elderly. We have
      recently demonstrated that the degree of CMI during walking was associated with physiological
      fall risk in MS, whereas gait velocity in and of itself was not.

      Evidence gathered from other special populations suggests that CMI can be minimized with
      interventions. However, there is no research on rehabilitation strategies on CMI in people
      with MS. One possible approach for improving cognitive function and reducing CMI involves
      computerized cognitive testing. This approach capitalizes on neural plasticity and has been
      found to improve cognitive function, walking and balance in healthy older adults. Although
      there is limited preliminary data suggesting this type of training may improve cognitive
      function in people with MS, there is no extant data indicating computerized cognitive
      training will impact mobility. Based on association between cognitive and motor function in
      people with MS, it is possible that cognitive training may lead to improvements in walking
      performance as seen in other clinical populations. One major advantage of computerized
      cognitive training is that it can be completed without direct supervision and in one's home
      to minimize various barriers to clinic-based rehabilitation.

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>CMI will be operationalized as the percent change in walking velocity from single (walking only) to dual task (walking while thinking). Participants will complete a total of 4 walking trials over a 20' pressure sensitive (Zenoâ„¢) walkway at a comfortable pace. Half of the trials will be conducted while reciting every other letter of the alphabet (i.e. N, P, R, etc). Each trial will start with a different letter to minimize practice effects. The order of the dual task conditions will be counter balanced. Prior to walking trails participants will complete the alternating letter task for two 10-second trials while seated.</description>

    <description>Cognition will indexed at each assessment utilizing the brief international cognitive assessment for MS (BICAMS) which is composed of the symbol digit modalities test (SDMT), California verbal learning test-II (CVLT-II) and the revised brief visuospatial memory test (BVMT). Respectively, these validated tests quantify cognitive processing speed, memory and executive function. All cognitive tests will be performed in an environment free of distractions. We note that these tests are valid and reliable in persons with MS.</description>

    <description>Computerized Cognitive Training: The online computer training program will be administered on the participants' home computer. The training program will consist of a total of 36 sessions (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Each session will last no more than 60 minutes and consist of five different cognitive exercises designed to improve cognitive processing speed, memory and executive function. All exercises will involve visual stimuli and a motor response (key or button press). Exercises will be adaptive to participants' individual ability and start with minimal difficulty.</description>
