    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, phase 1 safety run-in and phase 2 study of BBI608 in
      combination with temozolomide in patients with recurrent or progressive glioblastoma who have
      not received prior bevacizumab therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In arm A, patients who are candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 as
      monotherapy prior to resection, followed by post-operative BBI608 administered in combination
      with temozolomide. In arm B, patients who are not candidates for surgical resection will
      receive BBI608 administered orally, daily, in combination with temozolomide.

      In the phase 1/DLT cohort portion of this study, pharmacokinetics will be evaluated for both
      arms A and B. Pharmacodynamics will be evaluated in all patients who undergo surgical
      resection.

    <description>In arm A, BBI608 will be administered at the RP2D twice daily for 7(±2) days prior to planned surgical resection or biopsy of recurrent GBM. Upon the clinical recovery of the patient and at a time between 15-28 days after surgery, BBI608 will be administered orally, daily, each day of a 28 day cycle in combination with temozolomide.
In arm B, patients who are not candidates for surgical resection will receive BBI608 administered orally, daily, each day of a 28 day cycle at the RP2D in combination with temozolomide.</description>
