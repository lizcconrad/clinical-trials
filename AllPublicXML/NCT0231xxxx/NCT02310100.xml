    <textblock>
      A prospective, multicenter, interventional study to collect confirmatory evidence on the
      safety and effectiveness of the TactiCath® percutaneous ablation catheter in the post
      approval setting for the treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using
      contact force assisted irrigated radiofrequency ablation.

    <description>Rate of subjects free from symptomatic Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF), Atrial Flutter (AFL), and Atrial Tachycardia (AT) lasting longer than 30 seconds through 9 months of follow-up after a 3 month blanking period is higher than a stated performance goal. Procedural failure defined by any of the following events: (1) Documented recurrence of AF/AFL/AT during the 9-month observational period lasting longer than 30 seconds; (2) Repeat ablation following the blanking period; or (3) Use of new ADD for the documented symptomatic atrial arrhythmia following the blanking period.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is planned to undergo a catheter ablation procedure due to symptomatic PAF
             that is refractory or intolerant to at least one Class I IV antiarrhythmic drug

          2. Minimum of one episode of PAF greater than 30 seconds in duration within 12 months
             prior to enrollment documented by 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG), Holter monitor,
             trans-telephonic event monitor, telemetry strip, or implanted device

          3. Minimum of 3 episodes of PAF within the preceding 12 months documented by patient
             history

          4. Patient is 18 years of age or older

          5. Patient is willing and capable of complying unassisted with the study protocol
             requirements including all specified follow up visits

          6. Patient provides written informed consent prior to enrollment in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Persistent or long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation (AF)

          2. Patient has had 4 or more cardioversions in the past 12 months.

          3. Active systemic infection

          4. Presence of implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD)

          5. Arrhythmia due to reversible causes including thyroid disorders, acute alcohol
             intoxication, and other major surgical procedures in the preceding 3 months

          6. Myocardial infarction (MI), acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary
             intervention (PCI), or valve or coronary bypass grafting surgery within preceding 3
             months

          7. Left atrial diameter &gt; 5.0 cm

          8. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35%

          9. New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV

         10. Previous left atrial ablation procedure, either surgical or catheter ablation

         11. Patient has had a left atrial surgical procedure or incision with resulting scar

         12. Previous tricuspid or mitral valve replacement or repair

         13. Heart disease in which corrective surgery is anticipated within 6 months

         14. Bleeding diathesis or suspected pro coagulant state

         15. Contraindication to long term antithromboembolic therapy

             controlled with pre-medication

         19. Contraindication to computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography

         20. Severe pulmonary disease (e.g., restrictive pulmonary disease, constrictive or chronic
             obstructive pulmonary disease) or any other disease or malfunction of the lungs or
             respiratory system that produces severe chronic symptoms

         21. Positive pregnancy test results for female patients of childbearing potential

         22. Patient has other anatomic or co morbid conditions that, in the investigator's
             opinion, could limit the patient's ability to participate in the study or to comply
             with follow up requirements, or impact the scientific soundness of the study results

         23. Patient is currently participating in another clinical trial or has participated in a
             clinical trial within 30 days prior to screening that may interfere with this study

         24. Patient is unlikely to survive the protocol follow up period of 12 months
