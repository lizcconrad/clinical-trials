      This study (RA0078) will continue to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) for 6 months as additional medication to methotrexate (MTX) with or
      without folic acid in Chinese subjects with active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who participated
      in the main feeder study, RA0044. All subjects will continue to receive their established
      treatment with MTX with or without folic acid. The dose of MTX may be decreased by the
      Investigator due to toxicity, but should not be discontinued completely. Concomitant
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral corticosteroids will be permitted. For each
      subject, the study duration will last a maximum of approximately 32 weeks.

             the Week 24 Completion Visit of RA0044. Subjects who enter RA0078 at Week 16 of the
             RA0044 study are not required to have a chest x-ray prior to enrollment

          -  Subject is able to continue treatment with Methotrexate (MTX) (with or without folic
             acid) at a dose deemed appropriate by the Investigator

          -  Female subjects with childbearing potential should have a negative pregnancy test at
             Entry and should have a medically accepted method of contraception used during the
             entire duration of the study and for 10 weeks after the last dose of Certolizumab
             pegol (CZP). Medically accepted methods of contraception are: hormonal contraception
             for at least 2 cycles prior to Screening, intrauterine device, implant device,
             diaphragm with spermicide, bilateral tubal ligation, monogamous relationship with

          -  Subjects have a history of an infected joint prosthesis at any time with that
             prosthesis still in situ
