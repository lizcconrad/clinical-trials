    <textblock>
      This investigation is aimed to examine the effects of two different exercise-oriented
      protocols on the knee torque-angle relationship of the knee flexors.

      Thirty two young soccer players were be randomly assigned to three groups:
      hamstring-eccentric (ECC, n=11), unstable-squatting (UNS, n=11) or control (C, n=10). The ECC
      and UNS groups performed eighteen sessions over 6 weeks of an injury prevention protocol,
      using only 3 hamstring-eccentric or unstable-squatting exercises. The angle-torque
      relationship was measured before and after the training intervention. Voluntary isometric
      torque was recorded at six test angles, with participants prone (35º-100º; 0º on full
      extension).

      This study utilized a three parallel-groups randomized controlled design, where 3
      between-participant conditions, ECC, UNS and C, were tested. Once considered eligible for the
      study, all participants were familiarized with the testing procedures. Participants attended
      the laboratory for a pre-training test session, where body mass, height and muscle functional
      parameters were recorded. Two days after their pre-test, participants including in ECC or UNS
      started a 6 weeks (18 sessions) training program while the control group did not perform any
      type of resistance training.

      Nevertheless, during the 6 weeks intervention period all three groups continued with their
      normal recreationally physical activity consisting in 2 to 3 sessions per week of soccer
      training or friendly matches. Two days after the end of the intervention period muscle
      function was re-tested.

    <description>Three workouts per week on non-consecutive days for 6 weeks. 1)Assisted Nordic Curl: Kneeling on the ground with ankles fixed by a partner, participant lowering the trunk to the ground by eccentrically contracting the hamstrings. 2) Eccentric single stiff-legged dead lift: From standing position with the arm crossing over the chest, participant lowering the body toward the ground by flexing the hip joint without bending the support leg knee and raising the other leg until form an straight line with the trunk4 3) Eccentric double stiff-legged dead lift: From standing position with the arm crossing over the chest, participant lowering the body toward the ground by flexing the hip joint without bending the knees until the body parallel with the floor.</description>

    <description>Trained 3 times per week on non-consecutive days for 6 weeks for a total of 18 training sessions. UNS training consisted in the following three exercises: 1) One leg squat: Standing on the floor on one leg only and squat down until knee flexed to 900 and press back up with just that single leg. 2) One leg Squat on Bosu® balance Trainer: Standing on the Bosu® balance Trainer on one leg only and squat down until supported leg knee flexes to 900 and press back up with just that single leg. 3) Forward lunges on a Bosu® balance Trainer: position the forward leg on the Bosu® balance Trainer and squatting with the forward leg.</description>
