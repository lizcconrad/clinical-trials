      Alcohol is one of the most widely used recreational drugs and it is often used in social
      settings to enhance sociability. There are few data showing that acute alcohol consumption
      affects facial emotion recognition. However the acute effects of alcohol in social drinkers
      on different aspects of social cognition are largely unknown. In the present study, we will
      therefore evaluate effects of beer (alcohol) on social cognition. The study will include 60
      subjects (30 male, 30 female) and use a placebo-controlled, crossover design with the two
      experimental conditions alcoholic beer (individually calculated amount aiming to achieve a
      blood-alcohol concentration of 0.4g/kg), and non-alcoholic beer (placebo). We primarily aim
      to evaluate whether beer (alcohol) affects the ability to correctly decode emotions in facial
      expressions using different facial emotion recognition Tasks. Additionally, appraisal of
      visual erotic stimuli following alcohol consumption will be evaluated. Subjective social and
      mood effects will be assessed using validated questionnaires. Blood samples will be collected
      to assess plasma levels of the &quot;social hormone&quot; oxytocin as well as blood alcohol levels to
      test possible associations with effects on emotional processing.
