      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a particular and troublesome symptom occurring in some Parkinsonian
      patients. Our objective is to adapt and extend FOG detectors in order to include other
      associated gait pattern changes, like festination.Our purpose is to develop a wearable
      assistant which would trigger the most appropriate cueing aid just before occurrence of the
      freezing episode.

      Freezing of gait (FOG) is a particular and troublesome symptom occurring in some Parkinsonian
      patients .This brief, episodic absence or marked reduction of forward progression of the feet
      despite the intention to walk is associated to a fall risk. Automatized FOG episode detection
      would allow systematic assessment of patient state and objective evaluation of the clinical
      effects of treatments. Techniques have been proposed in the literature to identify FOG
      episodes based on the frequency properties of inertial sensor signals. Our objective here is
      to adapt and extend these FOG detectors in order to include other associated gait pattern
      changes, like festination. The proposed approach is based on a single wireless inertial
      sensor placed on the patient's lower limbs. Based freezing detectors are not sufficient to
      detect all FOG and festination episodes. Stride length and cadence are valuable inputs to
      anticipate the occurrence of upcoming FOG events. The investigators have developed a solution
      based on a minimal number of embedded sensors and detection algorithms for future real-time
      applications. It is well known that auditory rhythmic stimulation or visuals marks on the
      ground would improve dramatically gait in patients with FOG. This sensibility to cueing leads
      some teams to develop some mobility aid devices rhythmic. Our purpose is to develop a
      wearable assistant which would trigger the most appropriate cueing aid just before occurrence
      of the freezing episode.
