  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary intervention offered through this study is a manualized and culturally adapted
      CBT intervention combined with an exercise intervention, administered by trained Community
      Health Workers and exercise trainers to ethnic minority elders with moderate to severe mood
      symptoms and at risk of disability. In addition to the intervention implementation, the study
      examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based
      mental health and disability prevention treatments for ethnic minority elders in
      community-based settings. Thus, the study will evaluate the three components necessary for a
      successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among
      clients and partnering agencies, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization.

      The researchers have partnered with 5 community-based organizations and 2 clinics, each of
      whom will recruit 60 elder participants to be randomized into either the intervention
      (CBT+exercise) or control (enhanced usual care) groups. Each participant randomized into the
      intervention group will receive 10 sessions of individual CBT for depression and anxiety
      (Positive Minds), using a translated and culturally adapted manual, and administered by a
      trained community health worker. In addition, each participant will engage in three exercise
      groups per week for 12 weeks, using the Increased Velocity Specific to Task (Strong Bodies;
      InVEST) protocol. Both intervention and control groups will be assessed biweekly for symptoms
      of depression, anxiety, and suicidality, and both groups will participate in a thorough
      assessment at baseline, and 2, 6, and 12 months after baseline.
