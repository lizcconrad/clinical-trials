      The primary goal of this study is to improve the overall efficacy of cognitive processing
      therapy-cognitive-only version (CPT-C) in a sample of 130 active-duty service members through
      a variable length treatment. The study seeks to determine if some service members would
      benefit from a longer or shorter dose of treatment (4-24 sessions), and to identify which
      individuals are likely to require more, less, or the standard number of treatment sessions to
      reach good end-state functioning. Predictors of length of therapy and treatment outcome will
      be examined. Specifically, we will evaluate factors related to internalizing/externalizing
      traits, cognitive flexibility, inability to inhibit dysfunctional cognitions, and readiness
      to change as they are related to the number of treatment sessions required to treat patients
      to the point of good end-state functioning. Additional outcomes including alcohol use,
      psychosocial functioning, physical health, and sleep also will be evaluated.

    <time_frame>Pretreatment, weekly during treatment, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks posttreatment</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is a widely used and well-validated instrument for measuring the severity of depressive symptoms (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). It consists of 9 items that assess both affective and somatic symptoms related to depression and depressive disorders; these 9 items correspond to the diagnostic criteria for DSM MDD. Respondents rate the frequency with which they have been bothered by depressive symptoms within the past two weeks on a scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 3 (&quot;nearly every day&quot;). Scores on all items are summed to obtain a total severity score.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive Only (CPT-C) is an evidence-based form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) used to treat PTSD. CPT is a manualized program that focuses on challenging beliefs and assumptions related to the trauma, oneself, and the world. Individual sessions will be conducted twice weekly for 4-24 sessions; each session is 60 minutes.</description>
