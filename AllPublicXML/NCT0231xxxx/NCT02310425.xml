  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immature gastrointestinal functions increase the risk of poor growth as well as nosocomial
      infections and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in the preterm infant. The effects of
      probiotics on growth and development in premature infants have been investigated poorly.
      Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 (S. boulardii) is a non-pathogenic probiotic yeast.

      Prophylactic supplementation of S. boulardii at a dose of 50 mg/kg twice a day appeared to
      bring preterm infants weight gain closer to that of intra-uterine growth rate, reduce feeding
      intolerance, and had no adverse effects.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate if feeding supplemented with S. boulardii can
      improve growth and clinical outcomes in preterm and low birth weight infants.

      A prospective, randomized case-controlled trial was conducted in infants with a gestational
      age of 30 to 37 weeks and a birth weight between 1500 to 2500 g. The study group received S.
      boulardii supplementation, 50 mg/kg twice daily, compared to no intervention in the control
      group. The primary outcomes were short term growth parameters including weight gain, linear
      growth, head and chest circumference, and secondary outcomes were clinical outcomes, feeding
      intolerance and complications.

      A total of 125 infants were enrolled in the study, 63 in the treatment and 62 in the control
      group. S. boulardii was administered for the first time at 2.63 days after birth (1 day to 6
      days, 46 within 3 days, only 5 between 4 and 6 days).
