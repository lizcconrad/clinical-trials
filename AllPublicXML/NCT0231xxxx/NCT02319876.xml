      The current project was designed to examine the express TIM-3 on lymphocytes and monocytes
      and its role in immunosuppression during sepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppression is the leading cause of death in septic patients.Lymphocyte apoptosis has
      been recognized as an important step in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Previous studies
      indicated that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin protein 3 (TIM-3) is a type I cell surface
      protein and was identified as a marker of lymphocyte dysfunction. The current project was
      designed to examine the express TIM-3 on lymphocytes and monocytes and its further role in
      immunosuppression during sepsis.
