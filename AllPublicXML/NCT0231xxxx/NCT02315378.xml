    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness
      of a brief Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT) with adults (over age 18)
      showing signs of peritraumatic anxiety in the Emergency Department of Bellevue Hospital, New
      York in the hours following a psychologically traumatic event. Thirty-six participants will
      be enrolled over a 12-month period: 18 receiving ARTAT and 18 receiving Treatment As Usual
      (TAU). The study will target anxious arousal in patients immediately (1 to 8 hours) following
      a trauma. Participants will be recruited from among patients who present in the Emergency
      Department at Bellevue Hospital for treatment of an injury sustained in a traumatic event
      (accident, assault) as long as injuries do not preclude participation. Participants included
      in the study will have experienced a trauma within 8 hours and presenting with signs of a
      strong risk factor for PTSD: peritraumatic panic (severe psychological and physiological
      anxiety symptoms such as fear of dying, fear of losing emotional control, tachycardia,
      sweating, shaking and dissociation symptoms such as derealisation and depersonalization that
      occur during and immediately following a trauma. Following the initial assessment, eligible
      participants will be randomized to receive the one-hour anxiety-reduction intervention
      designed to reduce anxiety and panic symptoms through education and anxiety y management
      skills or TAU. The clinician administered and self-report assessments will be conducted at
      screening, baseline, post-treatment, weekly, and at a one-month and three-month follow-up.

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of the proposed research is to pilot a behavioral intervention specifically
      designed to reduce the symptoms of peritraumatic panic, in order to reduce the likelihood of
      subsequent PTSD. The investigators have developed the Anxiety Reduction Treatment for Acute
      Trauma (ARTAT), a one-session intervention targeting at-risk individuals (those continuing to
      experience peritraumatic panic following a trauma) and enhance self-efficacy. The
      intervention provides education about common responses to trauma in order to normalize
      symptoms and teaches individuals anxiety management techniques such as deep breathing and
      muscle relaxation. ARTAT specifically avoids encouraging people to process the trauma (given
      evidence that this may enhance arousal).

      This study is a randomized controlled trial of a single session 60- minute Anxiety Reduction
      Treatment for Acute Trauma (ARTAT) administered during Emergency Department (ED) admission to
      patients presenting with anxiety following traumatic exposure. Thirty-six participants will
      be enrolled over a 12-month period (18 receiving ARTAT and 18 receiving TAU). The study will
      target anxious arousal in patients immediately (1 to 8 hours) following a trauma.
      Participants will be recruited from among patients who present in the Bellevue Emergency
      Department for treatment of an injury sustained in a traumatic event (accident, assault) as
      long as injuries do not preclude participation. Participants included in the study will have
      experienced a trauma within 8 hours and presenting with signs of a strong risk factor for
      PTSD: peritraumatic panic (severe psychological and physiological anxiety symptoms such as
      fear of dying, fear of losing emotional control, tachycardia, sweating, shaking and
      dissociation symptoms such as derealisation and depersonalization that occur during and
      immediately following a trauma. Following the initial assessment, eligible participants will
      be randomized to receive the one-hour anxiety-reduction intervention designed to reduce
      anxiety and panic symptoms through education and anxiety y management skills or the TAU. The
      clinician administered and self-report assessments will be conducted at screening, baseline,
      post-treatment, and at a one-month and three-month follow-up.

    <description>Treatment as Usual for patients presenting after accidents and assaults as it pertains to mental health, is a brief intervention that varies in length depending on the patient's needs. If the patient is highly distressed, the social worked will provide brief crisis management support. The social worker also performs case management functions such as attempting to get in touch with family, contacting shelter or hotel if the patient is homeless, contacting other social service agencies if needed, and providing the patient referrals for mental health services in the community. A psychiatrist will also be called to assess the patient only if he or she appears to be a threat to self (suicidal) or others, and exclusion criteria for this study.</description>
