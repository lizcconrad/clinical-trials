  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will seek to use emotion recognition technology from video to link patient
      facial expressions, heart rate and respiratory rate changes, and movement patterns to patient
      pain scores.

      During hospitalization, beginning after orthopedic surgery, study participants will be asked
      to wear a small motion detector on their wrist. A computer vision system which analyzes both
      whole-body movement as well as facial expressions will be used at the bedside to compare
      common signs and symptoms of post op pain to patient pain scores.

      Up to 30 study participants will be selected.

      Study participants will be asked to complete a written pain diary during waking hours.This
      information will be compared to the pain scores found in the patient's medical record and/or
      the amount and frequency of pain medications they receive.
