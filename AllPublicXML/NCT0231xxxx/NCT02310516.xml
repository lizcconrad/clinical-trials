  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The brain awake surgery has recently boomed in neurosurgical oncology but also in epilepsy
      surgery. The goal of awake surgery is to allow a more precise localization of sensorimotor
      functions, languages and cognitive to better respect them. Indeed, the interindividual
      anatomo-functional variations, the lack of specificity of functional explorations
      radiological magnetic or nuclear, as well as the reorganization of the areas involved in
      these functions (mechanisms of brain plasticity) in epileptic patients or patients with
      cerebral tumor do not allow to identify them in preoperatively. Brain awake surgery allows an
      analysis and a precise real-time identification of areas and networks involved in these
      functions through a direct electrical stimulation (inhibitory or activatory). Thus, this
      surgical technique has become a gold standard in surgery of brain lesions located in
      functional areas.

      However, although the brain awake surgery has been practiced since many years, the
      confidentiality of these informations until recent years explains probably that very little
      data to be available on the personal experience of this procedure by patients. Studies that
      have analyzed the perception of the patient or the satisfaction of the patient after surgery
      in awake conditions were retrospective and included few patients. The investigators
      experience of lived of this surgery that the investigators have developed in the
      investigators team since over four years is that on the whole awake surgery is well tolerated
      if adequate explanations are provided preoperatively and if a minimum of preoperative
      precautions are observed.

      Thus, the investigators have decided to develop a preoperative device that could improve
      personal experience and well-being of patients undergoing this surgical approach.
