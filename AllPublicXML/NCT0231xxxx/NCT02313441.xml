  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocyte necrosis occurs frequently in elective percutanious percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) and is associated with subsequent cardiovascular events. This study
      assessed the cardio- and reno-protective effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in
      patients undergoing elective PCI. 200 patients were randomized into 2 groups: 100 patients
      received RIPC (created by three 5-minute inflations of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mm Hg
      around the upper arm, separated by 5-minute intervals of reperfusion) &lt; 2 hours before the
      PCI procedure, and the control group (n = 100).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of PCI- related myocardial infarction (MI 4a) at 24 hours after PCI.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>PCI-related myocardial infarction (MI 4a) was defined as cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) elevation &gt;0.20ng/mL (5 times the upper reference limit) 24 hr. post PCI.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>incidence of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) at 72 hours after contrast exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>CIN was defined as an increase in the serum creatinine level of more than 0.5 mg/dl or more than 25 % from baseline within 3 days after procedure without any other identifiable cause of acute kidney injury.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Chest pain severity during PCI</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Chest pain severity during PCI was graded on a scale of 0 for no pain to 10 for the most severe discomfort ever experienced</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>level of C-reactive protein (CRP)24 hr post PCI</measure>
    <time_frame>24h post procedure</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein level was measured 24 hr. post PCI to assess the inflammatory response .</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>major adverse events (MAE) at 3 month follow up</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Death was defined as &quot;all-cause&quot; death at follow-up. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was defined using standard diagnostic criteria. Heart failure (HF) during follow-up, was defined as either the presence of rales in more than one third of the lung fields that did not clear with coughing or evidence of pulmonary oedema on chest radiograph. Hemodialysis as a complication of acute deterioration of renal function post PCI was also calculated. Only the most serious event of MAE was used to calculate the cumulative MAE per patient according to the following sequence: death&gt;ACS &gt; HF&gt; Hemodialysis.</description>

          -  Elective PCI was defined as any coronary revascularization in a low-risk patient who
             presents to the facility for a planned PCI or for a coronary angiogram followed by ad
             hoc PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) emergency PCI, (2) baseline troponin value â‰¥ 0.04 ng/mL, (3) nicorandil or
             glibenclamide use (preconditioning-mimetic and preconditioning-blocking medication,
             respectively), (4) those who could not give informed consent, and (5) patients with
             severe renal impairment or on regular dialysis.
