  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at creation and validation of a vitreous haze scoring system using
      ultrasonography B-scan of the eye. Images will be obtained from patients with uveitis and
      quantification of inflammation will be done to create the scoring scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with uveitis may present with Vitreous Haze (VH) resulting in obscuration of fundus
      details. VH is composed of cells and protein exudation and results in decrease visual
      acuity.The degree of VH is an important indicator of disease activity, severity and response
      to therapy in patients with uveitis. Color fundus images are commonly used to objectively
      document VH.
