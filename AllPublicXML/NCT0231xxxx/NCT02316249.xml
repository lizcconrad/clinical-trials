      Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a health concern for millions of women worldwide. Patients
      have a variety of symptoms from POP including: vaginal bulging, vaginal pressure,
      constipation and urinary incontinence (1). It is estimated that the lifetime risk of
      undergoing surgery for prolapse or incontinence is 11%. The lifetime risk for recurrence of
      POP after surgery is 10-20% (2). Treatment options for POP include kegel exercises, pessaries
      or surgical management. Due to lifestyle, timing or inability to undergo surgery secondary to
      medical comorbidities the pessary can be a very reasonable alternative to surgical management
      of POP.

      There are two categories of pessaries: support and space occupying. Support pessaries are
      usually recommended for early stage of prolapse with adequate perineal support and include
      the ring pessary, Gehrung, Hodge and Shaatz. While space-occupying pessaries such as the
      Donut, Gellhorn, Cube and Inflataball are used for advanced stage prolapse with less perineal
      support and a wide genital hiatus (3). As the ring and the Gellhorn pessary are the most
      commonly used pessaries and can be inserted for all stages of prolapse, our study will focus
      on the use of the ring with support and the Gellhorn for treatment of POP (4).

      After menopause, estrogen levels decline. This may allow postmenopausal vaginal pH to
      increase to the range of 5.0-7.5. At these higher pH levels, lactobacillus survival is
      hindered, and vaginal colonization by other bacterial species predisposes women to
      symptomatic vaginitis (5). Discontinuation of pessary use is often due to discomfort,
      expulsion, urinary retention bothersome vaginal discharge and vaginal erosion (6). Common
      complications with pessary use are erosions (8.9%), or vaginal infections (2.5%) (7). Some
      studies have shown an erosion rate as high as 21% (6). Patients often complain of vaginal
      discharge with pessary use that is malodorous and bothersome. Local estrogen can help to
      restore the vaginal pH and help reduce vaginal discharge. The moisturizing properties of
      vaginal lubricants and creams may help reduce vaginal erosion in pessary users. We would like
      to compare Estrace ® to a placebo. The placebo will be the hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
      base cream in Estrace ® without the estradiol.

      No randomized control trials (RCT) have been performed showing if application of local
      hormone (Estrace) is superior to application of local nonhormonal vaginal cream for reduction
      of the bothersome symptom of vaginal discharge and subsequently erosion. We would like to
      compare vaginal estrogen against placebo as a mechanism to prevent bothersome discharge and
      prevention of vaginal erosion in women fitted with pessaries for pelvic organ prolapse.

      Study Population In general, the study population will be patients of the Urogynecology
      practice of North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System who present to the clinic for their
      initial pessary fitting. Patients will be fitted with either a ring with support or Gellhorn
      pessary and will return at intervals of 2, 6 and 12 weeks for follow up.

      All subjects over 18 yrs of age will be screened for eligibility relative to the patient
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. If a patient is eligible to enroll in the study, the nature
      and purpose of the study will be explained to the subject with a witness present. The subject
      will review and sign the written Informed Consent Form indicating informed and voluntary
      participation in the study. A copy of the consent form including all risks and benefits to
      the research subjects is attached as a separate document.

      Recruitment for the study will be done via direct contact from our patient population. If a
      subject is found to be eligible to participate, an approved study investigator will approach
      her during her scheduled initial pessary visit. No form of advertisement will be used. The
      recruitment methods used will provide equitable selection of subjects.

      After determination of eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria the patient will be
      consented for the study related procedures. The subject must consent to participate and sign
      the specific Institutional Review Board approved Informed Consent Form prior to the conduct
      of the study specific procedure. Patient may be consented in the clinic for the department of
      urogynecology.

      New patients who present for their initial pessary fitting will have the appropriate sized
      ring with support or Gellhorn pessary placed as per standard of care. The patient will return
      for her 2 week follow up visit as per standard of care.

      If no change in pessary is indicated the patient will be approached for participation in the
      study. If she agrees to participate, she will be randomized to use estrogen cream (Estrace)
      or placebo stratified on type of pessary.

      Estrace contains 0.1 mg estradiol per gram of cream. The recommended dosing is 2-4 grams
      daily for 1-2 weeks with a gradual reduction to half the initial dose over 1-2 weeks, and
      then 1 gram 1-3 times weekly for maintenance.

      Participants will be provided with the medication in prepackaged 0.5cc syringe. Either
      digitally or by using the syringe, she will then place 1cm distal to the introitus. This
      technique will be reviewed with the participant and she will also have to demonstrate correct
      application. She will use the cream nightly for 1 week then reduce the dose to 2 times weekly
      for maintenance. Participants will use the cream nightly for 1 week then twice weekly at
      night.

      The patient will be given a 3 month supply of the vaginal cream that she is randomized to. We
      will preload syringes with 0.5cc of either estrace or placebo cream. These will be randomized
      by a non-blinded study personnel.

      Study participants will return for follow-up appointments at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 6
      months. Participants will also be expected to return all syringes that she has used prior to
      the scheduled visit. This will aid in our assessment of patient compliance with suggested use
      of medication and also ensure that correct disposal of the vaginal cream.

      As per standard of care, a vaginal culture will be obtained at any visit if the patient
      complains of a bothersome, malodorous discharge. In addition to the vaginal culture, patients
      who report a malodorous discharge will undergo saline irrigation at time of visit and
      examination of vaginal tissue for erosion. If no vaginal erosion present the pessary will be
      replaced and the patient will be instructed to continue the previously prescribed regimen of
      3 times weekly application of vaginal cream. If vaginal erosion is noted, the pessary will be
      left out for 3 weeks and the patient will be instructed to use the vaginal cream daily for 3
      weeks. The patient will then return to the office after 3 weeks for a vaginal exam and
      replacement of pessary upon resolution of vaginal erosion.

      We will assess for atrophy, erosion, vaginal discharge and obtain a vaginal culture if
      clinically applicable. Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, 12 week and 6 month
      follow-up visits and include: Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI), Pelvic Floor Impact
      Questionnaire (PFIQ). We will assess patient satisfaction for use of pessary at each
      follow-up using a Liekhart scale. Patients with bothersome vaginal discharge will use a VAS
      scale with a rating of with a 10cm linear continuum in which 0 represents very bothersome and
      10 represents not at all bothersome. Vaginal erosion will be clinically described as minimal,
      moderate or severe.

      This research may not benefit study participants directly. However, knowledge gained from
      this study may help physicians and patients in the future with regard to the best treatment
      to reduce vaginal discharge and vaginal erosion in pessary users.

      Potential risks for this study outside of the risks associated with pessary use are minimal.
      Complications with pessary use include: vaginal erosion, urinary retention, urinary
      incontinence and discomfort. These complications will be reviewed with the patient prior to
      insertion of pessary. Potential risks encountered when using vaginal estrogen are low.
      Estrace contains 0.1 mg estradiol per gram of cream. The recommended dosing is 2-4 g daily
      for 1-2 weeks, a gradual reduction to half the initial dose over 1-2 weeks, and then 1 g 1-3
      times weekly for maintenance. Our patients will be using half the recommended daily dose for
      maintenance and at the most, 1/4th the recommended dose for priming the atrophic tissue.

      We are also reducing an additional minimal risk associated with local vaginal estrogen in our
      exclusion criteria.

      If a participant reports that she has not used the cream or has returned the syringes unused,
      she will be removed from the study for lack of compliance. Study participants will also be
      removed from the study if they develop or have a new diagnosis of any conditions that are
      listed in the exclusion criteria. Finally, they will be removed if any allergic
      reactions/adverse events occur from the use of Estrace or placebo. There will be no
      replacement procedure for study participants if they are withdrawn. No actions will follow or
      are warranted after study participant removal.

      This is a double-blinded randomized control trial of subjects with pelvic organ prolapse who,
      after counseling at their initial visit, opt for treatment with a vaginal pessary. Patients
      who have a Gellhorn or Ring with support pessary placed with then be randomized to one of two
      arms for application of a local vaginal cream: estrogen or placebo. The object of the study
      is to compare the incidence of vaginal discharge and vaginal erosion in each study arm. We
      will also compare subjective measures including quality of life and satisfaction with their
      treatment plan.

      Our Primary Objective is to compare the use of Estrace® or placebo in reducing symptomatic
      vaginal discharge and vaginal erosion in patients using Gellhorn or Ring pessaries.

      Prior to randomization subjects will be stratified according to type of pessary (Gellhorn or
      Ring). Within a stratum, subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to Estrace® or
      placebo.

      The Biostatistics Unit will develop a computer-generated randomization list that utilizes a
      permuted block design, and will develop and implement a well documented double-blind
      randomization procedure.

      Intention-to-treat (ITT):

      Data collected will be analyzed according to the ITT principle. The ITT population will be
      all patients randomized, regardless of whether or not the study cream was applied. All
      patients will be analyzed in the group to which they were randomized (even if they are
      switched over to another cream.)

      Patients will be assessed for study data at baseline (once the pessary is placed
      successfully, week 0), 6, 12, and 24 weeks.

      Descriptive statistics (means ± standard deviations or medians and interquartile range [25th
      percentile, 75th percentile] for continuous data; frequencies and percentages for categorical
      data) will be calculated for subjects on demographic and clinical characteristics as well as
      outcomes observed at the end of the trial.

      The two groups will be compared for categorical variables using the chi-square test or
      Fisher's exact test, as deemed appropriate. The two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney test will
      be used to compare the two groups for continuous data.

      Separate repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) models using a mixed models
      approach will be used to compare the two treatment arms with respect to their vaginal
      discharge, POP-Q staging , PFDI, and PFIQ trajectories from baseline to 24 weeks. Each model
      will include the main effects of treatment arm (Estrace® or placebo) and time (0, 12, and 24
      weeks), as well as the treatment x time interaction. If an interaction between group and time
      is not found to be statistically significant, only the main effects of treatment group and
      time will be analyzed. For all analyses, the standard assumptions of Gaussian residuals and
      quality of variance will be tested. If the standard assumptions are not met, a transformation
      will be performed.

      A result will be considered statistically significant at the p&lt;0.05 level of significance.
      All analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

      The proposed sample size for this double-blind randomized control trial is n=246 subjects
      (n=123 per arm).

      Based on data published by Manchana , 21% of symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse patients
      fitted successfully with a pessary had vaginal erosion. Let us assume a 60% reduction from
      this estimate (21% to 8.4%) after using Estrace®. A two group χ2 test with a 0.05 two-sided
      significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a vaginal erosion
      rate for the placebo group = 0.21 and a vaginal erosion rate of the Estrace® group = 0.084
      when the sample size in each group is 123.

      Our study limitations are that our primary outcome is a subjective assessment of vaginal
      discharge and vaginal erosion. Our population is an older, postmenopausal population and
      therefore may be more susceptible to vaginal erosion. Patient compliance to use of the
      vaginal cream 2 times weekly is also another limitation as this is a patient directed cannot
      be controlled, however we will try to reduce this limitation by requiring that patients bring
      their used syringes back to the office.

      The PI will monitor data, with emphasis on data integrity and patient welfare concerns
      including: recommendations concerning continuation or conclusion of the study, protection of
      the confidentiality of the trial data and the results of monitoring, review of data and study
      quality.

      Any adverse events, unanticipated problems, and protocol deviations will be reported to the
      Institutional Review Board as per North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System policy.

      Confidentiality will be maintained by using patient identification numbers instead of names.
      Original documents including consent forms that contain subjects' PHI, as well as
      questionnaires, will be stored in a locked cabinet within the office of Urogynecology, 865
      Northern Blvd., Suite 202, Great Neck, New York 11021. These documents will be kept
      separately from any de-identified research data that will be stored electronically as
      mentioned below. Institutional Review Board approved investigators will be the only
      individuals with access to research data that contains PHI. Any documents that contain
      subjects' PHI will be accessible on the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System network
      server through a password protected computer document/database. These documents are separated
      from any de-identified research data files. Institutional Review Board approved investigators
      will be the only individuals with access to research data that contains PHI. De-identified
      data research files will be stored on the network server.
