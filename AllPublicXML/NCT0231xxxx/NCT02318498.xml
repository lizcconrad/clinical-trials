  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocardial infarction with angiographically normal coronary arteries (MINCA) is common (7-8 %
      of all myocardial infarctions). There are several different causes behind MINCA where &quot;true
      infarction&quot; due to thromboembolism, myocarditis or Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy are the
      main findings. The underlying diagnosis is often made by clinical findings sometimes with the
      help of cardiac MRI (CMR). Investigators have previously shown that it was possible to give
      50 % of the patients a diagnosis made by the combination of clinical findings and CMR made in
      median 12 days after the acute event. The present study aim at improve the diagnostic
      accuracy by an early CMR with latest technique.

      The present study aim at improve the diagnostic accuracy in MINCA with an CMR made 2-4 days
      after the acute event. The aim is to give 70 % of all patients with MINCA (35-70 years old) a
      definitive diagnosis made by CMR only. One-hundred and fifty patients will be included and
      compared with a similar historical sample where 50 % of the patients received a diagnosis
      made by a late CMR and clinical findings. The study has 80 % power to detect this 20 %
      absolute difference (p &lt;0.05).
