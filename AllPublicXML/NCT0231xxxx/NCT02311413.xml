      The goal of this study is to identify changes in cells that are related to the treatment with
      Cat-PAD (ToleroMune Cat).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cat-PAD is an experimental cat allergy vaccine and has been studied to determine if it can
      reduce symptom scores of participants exposed to cat allergen. To study how the vaccine
      causes changes in the immune system, the researchers plan to evaluate changes in the blood
      (genes and proteins) and urine in response to the Cat-PAD vaccine.

             the subject's ability to participate in the study;

          -  Past or current medical problems or findings from physical examination or laboratory
             testing that are not listed above, which, in the opinion of the investigator, may pose
