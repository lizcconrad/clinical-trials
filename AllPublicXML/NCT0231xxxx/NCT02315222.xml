      Introduction The beneficial effect of vitamins and dietary supplements on oral wound healing
      has been recently reported in clinical trials (for review see Van der Valden, JCP 2011). In
      periodontal tissue, the imbalanced ratio between virulence of pathogens bacteria and
      proportionate host response induce a destructive process of periodontal ligament, cementum
      and alveolar bone. The importance of micronutrients including vitamins, calcium and
      antioxidant for periodontal health was reported in several clinical studies and the
      integration between traditional (non surgical and surgical interventions) and
      micronutritional approaches were proposed for treatment of periodontitis (Van der Velden et
      al. 2011).

      Clinical trials reported that daily supplement of fruit, vegetable and berry juice powder,
      vitamin D, Calcium seems to improve periodontal health in patients with chronic periodontitis
      that were treated with non-surgical or surgical periodontal therapy or were in maintenance
      program (Chapple et al 2012, Garcia et al 2011, Miley et al 2009, Bashutski et al. 2011).
      However, the beneficial effects of micronutrients on periodontal health and healing need to
      be more deeply investigated. Furthermore, a dietary supplement specifically formulated for
      periodontal health needs to be tested.

      Regenium is a dietary supplement with Q-TER (coenzyme q10 terclatrate), DHA Omega 3,
      Boswellia serrata, Vitamins and mineral salts that was formulated to improve the collagen
      formation and the maintenance of the health of oral mucosa. Q-TER plays a key role in the ATP
      synthesis and energetic metabolism, and has a strong antioxidant function. A recent study
      also reported the function of Q-10 as inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation (Moon et al.
      2012). DHA Omega 3 (Resolvine) has an important antioxidant function, affecting the cellular
      aging and moderates the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. Boswellia serrata showed beneficial
      effects on wound healing and contraction (Mallik et al. 2010). This micronutrient reduces the
      synthesis of leukotrienes in intact neutrophils by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, the key enzyme
      involved in the biosynthesis of leukotrienes and in the inflammatory process.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate if patients affected by severe periodontal
      disease and treated with periodontal non-surgical therapy benefit from dietary supplements
      (Regenium). It will be assessed the effect of Regenium on clinical parameters of periodontal
      wound healing and on systemic inflammation related to periodontal disease.

        1. Experimental procedure

           1.1 Study population A total of 60 patients afflicted with severe periodontal disease
           and that need for non-surgical periodontal therapy will be enrolled.

           Inclusion criteria

             -  severe periodontal disease: at least 2 sites with Probing Pocket Depth (PPD)&gt;7mm,
                Bleeding On Probing (BOP)&gt; 25%

             -  Age between 18 and 65 years

             -  Signed informed consent

           Exclusion criteria:

             -  Systemic diseases that may affect periodontal status

             -  Metabolic disorders

             -  Nutritional conditions that may alter the formation and maturation of connective
                tissue

             -  Pregnancy or lactation

           1.2 Subject protection Informed consent will be obtained from all subjects to be entered
           in the study. In obtaining the informed consent and in the conduct of the study the
           principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki on experimentation involving human
           subjects should be adhered to. At each visit, the clinician will evaluate patients for
           any untoward effects. In case a patient requires any treatment during the course of the
           study, the necessary treatment will be provided at the discretion of the clinician and
           according to the current standard of care.

           1.3 Treatment After including patient in the study, each patient will be randomly
           assigned to one of the experimental groups (test, control). At T0 clinical measurements
           will be harvested, saliva samples will be collected and serum analysis will be
           performed. Furthermore each patient will receive oral hygiene instructions and regular
           professional supragingival debridement. Therapy with Regenium or placebo will be given
           to the patient and will start at T0.

           Four weeks after starting the therapy (T1), clinical measurements and saliva samples
           will be harvested and serum analysis will be performed. After measurements the one-stage
           full-mouth disinfection will be performed as following described. Scaling and root
           planing of all pockets will be performed within 24 h in combination with an extensive
           application of chlorhexidine (0.20%) to all intra-oral niches such (periodontal pockets,
           tongue dorsum, tonsils) and in combination with systemic antibiotic treatment
           (amoxicillin cp. 1gr 2/die + 250 mg metronidazole 3/die).

           To resume patients will intake Ragenium or placebo for 3 months (from 1 months before
           and until 2 months after non surgical periodontal therapy), each patient will intake one
           pill of Regenium Tablet in the morning (with breakfast) and one capsule of Regenium
           Capsule in the evening (with dinner). Patients assigned to the control group (n=30) will
           intake placebo tablets and capsules as prescribed in the test group. Compliance will be
           evaluated by pill counting at the end of the study.

           Three months after therapy with Regenium or placebo (T2), clinical measurements and
           saliva samples will be harvested and serum analysis will be performed.

           Treatment assignment To enter a patient into the study each investigator will fill in a
           screening and an entry form and fax them to the Central Registrar located at the
           Clinical Research support Unit of Periodontology, Dental Clinic, Dep. of Biological,
           Surgical and Dental Sciences, University of Milan, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda
           Polyclinic Milan, Italy. Following receipt of these forms, the Registrar will proceed to
           verify satisfaction of all entry criteria and will enter the subject into the study.
           Patient codes will be assigned consecutively and will be made of a total of 2 digits
           that will encode the subject number (from 01 to 60). These will be assigned at the first
           visit, verifying the inclusion criteria and entering the patient into the study. After
           having been entered patients into the study, experimental patients will be randomly
           assigned by Central Registrar to one of the two treatment regimens according to
           pre-defined randomization tables.

           A balanced random permuted block approach will be used to prepare the randomization
           tables in order to avoid unequal balance between 2 treatments. In order to reduce the
           chance of unfavorable splits between test and control patients in terms of key
           prognostic factors, the randomization process will take into account the following
           variable: smoke. Treatment assignment will be noted in the registration and treatment
           assignment form that will be kept by the central registrar. To conceal assignment from
           the investigator until the time, at the end of the non-surgical periodontal therapy the
           central registrar will instruct the investigator to assign a sealed envelope containing
           the treatment for each patient, every envelop is endowed of a Treatment's Code, composed
           by a letter (that corresponds to the clinical center) and two numbers.

           When a patient enters in the study the investigator assigned him a sequential Patient's
           Code, than the clinician sends Screening Form and Entry Form to the study registrar. The
           central registrar will match the randomization envelope with the subject number based on
           the randomization tables and he send the Registration Form, with the correspondence
           between Patient's Code and Treatment's Code. Following receipt of the registration form
           from the Central Registrar, the investigator will prescribe the treatment (Regenium or
           placebo) to the patient and will book all the subsequent appointments according to the
           protocol.

        2. Measurements Clinical measurements To evaluate the inflammatory status, plaque control
           and severity of periodontal disease, clinical measurements will be taken at T0
           (immediately before starting with dietary supplements or placebo), at T1 (4 weeks after
           starting supplementation) and at the last day of supplementation (T2= 3 months after
           T0).

      The following clinical parameters will be taken:

        -  Full Mouth Plaque Score (FMPS), Full Mouth Bleeding Score (FMBS)

        -  Periodontal Pocket Depth (PPD), Clinical Attachment Level (CAL), tooth mobility.

      All clinical measurements will be taken by a blind calibrated examiner.

      Radiographic evaluations An X-Ray status with a parallel technique will be taken at the
      baseline during the diagnostic process of periodontal disease.

      Serum analysis

      Blood test will be performed at T0, T1 and T2 in all patients to evaluate the systemic
      inflammation and to assess changes on this condition after periodontal treatment and dietary
      supplements intake. The following blood markers of systemic inflammation will be evaluated
      (Graziani et al. 2010):

        -  High sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP)

        -  D-dimers and renal function (cystatin C)

      Whole Saliva Collection Unstimulated whole saliva will be collected from each subject at the
      beginning of the appointment, as previously described by Ramseier et al. Subjects' will
      vigorously rinsed their mouth with tap water for 20 seconds in order to remove gross debris.
      The subject then expectorates the water. Following a waiting period of 2 minutes, subjects
      will tip their head over the graduated test tube and passively expectorated whole saliva into
      the plastic funnel placed inside the plastic tube (Mandel et al. 1976). Each tube will be
      labeled with the subject's initials, harvest date and sample name. The collection will be
      completed once 2mL of whole saliva is collected, or a maximum of 15 minutes of sampling time
      is reached. The sample will then immediately placed on ice, supplemented with a proteinase
      inhibitor combination of 1% aprotinin (1mg/ml) and 0.5% phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF)
      (200mM in MeOH) (Sigma Chemical Company, St-Louis, MO), and aliquotted prior to storage at
      -20°C until analysis.

      Salivary Biomarkers Analysis Inflammatory biomarkers expression will be quantified using a
      custom human cytokine protein array|| for the evaluation of matrix metalloproteinase-8 and -9
      (MMPs-8 and -9).

      Upon receipt, the Quantibody® Array kits will be stored at -20°C. Prior to each assay, whole
      saliva samples will be thawed at room temperature and microcentrifuged for 5 minutes to
      obtain a cell-free supernatant for analysis.

      Each slide containing cytokine standards used for making known serial dilutions, with sample
      diluent serving as the negative control, and experimental samples will then be incubated
      overnight at 4°C followed by washing unbound materials. The detection antibody will then
      bound to the antigens within each well. Cy3 equivalent dye-conjugated streptavidin will be
      pipetted in each well, which binds to the detection antibody associated with immune
      complexes. The slides will be incubated and covered with aluminum foil to avoid light
      exposure and the fluorescence from each well was detected using a laser scanner.¶ The
      resultant signals of the samples will be compared to the standard curve for each of the
      cytokines in order to determine the concentrations of each cytokine within the samples. Data
      will be extracted and analyzed using microarray analysis software.#

      Compliance and its evaluation Compliance is a serious problem for clinical trials, to improve
      this fundamental aspect of the study, the clinicians will adopt some useful technique.

      Every patient will be instructed to download on his smartphone an application that will
      remind him to take Regenium in the morning and in the evening; secondly the clinician will
      call the patients two weeks after T0 and two and five weeks after T1, with the pretext to
      remind the next appointment and to have information about their oral health, but with the
      real intention to remember and to verify the regular assumption of Regenium. Lastly, at T2,
      patients will have to bring back the blister, also the empty ones, for the pill counting.

      It is important not to say the patients about the pill count, in order to avoid the risk of
      bias created by patient who throw away the remaining pill the day before the control. To have
      the blister back, clinicians will say the patients to return blister for wasting reasons, for
      both package and pills.
