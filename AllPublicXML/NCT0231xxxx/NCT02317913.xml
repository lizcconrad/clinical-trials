      To investigate the epidemiological pictures of Kawasaki disease (KD) in Shanghai from 2008
      through 2012, and illustrate the risk factors of coronary arterial lesions .
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A questionnaire form and diagnostic guidelines for KD will be sent to 50 hospitals providing
      pediatric medical care in Shanghai, China. All patients with KD diagnosed during January 2008
      through December 2012 will be recruited and analyzed. Distribution of age at onset and
      seasonal features of disease incidence wil be described. Univariate and multivariate
      association analyses will be performed to identify risk factors to Coronary arterial lesions
      (CAL) defined as ectasia or aneurysm by using multivariate logistic regression model.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The 5th revised edition of diagnostic criteria for KD, issued by the Japan Kawasaki
             Disease Research Committee at the 7th International Kawasaki Disease Symposium in
             2002, was adopted. Cases were included in the study if the patients had at least five
             of the following six clinical manifestations or at least four signs together with
             coronary abnormalities documented by echocardiography or coronary angiography:

               1. fever persisting 5 days or longer (inclusive of those cases in whom the fever has
                  subsided before the 5th day in response to therapy)

               2. bilateral conjunctival congestion

               3. changes of lips and oral cavity, such as reddening of lips, strawberry tongue,
                  diffuse congestion of oral and pharyngeal mucosa

               4. polymorphous exanthema

               5. changes of peripheral extremities, such as reddening of palms and soles,
                  indurative edema at initial stage, or membranous desquamation from fingertips at
                  convalescent stage

               6. acute nonpurulent cervical lymphadenopathy. In addition, the cases of incomplete
                  KD, diagnosed with referring to the guidelines for incomplete KD made by American
                  Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Heart Association (AHA) in 2004, were
                  also included in this investigation

                  Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The cases were not in accordance with the recruited criteria
