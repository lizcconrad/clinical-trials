      The purpose of this study is to determine whether early mobilization after Achilles tendon
      rupture can speed up healing and improve patient outcome.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients with acute Achilles tendon rupture will be screened for eligibility at the
      Karolinska University Hospital and Södersjukhuset, Stockholm.

      One hundred-fifty patients will be included and enrolled and assigned to the interventions
      either by a third party nurse or by a research nurse. Randomisation will be performed with
      use of computer-generated random numbers in permuted blocks of four, through an independent
      software specialist, and consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes opened after
      surgery and prior to treatment.

      The patients will be randomized to undergo either treatment as usual using plaster cast
      treatment alone or direct post-operative functional mobilization with a weight-bearing
      orthosis with adjustable range of motion of the ankle.

      The endpoint of the first part of the study is tendon healing quantified at 2 weeks by
      microdialysis followed by quantification of markers for tendon repair.

      The sample size for the outcome in the microdialysis study was calculated on a difference of
      the glutamate metabolite of 12 µM between the two groups. For this power analysis, we used a
      glutamate standard difference of 15 µM resulting from a previous study. It was determined
      that a sample size of 25 patients per group would be necessary to detect the glutamate
      difference with 80% power when alpha was set equal to 5%. Anticipating that we would lose 10%
      of participants enrolled, we plan to enroll 27 patients in each group for microdialysis.
