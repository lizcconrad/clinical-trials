      The study was conducted as an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-period,
      two-sequence, single-dose, crossover, bioequivalence study comparing Minocycline
      hydrochloride extended release tablets 135 mg manufactured by OHM Laboratories Inc. with
      SolodynTM extended release tablets 135 mg manufactured by AAI Pharma, Inc Wilmington, NC

      Test for drugs of abuse (opiates and cannabinoids) in urine and breath test for alcohol were
      carried out prior to admission in each period of the study. Following an overnight fast of at
      least 10 hour, a high-fat high-calorie breakfast was served to the study subjects.

      Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of minocycline hydrochloride
      extended release tablet 135 mg of either test or reference investigational product was
      administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at ambient
      temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study personnel.

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.
