  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies have proposed the use of zirconia abutments to improve the aesthetic
      outcomes in the anterior sextant, however the results have been inconclusive. A tendency
      towards a better aesthetic result with the use of zirconia instead of titanium abutments was
      observed, although more technical complications were also recorded.The use of zirconia
      abutments in the anterior maxillary region showed a tendency towards better matching,
      although differences were not significant. In addition, with these abutments more technical
      complications were observed, what increased the cost and time. More studies with larger
      samples and longer observations periods are needed to recommend the use of zirconia abutments
      for this clinical situation

      The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and aesthetic outcomes of
      single tooth implant restorations, where different abutment materials were used (zirconia vs
      titanium) associated with metal-ceramic crowns. The evaluation was carried out by means of an
      aesthetic composite index combined with patient evaluation

    <description>the following parameters were assessed by means of standardized photographs: contour of the labial surface of the mucosa and its colour; when compared to the adjacent teeth , penalty points were assigned ( 0 = excellent; 1 or 2 = satisfactory; 3 or 4 = moderate; 5 ore more, poor).</description>

    <measure>change from baseline in crestal bone levels</measure>
    <time_frame>one month and one year after placing the definitive crown</time_frame>
    <description>in standardized intraoral radiographs the the following measurements were carried out : vertical distance from implant shoulder to the most coronal bone in contact with the implant at mesial and distal site; horizontal distance from the implant shoulder to the adjacent teeth at mesial and distal sites; vertical distance ( parallel to the implant long axis) from the contact point to the bone crest at mesial and distal sides</description>
