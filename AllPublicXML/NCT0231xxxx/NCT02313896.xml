  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2 year research study to study if post discharge phone calls can help lengthen time
      to hospital readmissions for patients with encephalopathy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized prospective pilot study is to decrease hospital readmissions
      for patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Patients who were admitted at YNHH with hepatic
      encephalopathy will be enrolled. Patients will then be randomized to one of two groups upon
      discharge. The control group will receive usual standard of care for hepatic encephalopathy
      (encephalopathy education, cirrhosis brochure, stool chart, and routine follow up with their
      primary care provider and hepatologist). The intervention group will receive usual standard
      of care as discussed above and phone calls for a 3-month period after their hospitalization.

    <description>On discharge, patients will receive an information package about cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. In addition to regular visits with the doctor, they will receive phone calls from one of our research providers who will be a nurse practitioner, doctor, or physician assistant. In the first 2 weeks after discharge, they will receive phone calls every other day. For the following 10 weeks, they will receive phone calls once a week.</description>
