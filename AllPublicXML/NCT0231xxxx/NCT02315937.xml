  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Spinal anesthesia is a safe, frequently used anesthetic technique. The main side
      effect of spinal anesthesia is hypotension, occuring in up to 85 % of selected cases. This
      hypotension is often treated with fluid infusion. However, especially in elderly patients,
      high volume fluid infusion can lead to fluid overload.

      The effects of spinal anesthesia on preload and fluid responsiveness are not exactly known.
      Hence, therapy for hypotension after spinal anesthesia might not be adequate. With
      transthoracic echocardiography, vena cava inferior diameter and collapsibility can be used to
      monitor fluid responsiveness and guide fluid management.

      Objective: This study has two main objectives. The first is to explore the effects of spinal
      anesthesia on hemodynamic parameters of fluid status, especially vena cava inferior diameter
      and collapsibility. The second goal is to test the interrater variability transthoracic
      echocardiography exams when performed by (trained) anesthesiologists.

      Furthermore, the correlation between vena cava inferior collapsibility and the occurence and
      degree of hypotension (defined as a decrease from baseline of &gt;20% or a systolic pressure &lt;
      90 mmHg) after spinal anesthesia will be explored.
