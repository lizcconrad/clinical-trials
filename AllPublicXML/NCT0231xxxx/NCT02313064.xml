    <textblock>
      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with the oral formulation of CXA-10. The main
      purpose of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      CXA-10 and its metabolite(s) administered as single ascending oral doses to healthy
      volunteers (Part A). The effects of food on the PK of CXA-10 will also be investigated (Part
      B).

      This will be the first-in-human (FIH) study with oral formulation of CXA-10. The main purpose
      of this trial is to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of CXA-10
      and its metabolite(s) administered as single ascending oral doses to healthy volunteers (Part
      A). The effects of food on the PK of CXA-10 will also be investigated (Part B). Part A of the
      study will be a single-center, randomized, double-blind, third party open (sponsor)
      placebo-controlled study. Sequential single ascending doses will be administered in up to 5
      cohorts of subjects. Each cohort of subjects will be randomized to receive a single dose of
      CXA-10 or placebo in, a fasted state, as illustrated in the table below. Part B of the study
      will be a single-center, open-label, two-period study conducted in two cohorts of subjects as
      follows. The selected dose and the interval between Period 1 and Period 2 will be determined
      based on emerging PK data from Part A. The selected dose will be an intermediate dose level
      to avoid a food effect interaction that markedly enhances exposure. Subjects who participate
      in Part B of the study will receive two doses of CXA-10.

             Subjects with any other clinically relevant ECG parameter abnormality (e.g., PR
             interval, QRS deviation) or any clinically significant ECG abnormality will be
             excluded from the study. Subjects with a history of congenital long QT syndrome or in
             the subject's family will be excluded from the study (see Section 6.4)

             volunteer unsuitable for participation in the study

          5. Any clinical history of cardiovascular events, arrhythmias, fainting, palpitations,
             personal or family history of congenital prolonged QT syndromes or sudden unexpected

             or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) must be avoided within 7 days prior
             to the first dose and during this study as it will interfere with the pharmacology of
             CXA-10. Use of high energy supplements or drinks (especially, those containing
