      Compare lesion detection of the automated breast ultrasound (ABVS) exam with the conventional
      handheld (HH) breast ultrasound (US) exam.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to test a FDA-approved automated breast ultrasound (ABVS) machine in
      subjects recommended for an ultrasound of the breast. The main purpose of the study is to
      compare images obtained from the automated breast ultrasound exam with the standard physician
      performed handheld breast ultrasound exam for lesion detection equivalence.

      Each subject will have a bilateral hand-held breast ultrasound and a bilateral automated
      breast ultrasound, both exams preferably done on the same day. The hand-held ultrasound will
      be performed by a breast imaging physician participating in the study and the automated
      ultrasound exam will be performed by a sonographer.

      There is no radiation risk from ultrasound. The physician performing the handheld breast
      ultrasound is blinded to the study, will not know the subject's history, but only the reason
      for the breast ultrasound exam.

      The automated scan requires gentle pressure on the breast during a scan. Three basic views
      will be acquired for each breast, each scan lasting approximately one minute. Once all
      necessary views are acquired, the images will be sent to a remote workstation, where a second
      radiologist, also blinded to the results of the handheld study, will interpret the automated
      ultrasound.

      Once all images and patient information are gathered, the study radiologists will review the
      previous images, if available, to provide the final result that will determine clinical
      management. Therefore, it is possible that the hand-held or automated ultrasound scan will
      lead to further evaluation of the breast and possibly a biopsy.
