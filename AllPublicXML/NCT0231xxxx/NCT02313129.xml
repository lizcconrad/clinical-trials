      The purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of infertility in women with
      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). In this study the study team will compare the differences in
      ovarian reserve (the ability to provide egg cells that are capable of fertilization), the
      frequency of ovulation and the number of pregnancies between women with and without RA. It is
      possible that RA activity and medications limit ovarian reserve and ovulation, which may
      increase infertility among women with RA. There are several suspected causes for infertility
      in RA, including age-related fertility decline, inflammatory changes that impact endometrial
      receptivity and discourage implantation, accelerated ovarian decline due to certain arthritis
      medications and increased frequency of anovulation (a menstrual cycle during which ovaries do
      not release an egg) due to RA activity.

      This study is the first step toward our long term goal of increasing the ability of all women
      with RA to build the family they desire.
