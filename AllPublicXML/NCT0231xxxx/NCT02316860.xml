  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study the investigators evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of passive
      tilt test in athletes, as well as their haemodynamic responses and autonomic nervous system
      activity during head-up tilt. Moreover, the investigators try to apply a novel algorithm for
      the improvement of diagnostic yield of tilt test in athletes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We examine athletes with a history of reflex syncope and athletes without history of reflex
      syncope.All subjects undergo a tilt test, for the evaluation of haemodynamics, heart rate
      variability (HRV) and baroreflex sensitivity.

    <description>Passive tilt test (without pharmacological provocation). After a horizontal supine rest period of 5 min, the tilt table was inclined at 60Â° head-up position for 30 min. A positive response was defined according to the European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope</description>
