    <textblock>
      This study is a feasibility study of the Nucleus 24 ABI in children without NF2. It will be
      conducted as a repeated-measures, single subject experiment in order to accommodate the known
      variability in cochlear implant clinical results. Data obtained in the course of this study
      will be compared with the existing published outcome data from children with normal hearing
      and with cochlear implants (CIs). These comparisons may provide additional useful information
      about the progress of ABI subjects' performance over time. Also, this may allow the results
      of the current study to be utilized to design future pivotal studies of the device in the
      pediatric population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of the Nucleus™ 24
      Auditory Brainstem Implant (ABI) in pediatric patients who do not have Neurofibromatosis Type
      2 (NF2); specifically, children with total hearing loss due to severe cochlear anomalies,
      cochlear nerve disorders or failed cochlear implantation. These conditions can include:
      developmental or acquired cochlear nerve deficiency (CND), cochlear aplasia, post-meningitis
      cochlear ossification, or cochlear malformation. This study proposes to implant up to 10
      pre-linguistic young children (18 mos to 5 yrs. of age) and up to 10 post-linguistic children
      (&lt;21 yrs of age) with the Nucleus 24 Multichannel ABI in an attempt to demonstrate safety of
      the surgical procedure and device stimulation and the potential for auditory benefit beyond
      that experienced with a CI. These children would not qualify for the Nucleus ABI device, as
      their etiology is not an approved indication such as neurofibromatosis Type 2(NF2). Further,
      these children do not benefit from conventional hearing aids or cochlear implants.

      Two groups of children will be included: Group 1 will include prelingiustic deaf children
      ages 18 months - 5 years and Group 2 will include postlinguistic deaf children &lt; 21 years of
      age. Post-operative evaluations will be conducted at the initial activation and at 1, 3, 6,
      12, 18, 24, 30, and 36-month intervals post-activation in order to demonstrate the emergence
      of open-set speech perception abilities prior to study cessation. Experience in the CI
      literature has shown that a minimum of 2 years of device usage is required for children with
      pre-lingual hearing impairment to develop some open-set speech perception abilities. While
      Group 2 is post-linguistic and some may have had significant hearing prior to becoming deaf,
      the same time intervals will be used for consistency. Blinding or masking procedures are not
      included in the design, as the presence/absence of a brainstem implant cannot be easily
      concealed from the device recipients and/or clinical investigators.

Adverse events will be tracked on a case-by-case basis and recorded at the time of occurrence and followed up at resolution. Any adverse events will be reported to the NYUSOM IRB. Should there be concern for the safety of the subjects because of their participation in the study by the investigators or the IRB, the study would be halted at least temporarily and a detailed discussion with the investigators and the IRB would be undertaken.</description>

          -  Post-linguistic hearing loss (&lt;21 yrs. of age) with:

               -  Loss or lack of benefit from appropriate CI without the possibility for revision
                  or contralateral implantation. Examples might include:

          -  No medical contraindications

          -  Willing to receive the appropriate meningitis vaccinations

               -  of parental role in rehabilitation

               -  that the child may not develop spoken language as a primary communication mode or
                  even sufficient spoken language to make significant academic progress in an
                  aural/oral environment

          -  Involvement in a rehabilitation program that emphasizes development of auditory skills
             with or without the use of supplementary visual communication.

          -  Able to comply with study requirements including travel to investigation sites.

          -  Informed consent for the procedure from the child's parents/legal guardian.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For both Groups 1 and 2:

          -  Pre- or post-linguistic child currently making significant progress with CI Even for
             the very young children (18 months of age with 6 months of use), nearly all children
             with a good auditory signal from their CI will show evidence of improvement in these
             metrics over time.

          -  MRI evidence of one of the following:

               -  normal cochlea and cochlear nerves or NF2

               -  brainstem or cortical anomaly that makes implantation unfeasible

          -  Clear surgical reason for poor CI performance that can be remediated with revision CI
             or contralateral surgery rather than ABI.

          -  Intractable seizures or progressive, deteriorating neurological disorder

          -  Patients with evidence of Chiari malformation, hydrocephalus, spina bifid a

          -  Patients with any foreseeable need for a future MRI scan

          -  Unable to participate in behavioral testing and mapping with their CI. If this appears
             to be an age effect, ABI will be delayed until we can be assured that the child will
             be able to participate, as reliable objective measures of mapping are currently not
             available for mapping these devices.

          -  Unable to tolerate general anesthesia (cardiac, pulmonary, bleeding diathesis, etc.).

          -  Need for brainstem irradiation

          -  Unrealistic expectations on the part of the subject/family regarding the possible
             benefits, risks and limitations inherent to the procedure and ABI device.

          -  Unwilling to sign the informed consent.

          -  Unwilling to make necessary follow-up appointments.
