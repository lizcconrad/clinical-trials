    <description>There will be four patient groups analyzed. Ten patients each, 10 with active eosinophilic esophagitis defined by consensus guidelines, 20 patients in histologic remission (10 by steroids and 10 by diet) and 10 control volunteers will be studied. Patients who have consented to the trial will be scheduled at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) Patients will report to Charlton 7 the CRU, having their height, weight, blood pressure and temperature recorded. Subjects can choose to either have a saline lock IV placed or have their bloods drawn 3 separate times. They will receive 25 grams of D-xylose orally. The D-xylose will be mixed in 10 cc of water with 2 teaspoons of honey. D-xylose serum levels will be drawn at 5 and 10 and 60 minutes.</description>
