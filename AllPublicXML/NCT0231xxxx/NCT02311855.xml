      The main objective is to evaluate the strength and duration of immune response after
      influenza vaccination in patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) receiving treatment with
      biological agents as compared to a group healthy controls who do not have RA. Influenza
      vaccine titers will be drawn 3 times: at Baseline(prior to vaccination), 4-6 weeks post
      vaccination, and 5-6 months post vaccination. Influenza vaccination will be done at the
      baseline visit after the baseline blood draw.

      Aims:

        -  Evaluate the strength and duration of immune response after influenza vaccination in
           patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) receiving treatment with biological agents.

        -  Evaluate for predictors of immune response such as age, gender, disease duration, type
           of the biological agent(s) used, duration of the treatment, and type of treatment in the
           past.

        -  Assess the efficacy of vaccine response in this population by recording proportion of
           patients who contracted influenza illness despite vaccination. The result of the study
           may provide more information regarding which situations inadequate immune response by
           strength or duration would most likely to be expected. This may help lay some groundwork
           for future studies looking at the use of booster vaccinations in this population

    <description>Each participant will have a blood draw to measure the antibody titres influenza strains covered by the 2014-2015 influenza vaccine at three different time points:
Visit 1- Baseline/prior to vaccination Visit 2- 4-6 weeks post-vaccination Visit 3- end of influenza season (April-May)
At Visit 1, after the baseline blood draw, all participants will be vaccinated by Research staff in order to standardize the time from Baseline blood draw to vaccination. Participants aged 65 and older will be offered the extra strength version of the vaccine, which is usual care. Participants under the age of 65 will be given the usual strength vaccine. All patients will be given the intramuscular (IM) vaccine.</description>
