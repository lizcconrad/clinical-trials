             24-hour period prior to the first dose of study drug

          -  Willing to avoid tanning devices

          -  Willing to forgo other systemic and topical treatments for psoriasis during the course

                  upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening. (Subjects with an isolated AST
                  elevation of any magnitude, or a ratio of AST:ALT &gt; 1.5 should be interviewed
                  regarding use of alcohol, have levels repeated and participation in the study
                  should be discussed with the medical monitor.)
