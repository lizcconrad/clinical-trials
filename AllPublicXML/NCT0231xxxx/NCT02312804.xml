    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted using 3+3 design and includes, a dose escalation part to define
      the MTDfRP2D for the combination of BGJ398 and carboplatin/paclitaxel, and a dose expansion
      part to treat another 12 patients (only cervix cancer) to further evaluate safety of this
      combination. Safety, tolerability and MTD will be determined in the dose escalation part of
      the study. The dose expansion will additionally investigate preliminary anti-tumor efficacy
      in cervical cancer. The dosing cycle is 21 days.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects age &gt;18 years at the time of informed consent

          -  Histologically/cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors for
             which no curable therapy exists. In dose expansion part of this study, only patients
             with stage IV or recurrent/persistent cervical cancer will be enrolled. Confirmation
             of FGF/FGFR aberration is not required.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2

          -  Adequate marrow function as defined below:

        absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10 9/L platelets ≥ 100,000 x 10 9/L hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL
        Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin &lt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal
        (ULN); alanine aminotransferase (AL T) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &lt;3 times the
        ULN

          -  Evidence of measurable or evaluable disease, as determined by RECIST v 1.1

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. A female of child-bearing
             potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having undergone a tubal
             ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following criteria: has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (Le., has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 12 consecutive months). Oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted
             hormonal methods are not allowed as the sole method of contraception because BGJ398
             has not been characterized with respect to its potential to interfere with PK and/or
             the effectiveness of OCs.

          -  It is preferred that archival tumor sample is available for molecular testing, if not
             available, a newly obtained tumor biopsy may be submitted instead (not mandatory)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For patients enrolled in dose escalation, any number of prior treatments allowed. For
             patients enrolled in dose expansion, no prior chemotherapy is allowed (previous single
             agent cisplatin concurrent with radiotherapy is accepted).

          -  No prior therapy with paclitaxel, BGJ398 or other FGFR targeting agents.

          -  Preexisting&gt; grade 2 peripheral neuropathy

          -  Patients with brain metastases are allowed provided that they are clinically stable
             for a period of 30 days prior to study entry and there is not a requirement for
             steroids or anti epileptics.

          -  History of pancreatitis in last 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  History and/or current evidence of endocrine alterations of calcium/phosphate
             homeostasis, e.g., parathyroid disorders, history of parathyroidectomy, tumor lysis,
             tumoral calcinosis, or patients with other phosphate regulating abnormalities. Because
             hyperphosphatemia is a frequent occurrence with BGJ398 treatment, pretreatment and
             concurrent treatment with phosphate regulating agents is allowed.

          -  Current evidence of corneal or retinal disorder/ keratopathy such as bullous/ band
             keratopathy, corneal abrasion, inflammation/ulceration, keratoconjunctivits, etc

          -  Since BGJ398 is a likely inhibitor of CYP3A4, patients who are currently receiving
             treatment with agents that are known sting inducers or inhibitors CYP3A4 are not
             allowed

          -  Treatment with any of the following anti-cancer therapies prior to the first dose of
             the of BGJ398 within the stated timeframes: intravenous chemotherapy within a period
             of 4 weeks ( 6 weeks for nitrosourea, mitomycin-C), biological therapy (e,g.
             antibodies) within a period of time that is ~ 5 t1/2 or less than 4 weeks, whichever
             is shorter, prior to starting study drug, any other investigational agents within a
             period of time that is &lt; 5 tl/2 or 4 weeks (whichever is shortest) prior to starting
             study drug, wide field radiotherapy &lt; 4 weeks or limited field radiation for
             palliation &lt; 2 weeks prior to starting study drug.

          -  Use of medications that increase serum levels of phosphorus and/or calcium.

          -  History of cardiac disease (Congestive heart failure NYHA grade&gt; 2, LVEF &lt; 50% as
             determined by MUGA scan or ECHO, history of clinically significant ventricular
             arrhythmias, unstable angina pectoriS or acute myocardial infarction &lt;6 months prior
             to starting study drug, QTcF &gt; 450 msec)

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women.
