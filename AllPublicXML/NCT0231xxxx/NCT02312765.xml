  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep apnea, characterized by abnormal breathing at night, is often untreated in patients
      with heart failure. Helping patients to effectively use the most common form of treatment for
      sleep apnea, positive airway pressure therapy, can improve their heart function. This can
      reduce the likelihood that the patient will be re-admitted to the hospital. AirCareLabs has
      developed an innovative solution that allows patients to communicate with health care
      providers 24 hours a day, thus allowing them to get the help they need to effectively use
      positive airway pressure and thereby reduce the risk of being re-admitted to the hospital.

    <description>PAP adherence will be measured from the PAP unit (which monitors nightly hours of use and records this data; this is the standard of care clinical practice approach used currently by health care providers to monitor PAP use) and will be reported as hours of use per night on average across the 30 day period (hours of use per night is the most commonly used criteria for adherence).</description>
