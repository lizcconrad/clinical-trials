  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of T2P2 is to track the progression of T2D and related comorbidities
      and complications in the TODAY cohort as they transition to young adulthood. We hypothesize
      that:

        -  Youth-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) will progress rapidly and result in high rates of
           diabetes-related medical complications and comorbidities.

        -  The rapid rate of progression is related to increased insulin resistance characteristic
           of puberty, worse β-cell function, degree of glycemic control, control of non-glycemic
           factors, and obesity itself.

    <ipd_description>The TODAY/TODAY2 Study Group engages in a number of methods to disseminate and share resources.
Findings are reported in manuscripts and presentations.
An active Ancillary Studies Committee reviews proposals to access the study cohort, the central database, and stored biospecimens.
Materials from the TODAY lifestyle intervention program and the standard diabetes education manual for adolescents developed by study experts are made available for public access on the website https://today.bsc.gwu.edu/web/today/home.
The study group adheres to the policies of the NIDDK Central Repositories to make data available to other scientific investigators. A TODAY2 de-identified database will be prepared and transferred along with excess stored biospecimens. Appropriate informed consent is required to transfer stored biospecimens.
TODAY establishes collaborative arrangements to work with other federally funded study groups.</ipd_description>
