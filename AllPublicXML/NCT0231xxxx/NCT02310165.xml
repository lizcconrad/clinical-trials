    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different methods that are used for inserting the
      needle during paracentesis. One method is called the &quot;coaxial insertion technique&quot; and the
      other is called the &quot;z-tract technique&quot;. Researchers would like to see which method is better
      and leads to less problems like oozing from the needle insertion site and pain during the
      procedure. Both methods are approved and currently used methods for doing a paracentesis at
      the University of Virginia. Which method is used generally depends on physician preference.
      There have been no studies done to date that compare these two methods for needle insertion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years and older

          -  Agreement to participate

          -  Patients with cirrhosis (confirmed by liver biopsy or clinically diagnosed) and
             ascites

          -  Patients presenting to UVA Digestive Health Clinic for a scheduled therapeutic
             paracentesis who do not have any contraindications to the procedure

          -  Ability to be reliably contacted by phone 24 hours following paracentesis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prisoners

          -  Non-english speaking

          -  Paracentesis with less than 5 liters of ascitic fluid removed. (If this occurs, the
             specific subject encounter will be removed from the study but the subject may be
             included if at their next regularly scheduled paracentesis 5 liters or greater of
             ascitic fluid is removed.)
