      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of guselkumab
      in participants with Active Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center (more than one clinical site will work on a medical research study),
      randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), double-blind (neither
      investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to test
      whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) study to determine the efficacy and
      safety of guselkumab in participants with PsA. The study will consist of 4 parts: Screening
      period (6 weeks), a double-blind treatment period (consists of guselkumab and placebo
      treatment for 24 weeks), an active treatment period (guselkumab for 20 weeks), and follow-up
      period (12 weeks). The maximal study duration for a participant will not exceed 62 weeks
      including the Screening period. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      groups in a 2:1 ratio to either receive Guselkumab 100 milligram (mg) at Weeks 0, 4 then
      every 8 weeks or Placebo at Weeks 0, 4 then every 8 weeks until Week 24. At week 24,
      participants remaining in the placebo group will start to receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks
      24, 28, 36 and 44. Participants in both treatment groups who have less than (&lt;) 5 percent (%)
      improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts at Week 16 will qualify for
      early escape and will switch to open-label therapy with ustekinumab 45 mg or 90 mg at Weeks
      16, 20, 32, and 44 based on the approved dosage for the PsA indication in the particular
      country of study. The efficacy will be assessed primarily by measuring percentage of
      participants who achieve an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 Response at Week 24.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
