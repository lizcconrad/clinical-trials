  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of fresh, frozen or lyophilized
      fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) via colonoscopy in patients with recurrent C.
      difficile associated diarrhea (RCDAD). We will generate a frozen, lyophilized or fresh fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT) inoculum from well-screened healthy volunteer donors of â‰¥150
      gram/sample. Delivery of FMT will be performed colonoscopically. Fecal samples from donors
      and recipients will be saved for later metagenomic studies to characterize the microbiome of
      the gut in patients before and after FMT.

      Donors will be enrolled and screened at the Center for Infectious Disease laboratory for
      enteric pathogens at University of Texas School of Public Health (EPDL-UT-SPH) which is
      College American Pathologist and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments certified
      laboratory. The donors will come from a variety of places, including the University of Texas
      School of Public Health. We will screen at least 70 donors to recruit at least 20 qualified
      donors.

      Recipients All patients to be treated must have a physician who is willing to care from them
      after discharge from our facility. Recipients will need to have insurance or be willing to
      self-pay for this therapy. Attending physician of recipients/patients will order the FMT and
      make clinical decisions related to overall health for his/her patients. All patients
      undergoing therapy will be handled as outpatients at either Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center
      in the Texas Medical Center, the Digestive Disease Center at Memorial Hermann in the Texas
      Medical Center, or Kelsey-Seybold Clinic - Main Campus on Holcombe Blvd. Once the procedure
      is completed, the recipient will be transferred back to their original medical treatment
      facility or be released to home care under the care of their physician. A gastroenterologist
      with privileges at Endoscopy procedure site will perform the FMT via colonoscopy. The Center
      for Infectious Disease enteric pathogens laboratory at the University of Texas School of
      Public Health will prepare donor stool for administration via a colonoscope. We will screen
      at least 120 recipients to recruit 100 qualified recipients.

      Evaluation of the safety of FMT and recurrence of clinical symptoms of CDAD will be performed
      by the primary physicians and research coordinators from the EPDL-UT-SPH. The primary
      endpoint is to evaluate the safety of the FMT (fresh or frozen or lyophilized health donor
      feces) for the treatment of patients with 3 or more episodes of RCDAD. A second efficacy
      endpoint is to evaluate the recurrence of clinical symptoms and CDAD after initial therapy.
      In order to monitor any health effects for safety, participants will be contacted quarterly
      for three years following study completion. The recipient will be contacted by the
      investigator pre- and approximately 7, 14 and 30 days after the procedure is performed. The
      following procedures will be completed: review recipient diary with the recipient to ensure
      that the following information is recorded correctly and a fresh stool sample will be
      collected from recipient, tested for C. difficile toxins and an aliquot (2 mL) stored at -80C
      for future analysis (e.g. microbiome). The recipients will be contacted by phone for their
      diarrhea status.

      The following safety endpoints will be evaluated in this study.

      Medical conditions

      Clinical improvement is monitored by telephone/email and or E-mail during 90 days after FMT.
      Minor clinical management of the subject with over the counter medication (e.g. loperamide,
      acetaminophen and Saccharomyces boulardii [probiotic]) will be performed in the case of mild
      diarrhea and abdominal pain.

      All subjects will be followed up by phone the day after FMT to assess health status during
      week one. Study subjects will be monitored on approximately days 7, 14 and 30 after FMT, at
      which time we will review the recipient diary with the recipient to review any adverse
      experience or medication taken since the medical history obtained at FMT.

      Investigators should determine if any adverse experience or medication need to be further
      studied. Donor will be contacted and tested if it is necessary. All actions will be recorded
      on with medical condition, dates of adverse experience and medication taken, indication for
      new medication taken, and total daily dose (Patient Data Collection Form).

      Recipients should be instructed at FMT to contact the Investigator if they have any questions
      regarding adverse experience or the appropriateness of a medication after FMT.

      Monitoring for safety

      The following definitions of terms are guided by the International Conference of
      Harmonization and US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 312.32).

      An adverse experience is any unfavorable or unintended sign, symptom, of disease temporally
      associated with FMT procedure, whether or not considered related to the procedure, including,
      but not limited to:

        -  Any symptom not previously reported by the recipients (Recent Medical History)

        -  An exacerbation of a pre-existing illness, increases in the frequency and/or severity of
           the signs or symptoms of CDAD (defined as positive C. difficile toxin test and enteric
           symptoms)

        -  A significant increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or
           condition

        -  A condition first detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even through the
           condition may have been present before the procedure

      Details of all adverse experiences that occur after FMT through approximately day 90 visit
      will be collected as indicated above.

      Serious adverse experience is any adverse experience that:

        -  Results in death

        -  Is life threatening (at immediate risk of death from the procedure as it occurred)

        -  Requires inpatient hospitalization (overnight stay) or prolongs a current
           hospitalization

        -  Causes a persistent or significant disability/incapacity

        -  Medical important (any event that requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent
           one of the outcomes listed above)

      The investigator will exercise medical and scientific judgment when deciding whether
      expeditious reporting is appropriate in other situations not strictly meeting the listed
      criteria above. The investigators will meet/discuss with experts in the field if there is a
      question of whether the adverse experience would be considered serious.

      Severity - The adverse experience will be documented on the appropriate page in the Patient
      Diary according to the following descriptors:

        -  Mild: associated with no limitation of usual activities or only slight discomfort

        -  Moderate: associated with limitation of usual activities or significant discomfort

        -  Severe: associated with inability to carry out usual activities or very marked
           discomfort

      Relationship - the relationship of adverse experience to FMT will be assigned by the
      Investigator according to the following definitions:

        -  Probable: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the procedure that
           follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected procedure and that could
           not be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of that patient's clinical
           state

        -  Possible: a reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the procedure that
           follows a known or expected response pattern to the procedure but could readily have
           been produced by a number of other factors

        -  Unlikely: a reaction that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the
           procedure but for which causality from FMT cannot be ruled out.

        -  Not related: a reaction for which sufficient data exist to indicate that the etiology is
           unrelated to the procedure

      Pre-existing signs and symptoms and medical conditions

      Medical conditions that are present at or before the procedure that manifest with the same
      severity or frequency will not be recorded as adverse experience. Similarly, signs or
      symptoms related to a pre-existing disease will not be recorded as adverse experience unless
      there is an increase in the severity or frequency of the signs or symptoms. These
      pre-existing conditions, signs, or symptoms will be recorded on the Recent Medical History
      Form.

      Progression of underlying conditions as an adverse experience

      If the progression of the underlying condition might be reasonably anticipated given the
      nature and severity of the underlying condition, then the progression of the underlying
      condition per se will not constitute an adverse experience. However, if the progression of
      the underlying condition is fatal, then the progression of the underlying condition should be
      reported as an adverse experience.

      Recording and documenting adverse experience

      The Investigator must completely and promptly record each new adverse experience and serious
      adverse experience, even if the relationship of adverse experience to the procedure is
      assessed by the Investigator to be &quot;unlikely&quot; or &quot;not related&quot;. In addition, the investigator
      must document and follow serious adverse experiences that occur from the procedure through 90
      days after the FMT. The Investigator should attempt, if possible, to establish a diagnosis
      based on the presenting signs and symptoms. If an adverse experience meets the definition of
      a serious adverse experience then the Investigator must also complete the serious adverse
      experience, and also send any supporting source documents directly to the University of Texas
      Health Science Center IRB as soon as the event is discovered. At each visit, after the
      patient has had an opportunity to mention any problems spontaneously, the Investigator (or
      designee) will inquire about adverse experience by asking the standard questions listed in,
      such as:

        -  Have you had any medical problems since your last visit?

        -  Have any medical problems present at your last visit changed, i.e., stopped, worsened,
           or improved?

        -  Have you taken any new medicines, other than study drug, since your last visit?

      Any spontaneous adverse experience information provided by the patient will be reported. If
      an adverse experience has not resolved at the time of the Final Visit, the Investigator
      should evaluate the status of the adverse experience at the Follow-Up telephone/email contact
      (day 60) and update to reflect the status of the adverse experience (e.g. ongoing or
      resolved).

      Investigator reporting of serious adverse experience

      All serious adverse experience must be reported to the University of Texas Health Science IRB
      using the serious adverse experience facsimile or email or by telephone/email as soon as the
      serious adverse experience is discovered, and within 24 hours after the Investigator
      recognizes or classifies the event as a serious adverse experience. A brief description of
      the event must be provided at the time of the initial serious adverse experience report. The
      initial serious adverse experience report should be followed up by additional information
      using the serious adverse experience within 48 hours. The reports should identify the patient
      by their unique patient number instead of names. The completed serious adverse experience
      Form will be used by the investigators in regulatory filings. The investigator is responsible
      for continuing to report to the University of Texas Health Science IRB any new or relevant
      follow-up information obtained concerning the serious adverse experience. The results of any
      additional assessments conducted must be also reported to the University of Texas Health
      Science IRB.

      Notification of post-study serious adverse experience

      Investigators are not obligated to actively seek follow-up information for patients with
      adverse experience after the conclusion of the study (i.e., &gt; 90 days after the FMT
      procedure). However, if the investigator becomes aware of an adverse experience that occurs
      after the patient completes and the adverse experience is considered by the Investigator to
      be at least possibly related to study procedure, the investigator must notify the University
      of Texas Health Science Center IRB.
