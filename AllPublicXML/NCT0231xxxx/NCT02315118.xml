  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advancement in chemotherapy, radiotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplant
      (HSCT), and the recent introduction of more targeted therapies, a substantial proportion of
      patients with B-cell malignancies, such as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and
      B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) still succumb to their malignancies. For CLL and
      low-grade NHL, cure is achievable only with HSCT but such aggressive approach is not
      justified as the initial therapy for most patients who have indolent disease; when disease
      has progressed, transplant is either not feasible or ineffective. For high-grade B-cell NHL,
      the availability of Rituximab has improved disease outcome but treatment failure portends
      nearly inevitable death from disease or treatment-related complications. Thus, newer, more
      effective therapies for patients with B-cell malignancies are urgently needed.

      The present study translates recent laboratory findings into clinical application. In
      patients with B-cell malignancies receiving the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab as standard
      therapy, the study aims to assess the feasibility and safety, as well as explore the
      efficacy, of infusing autologous T-lymphocytes engineered to express a CD16-41BB-CD3zeta
      chimeric receptor which mediates antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. Receptor expression is
      achieved by electroporation of mRNA.

    <description>Participants will be monitored for toxicity for a period of one-month (30 days) after the last T cell infusion. Monitored toxicities will include the following:
grades III-IV allergic reactions related to infusion;
grade IV neutropenia lasting greater than 28 days;
grade IV infection uncontrolled for greater than 7 days;
grade IV other adverse events;
treatment-related death (grade V).</description>

    <description>Response criteria follow those defined by NCCN Guidelines version 4.2011 for CLL and NHL.
For monitoring of treatment response, patients with CLL and NHL will have PET-CT scan at approximately 1 month before and after infusion and at intervals thereafter till progression. Peripheral blood and bone marrow studies (the latter only if bone marrow is involved pre-treatment) will be done to determine levels of residual disease by using established flow cytometric and molecular MRD assays.</description>

Longer term impact on the suppression of B cell function will also be monitored by assaying B cell numbers and immunoglobulin levels.</description>

IL-2 dosing will be continued 3 times per week for one week (3 doses total).
On Day 0, T cell modification in the laboratory and T cell infusion in the patient will be done.
A disease status evaluation will be conducted approximately 4 weeks post-T cell infusion.</description>

             autologous transplantation, and in whom further salvage therapy has produced only a
