    <textblock>
      The objective is to evaluate the effect of no-commercial enteral diet for patients in home
      nutritional therapy in anthropometric and biochemical indices comparing to patients using
      commercial enteral diets.

    <description>The study was constituted by sixty-six patients, thirty-three in each group. Patients on not industrialized enteral diet (standardized diet group) entered at random in the study and were matched by gender, age, socioeconomic status and medical diagnosis to patients using commercial diet (commercial group). The evaluation consisted of anthropometric measures of weight, height, arm circumference, triceps skin fold and biochemical índices at baseline and at the end of the intervention.</description>

    <description>A enteral diet formulation was developed to meet dietary requirements of adult patients. The formulation was standarized in household measures so that caregivers would prepare it and delivered it at the patients' home. Anthropometric measurements and blood samples were taken at baseline and at the end of the intervention which lasted four months.</description>
