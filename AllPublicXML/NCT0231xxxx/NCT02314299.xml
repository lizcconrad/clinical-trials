  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation clinical study, enrolling 21 subjects in one
      of the two treatment groups to determine the effects of topical ocular administration of low
      dose or high dose MTP-131 given twice a day in subjects with Diabetic Macular Edema and
      Age-Related Macular Degeneration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  General:

               1. Adults aged ≥18 and ≤ 80 years

               2. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at
                  Baseline and agree to use a highly effective method of contraception throughout
                  the study and 60 days after the last dose of study drug.

          -  DME Treatment Group:

               1. Central subfield thickness (CST) ≥325 microns as measured by spectral domain
                  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) at Screening and Baseline Visits

               2. BCVA (ETDRS) no better than 20/25 in the study eye

               3. BCVA (ETDRS) no worse than 20/640 in either eye

          -  AMD Treatment Group:

               1. Non-exudative, intermediate age-related macular degeneration defined as an eye(s)
                  having extensive intermediate drusen (10 or more drusen 63μm - 124μm) or large
                  drusen (1 or more ≥125 μm) with no evidence of advanced AMD (i.e., no choroidal
                  neovascularization or macular atrophy)

               2. BCVA (ETDRS) no worse than 20/400 in either eye

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  General:

               1. Inability to self-administer eye drops

               2. Current use of or likely need for systemic medications known to be toxic to the
                  lens, retina or optic nerve (for example deferoxamine,
                  chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine [Plaquenil], tamoxifen, phenothiazines and
                  ethambutol)

               3. Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude
                  safe participation in the study or completion of all study requirements and
                  examinations

               4. Have a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥ 12%

          -  Ocular Conditions:

               1. Any ocular condition in the study eye that in the opinion of the investigator
                  would prevent improvement in visual acuity or successful completion of any study
                  examination

               2. Ocular hypertension or glaucoma, dry eye, and any other ocular pathology in the
                  study eye requiring treatment with topical ophthalmic drops
