      Background: Sedation of the intensive care unit (ICU) patient is necessary to relieve the
      patient from pain, anxiety and agitation and to enable mechanical ventilation, diagnostic
      investigations and invasive procedures. While sedation policy has shifted from deep sedation
      to moderate, minimal, or even no sedation in the general ICU, optimal sedation of the
      cerebrovascular ICU patient is unclear and controversial.

      Method: MOderate vs DEep Regime in NeuroIntensive care SEdation (MODERNISE) is a prospective,
      randomized, open, two-center trial. Patients with acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral
      hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage who need to be ventilated are eligible for enrollment.
      It is intended to enroll 50 patients per group (n=100). Patients are randomized within 72h
      from admission to either moderate sedation as defined by Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale
      (RASS) &gt;= -3 or to deep sedation as defined by RASS &lt; -3 for the next 72h, after which
      weaning from sedation is aimed for in a stepwise fashion in both groups. If reduction of
      sedation is not feasible, patients remain at their respective sedation level for another 12
      hours, and sedation reduction is then tried again. Patients are multimodally monitored for
      systemic and cerebral parameters (the latter including bispectral index (BIS) monitoring).
      The primary endpoint is ICU length of stay (ICU-LOS); secondary endpoints are several
      pre-defined variables of the ICU course, feasibility of sedation levels without violation of
      pre-defined safety criteria, pre-defined complications, and short- and long-term functional
      outcome and mortality.

      Conclusion: The feasibility, safety and benefits of moderate as opposed to deep sedation even
      in the acute phase of severe cerebrovascular disease needs to be clarified in a prospective
      randomized study. Results from this study might change sedation regimes and help prevent
      unwanted effects of deep sedation in the brain-injured patient.

      Executive Summary Rationale While sedation policy has shifted from deep sedation to moderate,
      minimal, or even no sedation in the general ICU, optimal sedation of the cerebrovascular
      neuro-ICU (NICU) patient is unclear and controversial. The rationale of this study is to
      analyze potential benefits, feasibility and safety of moderate as opposed to deep sedation.

      Aim and hypothesis MODERNISE is a pilot trial aiming to investigate the safety, feasibility
      and potential benefits of moderate vs. deep sedation in patients with severe ischemic stroke,
      intracerebral hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The primary objective is to compare
      moderate sedation and deep sedation with respect to ICU-LOS.

      Design MODERNISE is a prospective, randomized, controlled, outcome observer-blinded,
      two-center trial. Patients are randomized to either moderate sedation as defined by RASS) &gt;=
      -3 or to deep sedation as defined by RASS &lt; -3.

      Study Outcomes The primary endpoint is ICU-LOS. Secondary endpoints are the ventilation-free
      ICU-LOS, ventilation duration, sedation duration, complications (including episodes of
      treatment-demanding increases of intracranial pressure (ICP), episodes of hypotension,
      episodes of cerebral hypoperfusion, pneumonia, sepsis, ileus, episodes of paroxysmal
      sympathetic hyperactivity (PSH)), time within sedation goal, demand of sedatives, demand of
      analgesics, demand of vasopressors, scores (RASS, nociception coma scale (NCS), Glasgow Coma
      Scale (GCS), intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC), confusion assessment method
      - ICU (CAM-ICU), ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90
      days, PTSD at 90 days.

      Discussion To clarify the benefits of moderate sedation in critical care ventilated stroke
      patients, a randomized multicentre trial is clearly needed. If this two-center pilot trial
      shows differences in relevant parameters of the ICU course and gives promising safety and
      feasibility results, a multi-centre trial may be planned on this basis.

    <description>1. Moderate sedation defined by target RASS of &gt;= -3. The intervention (M) is sedation by use of any sedative and/or analgesic medication(s) left at the discretion of the treating physicians targeted at a RASS of &gt;= -3 (patient responds to verbal stimulus) from randomization for the next 72h. RASS will be assessed once every 8 h (at he beginning of each shift) and measures undertaken to achieve the target level. If safety-limits are violated, sedation may have to be deepened below the target level for 8h and re-assessed at the beginning of the next shift with the aim to approach the target level of the intervention group again.</description>

    <description>As far as sedation is concerned, this will be adapted to all patients before randomization in the first 3 days according to what the diagnosis and acute treatment of the underlying disease demands. This will be deep sedation or even general anesthesia (for operative procedures) in most cases. After 72h at the sedation level of the respective randomization result, both groups will tried to be weaned from sedation with the goal of awakening, weaning from ventilation, overall de-escalation and transfer to rehabilitation as far as the course of the disease and the occurrence of complications allows. This reduction of sedation will follow individual regimes at he discretion of the treating physician. However, if cessation of sedation violates safety-limits (see below, Tab. 2) or is not feasible for other reasons, return to the level the patient was initially randomized for (or even below that) is mandatory with a re-assessment of safety for sedation weaning after 12h aimed for.</description>
