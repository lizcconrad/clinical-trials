    <textblock>
      Study designed to evaluate safety and tolerability of a genetically attenuated P. falciparum
      (GAP3KO) that arrests early in the liver stage of the parasite life cycle. Study will also
      confirm the attenuation of the GAP3KO parasites using peripheral blood smears. Secondary
      objectives are to evaluate the humoral immune responses to GAP3KO.

      This single arm, open-label, phase 1 safety study is designed to evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of a genetically attenuated P. falciparum (GAP3KO) that arrests early in the
      liver stage of the parasite life cycle. The study will also confirm the attenuation of the
      GAP3KO parasites using peripheral blood smears. The secondary objectives of the study are to
      evaluate the humoral immune responses to GAP3KO.

      A total of 10 healthy, malaria-naïve adult subjects will be enrolled to receive GAP3KO via
      the bite of 150-200 GAP3K0-infected A. stephensi mosquitoes under controlled conditions.
      Subjects will be evaluated for safety, reactogenicity, and signs and symptoms of malaria to
      confirm attenuation for 28 days, including monitoring in a hotel setting 8-18 days post GAP
      3KO administration.
