  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating evidence suggesting that inflammatory processes, through microglial
      activation, would play a key role in the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's disease
      (PD). It is considered that microglial activation would be part of self-propelling cycle of
      neuroinflammation that fuels the progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration. It is however
      hard to evidence microglial activation in vivo, especially in the substantia nigra: first,
      the investigators need very high resolution imaging tools and then, the only ligand available
      to date, 11C-PK11195, has a low sensitivity and specificity and provided heterogeneous
      results.

      18F-DPA-714 is a new PET ligand which labels microglial cells. The investigators aim to
      explore the topography and intensity of microglial activation in several different groups of
      PD patients: 1) de novo, drug-naïve subjects (n = 6); 2) non-fluctuating treated patients
      (&quot;honeymoon&quot;) (n = 10); 3) advanced drug-responsive patients motor fluctuations (wearing-off
      or dyskinesia) (n = 6); 4) patients with LRRK2 gene mutation (n = 6); and 5) related to
      healthy patients carriers of the mutation LRRK2(n = 6). PET imaging will be performed with a
      new generation tomography having a very high resolution.

      This study might reveal significant neuroinflammatory process in the midbrain of PD patients
      and will determine if such process is present in both sporadic and genetic forms of PD. The
      results of this study might provide a new biomarker of disease pathological progression and
      help as identifying subjects who might most benefit from a specific anti-inflammatory drug.
