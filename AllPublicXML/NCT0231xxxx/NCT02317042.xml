    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new therapy (Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway
      Pressure with intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (AutoEPAP iVAPS)) designed to treat
      respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure and/or nocturnal hypoventilation with upper
      airway obstruction. The study will be performed in two phases: In a sleep unit and in the
      home environment. The new therapy will be compared against two existing ventilator therapies:
      &quot;Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode&quot; and &quot;Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS)&quot;.

      Phase I: To compare sleep and sleep-breathing parameters for patients who use AutoEPAP iVAPS
      (experimental arm) compared to iVAPS (commercially available therapy)

      Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV) will be recruited to
      participate for 3 nights in a monitored sleep unit. They will have a sleep study each night:

      Night 1 will involve an evaluation of their current NIV settings. Some of these settings will
      be used to set up AutoEPAP iVAPS and iVAPS.

      Night 2 &amp; 3: the participants will be randomised to AutoEPAP iVAPS or iVAPS. They will have
      sleep studies on each therapy, whereby their sleep and sleep-breathing will be monitored and
      evaluated.

      After each night, the participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire about how well
      they slept.

      Phase II: To compare sleep-breathing and therapy adherence for patients who use AutoEPAP
      iVAPS (experimental arm) compared to their usual therapy (Spontaneous Time (ST) mode).

      Participants already established on non-invasive ventilation (NIV; ie. ST mode) will be
      recruited to participate for 14 nights. This study will occur at home. The participants will
      be randomised to trial AutoEPAP iVAPS or ST mode therapy for Week 1 and 2. Data will be
      collected onto the respiratory device (i.e. Juno) detailing objective usage, air leak and
      breathing parameters (e.g. oxygenation). Participants will also complete a questionnaire
      after each week to evaluate subjective sleep quality and comfort.

      Blood samples will also be collected Pre-week 1, and after week 1 &amp; 2 to measure oxygen,
      carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels in the blood. Blood samples will be taken from the ear
      lobe.

    <description>iVAPS is a type of respiratory support ventilation. It is used to treat people with respiratory insufficiency, respiratory failure or hypoventilation. It is commercially available. iVAPS is the predicate therapy for the Experimental therapy: Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (AutoEPAP) iVAPS.
iVAPS delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate. Collectively, this optimises ventilation and ensures a target alveolar ventilation is achieved.</description>

It is being developed by AutoEPAP iVAPS delivers two air pressures (one for inspiration and a second for expiration) and provides a back-up breathing rate.

    <description>'Juno' is the ventilator unit. It will have a flow generator which will deliver air pressure to the participant during sleep. It will have a water tub for humidification, and a single tube circuit which will be connected to a vented face mask. It will have the ventilator programs: Spontaneous Timed (ST) mode, Intelligent Volume Assured Pressure Support (iVAPS) and Automatic Expiratory Positive Airway Pressure (AutoEPAP) iVAPS programed into the software. It is also compatible with &lt;4 L/min oxygen therapy. It is for people who weight at least 13 kg (when in ST mode), or at least 30 kg (when in iVAPS or AutoEPAP iVAPS modes).</description>
