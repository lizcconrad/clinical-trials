  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MicroPort Orthopedics (MPO) is conducting this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of its total hip arthroplasty (THA) and resurfacing
      components marketed in the European Union (EU). These types of studies are required by
      regulatory authorities for all THA and resurfacing devices that do not have medium to
      long-term clinical evidence available at the time of gaining approval to market in the EU.
      This study has been designed in accordance with the medial device directives (MEDDEV) 2.12/2
      rev 2.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has undergone primary THA for any of the following:

          -  Non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as osteoarthritis, avascular
             necrosis, ankylosis, protrusio acetabuli, or painful hip dysplasia;

          -  Inflammatory degenerative joint disease such as rheumatoid arthritis; or

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Subject is implanted with the specified combination of components

          -  Subject is willing and able to complete required study visits or assessments

        Previously implanted bilateral subjects can have both THAs enrolled in the study provided:
        1) the specified combination of components were implanted in both, 2) all other aspects of
        the Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria are satisfied, 3) enrollment does not exceed the subject
        count specified in the Investigator Agreement, and 4) the subject agrees to a second
        Informed Consent document specific to the second THA. Prospective enrollment of a
        previously unimplanted hip is not permitted in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of primary THA
             surgery

          -  Subjects currently enrolled in another clinical study which could affect the endpoints
             of this protocol

          -  Subjects unwilling to sign the Informed Consent document

          -  Subjects with substance abuse issues

          -  Subjects who are incarcerated
