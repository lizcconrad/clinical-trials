  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab works in treating patients with anal canal
      cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory) and has spread to other
      places in the body (metastatic). Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may block tumor
      growth in different ways by targeting certain cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) with nivolumab in patients with previously treated
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) of nivolumab in patients with previously
      treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of
      the anal canal treated with nivolumab.

      III. To evaluate the grade 3 and 4 toxicity rate in patients with previously treated
      metastatic SCCA of the anal canal when treated with nivolumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate ORR, PFS, and OS based on expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1
      (PD-L1), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), peritumoral cluster of differentiation (CD)8+ tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), peritumoral CD4+ TILs, and regulatory T cells as analyzed
      from tumor biopsies in previously treated patients with metastatic SCCA of the anal canal
      when treated with nivolumab.

      II. To evaluate radiographic responses according to relative changes in proportions of
      anti-human papillomavirus (HPV) specific CD8+ and CD4+ TILs and regulatory T cells in
      patients with previously treated metastatic SCCA of the anal canal following treatment with
      nivolumab, analyzed from serial peripheral blood samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 60 minutes once every two
      weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 100 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
