  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary objective To determine BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants in 250 Romanian women with
      breast/ovarian cancer selected for likeliness to harbor germline mutations in these genes by
      specific criteria for high-risk status including age at disease onset.

      Secondary objective Considering the fact that BRCA testing is not a routine procedure in
      Romania and mutation prevalence varies in different populations, we intend to look for the
      founder mutation in our population, running full BRCA genes sequencing to a representative
      population sample. This would allow a more targeted approach to real-life practice and would
      ensure personalized solutions for every patient in need.

    <intervention_name>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MPLA) BRCA1 BRCA2</intervention_name>
    <description>Firstly many pairs of probes, containing: a universal primer sequence, a specific hybridisation target sequence and a stuffer DNA region to vary the size of the resulting product, are hybridised adjacent to each other on the target DNA strand .The two adjacent probe sequences are ligated to form a continuous section of DNA.The ligated probes are then amplified using PCR. The amplified fragments are analysed by capillary electrophoresis to detect the different fragment lengths. These data can be analysed to show the relative copy number of each fragment that is present in the sample.</description>
