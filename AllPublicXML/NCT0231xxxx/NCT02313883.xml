      A Pharmacokinetic Pilot followed by a Phase I/II, Blinded, Randomized, Controlled, Parallel
      Arm Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of PerioSept® and Scaling and
      Root Planing in Subjects with Periodontitis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will follow an adaptive trial design, whereby information regarding PerioSept(r)
      drug levels will be obtained via a PK trial lead in period (PK Pilot) in a limited number of
      subjects (up to N=8). This will be followed by the main safety and efficacy trial of
      PerioSept(r) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (SRP) in subjects with moderate to
      severe periodontitis (Main Trial, N=87). The PK Pilot will be an open label PK study. Up to 8
      qualifying subjects will receive SRP on Day 1 followed by 3% PerioSept(r) administered in a
      minimum of 4 qualifying periodontal Study Pockets in at least 2 quadrants with a probing
      pocket depth (PPD) ≥ 5mm and bleeding on probing (BOP) and at least 20 other qualifying
      pockets (PPD ≥ 5 mm). The Main Trial will be a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo
      controlled, parallel arm trial of PerioSept(r) (0.3%, 1% or 3%) administered up to three
      times (over Days 1 and 2, at Weeks 4 and 12) into a minimum of 4 qualifying periodontal Study
      Pockets in at least 2 quadrants with a PPD ≥ 5mm and BOP following SRP at baseline. All other
      eligible pockets with a PPD ≥ 5mm will also be treated.

      Full mouth SRP will be initiated on Day 1 followed by randomized treatment of that side. If
      necessary, SRP and randomized treatment may be completed on the other side of the mouth on
      Day 2. Treated pockets that still have a PPD ≥ 5mm at the 4 and 12 week visits will be
      retreated with SRP or SRP plus placebo or PS, as randomized. Assessments will be conducted
      over a 24 week (6 month) period including safety assessments and assessments of dental
      parameters (PPD, BOP, Plaque index, Gingival Index, Clinical attachment level).
