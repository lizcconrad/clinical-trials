    <textblock>
      Background In subjects with hypercholesterolaemia, cholesterol values remain above guideline
      levels. One of the limiting factors to the achievement of goals in such patients is
      therapeutic non-adherence. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an
      intervention designed to improve control of hypercholesterolaemic patients, consisting of a
      combined strategy that would include the delivery of printed information,
      treatment-compliance check cards and the dispatch of text messages as complementary measures
      in support of the intervention at the general practitioner's practice.

      Methods/Design A randomised, parallel-group clinical trial will be conducted at the family
      medicine outpatient facilities of eight health centres in three of Spain's Autonomous
      Regions, covering a total of 358 subjects aged 18 years or over with diagnosis of
      hypercholesterolaemia. Patients in the intervention group will be supplied with printed
      material with information on the disease and its management, mobile-telephone text messages
      with guideline summaries, reminders of forthcoming appointments and/or arrangements for
      making new appointments in the event of non-attendance, and self-report cards to check
      compliance with recommendations. Both groups -intervention and control- will receive routine
      recommendations from their physicians in accordance with current European clinical practice
      guidelines for hypercholesterolaemia and cardiovascular risk management. As regards the
      measurements to be made, the main variable is the proportion of subjects who attain the low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol levels set as a target across a follow-up period of 24
      months. The secondary variables are as follows: adherence to recommendations on lifestyle and
      adherence to drug treatment; variation in lipid profiles and cardiovascular risk levels;
      appearance of cardiovascular events; physical activity; food consumption; smoking habit;
      anthropometric measures; blood pressure; health problems; use of hypolipidaemic agents;
      socio-demographic data; beliefs and expectations about preventive recommendations; and degree
      of satisfaction with the combined strategy.

      Discussion Should this intervention prove effective, a recommendation could be issued on the
      application of this combined strategy to subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. It is a simple,
      relatively inexpensive intervention.

    <description>The main study variable is the proportion of subjects who attain the LDL-C levels set as targets by the Guidelines for Management of Dyslipidaemias and CVR, across a follow-up period of 24 months.
