    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the combination of Daclatasvir, Sofosbuvir and
      Ribavirin for 12 or 16 weeks is safe and effective in the treatment of Genotype 3 Chronic
      Hepatitis C (HCV) in patients with advanced fibrosis or compensated cirrhosis. Patients in
      this study may have already been treated prior for HCV or may have never received treatment
      for their HCV.

    <description>SVR12, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 12. SVR12 imputation was based on Next Value Carried Backwards (NVCB) approach. HCV RNA measurements were excluded after the start of non-study anti-HCV medication on treatment or during follow-up.</description>

    <description>SVR4, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 4. SVR24, defined as percentage of participants with hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid (RNA) &lt; lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), target detected (TD) or target not detected (TND) at follow-up Week 24. SVR4 imputation was based on Next Value Carried Backwards (NVCB) approach. SVR24 imputation was based on missing being treated as non-responder.

    <time_frame>Date of First Dose of Study Drug to 7 Days post last dose of study drug (up to 13 weeks or 17 weeks depending on the randomized treatment group)</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse event (SAE) defined: a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Adverse event (AE) defined: any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. The degree of the adverse event or laboratory abnormality are evaluated by grades: Grade (Gr) 1=Mild, Gr 2=Moderate, Gr 3=Severe, Gr 4=Life-threatening or disabling, Gr 5=Death. Grading as per using National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (NCI CTC) Version 3.0 criteria.</description>
