      RATIONALE: Classically the evaluation of response in lung cancer has been based in comparing
      pre &amp; post treatment tumour volume by means of studying changes in the diameter of the
      selected target lesions by RECIST. The introduction of new targeted drugs creates the need of
      a different response assessment. Functional imaging techniques are able to study in vivo
      physiological processes of angiogenesis. Therefore, dynamic techniques may be more
      appropriate for assessing response to antiangiogenic drugs, whose mechanism of action is
      focused on tumor's vasculature normalization. Preliminary studies have demonstrated
      significant and very early changes in indirect vasculature parameters such as flow, blood
      volume and tumor perfusion with vascular-targeting agents. These techniques may be useful for
      selecting patients who are going to benefit from antiangiogenic therapy by an early
      evaluation of response by means of functional imaging method.

      PURPOSE: IMPACT is an open-label, single arm phase II/IV study to evaluate the predictive
      value and early radiologic response or perfusion computed tomography (CT) in patients
      diagnosed with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC treated with
      bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary objective:

      • To assess early tumour response (at day +7) in terms of blood flow as compared to Objective
      Response Rate (ORR) in terms of RECIST criteria (CR + PR) at day 42.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess early tumour response (at day +7) in terms of blood volume, mean transit time,
           enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour permeability as
           compared to ORR (CR + PR) at day 42.

        -  To assess tumour response (at day +42) in terms of blood flow, blood volume, mean
           transit time, enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour
           permeability as compared to ORR (CR + PR) at day 42.

        -  To assess tumour response (at day +7 and +42) in terms of blood flow, blood volume, mean
           transit time, enhancement peak, time to the enhancement peak and capillary tumour
           permeability as compared to PFS and OS

        -  Safety profile using NCI-CTC AE (version 4.0).

        -  To assess the efficacy in the subgroup of adenocarcinoma pts.

      Outline:

      Patients receive bevacizumab 7.5mg/kg IV, cisplatin 80mg/m2 and gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on
      days 1 and 8 up to 6 cycles of 21 days. Patients without progression may continue maintenance
      treatment with single-agent bevacizumab 7.5 mg/Kg on day 1 every 21 days.
