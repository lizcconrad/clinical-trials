  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single center, observational, 2-cohort study of adult patients
      with severe Hemophilia A. There is no randomization procedure and all patients will be
      treated as per usual clinical practice. Patients will be followed up for 18 months after
      enrolment.

    <textblock>
      The primary therapy for hemophilia is coagulation factor replacement, given either
      episodically on demand (OD) for the treatment of acute bleeds or prophylactically to prevent
      them.

      The last years there has been an interest to study the comparative effectiveness of OD vs. SP
      (Secondary Prophylaxis) treatment strategies so as to create an evidence based platform to
      guide both clinical decision making and quantify the economic aspects of each treatment
      alternative. In Greece relevant information is lacking, thus it is imperative to study how
      patients on different treatment strategies are managed in a real-life setting in Greece,
      including the main factors associated with increased health care utilization, clinical
      success and patient well being.
