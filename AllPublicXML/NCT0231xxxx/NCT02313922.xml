      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether etanercept combined with methotrexate are
      superiority than etanercept as monotherapy in the treatment of chinese severe plaque
      psoriasis. A phase IV, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was
      conducted.The primary outcome was Change from baseline in plaque psoriasis as assessed by
      PASI (psoriasis area and severity index) response or PASI75 (a patient that has an
      improvement from baseline PASI of at least 75%)
