      There will be two phase II cohorts for pembro plus trastuzumab: one cohort will be for
      patients with unresectable HER2 overexpressing gastric or GEJ cancers, the other cohort will
      be for patients with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The pembro plus
      ado-trastuzumab emtansine phase II arm will be for patients with HER2 overexpressing MBC.
      There will be two phase II cohorts for pembro plus cetuximab: one cohort will be for patients
      with HNSCC, the other cohort will be for patients with K-ras, B-raf, N-ras wildtype
      metastatic CRC.

      Pembrolizumab 2mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Pembrolizumab
      will be infused prior to the start of the assigned monoclonal antibody (Mab) arm. .

      Dosing for the Mab arms will begin as follows:

      Arm 1: Cycle length is 21 days. Intravenous (i.v.) trastuzumab 6 mg/kg on day 1 every 21
      days.

      Arm 2: Cycle length is 21 days. i.v. ado-trastuzumab emtansine 3.6 mg/kg on day 1 every 21
      days.

      Arm 3: Cycle length is 21 days. i.v. cetuximab 400 mg/m2 on cycle 1 day 1, then i.v.
      cetuximab 250 mg/m2 on day 8. Each subsequent cycle will be i.v. cetuximab 250 mg/m2 on days
      1 and 8 every 21 days.
