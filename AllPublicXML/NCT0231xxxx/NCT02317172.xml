  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people usually have systemic diseases and take medications that can cause dry mouth.
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether continuous use of edible, gel-based
      artificial saliva in geriatric population with dry mouth problems will reduce signs and
      symptoms of dry mouth and improve quality of patients' saliva.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pre-post test trial was conducted in 120 elders with xerostomia. All subjects received a
      total of 50 ml (10ml x 5 times) OMJ per day. Subjective and objective dry mouth scores,
      salivary pH, buffering capacity and satisfaction were monitored at 2 weeks and 1 month use,
      compared to baseline. The data were analyzed by Repeated Measure ANOVA.
