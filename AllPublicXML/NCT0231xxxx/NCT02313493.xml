    <textblock>
      In the present pilot study the feasibility and efficacy of Baby Triple P- an antenatal parent
      training- are investigated. Healthy becoming first time parents were randomly allocated to
      either the Baby Triple P parent-training group or a care as usual control group. It is
      expected that 78 couples of becoming first time parents are recruited. It is hypothesized
      that parents and their infants in the parent training group will show significantly less
      psychopathology / regulation problems and better partnership quality than participants in the
      control condition.

      In this pilot study, the efficacy and feasibility of the Baby Triple P parenting training is
      investigated in a pilot study using a randomized controlled trial. According to the efficacy
      of the parenting training, it is expected that parents in the training condition show higher
      scores on mental health scales (BSI-18) and quality of Partnership (PFB). Furthermore, it is
      expected that infants whose parents has taken part in the parenting training have lower
      severity ratings of regulatory disorders assessed with the Baby-DIPS diagnostic interview
      than infants of parents in the care as usual control condition.
