      Depression related to pregnancy frequently presents postpartum depression, which has
      deteriorating and lasting negative effects, not only on infant and child well being but also
      on mother's and father's mental health (Nancy K et al 2009). It is therefore important to
      introduce interventions aiming to improve mental health of mothers that could minimize the
      risk of diseases, and have positive effect child's on physical and psychological
      developmental wellbeing.

      Therefore, this project has been designed to assess the effectiveness of Interpersonal
      Psychotherapy for Postnatal Depression in Pakistan.

      Prevalence of depression in the postnatal period is 10% to 17 % in western world ( O 'Hara
      and Swain 1996; Josseffson et al 2001; Yoshida et al 2001) and 23% to 36% in the developing
      world (Rahman et al 2003; Patel et al 2002; Husain et al 2006).

      In developed countries, studies indicate that maternal depression is associated with
      long-term emotional, cognitive and behavioral problem in children. There is evidence of link
      between maternal psychopathology to physical health of child. Research evidence also
      indicates that long-term negative impact of postnatal depression is on the mother's mental
      health, on infant's development and on the marital relationship (Reay, Fisher, Robertson,
      Adams and Owen 2005).

      because of high prevalence of maternal depression in low income countries like Pakistan, the
      present study is designed to test the effectiveness of Interpersonal Psychotherapy for women
      with maternal depression. The participants will be recruited from Civil hospital Karachi and
      also from three different communities. total 50 participants will be recruited and randomized
      to 2 groups: either intervention or TAU group. Assessment will be done on baseline, after
      completion of intervention and 3 months after completion of intervention. Assessment will
      include Edinburg Postnatal depression scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder-7 and Rosenberg Self Esteem scale. Participants in intervention group will
      receive 12 sessions of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)

    <description>Interpersonal Psychotherapy will be delivered to Intervention group. The intervention group will be further divided into 3 groups (8 depressed mothers in each group). IPT is 12-16 week treatment, contains a supportive element, an educational element, parenting element and an interpersonal relationship element. Its goals include helping mothers feel supportive, empowered and confident about their parenting abilities, which will directly influence in reducing their depressive symptoms as well as resolution of interpersonal conflicts.
