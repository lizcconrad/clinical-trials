    <textblock>
      It has been found that arm and leg cycling is similar to walking. Thus, the objective of this
      research is to determine if arm and leg cycling can be used to improve walking ability in a
      post-stroke population. This outcome would directly impact the health and quality of life for
      those who have suffered a stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been found that arm and leg cycling is similar to walking in terms of the muscle
      activation patterns, joint ranges of motion, and neural pathways activated. Another advantage
      of arm and leg cycling is that it involves coordination of all four limbs in a rhythmic
      movement. This may be particularly beneficial given previous findings that arm movement
      contributes to the activation of leg muscles during walking in humans. This is achieved with
      interconnected neural pathways that link the arms to the legs. These neural interlimb
      connections remain intact in stroke victims, such that maximizing the contribution of the
      arms to the legs may increase coordination for walking.

      Thus, the objective of this research is to determine if arm and leg cycling can be used to
      increase the strength of inter-limb connections and if this helps to improve walking ability
      in a post-stroke population. 15-20 participants will be recruited to participate in a five
      week training intervention where measures will be taken before and after the intervention to
      assess efficacy. Arm and leg cycling could provide a novel method to improve inter-limb
      coupling and walking ability. These outcomes would directly impact the health and quality of
      life for those who have suffered a stroke.
