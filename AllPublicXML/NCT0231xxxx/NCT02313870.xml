      This controlled multi-center randomized clinical trial, with direct individual benefit, will
      compare efficacy and safety of two strategies in non-localized BP care: a combined regimen
      using initial superpotent topical steroids associated with methotrexate for 4 weeks followed
      by methotrexate alone for 8 months and superpotent topical steroids alone maintained 9 months
      (current standard of care). The expected result is an equivalence between the two compared
      strategies in terms of safety and efficacy, MTX monotherapy during the maintenance phase
      being easier to manage and therefore associated with better compliance than topical steroids
      with less cutaneous side effects and most cost-effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a rare mucocutaneous autoimmune bullous disorder (incidence
      &lt;1/10000 / year in France) that mostly affects elderly patients. Its mortality rate is as
      high as 20 to 40% at one year. A study initiated by the French group for bulllous disorders
      devoted to the study of autoimmune bullous diseases the study of autoimmune bullous diseases
      and which is an international leader on this issue, has previously demonstrated the efficacy
      and relatively good tolerance of superpotent topical corticosteroids in BP.However, the use
      of superpotent topical corticosteroids is flawed with practical difficulties (home-based care
      by nurses once or twice a day to administer treatment, this for several months) and its cost
      is significantly higher than that an oral steroid treatment as a consequence. On the other
      hand, there is probably a non-negligible systemic absorption of superpotent topicalsteroid
      responsible for potentially serious side effects similar to those encountered with systemic
      corticosteroids. Finally, a protracted treatment with superpotent topical steroid most often
      causes skin atrophy with deleterious consequences.It would then be of interest to be able to
      significantly reduce the duration of use of topical steroids through an early-associated
      systemic treatment relying on an easy-to-use and relatively safe molecule that would maintain
      the disease under control after an initial clinical remission has been achieved by initial
      and time-limited use of superpotent topical steroids. Methotrexate (MTX) could be an
      interesting candidate in this regard, with a low-level and tolerable short- and middle-term
      toxicity if small doses are used (10-15 mg / week) while its long-term safety is usually
      irrelevant in elderly patients. Its use and monitoring are relatively easy and a number of
      international publications, including two recent French ones, have shown efficacy in this
      setting including a relaying strategy after initial use of superpotent topical steroids in BP
      treatment, in preliminary open studies .These encouraging results prompt to propose a
      controlled multi-center randomized clinical trial, with direct individual benefit, comparing
      efficacy and safety of a treatment regimen using superpotent topical steroids alone
      maintained 9 months (current standard of care) to a mixed initial treatment combining
      applications of superpotent topical steroids associated with methotrexate for 4 weeks
      followed by methotrexate alone for 8 additional months in non-localized BP. In both arms, the
      total treatment duration will then be 9 months. The two arms of the study will be:Arm A:
      daily applications of topical clobetasol propionate at a dose of 10 to 30 g / day depending
      on the patient's weight and the initial number of new blisters per day, associated with
      methotrexate (MTX) received either orally or subcutaneously at a dose of 12.5 mg / week in
      patients weighing less than 60 kg and with creatinine clearance greater than 50 ml / min
      (planned dose reduction to 10 mg / week in patients less than 60 kg or with a creatinine
      clearance less than 50 ml / min) for four weeks followed by oral or subcutaneous methotrexate
      alone at the same dose during following 8 monthsArm B: daily applications of topical
      clobetasol propionate at a dose of 10 to 30 g / day depending on the patient's weight and the
      initial number of new blisters per day maintained until 14 days after full disease control
      followed by the same daily dose applied every other day for a month and then twice a week for
      a month and then once a week until the end of the 9th month.The primary endpoint will be the
      actuarial survival rate at one year in both groups and secondary endpoints will be the
      initial control rate of the disease, the number of serious side effects during treatment and
      the number of relapses during treatment.The expected result is an equivalence between the two
      compared strategies in terms of safety and efficacy, MTX monotherapy during the maintenance
      phase being easier to manage and therefore associated with better compliance than topical
      steroids with less cutaneous side effects and most cost-effective.This study will enroll 150
      patients per arm and will include a follow up of 9 months with 9 visits per patient.
