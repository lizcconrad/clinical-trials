  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery plays an important role in the treatment of anterior mediastinum disease. The major
      surgical approaches include: cervical approach, mid-sternal approach, cervical combined
      mid-sternal approach and video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. The cervical approach is
      rarely adopted because of its restricted visual field. The cervical combined mid-sternal
      approach have a broader field of vision, given this advantage, the surgeon can remove the
      thymus and its surrounding fat tissue more thoroughly. But the trauma of this approach is
      much larger, and the postoperative complication is also a serious problem. The video-assisted
      thoracoscope is often adopted by left or right approach, this minimally invasive procedure
      can not remove anterior mediastinum fat thoroughly. In clinical practice, the investigators
      designed a new method named &quot;3-Hole&quot; subxiphoid approach. This study is designed to compare
      the safety and validity between this new method and others.

    <description>The patient were in the supine position with legs apart at about 45°, made a 2.0 cm incision below xiphoid process as the observation hole. Then made two 0.5cm operation holes along bilateral rib arch at midclavicular line, two trocars were inserted into the two holes under the guidance of B-ultrasound.After that, carbon dioxide was pumped into the anterior mediastinum, the pressure was maintained at 8 mmH2O, ultrasound scalpel and a grasping forceps were inserted through the operating ports respectively. Retrosternal space including bilateral lower poles of thymus, internal mammary arteries and phrenic nerves were exposed by both blunt and sharp dissection. Then ultrasound scalpel were used to separate the thymus and its surrounding fat tissue, cut off thymic veins by ultrasound scalpel.For patients with myasthenia gravis, bilateral mediastinal pleurae and the affected adipose tissues had been thoroughly removed.</description>
