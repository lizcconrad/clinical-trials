  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracranial atherosclerosis is common vascular lesion in Asian acute stroke patients and
      intracranial atherosclerosis patients have high rate of coronary artery disease (CAD).
      Moreover, several studies showed obvious association of CAD and cerebrovascular stenosis,
      which had been proved to increase the risk of stroke after coronary revascularization
      including coronary bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention. In addition, the
      efficacy and safety of combined coronary and cerebral intervention are not fully
      investigated. Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics
      of coronary and cerebrovascular arteriosclerosis as measured by combined coronary and
      cerebral angiography, explore the relationship between inflammation, atherosclerosis-related
      markers and coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis and compare the efficacy and safety of
      simultaneous or staged coronary and cerebral interventional strategy in Chinese Patients.

      The coronary angiography and cerebrovascular angiography are performed for all participants.
      The combined strategy for coronary and cerebrovascular angiography is carried out routinely
      in the investigators institutions. Simultaneous strategy is considered as that performed via
      the same access and within the same day. Staged strategy is intended as that performed within
      7 days from the first procedure. The sequence of angiographies is established on an
      individual patient basis by the cardiovascular and neurointerventional team according to
      clinical symptoms of the patients and after coronary or cerebrovascular angiography. After
      combined coronary and cerebral angiography, simultaneous or staged interventional strategy
      will be performed in patients with severe coronary and cerebral stenosis. Blood sample is
      obtained from artery sheath when performing coronary or cerebral angiography. Lipid levels,
      inflammation and atherosclerosis-related markers will be measured in this study.

    <description>North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criteria were used for extracranial carotid stenosis calculations.The degree of extracranial carotid stenosis and stenosis in the extracranial segment of the vertebral artery was classified as normal, &lt;50%, 50-69%, 70-89%, and 90-99% stenosis, or occluded. We defined angiographic extracranial arterial stenosis as a diameter stenosis of ＞70% on the common carotid artery, the carotid bifurcation, the internal carotid artery, and vertebral artery.</description>

    <description>Intracranial stenoses were measured according to the methods described in the Warfarin-Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Disease Study. The degree of stenosis in the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery, stenosis in the intracranial segment of the vertebral artery, and stenosis in the basilar artery were classified as normal or ≤25%, 25-49%, ≥50% stenosis and occlusion. We defined angiographic intracranial cerebral artery stenosis as a diameter stenosis of ＞50% on the intracranial segment of the internal carotid artery and the vertebral artery, and the basilar artery. Stenoses were classified as moderate (50-69%) or severe (70-99%).</description>

    <description>The modified Gensini's stenosis scoring system was used to assess the severity of coronary lesions. The Gensini score was calculated by assigning a severity score to each coronary stenosis according to the degree of luminal narrowing and its geographic importance. Severity scores assigned to the specific percentage luminal diameter reduction of the coronary artery segment were 32 for 100%, 16 for 99%, 8 for 75%, 2 for 50%, and 1 for 25%.</description>
