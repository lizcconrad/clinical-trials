  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility and clinical evaluation study of the VisuMax femtosecond laser for
      refractive correction of hyperopia using the small incision lenticule extraction (ReLEx
      smile) method.

      In ReLEx® the VisuMax femtosecond laser creates two interfaces that define a refractive
      lenticule of stromal tissue. In ReLEx® FLEx, the upper interface is converted into a LASIK
      flap by the creation of a sidecut. The LASIK flap is lifted and the lenticule can be removed
      to correct the refractive error by tissue subtraction. In ReLEx® smile, the lenticule is
      dissected and removed through a small 2-3mm incision without the need to create a whole flap.

      The aims are i) to optimize the VisuMax settings for lenticule separation ii) to optimize the
      lenticule geometry iii) to assess the safety, efficacy and stability of the treatment

    <description>The VisuMax femtosecond laser is used to create two interfaces that define a refractive lenticule of stromal tissue and a 2mm wide tunnel to connect the upper layer to the corneal surface. The lenticule is manually dissected and removed through the small 2mm incision without the need to create a flap as in LASIK.</description>
