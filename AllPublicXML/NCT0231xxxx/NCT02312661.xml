  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Molecularly targeted agents which inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway
      and/or circumvent p53 in the induction of apoptosis are exciting potential targets in ovarian
      cancer. Metformin is a biguanide, widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus,
      that has shown anti-cancer activity in preclinical studies. The main mechanism of metformin's
      effect is mTOR pathway inhibition and, in addition, it has been shown to circumvent
      p53-induced apoptosis making it an exciting, potentially effective drug in ovarian cancer.

      A phase Ib, single-centre, dose-escalation trial with a traditional escalation rule with
      fixed dose levels (&quot;3 + 3&quot; rule). The recommended phase II dose will be defined as the
      maximum predefined dose level at which 0 of 3 or ≤ 1 of 6 subjects experience a drug-related
      dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1 and 2 of treatment. An estimated 10-20 patients
      will be required for this study.
