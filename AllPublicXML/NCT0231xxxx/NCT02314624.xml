  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ultimate goal is to facilitate the delivery of empirically supported treatments (ESTs)
      for mental disorders and to improve client mental health outcomes. Toward this end, this
      Phase II SBIR proposal seeks to complete the development and testing of PracticeGround, a
      comprehensive software system designed to integrate with electronic health records, and that
      contains multiple methods of training clinicians in ESTs and delivering ESTs to clients,
      continuous progress monitoring of client outcomes, and clinical support tools to guide
      clinicians and clients through delivery of the necessary EST. The investigators will conduct
      an 18-week randomized controlled trial (N=80) comparing PracticeGround (n=40) to
      care-as-usual (n=40) in depressed outpatient clients. PracticeGround clinicians will have
      full access to the software. Study clinicians and clients will be assessed once every six
      weeks (baseline, 6, 12, and 18 weeks). To ensure generalizability of findings, the
      investigators will not control for natural therapy variations (e.g.,session frequency,
      medication use, etc.). Primary outcomes include: depression, psychological distress,
      treatment satisfaction (clients and clinicians), and treatment drop out. Secondary clinician
      outcomes include: extent of PracticeGround use with clients across clinicians' caseload.
