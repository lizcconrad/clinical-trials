    <textblock>
      Fruquintinib administered at 5mg once daily(QD) in 4 weeks treatment cycle (three weeks on
      and one week off) was well tolerated and demonstrated encouraging preliminary clinical
      antitumor activity in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in phase Ib and phase
      2 study. This study is aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib in the
      treatment of patients with metastatic CRC who have progressed after second line or above
      standard chemotherapy

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III clinical trial
      to compare the efficacy and safety of Fruquintinib plus BSC versus placebo plus BSC in
      patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have progressed after second-line or above
      standard chemotherapy. After checking eligibility criteria, subjects will be randomized into
      Fruquintinib plus BSC group (treatment group) or placebo plus BSC group (control group) in a
      ration of 2:1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Overall Survival (OS). Secondary Efficacy
      Endpoints: Progression free survival (PFS) (According to RECIST Version 1.1), Objective
      Response Rate (ORR), Disease Control Rate (DCR), . Safety and tolerance will be evaluated by
      incidence, severity and outcomes of AEs and categorized by severity in accordance with the
      NCI CTC AE Version 4.0.
