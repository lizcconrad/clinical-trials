  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part, open-label, safety, tolerability, and PK study of FPA144. Patients will
      be enrolled in Part 1 (A or B, dose escalation) or Part 2 (dose expansion) of the study, but
      not both.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part 1A is a dose-escalation study in patients with any locally advanced or metastatic solid
      tumor or lymphoma for which standard therapies have been exhausted. Part 1B will further
      assess safety and evaluate PK of FPA144 in gastric cancer patients.

      Part 2 patients will be enrolled and treated in order to further characterize safety and
      preliminary efficacy in a selected cancer patient population with the greatest potential for
      clinical benefit from FPA144 treatment.
