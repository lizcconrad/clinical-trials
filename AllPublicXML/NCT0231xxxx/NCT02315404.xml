  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal bleeding originating from the small bowel is difficult to diagnose and treat
      because the small bowel is difficult to see and reach. Balloon assisted enteroscopy (BAE) is
      a new enteroscopy methods that allow examination of the small bowel and allows for diagnosis
      and treatment of bleeding originating from this part of the intestine. Unfortunately, BAE is
      unsuccessful in identifying the cause of bleeding in 40-50% of patients. This may be due to
      limited visualization of the small bowel lining during conventional endoscopy. One way to
      improve visualization of the small bowel lining is by adding a transparent plastic cap to the
      end of the endoscope (camera), which allows the endoscope to see around sharp turned and
      behind folds in the small bowel.

      The investigators goal in this randomized controlled study is to see if adding a transparent
      cap to the end of the endoscope will help to identify and treat small bowel bleeding. The
      investigators will invite patients referred for BAE to participate in the study; the
      alternative to participating in the study is having standard BAE (without a cap). If patients
      choose to participate in the study they will be randomized to BAE with or without a cap on
      the end of the endoscope. Subjects time commitment will be limited to the consent process and
      pre-procedure paperwork at time of initial endoscopy and time required to complete telephone
      questionnaire at 12 months follow up.

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic yield defined as proportion of enteroscopies in which any abnormality is detected.
a. Abnormalities classified as: i. P0: lesion with no bleeding potential, including visible submucosal veins, diverticula without the presence of blood or nodules without mucosal break.
ii. P1: lesion considered as having uncertain bleeding potential, such as a red spot on the intestinal mucosa or small erosions.
iii. P2: lesion considered to have high potential for bleeding; such as typical angiomata, large ulceration, tumor or varices</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Therapeutic yield being defined as proportion of enteroscopies in which a therapeutic intervention was undertaken. Interventions included in this calculation were polypectomy, argon plasma coagulation, bipolar coagulation, dilation of strictures, and endoscopic clipping. Biopsy was considered to be a therapeutic intervention if histopathology results lead to the initiation of a medical or surgical therapy (i.e: resection of mass, medical therapy for Crohn's disease)</description>
