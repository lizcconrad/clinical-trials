    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether it is better to introduce cancer
      patients to the palliative care team at a later date when there is a specific issue or
      problem or to introduce cancer patients to the palliative care team when first diagnosed
      before any specific issue or problem occurs.

      The investigators will conduct a one-year randomized, controlled study to evaluate the impact
      of an early, integrated palliative care services. The intervention will include comprehensive
      palliative care services delivered in conjunction with standard oncology care and patient
      friendly materials for high risk oncology patients. The investigators primary clinical
      endpoint will be health related quality of life, specifically focusing on measures of
      anxiety, depression, and well-being.

      Secondary personalized palliative care outcomes are expected to include:

        -  Reduced deviations from care plan as captured in the medical record compared to the
           group who did not receive early, integrated palliative care services

        -  Reduced hospital utilization compared to the group who did not receive early, integrated
           palliative care services

    <measure>Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General (FACT-G) Health Related Quality of Life Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT Measurement System is a group of questions which measure health-related quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients. The FACT-G is a 26-item version that addresses multiple QOL dimensions including physical well-being, functional well-being, emotional well-being and social well-being. The response format of the FACT Measurement System consists of a 5-point Likert scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>PROMIS Depression Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression scale is a highly reliable, validated, precise measures of patient-reported health status for physical, mental, and social well-being. The domains of depression are measured through four targeted questions each on a 5 point Likert scale.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patient level data will be obtained for this study through retrospective chart review. Data to be collected from patients' charts include oncology medications and treatments, outcomes and interventions over the course of treatment (surgeries, adverse events, death), and hospitalizations. Clinical interventions, treatments, and events extracted from the charts will inform the investigators analyses regarding health care resource utilization.</description>

    <description>Consenting patients will be approached by a research nurse to complete quality of life questionnaires (baseline measures) either in the oncology clinics or infusion clinics. Patients assigned to early palliative care will meet with a member of the palliative care team after enrollment and completion of the initial questionnaires to receive and review patient-oriented materials detailing palliative care services. Patients will then receive a comprehensive initial consult with a palliative care provider (a trained physician, nurse or nurse practitioner). Additional consults with the palliative care service will be scheduled approximately every 6 weeks for the duration of the study period (one year) at the discretion of the patient and palliative care provider.</description>
