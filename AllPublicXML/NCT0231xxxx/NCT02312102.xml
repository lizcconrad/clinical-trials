      This research study is evaluating drugs called bortezomib and lenalidomide as a possible
      treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the bortezomib
      and lenalidomide investigational combination. This drug combination has been used in the
      treatment of relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and has been previously investigated in the
      treatment of MDS and AML, albeit at a lower dose of lenalidomide. In this research study, the
      investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination that can be given safely
      and see how well it works as a combination for MDS and AML in individuals whose disease has
      relapsed after an SCT.

      -  After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:

        -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar for each treatment cycle. The
           investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that
           can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants
           that have, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same
           dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who
           have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

        -  Dose escalation will occur using a standard 3+3 dose escalation approach, beginning in
           dose level I with dose cohorts and rules for escalation and de-escalation.

        -  Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks). The first two cycles are called the
           induction cycles. If the participant respond to treatment during the first two cycles,
           they can continue on to the maintenance cycles.

Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks). The first two cycles are called the induction cycles. If the participant respond to treatment during the first two cycles, they can continue on to the maintenance cycles.
During the induction and maintenance cycles, patients receive up to the MTD of lenalidomide on days 1-21 days only. During days 22-28 (4th week) there is a rest period.
Bortezomib: During the induction cycles, the medication will be given on days 2, 5, 9, and 12 followed by a 17-day rest period. During the maintenance cycles, bortezomib will be given on days 2, and 5 followed by 23-day rest period.</description>
