    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study consists of 2 parts: 1) The main study, which is randomized,
      placebo-controlled, observer-blind; 2) A sub-study, which is open-label, uncontrolled,
      non-randomized study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of MVA-BN-Filo
      and Ad26.ZEBOV administered in different sequences and schedules to healthy adult
      participants. The study consists of a Screening period (up to 28 days in the main study and
      up to 56 days in the sub-study), a vaccination period in which participants will be
      vaccinated at baseline (Day 1) followed by a boost on Day 15, 29 or 57, and a post-boost
      follow-up until all participants have had their 21-day post-boost visit (Day 36, 50 or Day
      78). The total duration of the study will be about 1 year for participants who received
      vaccine and about 3 months for participants who received placebo. Safety will be monitored
      during the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history, and the
             investigator's clinical judgment

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum β-human chorionic
             gonadotropin pregnancy test at screening, a negative urine pregnancy test immediately
             prior to each study vaccine administration, and practice adequate birth control
             measures from 28 days before the prime vaccination until at least 3 months after the
             boost vaccination as specified in the study protocol. If not heterosexually active at
             screening, must agree to practice adequate birth control measures if they become
             heterosexually active during their participation in the study (from screening onwards
             until at least 3 months after the boost vaccination). Agree not to donate eggs (ova,
             oocytes) for the purposes of assisted reproduction from screening onwards until at
             least 3 months after the boost vaccination

          -  Women of non-childbearing potential, defined as postmenopausal (&gt;45 years of age with
             amenorrhea for ≥2 years or any age with amenorrhea for ≥6 months and serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;40 mIU/mL) or surgically sterile (hysterectomy,
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy), are not required to use the
             birth control methods as specified in the study protocol

          -  A man who is sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential and who has not
             had a vasectomy must agree to use a double-barrier method of birth control, such as
             either condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository or partner with
             occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
             foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In case the female partner is using an adequate
             method of birth control, a single-barrier method of birth control for the male subject
             is acceptable. Men must also agree not to donate sperm from screening onwards until at
             least 3 months after the boost vaccination

          -  Must be available and willing to participate for the duration of the study visits and
             follow-up, provide verifiable identification, and have a means to be contacted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has been vaccinated with a candidate Ebola vaccine

          -  Has been diagnosed with Ebola disease or exposed to Ebola including travel to West
             Africa in the last 12 months. West Africa includes but is not limited to the countries
             of Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone

          -  Has received any Ad26- or MVA-based candidate vaccine in the past

          -  Known allergy or history of anaphylaxis or other serious adverse reactions to vaccines
             or vaccine products (including any of the constituents of the study vaccines),
             including known allergy to egg or aminoglycosides

          -  A woman who is pregnant or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant while
             enrolled in the study or within 3 months after the boost vaccination

          -  History of diabetes mellitus type 1 or type 2, including cases controlled with diet
             alone; thyroidectomy, or thyroid disease requiring medication during the last 12
             months; uncontrolled hypertension as defined in the study protocol; or, major
             psychiatric illness and/or substance abuse problems during the past 12 months that in
             the opinion of the investigator would preclude participation
