  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the randomized controlled study is to determine effects of an adjusted amount of
      oral nutritional supplements on the quality of life, the nutritional status, side effects,
      and response to therapy, in patients with pancreatic and hepatocellular carcinoma receiving
      palliative therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is often associated with malnutrition and weight loss. The occurence of malnutrition
      during the course of the disease depends on the type, extent, and therapy of the tumor.
      Pancreatic cancer patients and patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are particularly at
      risk of developing a pronounced weight loss. Cancer-related malnutrition has negative impact
      on the response to therapy, survival, quality of life, and the infection rate of patients,
      resulting in prolonged hospital stays and higher costs for health care. Maintaining or
      optimizing the quality of life in patients receiving palliative therapy has priority. Since a
      poor nutritional status affects the quality of life, patients might benefit from the use of
      an adjusted amount of oral nutritional supplements.

      To determine the effects of oral nutritional supplements, a controlled randomized study will
      be conducted.
