      The aim of this study is to assess whether vaginal misoprostol reduces pain during office
      hysteroscopy in parous patients with no risk factors for experiencing severe or unacceptable
      pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical ripening with misoprostol to minimize the pain experienced during office
      hysteroscopy has been proposed by several authors.

      The use of misoprostol is usually associated with undesired side effects and therefore any
      beneficial effect of misoprostol on reducing pain should be weighed against its undesired
      side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, shivering, pain) and coasts. Till now , no
      studies have yet determined whether misoprostol should be used routinely or for the subgroup
      of patients at higher risk for cervical stenosis.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether vaginal misoprostol reduces pain during office
      hysteroscopy in parous patients with no risk factors for experiencing severe or unacceptable
      pain.

    <description>Misoprostol (400µg) will be administered vaginally 12 hours before office hysteroscopy. A rigid 2.9 mm hysteroscope with 30° forward oblique lens will be used in the procedure. The uterine cavity will be distended by warm saline at a pressure between 60-80 mmHg. All the procedures will be performed during the proliferative phase using the vaginoscopic approach as described by Betocchi and Selvaggi in 1997 . All the procedures will be diagnostic.
Pain intensity will be assessed by visual analogue scale during the examination and 30 minutes after the procedure. A visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 will be used (zero indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible experienced pain).</description>
