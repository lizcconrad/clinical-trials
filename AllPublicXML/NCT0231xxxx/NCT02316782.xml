      The purpose of this research study is to determine if Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)
      grayscale and VH (Virtual Histology)-IVUS pre-stenting can assess more accurately the
      location, amount, and type of a blockage than angiogram alone. Additionally, this study is to
      determine if IVUS grayscale and VH-IVUS guidance will result in improved acute and long term
      procedural outcome vs. bifurcation stenting with only angiographic guidance in native
      coronary arteries.

      Global multi-center, prospective, two-arm, randomized study. Patients will be randomized to
      either blinded or non-blinded IVUS assessment before the treatment of coronary bifurcation
      lesions. Treatment will be based either on grayscale and VH IVUS versus angiography alone.

      After routine coronary angiogram, the physicians in the blinded arm of the study will only
      use the angiogram to guide the DES stenting procedure; the non-blinded arm will use the
      angiogram and IVUS grayscale and VH-IVUS to guide the procedure. In all patients, both pre-
      and post intervention, IVUS grayscale and VH-IVUS will be preformed on both branches of the
      bifurcation (blinded or non-blinded).

    <description>The primary objective of this randomized study is to demonstrate that pre-intervention IVUS can provide more accurate information on lesion characteristics than information derived from pre-procedural angiogram alone. This will be determined by full lesion coverage, no acute evidence of plaque protrusion or dissection at the stent edge, no evidence of stent underexpansion, no evidence of stent malapposition, or no significant side branch disease left behind.</description>

        Per Protocol Population All patients who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, completed
        the study intervention procedure as described in the protocol, and completed the 1-month
        follow-up.

        Intent to Treat Any subject randomized into the trial and there was an attempt to use the
        IVUS but either side branch was not IVUS'd pre and post intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must be greater than 18 years of age.

          2. Patient is scheduled for coronary stenting of a bifurcation lesion in a native artery
             using Drug Eluting Stents (DES).

          3. Patient must be willing and able to read and sign the informed consent document before
             planned coronary intervention.

          4. If the patient is female and of child bearing potential, a pregnancy test (serum HcG
             or urine dip stick) is negative within 7 days of the procedure.

          5. Side branch lumen diameter min of &gt;2 mm by visual, angiographic estimate.
