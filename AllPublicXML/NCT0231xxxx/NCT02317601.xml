  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Study is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The Objective is to
      investigate the effect of single-high-dose glucocorticoid on surgical stress response and
      postoperative delirium among Elderly hip Fracture Patients undergoing surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Hip Fracture are exposed for two traumas that can trigger a stress response.
      The first is the fall that causes the Fracture. The second is the surgery. In this study the
      intervention is dispensed early in the disease course - as soon as the Fracture has been
      diagnosed and booked for surgery.
