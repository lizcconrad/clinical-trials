      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of a nicotine patch as a treatment for
      problems with attention, learning and memory in breast cancer patients who are 1-5 years post
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have suggested that chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer may change the way the
      brain functions. As a result, patients who receive chemotherapy for breast cancer may
      experience problems with their attention, learning, and memory that they did not have before
      receiving chemotherapy. The investigators have found that nicotine treatment can help other
      types of patients with similar difficulties with attention, learning, and memory. Nicotine is
      a naturally occurring substance found in tobacco and is known to interact with nerve cells in
      the brain that are important for functions like learning and memory, and has been studied in
      a number of disorders. This study is designed to test whether nicotine treatment is helpful
      for learning and memory problems after chemotherapy for breast cancer.

      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot study to evaluate the effect of
      transdermal nicotine to 1) reduce subjective complaints and 2) enhance cognitive performance
      on laboratory measures of cognitive performance in breast cancer patients with persistent
      chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI), a condition also known as &quot;chemo brain.&quot;
      Participants will be randomized to either placebo or active compound (50/50) for the 6-week
      treatment portion of the study. Participants will be assessed before, during, and at the end
      of treatment. At the end of the 8-week study, participants will have the option to take part
      in the open-label portion of the study for an additional 6 weeks.

    <description>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog)scale will be used to monitor change in CRCI subjective complaints. This instrument has been used to monitor change in CRCI subjective complaints in previous studies and demonstrates good internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and discriminant and convergent validity. This 37-item questionnaire is a self-report measure of cognitive function that aims to evaluate the &quot;real world&quot; impact of CRCI. It consists of four subscales (PCI: Perceived Cognitive Impairments, PCA: Perceived Cognitive Abilities, QOL: Impact on quality of life, and Oth: Comments from Others) and evaluates memory, concentration, mental acuity, verbal fluency, functional interference, and multitasking ability. Higher scores indicate better cognitive functioning.</description>

    <description>Our cognitive performance battery will consist of subtests from the CogState battery and other computerized and verbal tests. The CogState battery (CogState Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) is comprised of a subset of tasks that includes measures of various cognitive domains. The tasks in the CogState battery have been specifically designed to assist with decisions about the presence or absence of cognitive change Other computerized tasks such as the Critical Flicker Fusion (CFF) task, the Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task, and the Conners Continuous Performance Test (CPT) will also be givenThe Buschke Selective Reminding Task (SRT) will be used to assess immediate and delayed memory recall.</description>

    <description>Nicotine will be delivered by a transdermal patch delivery system for topical application. Each patch will contain approximately 1.75mg nicotine/cm2, and releases 7, and 14mg of nicotine, respectively, over 24 hours. Patches will be applied for 16 hours per day. Participants will be titrated over the course of the 6-week treatment period in order to avoid initial side effects as follows:
Week 1: ½ 7 mg patch per day, Week 2: 7 mg patch per day, Weeks 3-4: ¾ 14 mg patch per day, Weeks 5-6: 14 mg per day, Weeks 7-8: Treatment withdrawal</description>

Week 1: ½ 7 mg patch per day, Week 2: 7 mg patch per day, Weeks 3-4: ¾ 14 mg patch per day, Weeks 5-6: 14 mg per day, Weeks 7-8: Treatment withdrawal</description>

    <description>Nicotine patches are currently FDA approved for smoking cessation. Nicotine has effects that have been well studied for many years. Studies have shown that nicotine by itself does not appear by itself to be cancer causing. The use of the nicotine patch is not expected to increase risk of breast cancer recurrence.</description>
