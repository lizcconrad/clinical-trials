  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a prototype device detecting zinc protoporphyrin-IX fluorescence
      non-invasively from the intact oral mucosa. Zinc protoporphyrin-IX is an established
      indicator of iron deficiency. The prototype device is used to measure the erythrocyte zinc
      protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratio for women after delivery, a study group chosen because of an
      elevated risk of iron deficiency. The results from the non-invasive measurements are compared
      to reference measurements of the erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratio from residual
      blood samples from the same patients and to other indicators of iron status, including
      hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and soluble transferrin
      receptor.

      This trial is a proof-of-concept study using a prototype fiber optic fluorometer to acquire
      autofluorescence spectra from women after delivery and determine the erythrocyte zinc
      protoporphyrin-IX fluorescence intensity from these spectra. The non-invasively determined
      fluorescence spectra are evaluated to provide a quantitative measure of the erythrocyte zinc
      protoporphyrin-IX/heme concentration ratio. These values are primarily compared to an
      erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX determined by HPLC from residual blood samples from the
      same subjects and secondarily to erythrocyte zinc protoporphyrin-IX/heme ratios determined
      using a commercial hematofluorometer (AVIV, model 206d) and other indicators of iron status,
      including hemoglobin, ferritin, serum iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation and soluble
      transferrin receptor

      This study could help to establish the non-invasive fluorescence measurement of zinc
      protoporphyrin-IX as a rapid, easy to use means for point-of-care screening for iron
      deficiency in resource-limited settings lacking laboratory infrastructure.
