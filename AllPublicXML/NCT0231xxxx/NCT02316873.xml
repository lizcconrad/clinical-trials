      The purpose of this study is to determine whether music training is an effective treatment of
      reading disorders

      Introduction: Children with dyslexia show deficits in temporal processing, both in language
      and in music. Musical activity increases phonological awareness, word segmentation, working
      memory, as well as reading abilities in children with typical development, a compelling
      evidence for a role of music training in fostering brain plasticity. Within this theoretical
      framework, we investigate the hypothesis that music training, by improving temporal
      processing and rhythm abilities, improves phonological awareness and reading skills in
      children with dyslexia.

      Methods: The study is a prospective, multicenter, open randomized controlled trial,
      consisting of test, rehabilitation and re-test
