    <textblock>
      The European Home Mechanical Ventilation Registry (EHMVR) will enable a thorough evaluation
      of HMV by documenting the characteristics of HMV patients and their treatment. This will
      facilitate a prospective, observational study to identify the primary indications for HMV,
      describe patterns of HMV use in European countries, and characterize changes in the
      initiation and utilization of HMV over time. The registry will target all adult individuals
      who have an indication for HMV. In the EHMVR, patient data from routine clinical care will be
      documented using an electronic case report form (eCRF). The eCRF will record: patient
      demographic data; diagnostic information (including primary diagnosis, 6-minute walk time,
      the presence of depression, and quality of life); blood gases; ventilation treatment
      (including type of ventilator, modes and settings, interfaces used); follow-up data
      (including failure rates, side effects, technical issues). An initial Pilot Phase will be
      launched with the aim to enrol at least 200 patients over a 6-month period to determine the
      feasibility of the registry. Steering committee members and their institutions will be the
      main participants in the Pilot Phase. After completion of the Pilot Phase, the registry will
      be expanded across Europe with the goal of enrolling approximately 10,000 patients over 5
      years.

  <detailed_description>

      The data (baseline and follow-up) should be collected as part of routine clinical care. In
      clinical practice, after HMV initiation, the first control examination (follow-up number one)
      with nocturnal diagnostics should take place within the first 4-8 weeks. Annual follow-up is
      required, and it is recommended that subsequent control visits should be performed 1-2 times
      a year. Each patient will be included for 5 years (total duration of the registry).

        The registry will target all adult individuals who have an indication for HMV (including
        those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], central hypoventilation syndrome [CHS],
        chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], kyphoscoliosis, obesity hypoventilation
        syndrome [OHS], spinal cord injury [SCI], Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD], muscular
        dystrophies [MDs] other than DMD, myopathies and myotonic dystrophy [Steinert's muscular
        dystrophy; SMD]). All newly-diagnosed patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are
        eligible for HMV treatment as part of routine care can be included in the registry.
        Patients who satisfy all the inclusion criteria will be consecutively enrolled into the
        registry.
