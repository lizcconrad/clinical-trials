      The aim of this randomized, stratified, single-blinded study is to compare two home based
      strength-training protocols (High Intensity Interval Training and Progressive Resistance
      Training) and their effects on muscle strength, gait and aerobic and anaerobic capacity in
      children with cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is a common neuro-developmental disorder. Among other signs of upper motor
      neuron syndrome, walking pathologies and muscle weakness are leading signs of disability in
      children with cerebral palsy. Moreover, the gradual decline in muscle strength is part of the
      aging process and can be particularly devastating for people with motor disabilities.
      Therefore muscle-strengthening programs are indicated for children with cerebral palsy. There
      is evidence that lower extremity muscle strength can be increased by Progressive Resistance
      Training (PRT) in children with cerebral palsy. However, PRT is time consuming and therefore
      not always feasible for children with neurologic disorders. Moreover, it does not influence
      the anaerobic capacity needed for everyday activities in children. High Intensity Interval
      Training (HIIT) is a time efficient method, which increases both aerobic and anaerobic
      capacities. The aim of this randomized, stratified, single-blinded study is to compare two
      home based strength-training protocols (HIIT and PRT) and their effects on muscle strength,
      gait and aerobic and anaerobic capacity in children with cerebral palsy.

    <measure>Change in time for Muscle Power Sprint Test</measure>
    <time_frame>between baseline and 2 months later (end of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Short-term muscle power will be measured using the mean power (in watts) derived from the Muscle Power Sprint Test. This test has been shown to be reliable in children with cerebral palsy. For the test, the children are instructed to complete six 15m runs at maximum pace. Between each run, the child is allowed a timed 10 second rest. Mean power output (in watts) is calculated based on the child's body weight and the average time taken to perform the six all-out sprints.</description>

    <description>The key for the PRT is the timely progression of load, based on the child's individual level of strength, which ensures progressive overload.
Every training session will consist of a warm up, progressive resistance exercises and a cool down period. During warm up and cool down periods.These exercises will be the same for both training groups.
The strength training exercises have been chosen to strengthen the main lower extremity muscle groups which are important for the gait: sit-to-stand, lateral step-ups, the half knee rise, heel-rises and bridging.
All these exercises are performed loaded according to the individual level. Three sets of 8 to 10 repetitions of each exercise will be practiced on 3 non-consecutive days with moderate velocity.</description>

    <description>The High Intensity Circuit Training is a sub form of High Intensity Interval Training. The key feature is the very little rest between the exercises which causes a consistent elevation of the participant's heart rate and a short duration of the whole exercise session. Every training session consists of a warm-up, a circuit of 5 exercises (the same as these in the PRT group) and a cool-down period. The children will be asked to train 3 times a week on non-consecutive days and to perform 3 sets. Exercise workload is controlled by determination of time intervals (30 seconds). The children will be instructed to perform as many repetitions as possible during the exercise interval and to keep the rest between the exercises short (it must not exceed 30 seconds).</description>
