    <textblock>
      Patients with heart attacks caused by blocked coronary arteries are usually treated with a
      technique called primary angioplasty. Although this treatment is very successful it can
      result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened due to reperfusion injury.
      Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in
      some patients but not in others, however it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive
      and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery. We are investigating a simpler way to
      cool the heart muscle directly using cooled fluid passed through the catheter without the
      shortcomings of entire body cooling. This pilot will address safety and feasibility
      considerations.

    <textblock>
      The precise mechanisms involved in ischaemia/reperfusion injury is not fully understood but a
      number of factors are thought to contribute to cardiac dysfunction14, 15. These include : 1.
      reperfusion arrhythmias; 2. microvascular obstruction or no-reflow phenomenon; 3. myocardial
      stunning and 4. cardiomyocyte apoptosis. It is estimated that ischaemia/reperfusion injury
      occurs in &gt; 30% of patients and is associated with reduced myocardial salvage and poor
      prognosis16-18. Ischaemia/reperfusion injury may account for up to 50% of the final infarct
      size9.

      Deep hypothermia (&lt; 30 Â°C) has long been used in protecting the heart during coronary artery
      bypass grafting and heart transplantation. Intermittent antegrade or retrograde infusion of
      cold cardioplegia appears to reduce myocardial ischaemia and improves outcome19, 20. Deep
      hypothermia however can cause spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and impaired cardiac
      function and its application is limited to the unconscious patient.
