    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well Avatar-directed chemotherapy works in treating patients
      with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer that does not respond to platinum
      anti-cancer drugs. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, gemcitabine hydrochloride,
      pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, topotecan hydrochloride, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Using an Avatar, a living tumor
      sample with similar genetic characteristics to the original tumor, may help determine which
      chemotherapy is most effective.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate of Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy in patients with
      platinum-resistant ovarian, primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the progression-free survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian,
      primary peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy.

      II. To determine the overall survival of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary
      peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy.

      III. To determine the adverse events for patients with platinum-resistant ovarian, primary
      peritoneal and fallopian tube cancers receiving Avatar-directed salvage chemotherapy.

      IV. To determine the correlation between patient response and response in their Avatar.

      V. To enrich the Avatar response signature in response to Avatar-directed therapy using
      patient outcomes.

      VI. To compare the response rates between patients who did or did not receive bevacizumab
      treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment arms as directed by Avatar results.

      ARM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1-96 hours on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity

      ARM B: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 60 minutes on
      day 1. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 every 21 days
      or days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients may also receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes
      on day 1 every 21 days or days 1 and 15 every 28 days. Courses repeat every 21 or 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.

               -  Vaccines and immunotherapy All of these exceptions should be confirmed with the
                  Principal Investigator (PI) prior to registration

          -  Co-morbid systemic illnesses or other severe concurrent disease which, in the judgment
             of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this study or
             interfere significantly with the proper assessment of safety and toxicity of the
             prescribed regimens

          -  Immunocompromised patients and patients known to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             positive and currently receiving antiretroviral therapy; Note: patients known to be

             eligible for this trial

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness judged by the treating investigator to preclude
             treatment with chemotherapy

          -  Receiving any other investigational agent which would be considered as a treatment for
             the primary neoplasm

          -  Other active malignancy =&lt; 3 years prior to registration; EXCEPTIONS: non-melanotic
             skin cancer or carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix; Note: if there is a history of prior
