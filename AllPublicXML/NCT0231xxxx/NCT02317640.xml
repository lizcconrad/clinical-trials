  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to understand what happens to muscle and bone in spinal cord injured
      males after four months of training using stand training, with body weight support (BWS),
      with testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), and electrical stimulation (ES). Specifically,
      researchers will investigate nerve, muscle, and bone changes in the lower limbs in response
      to stand training and ES when combined with TRT compared to i) standing alone with TRT; ii)
      stand training alone with placebo; iii) stand training alone and ES with placebo.

      Primary Aim:

      To assess the effects of our novel tri combination Activity-Dependent Rehabilitation model
      approach on muscle volume of the lower limbs.

      Secondary Aims:

      i) To better define the mechanisms that contribute to changes in muscle.

      Preliminary data from animal studies have shown increased expression of Activin receptor IIB
      and increased nuclear localization of Smad2 and Smad3 after SCI and that these adverse
      changes are reversed by androgens. Additional studies will examine mRNA levels for myostatin,
      its receptor and its inhibitors (e.g., follistatins) and determine nuclear levels of Smad2
      and Smad3. We will also measure resting energy expenditure to confirm that changes in muscles
      mass correspond to anticipated metabolic effects.

      ii) To evaluate the changes in bone and bone structure with Stand Training with TRT and ES.

      Individuals with SCI not only lose motor and/or sensory function, they experience dramatic
      muscle and bone loss. Locomotor training, an activity-based intervention that engages the
      neuromuscular system below the level of lesion for standing and walking enhances EMG activity
      and has shown modest improvements in muscle without any attenuation in bone density
      [172-177]. Dynamic stand training, an important component of locomotor training, provides
      sensory feedback related to standing and bilateral weight bearing, resulting in bilateral
      muscle activation via central pathways through the spinal cord [161,178-181]. Thus, the stand
      retraining component provides a physiologically relevant multi-muscle activation through
      central pathways, dynamic gravity opposed loading of the legs and additional task specific
      activation of the muscles [161,162,179]. Functional electrical stimulation is a method of
      exercise that has been employed in the SCI population and has demonstrated success in
      improving muscle, with less conclusive evidence for its effect on bone albeit there has been
      speculation that although slowing or preventing bone loss may be feasible after SCI,
      reversing such bone loss (i.e. restoring bone) is not possible, although the evidence is
      primarily from applying FES to single muscles [151,171]. TRT has been shown to offer a
      logical, efficacious, and cost-effective intervention to, in part, counteract these untoward
      body composition, metabolic, and functional sequelae of relative hypogonadism in those with
      chronic SCI [37]. In addition, testosterone alone has been shown to increase muscle mass,
      muscle strength, and bone in androgen-deficient men and older men with low testosterone
      levels [182,183]. The model of compressive loads generated during the combination of stand
      retraining and multi muscle ES will be multi-directional and will increase muscle strength
      and the forces applied to the hip, femur and tibia bones. We anticipate that the model of
      standing plus TRT will increase muscle mass and strength more than standing alone. The
      combination of multi muscle TRT+ES while stand training will further increase muscle strength
      compared to either arm alone, resulting in an increased synergistic response of benefit which
      will surpass the threshold needed to significantly increase bone restoration
      [102,184,185].This novel tri-combination synergistic approach of TRT, ES, and Stand Training
      is being hypothesized to increase muscle mass and strength to a greater extent than that of
      each alone or than that of only two of these interventions. Measurements of muscle torques
      will be obtained to demonstrate a quantifiable relationship between muscle strength and bone
      mass.

    <description>Standing training will be prescribed 3 days/week (1.5 hours/sessions) for 60 sessions. All individuals randomized to stand training will train with BWST with manual assistance and will undergo a stand evaluation. During the evaluation the participants will be placed on the treadmill in an upright position and suspended in a harness by an overhead cable (i.e. BWST). A trainer will be positioned to assist the participant while standing and to provide manual assistance if needed. The amount of BWS and level of assistance given for each body segment will be recorded. The BWS level at which the participant can independently support good standing posture will also be recorded. Standing time while on treadmill and overground will be recorded daily as part of the training sessions.</description>

    <description>Stand Training as described above with Placebo or testosterone Gel applied by a pump. After a baseline testing period, TRT will begin in the treatment groups by application of a daily dose of 40.5 mg of testosterone or placebo gel. The gel is to be applied to the upper arms and shoulders and is absorbed and eliminated over the course of a day. To ensure proper dosing serum T concentration will be assessed at screening, baseline, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 month time points. As such, follow-up with the participant will be necessary to determine the correct replacement dose of TRT, and adjustment of dose if needed, (i.e. 40.5 mg up to 81 mg of gel). If serum T levels are not within normal range at the 2 week time point, the dose will be increased in increments of 20.25 mg up to 81 mg.</description>
