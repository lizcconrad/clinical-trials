  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to establish the acceptability and evaluate the limited efficacy of Simple
      Reminiscence (SR), a home-delivered non-pharmacological intervention designed to relieve
      stress, improve affect, and prevent or quell disruptive or maladaptive behaviors in
      community-residing individuals diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease (EAD). Unmanaged
      episodes of anxiety can be antecedents of maladaptive behaviors, including agitation, anger,
      and sometimes even violence.

      SR is a dyadic strategy; both the person with EAD and the caregiver engaged the patient's
      memory to interrupt a current episode of anxiety.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the intervention, family caregivers are trained to collaborate with and guide
      patients to access positive memories as a way to manage or move past the anxiety that plagues
      individuals with EAD - often arising when confronted by common complex tasks they previously
      were able to perform.

      During the project's first six months (phase 1), the investigators will develop a series of 4
      video-vignettes illustrating dyads (including one member with EAD) managing a variety of
      anxiety provoking scenarios associated with EAD (e.g., trouble reconciling a checkbook)
      through the use of SR.

      During the second phase of the project, a research assistant will administer SR at four home
      visits. The SR intervention has three components:

        1. A didactic component using the SR manual that the couple retains (15 minutes);

        2. Viewing one of the brief video-vignettes illustrating the application of reminiscence
           techniques (5 minutes; a different video-vignette will be viewed at each visit; and

        3. Facilitation of caregiver practice in applying the techniques, using a recent example of
           anxiety-linked experience of the person with EAD (10 minutes). The caregiver is
           encouraged to learn and practice the techniques in order to cue and coach the person
           with EAD in their use.

      The attention control treatment, a Social Visit, is a 30-minute activity in which the person
      with EAD, the caregiver and the research assistant (RA) review and discuss the day's
      newspaper headlines. The RA will use communication techniques specifically designed to keep
      the conversation present focused.

      Both members of the dyad will collect saliva to evaluate diurnal cortisol secretion.
