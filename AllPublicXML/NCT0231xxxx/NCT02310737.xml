      The purpose of this study is to compare sharp and blunt fascial entry during caesarean
      section.

      The patients will be divided into two group, The fascia will be opened with a sharp scissors
      in first group (group1), on the other hand in group 2 fascia distracted from the muscle
      tissue with a blunt maneuver. The study is planning to perform on women having cesarean
      section for the first time in their life and who have not previously had lower abdominal
      surgery before. The following parameters are evaluated for each patients

      1. All patients are evaluated for postoperative pain with VAS score when they first mobilized
      and following postoperative1, 3 and 7 days; 1 and 3 months 2. Postoperative sensory loss on
      skin incision scar, lower abdomen, pelvic region, groin, inner thigh, and labia majus
