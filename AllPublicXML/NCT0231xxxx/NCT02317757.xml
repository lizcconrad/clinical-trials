  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      These days, there is higher proportion of elderly cancer patients. Most of them have
      comorbidities, borderline performance status and nutritional status. The discontinuation of
      chemotherapy due to unbearable toxicities was not uncommon. Comprehensive geriatric
      assessment might be beneficial in selection of suitable elderly patients for chemotherapy
      administration.

      The patients with the age more than 70 years old who scheduled for chemotherapy were
      enrolled. Geriatric assessment was performed before starting chemotherapy. The toxicity will
      be recorded prospectively. Predisposing factors of grade 3 and 4 toxicity will be reported.
