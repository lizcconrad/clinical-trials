      The investigators hypothesize that this single-cell analysis can be used to evaluate prostate
      needle-core biopsies prospectively even in non-homogenous samples by providing profiles of
      proteomic and phenotypic signatures. These profiles will in turn enable better predictions of
      the malignant progression of prostate cancers in the settings of current clinical practice.

    <textblock>
      Current approaches for early detection and diagnosis include prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
      which is a useful, though not specific, biomarker for detecting prostate cancer. The
      suspected patients will be further sent for digital rectal examination(DRE), in which a
      doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the patient's rectum to feel for lumps,
      enlargements, or areas of hardness that might indicate prostate cancer. However, the only
      test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a biopsy - the removal of
      small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. If cancer is suspected using PSA
      test and DRE, more than 90% suspected patients choose undergo prostate biopsy. Prostate
      needle biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization.
      Markedly, the fine needle biopsy is minimally invasive and has currently been suggested for
      longitudinal monitoring of highly suspected patients or follow-up therapeutic responses. The
      large availability of biopsy samples for prostate cancer provides a cornerstone for the
      proposed patient specimen-based research. The investigators anticipate that comprehensive
      analysis rather than simple pathological examination of these samples will generate new
      insights to prostate tumor progression in human.

      Research samples will be placed in separate, de-identified specimen jars. Following each
      case, investigators on this protocol will provide the de-identified specimen jars to
      collaborators to perform single-cell analysis. All clinical specimens will be handled by
      pathology according to existing protocols.

      Processing of the samples will include disassociated into a single cell suspension and
      culturing the sample. This suspension can be then placed onto a microfluidic device for
      processing. It is hypothesized that collection of samples in this manner will allow the
      comparison of molecular profiles with clinically accepted standards to impact prospective
      research on prostate cancer.
