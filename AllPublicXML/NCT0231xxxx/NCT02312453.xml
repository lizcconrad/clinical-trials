      Abstract

      Introduction: The brachial plexus at the infraclavicular level runs deeper compared to its
      course proximally, giving rise to impaired needle visualisation due to the steep angle of
      needle insertion with the current ultrasound-guided approach. A new posterior parasagittal
      in-plane ultrasound-guided infraclavicular approach was introduced to improve needle
      visibility. However no further follow up study was done.

      Methods: We performed a case series and a cadaveric dissection to assess its feasibility in a
      single centre, University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from November 2012
      to October 2013. After obtaining approval from the Medical Ethics Committee, University
      Malaya Medical Centre, 18 patients undergoing upper limb surgery were prospectively
      recruited. A cadaveric dissection was also performed. The endpoints of this study were the
      success rate, performance time, total anaesthesia related time, quality of anaesthesia and
      any incidence of complications.

      Introduction Our study focus on the ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block,
      which is a cord-level block of the brachial plexus for surgical procedures below mid-humerus.
      The brachial plexus at this level runs deeper compared to its course proximally, giving rise
      to impaired needle visualisation due to the steep angle of needle insertion with the current
      ultrasound-guided approach (lateral para-sagittal in-plane technique).1

      A new ultrasound-guided posterior approach parasagittal in-plane infraclavicular block was
      introduced to improve needle visibility.2 However no further follow up study was done.

      Therefore, we performed a case series of 18 patients with a cadaveric dissection, to assess
      the feasibility of this approach.

      Methods After obtaining ethics committee approval from the Medical Ethics Committee,
      University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Chairperson Professor Dr. Looi Lai
      Meng; IRB reference no. 949.14 dated 17 October 2012, amendment no.1038.76 dated 19 December
      2013) and written informed consent, 18 patients undergoing surgery of the elbow, forearm,
      wrist, or hand were prospectively recruited based on the criteria below.

    <description>All patients were given a single shot ultrasound-guided posterior parasagittal in-plane approach infraclavicular brachial plexus block under aseptic technique. The blocks were performed using a 21G, 100 mm insulated short bevel needle (Stimuplex A, B Braun, Melsungen, Germany) without nerve stimulation. A 25-ml local anaesthetic admixture [Lignocaine 2% (100mg) plus Ropivacaine 0.75% (150mg)] was administered. We used an ultrasound machine (Sonosite M-Turbo; SonositeÂ®, Bothell, WA, USA) with HFL38x/ 13-6 MHz linear transducer probe.</description>
