      A prospective, open, multicenter, randomized III trial with two arms:

        -  Arm A: Primary tumor resection , followed by chemotherapy

        -  Arm B: Chemotherapy alone. Compare overall 2-year survival rates in patients treated for
           resectable rectal adenocarcinoma with unresectable metastasis, treated either with the
           primary tumor resection with chemotherapy +/- target therapy, or with chemotherapy (+/-
           target therapy) alone.
