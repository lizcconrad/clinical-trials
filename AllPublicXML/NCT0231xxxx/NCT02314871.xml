  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effects of three types of perioperative analgesia on
      the number of circulating cancer cells (representing minimal residual disease) following
      radical colon cancer surgery. Patients will be randomized into one of three groups. The
      intervention group will receive combined regional and general anesthesia during surgery and
      postoperative epidural analgesia. The two control groups will receive balanced general
      anesthesia and either morphine-based or piritramide-based postoperative analgesia. We
      hypothesize that epidural analgesia will be favorable to both piritramide-based and
      morphine-based analgesia and that piritramide-based analgesia will be favorable to
      morphine-based analgesia with regard to the number of circulating cancer cells and its
      development in the early postoperative period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Techniques of regional analgesia such as epidural analgesia may favorably influence
      metastasis development following cancer surgery compared to analgesia based on strong opioids
      such as morphine or piritramide. These beneficial effects, if present, are probably
      attributable to less immunosuppression of antimetastatic immune defenses.

      The aim of this study is to identify techniques of perioperative analgesia with the potential
      to prevent metastasis development in patients undergoing open radical colon cancer surgery.
      In the early postoperative period, a relationship between metastasis development and the
      number of circulating cancer cells representing minimal residual disease has been shown.
      Therefore, effects of epidural, morphine-based and piritramide-based analgesia on the number
      of circulating cancer cells will be compared at several time points during the peroperative
      and early postoperative periods. The number of circulating cancer cells will be assessed in
      peripheral venous blood samples using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Perioperative care
      will be standardized and patients will be followed by clinical observation, laboratory
      analyses and monitoring instrumentation daily during their hospital stay.
