    <textblock>
      The NIR light source of our device is based on light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which can
      deliver sufficient light to biological tissues and induce fluorescence emission to meet the
      needs of the planned clinical studies. It should be noted that the light source is still well
      under the US FDA recommended limit for NIR exposure and ANSI standard. In addition, the light
      source is not laser-based, which is significantly safer than other optical imaging systems
      utilizing laser technologies. The fluorescence signals will be received by the detector
      portion of our device. Gain-settings could be easily adjusted during operation to optimize
      the contrast between high fluorescence areas (tumors) and low fluorescence areas (normal
      tissues). Real-time fluorescence video will be displayed in the goggle eyepiece as well as on
      a secondary monitor to facilitate viewing by other surgeons in the room.

    <measure>Ability for the imaging device to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN) during the SLN biopsy procedure compared to standard of care gamma-probe identification of the SLN</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of the biopsy procedure (approximately 1.5 hours)</time_frame>
    <description>After gamma-probe identification of the SLN, the physician will put on the goggle system to attempt to identify the SLN using fluorescence guidance. After this is performed, the goggle system will be removed and the SLN biopsy will be completed per standard techniques. Findings with the goggles will be recorded but will not change how the SLN biopsy is performed. The surgically-removed SLNs will be pathologically examined under standard protocols.
Identification of the SLN via fluorescence imaging will be compared to identification of the SLN via standard radiocolloid.
Fluorescence imaging results will be classified in relation to the &quot;true&quot; status based on the standard SLN biopsy. Descriptive statistics will be utilized to describe the feasibility of the imaging modality in identifying the SLN.
The main data point collected is &quot;Do ICG-identified node (s) have extra-corporeal gamma activity?&quot;</description>

    <description>During the SLN biopsy, the patient will undergo injection of ICG around the breast tumor or melanoma per standard techniques. 1.6 mL of 500 micro-molar ICG will be injected periareolarly (for breast cancer) or peri-tumorly (for melanoma). This will be performed after standard of care technetium-colloid injection. Patients will then undergo the standard SLN biopsy procedure.
After gamma-probe identification of the SLN, the surgeon will put on the goggle system to attempt to identify the SLN using fluorescence guidance. After this is performed, the goggle system will be removed and the SLN biopsy will be completed per standard techniques. Findings with the goggles will be recorded but will not change how the SLN biopsy is performed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Newly diagnosed with clinically node-negative breast cancer or melanoma being staged
             with SLN biopsy.

          -  Negative nodal basin clinical exam.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for surgery.

          -  Receiving any investigational agents.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to ICG or other agents used in the study,
             including known iodide or seafood allergy.

          -  Presence of uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing
             or active infection of the breast and/or axilla, symptomatic congestive heart failure,
             unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant.

          -  Breastfeeding. Patients who are breastfeeding are excluded from this study because
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary
             to treatment of the mother with ICG dye.
