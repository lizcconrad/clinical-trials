      Single center, open-label randomized-control trial Population: de novo 48 kidney transplant
      recipients (age 18-75 years) from ECD/AKI donors Compare: everolimus with low dose CNI and
      prednisolone versus standard immunosuppressive regimen Objective: To evaluate efficacy of
      everolimus with low dose CNI in de novo kidney transplant recipients of ECD/AKI donors
      Primary endpoint: Mean eGFR (CKD-EPI) at 12 months post-transplantation

      Secondary Endpoints:

        -  To assess renal function by means of eGFR (Cockcrault and Gault formula), at -Month 6
           and 12 post-transplantation

        -  To assess incidence of the individual composite endpoints including BPAR, graft loss and
           death at Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation

        -  To assess the incidence and duration of renal replacement therapy

        -  To assess the incidence of chronic allograft nephropathy (IF/TA) at Month 12

        -  To assess renal function by means of serum creatinine at Month 6 and 12
           post-transplantation

        -  To compare the overall safety and tolerability (incidence of AEs and SAEs, infections,
           discontinuations due to AEs, lab abnormalities, wound and surgical complications) at
           Month 6 and 12 post-transplantation

      Definition of ECD

        -  Brain-dead donor &gt; 60 years old or

        -  Donor age &gt; 50 years old with two of the following criteria;

        -  History of HT

        -  Terminal SCr. ≥ 1.5 mg/dL

        -  Death from cerebrovascular accident Definition of AKI donor

        -  Brain-dead donor with an increase of SCr. ≥ 0.3 mg/dL from baseline
