  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - X-linked juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS) is caused by changes in the RS1 gene. These changes
      cause abnormal function of the eye protein retinoschisin. Without normal retinoschisin, the
      layers of the retina split and vision is lost. Researchers want to try to introduce a healthy
      RS1 gene into eye cells, to see if this helps retinal cells make healthy retinoschisin. They
      will put the gene in a virus. The gene and virus package is known as a gene transfer vector
      (AAV-RS1 vector).

      Objectives:

      - To see if the AAV-RS1 vector is safe to use in people.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 and older with a mutation of the RS1 gene, 20/63 vision or worse in one eye, and
      XLRS.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with genetic tests to confirm XLRS. They will have a
           medical history and physical and eye exams.

        -  At visits 1-2, participants will have some or all of the following:

        -  Medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Blood and urine tests

        -  Tuberculosis skin test

        -  Eye exam

        -  Vision tests (for one test an intravenous line will be placed in the arm. A dye will be
           injected that will travel to the blood vessels in the eye).

        -  At visit 3, the AAV-RS1 vector will be injected with a needle in the study eye.
           Participants pupils will be dilated. They will get numbing eye drops.

        -  Visits 4-13 will occur in the 18 months after gene transfer. Many of the above tests
           will be repeated. Participants will discuss any side effects.

        -  Visits 14-17 will occur yearly between years 2 and 5.

        -  After year 5, participants will be contacted yearly by phone for up to 15 years.

      Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ocular AAV-RS1 vector
      (AAV8-scRS/IRBPhRS) gene transfer to the retina of participants affected with X-linked
      juvenile retinoschisis (XLRS).

      Study Population: Male participants affected with XLRS will receive ocular gene transfer. A
      maximum of up to 24 participants may be enrolled.

      Design: This is a Phase I/IIa, prospective, dose escalation, single-center study. One eye of
      each participant will receive the AAV-RS1 gene vector application by intravitreal injection.
      Participants will be closely monitored in conjunction with DSMC oversight. Participants will
      be followed for 18 months after which they will continue to be followed for up to 15 years
      after enrollment, or per FDA requirements, for further safety analysis.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the safety of ocular AAV-RS1 vector as determined
      from assessment of retinal function, ocular structure and occurrence of adverse events and
      laboratory tests. Secondary outcomes include changes in visual function, electroretinogram
      (ERG) responses, visual field measurements, retinal imaging with optical coherence tomography
      (OCT), and the formation of anti-AAV and anti-RS1 antibodies.

      Statistics: No formal sample size calculations are used in this Phase I/IIa dose-escalation
      study.

          -  Participant has low absolute neutrophil count (ANC&lt;1.3 x 10(3)/micro liters).

          -  Participant has used any biologic immunosuppressive agents within the last three
             months (within the last six months for rituximab or cyclophosphamide).

        STUDY EYE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        The participant must have at least one eye meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the
        exclusion criteria listed below.

        STUDY EYE INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The study eye must have a best-corrected E-ETDRS visual acuity letterscore of less
             than or equal to 63 (i.e., worse than or equal to 20/63). The visual acuity from the
             first baseline visit (Baseline 1) will be used for eligibility determination in case
             of a change in visual acuity at the second baseline visit (Baseline 2).

          -  Electroretinogram in the study eye with a scotopic combined response demonstrating a
             subnormal b wave, consistent with retinoschisis.

        STUDY EYE EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  The study eye has a history of other ocular disease likely to contribute significantly
             to visual loss or likely to present special risks (e.g., optic neuropathy, advanced
             glaucoma, uveitis, large bullous schisis cavities or bullous retinal detachment
             precluding safe intravitreal injection).

          -  The study eye has lens, cornea, or other media opacities precluding adequate
             visualization and testing of the retina.

          -  The study eye has undergone intraocular surgery within six months prior to enrollment.

          -  The study eye is receiving topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, or has received
             topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors in the past three months.

        STUDY EYE SELECTION CRITERIA:

        If both eyes of a participant meet the study eye eligibility criteria, the choice of study
        eye will be determined as follows:

          -  The eye with the worse visual acuity will be selected as the study eye.

          -  If both eyes have the same visual acuity, the choice of study eye will be determined
             at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the participant.
