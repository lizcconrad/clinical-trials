  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate if a standardized nutritional intervention with a
      protein and energy enriched milk could help overcome the catabolic state in children
      hospitalized with a bronchiolitis and thus creating a better nutritional state during
      hospitalization and at outpatient follow-up.

      The investigators also want to assess the clinical repercussion on the number of
      hospitalization days, the duration of oxygen support and the quality of life at ouptatient
      follow-up.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the effect protein-energy enriched milk to
      reverse the catabolic state (weight loss, change in mid-upper arm circumference and tricpes
      skin fold) on the short term and failure to thrive (degree of weight recovery, change in arm
      circumference) one week after discharge in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. The
      secondary short term aims are to investigate the effect on the length of hospital stay, days
      of oxygen support and the rate of antibiotic use. Secondary long term outcomes are the
      re-admission rate, the persistence of wheezing and the number of work days missed by the
      parents.

      The investigators hypothesize that in those children who received a protein-energy enriched
      milk during hospitalization the catabolic state will be reversed more quickly by the
      intervention and will need less hospitalisation days, less oxygen support, less antibiotic
      use, less re-admission rate, less persistent wheezing and less work days missed by the
      parents. The investigators also hypothesize that the effects of the nutritional intervention
      on the proposed outcome parameters will be greater in children screened at high nutritional
      risk.

    <description>Children in the intervention group will receive a protein-energy enriched milk (Infatrini®, or in the case of children on a partial or fully hydrolized milk Infatrini Peptisorb®). The volume of milk offered will be the same quantity as they usually drink at home (within the limits of 120-170 ml/kg/day). The intervention will be carried out during the first 7 days of hospitalisation, or until the day of discharge (if hospitalized for less than 7 days).</description>
