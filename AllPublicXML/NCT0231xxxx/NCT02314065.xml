      Background

      Severe health anxiety is a highly distressing, often debilitating, psychological problem.
      Since the release of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) its
      clinical manifestations are increasingly often referred to as Somatic Symptom Disorder (SSD)
      or Illness Anxiety Disorder (IAD). Despite often being overlooked in routine care, several
      treatments for severe health anxiety have shown great promise, the most well-established
      being Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Traditionally, CBT - like most other
      psychotherapies - has typically been delivered face-to-face. That is, the patient physically
      meeting with the therapist once a week for the whole of the treatment. Internet-delivered CBT
      does not rest on this requirement, but has nevertheless been shown to be efficacious for
      severe health anxiety (see for example NCT01673035).

      Aim of the study

      The present study aims to compare the effects of Internet-delivered CBT and CBT face-to-face
      for severe health anxiety in a randomized controlled trial. A non-inferiority criterion is
      applied to determine if Internet-delivered CBT is at least as efficacious as its
      well-established predecessor.
