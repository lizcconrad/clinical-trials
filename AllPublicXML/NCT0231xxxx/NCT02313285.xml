  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective:

      To assess the long-term safety of GZ402668 in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) who
      received prior treatment during the TDU13475 or TDU14981 studies.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the pharmacokinetics of GZ402668 in patients with MS. To assess the
      pharmacodynamics of GZ402668 in patients with MS. To assess the immunogenicity of GZ402668 in
      patients with MS.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The total study duration for a patient is approximately 47 months.

      There is no administration of GZ402668 in the LTS14120 study. Patients who already received
      investigational medicinal product (GZ402668 or placebo) in TDU13475 or TDU14981 will be
      followed up to 47 months in the LTS14120.

      Note: Patients from TDU14981 study (sanofi-sponsored) will participate in LTS14120 study. In
      order to keep consistent among all study related documents, the title of the LTS14120 study
      is not amended.
