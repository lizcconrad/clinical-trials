    <textblock>
      This study focuses on the effect of the hydroxyapatite coating with BoneMaster on the
      fixation of the hip prosthesis in primary hip alloplasty. A hemispheric joint cup of the type
      Exceed cup (Biomet) characterized by a porous surface of titanium plasma spray is used. The
      surface is coated with hydroxyapatite deposited electrochemically (BoneMaster) and will be
      compared with an identical cup without hydroxyapatite.

      This study focuses on the effect of the hydroxyapatite coating with BoneMaster on the
      fixation of the hip prosthesis in primary hip alloplasty. A hemispheric joint cup of the type
      Exceed cup (Biomet) characterized by a porous surface of titanium plasma spray is used. The
      surface is coated with hydroxyapatite deposited electrochemically (BoneMaster) and will be
      compared with an identical cup without hydroxyapatite. A 5-year radiologic analysis of
      migration will be carried out with the object of detecting prognostic evidence of prosthesis
      loosening. Migration is determined by Roentgen Stereo-photogrammetric Analysis (RSA) on
      stereoroentgenograms. Simultaneously, the patients will be monitored by using the clinical
      outcome measure HOOS (Hip disability and osteoarthritis outcome score), OHS (Oxford Hip
      Score), EQ-5D (EuroQol), HHS (Harris Hip Score) on range of motion, VAS (Visual Analog
      Scale), postoperative complications and reoperation.

      Hypothesis: We expect that the Exceed cup with hydroxyapatite deposited electrochemically
      (BoneMaster) is superior or equal compared to a similar cup without hydroxyapatite regarding

        -  mechanical stability (RSA)

        -  (clinical outcome)
