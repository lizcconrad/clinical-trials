  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sub-population of patients affected by non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating
      mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) do not gain benefit from treatment
      with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The hypothesis of this study is that the addition of
      chemotherapy with oral vinorelbine to first-line TKI might result in improved outcomes in
      EGFR-mutated patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of the dramatic improvements obtained with EGFR-TKIs in patients affected by NSCLC
      with activating mutations of EGFR, a fraction of these patients (about 30%) do not respond to
      EGFR-TKIs or achieve a response of short duration. It has been suggested that these patients
      may be affected by additional mutations that confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs in spite of the
      presence of activating mutations of the EGFR gene. Pre-clinical studies show that the
      addition of chemotherapy to gefitinib may result in increased anti-proliferative activity,
      and subsequent clinical studies suggest that the synergic activity of gefitinib and
      chemotherapy can depend from the employed schedules (concurrent versus sequential).
      Additionally, data from phase I trials of gefitinib plus vinorelbine revealed a high
      incidence of severe hematological toxicity with concurrent administration, while sequential
      schedules resulted in a more manageable safety profile.

      On the basis of the aforementioned data, we hypothesize that the sequential combination of
      vinorelbine and gefitinib might result in improved outcomes (in terms of response and
      survival) in EGFR-mutated NSCLC over gefitinib alone with acceptable tolerability. The
      availability of an oral formulation of vinorelbine makes it possible to offer the patients an
      exclusively oral treatment.
