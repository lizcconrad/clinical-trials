  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether a particular type of nerve fibers, A-delta
      fibers, can be tested in an Electromyography (EMG) lab on a routine basis. Normal, healthy
      volunteers will be enrolled in this study.

    <textblock>
      The epidermis is the outermost layer of the skin that includes skin cells and small nerve
      fibers called A-delta fibers. A-delta fibers send signals to the brain about pin-prick type
      of pain and temperature. The investigators want to study whether the investigators can
      stimulate A-delta fibers and document this by recording electrical potentials from the nerves
      in subjects' limbs.

      Study Procedures:

      A small piece of plastic will be applied to your foot and your hand. A tiny sharp tip
      protrudes from this piece of plastic. You will be barely able to feel this sharp tip when
      touching the piece of plastic. This is the electrode for intra-epidermal stimulation.

      With stimulation, you will feel a pin-prick type of sensation. The stimulus will be adjusted
      so that you barely feel the pin-prick type of sensation. The investigators will record
      responses of stimulation from nerves in your skin.

    <description>A small piece of plastic with a tiny sharp protruding tip (the intra-epidermal stimulation electrode) will be applied to the foot and hand. Small &quot;sticker&quot; electrodes will be placed over nerves on the forearm or ankle. A stimulus will be applied to the electrode for intra-epidermal stimulation. The stimulus will be gradually increased from no stimulus to a stimulus that is barely felt as a pin-prick type of sensation. Thereafter, the stimulus will be applied 5-15 times per second for 10 periods of 40-60 seconds.</description>
