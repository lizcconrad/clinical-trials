  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      24 healthy male volunteers are to be assigned to take orally Sanchi-Tongshu Capsule (Enteric
      coated pellets) and Sanchi-Tongshu Capsule in fasting condition according to a randomized,
      crossover, self-control method, with ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Re and notoginsenoside R1
      as detection indicators. Establish the &quot;blood drug concentration-time &quot; curve, compare the
      bioequivalence of the main effective ingredients of the two preparations during the
      absorption process in human.
