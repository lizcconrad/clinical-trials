    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by loss of
      coordination and cardiomyopathy. It is the most common form of inherited ataxia with an
      incidence in 1/50,000 in the Caucasian population. FRDA is associated with progressive damage
      to the nervous system, resulting in symptoms ranging from gait disturbance to speech
      problems, as well as diabetes and heart disease. The heart disease manifests as
      cardiomyopathy, and is responsible for approximately 60% of deaths from FRDA. This study is
      designed to characterize the cardiac manifestations of the disease using exercise, MRI, ECHO
      and serum parameters, in the context of the neurological disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to assess cardiac dysfunction in individuals with FRDA using 4
      modalities: hand crank exercise, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, echocardiography
      (ECHO), and serum measurements of cardiac status, including high sensitivity troponin, a
      measure of cardiac myocyte damage; N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide
      (NT-proBNP), a measure of heart failure; and creatine phosphokinase (CPK), a general measure
      of muscle damage. While there have been individual studies of some of these modalities, there
      are no studies that correlate these parameters and it is not known which parameters are more
      sensitive to cardiac dysfunction. This preliminary study will help define the parameters that
      will be most useful in assessing the cardiac involvement in FRDA.

    <description>CMR is a non-invasive way to take a high-resolution image of the heart and vessels. CMR uses powerful magnets and radio waves to obtain the image. During the CMR, you will have a substance injected into your vein called &quot;contrast&quot; to get a better picture of the heart.</description>
