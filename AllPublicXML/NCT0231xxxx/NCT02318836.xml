  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of lofexidine in 6 adult
      subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score of 5 6), 6 adult subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7 9), 6 adult subjects with severe hepatic
      impairment (Child Pugh score 10 15), and 6 control subjects with normal hepatic function with
      mean age, body mass index (BMI), and gender distribution targeted to be similar to the
      impaired hepatic function cohorts.

      This is a Phase 1, open-label, parallel-group, single-dose study of lofexidine in 6 adult
      subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score of 5 6), 6 adult subjects with
      moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh score 7 9), 6 adult subjects with severe hepatic
      impairment (Child Pugh score 10 15), and 6 control subjects with normal hepatic function with
      mean age, body mass index (BMI), and gender distribution targeted to be similar to the
      impaired hepatic function cohorts. Subjects will be confined to an inpatient facility from
      the evening before dosing to 144 hours after dosing.

      Subjects who successfully complete screening will report to the inpatient facility at an
      appropriate time the evening before study drug administration (Day 1) to ensure a minimum 10
      hour fast. The next morning (Day 1) while still fasting, subjects will receive a single, oral
      dose of 400 µg lofexidine HCl (two 200 µg tablets). Blood samples will be collected for
      pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis at multiple time points over the next 144 hours (Day 7). Pooled
      urine samples will be collected at 0 3 hours, 3 6 hours, 6 12 hours, 12 24 hours, 24 48
      hours, 48 96 hours, 96 120 hours and 120 144 hours post-dose. Safety will be assessed by
      recording adverse events (AEs), measuring vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) and
      clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), recording 12 lead safety
      and Holter electrocardiograms (ECGs), and performing physical exams.
