    <textblock>
      This study will compare the effects of ethanol on the PKs of a 1 mg dose of UT-15C in healthy
      volunteers to determine the in vivo effects of ethanol, including the timing of ethanol
      consumption in relation to UT-15C ingestion.

      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, four-way (period), crossover study in which
      28 healthy volunteers will receive a single 1 mg oral dose of UT-15C and/or ethanol. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences such that all subjects
      will receive all four sequences in a pre-specified order.

             preferred and usual lifestyle, or use two different forms of highly effective
             contraception for the duration of the study, and for at least 30 days after
             discontinuing study medication. Medically acceptable forms of effective contraception
             include: (1) approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills), (2)
             barrier methods used with a spermicide, (3) an intrauterine device, or (4) partner
             vasectomy. For women of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test is
             required at Screening and Baseline prior to initiating study medication.

          3. The subject, if male, must use a condom during the length of the study, and for at
             least 48 hours after discontinuing study medication.
