  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare the efficacy of the usual education materials to individualized
      computerized decision guide on decision conflict of patients with lupus nephritis making
      treatment decisions regarding immunosuppressive therapies.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study, a randomized controlled trial [RCT], will evaluate methods to assist
      minority lupus patients (African-Americans and Hispanics) to make shared decisions for the
      management of their lupus nephritis considering what is the best for them. We have developed
      an individualized patient decision guide that is culturally sensitive since it was developed
      solely based on the values, beliefs and preferences of minority patients. We will test the
      effectiveness of individualized decision aids in African-American and Hispanic lupus
      nephritis patients in a 2-arm randomized trial including 200 patients. We hypothesize that
      use of decision-aid will be associated with reduction in decisional conflict and more
      informed choice compared to usual care group (American College of Rheumatology [ACR] lupus
      pamphlet; co-primary effectiveness outcomes), both clinically meaningful and patient-centered
      outcomes. We chose the low-literacy decisional conflict scale as our primary outcome, since
      it is a validated measure, and the most commonly used outcome measure in decision aids RCTs.
      We use informed choice as a co-primary outcome, since this is conceptually most immediate to
      the intervention. It will measure whether in those with knowledge of risks and benefits of
      immunosuppressive drugs, patient values are concordant with their choice of immunosuppressive
      drug. Secondary outcomes include patient involvement in decision-making (concordance on
      control preference scale) and patient-physician communication (Interpersonal Processes of
      Care (IPC) score and analysis of audiotaped physician-patient Interaction (using the Active
      Patient Participation Coding Scheme (APPC)). Since we planned to recruit patients with
      current lupus nephritis flare (making current decision for an immunosuppressive drug) and
      with past lupus nephritis flares (making the same decision for a future lupus nephritis
      flare), two secondary outcomes (control preference scale for concordance of preferred and
      real role in deciding about immunosuppressive drugs and the audiotaped physician-patient
      interaction about immunosuppressive drugs) will be analyzed only in patients with current
      lupus nephritis flare, a subset of the entire cohort.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Decisional Conflict Scale Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after viewing the decision-aid or the standard hand-out (pamphlet) on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) but before treatment decision-making (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient self-administered, validated measure of decisional conflict, most commonly used as the primary outcome in RCTs of decision aids (change score). The score ranges from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extreme decisional conflict). Decisional conflict represents a state of uncertainty about a choice or course of action and is more likely in situations involving high-stakes choices with important potential gains and losses, value tradeoffs in selecting a choice or a course of action (vs. the alternative) or uncertain outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Informed Choice (Validated Instruments for Values Regarding Immunosuppressives, Knowledge About Immunosuppressives, and Treatment Decision-making)</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) but before treatment decision-making (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Concordance between values related (for or against starting) immunosuppressive drugs with patients' decision (to start or not start) immunosuppressive drugs, in those with adequate knowledge about benefits/harms of immunosuppressive drugs, assessed using validated instruments for values regarding immunosuppressive drugs, knowledge about immunosuppressive drugs, and treatment decision-making (patient's decision to start immunosuppressive drug).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Control Preferences Scale: Patient Participation in Decision-making</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) but before treatment decision-making (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>This scale assessed how much decision-making control they would like to have versus actually experienced. There are 5 responses for 5 control options: active, active shared, collaborative, passive shared and passive, which were collapsed into active (active, active shared), collaborative, and passive (passive shared and passive), as previously (and pre-specified). Concordance was assessed between desired and actual role played by each patient. We present these data for patients with current flare only, since only they were making a decision about the immunosuppressive drugs; patients with past lupus flare were not included in the denominator.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Physician Communication (Interpersonal Processes of Care (IPC)</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>This was assessed using the interpersonal processes of care (IPC), an 18-item validated patient-reported measure of patient-physician communication and care processes. The score ranges from 18 (worst) to 90 (best) and the scale is a patient-reported measure of patient-physician communication and care processes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Analysis of Audiotaped Physician-patient Interaction (Using the Active Patient Participation Coding Scheme (APPC)): Doctor Patient-centered Communication</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>This was done by analyzing the audio-recorded patient-physician discussion in patients with current lupus nephritis flare. The APCC is a validated instrument to measure 'active patient participation.' APCC assesses indicators and facilitators of patient participation. The unit of coding is the utterance, the oral analogue of a sentence. The range is 0 to unlimited. Patient participation is measured by the number of questions, number of concerns expressed, and act of assertiveness (e.g., preferences, introducing topics, making requests). These are 'active' forms of participation because of their influence on clinician behavior and the structure and content of the consultation. The APPC also assess clinician behaviors that facilitate and support patient participation, partnership-building and supportive talk (e.g., reassurance, empathy). We present doctor patient-centered communication. higher scores indicates better patient participation and communication.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability (Number of Participants Rating Each Statement as &quot;Excellent&quot;)</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability of the decision-aid (information quality and quantity, presentation style and usefulness) was assessed using a validated acceptability survey on 4-point scale ranging from &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;poor&quot; (response options were: excellent, good, fair and poor). The number of patients rating each of the five statements as &quot;excellent&quot; (vs. other ratings) was compared between the two treatment arms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility (Number of Participants Rating the Feasibility of Using Decision-aid or Pamphlet- Referred to as Education Guide in This Statement)</measure>
    <time_frame>After viewing the guide or standard hand-out on the same visit as the intervention (preferred) (usually within 1 week)</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the decision-aid vs. pamphlet was assessed using a single statement &quot;The education guide was easy to use&quot;. Patients rated this on 5-point ordinal scale ranging from &quot;strongly agree&quot; to &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (response options were: strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly disagree). The number of patients was compared between the two treatment arms.</description>

        <description>This scale assessed how much decision-making control they would like to have versus actually experienced. There are 5 responses for 5 control options: active, active shared, collaborative, passive shared and passive, which were collapsed into active (active, active shared), collaborative, and passive (passive shared and passive), as previously (and pre-specified). Concordance was assessed between desired and actual role played by each patient. We present these data for patients with current flare only, since only they were making a decision about the immunosuppressive drugs; patients with past lupus flare were not included in the denominator.</description>

        <title>Analysis of Audiotaped Physician-patient Interaction (Using the Active Patient Participation Coding Scheme (APPC)): Doctor Patient-centered Communication</title>
        <description>This was done by analyzing the audio-recorded patient-physician discussion in patients with current lupus nephritis flare. The APCC is a validated instrument to measure ‘active patient participation.’ APCC assesses indicators and facilitators of patient participation. The unit of coding is the utterance, the oral analogue of a sentence. The range is 0 to unlimited. Patient participation is measured by the number of questions, number of concerns expressed, and act of assertiveness (e.g., preferences, introducing topics, making requests). These are ‘active’ forms of participation because of their influence on clinician behavior and the structure and content of the consultation. The APPC also assess clinician behaviors that facilitate and support patient participation, partnership-building and supportive talk (e.g., reassurance, empathy). We present doctor patient-centered communication. higher scores indicates better patient participation and communication.</description>
