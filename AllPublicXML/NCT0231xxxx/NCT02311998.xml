    <textblock>
      There are 2 parts to this study: Part 1 (dose escalation) and Part 2 (dose expansion).

      The goal of Part 1 of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of
      the combination of bosutinib and inotuzumab ozogamicin that can be given to patients with
      Philadelphia positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML) in the lymphoid blast phase that also expresses CD22 (a type of protein on the leukemia
      cell).

      The goal of Part 2 is to learn if the dose found in Part 1 can help to control the disease.

      The safety of this drug combination will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is not FDA-approved or commercially
      available. Bosutinib is FDA-approved and commercially available for the treatment of certain
      types of CML in patients who have failed previous therapies. It is considered investigational
      to use this combination of drugs to treat Ph+ AML/CML.

      Up to 80 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study
      group based on when you join this study and whether or not you have received earlier
      treatment for leukemia. Up to 36 participants will be enrolled in Part 1 of the study, and up
      to 44 participants will be enrolled in Part 2.

      If you are enrolled in Part 1, the dose of bosutinib you receive will depend on when you join
      this study and your treatment history. The first group of participants in each treatment
      history group will receive the lowest dose level of bosutinib. Each new group will receive a
      higher dose of bosutinib than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of bosutinib is found.

      If you are enrolled in Part 2, you will receive bosutinib at the highest dose that was
      tolerated in Part 1.

      All participants in Parts 1 and 2 will receive the same dose of inotuzumab ozogamicin.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will take bosutinib tablets by mouth 1 time each day with food. If you miss or vomit a
      dose of bosutinib, do not take &quot;make up&quot; the dose. Wait and take your next dose as scheduled
      the next day.

      You will also receive inotuzumab ozogamicin by vein over about 1 hour on Days 1, 8, and 15 of
      each 28-day cycle. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may switch to a different dosing
      schedule and receive inotuzumab ozogamicin 1 time every 4 weeks. The doctor will discuss this
      with you.

      You will be given standard drugs (such as acetaminophen/paracetamol, antihistamines, and/or
      steroids) to help decrease the risk of side effects. If your doctor thinks it is needed, you
      may also receive hydroxyurea to control your white blood cell count while you are on study.
      You may ask the study staff for information about how these drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of all cycles and Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1:

        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have a physical exam. On Day 8 of Cycle 1, you will not have this exam.

      You may have these routine blood draws performed at a local lab or clinic closer to your
      home. The results will be sent to the study doctor for review.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 2-6, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check the status of
      the disease and for CD22 testing. If the disease appears to get better, you will have this
      test every 2 cycles. After Cycle 6, you will have this test every 3 months or at any time the
      doctor thinks it is needed.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may take the inotuzumab ozogamicin for up to 6 cycles. You may continue taking bosutinib
      for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best interest. You will no longer be able to
      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you
      are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after 1 year of follow-up calls.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      About 28 days after your last dose of study drugs:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and for CD22 testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy to check
           the status of the disease and for CD22 testing.

      If you cannot come to MD Anderson for the clinic visit, you will be called by a member of the
      study staff and asked about any side effects you may have. This call will last about 5
      minutes.

      Follow-Up:

      After your end-of-treatment visit or call, you will be called 1 time about every 12 weeks
      (for up to 1 year) and asked about any anti-cancer therapy you may have started. This call
      will last about 5 minutes.
