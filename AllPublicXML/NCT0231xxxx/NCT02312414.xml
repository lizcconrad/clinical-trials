  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is a common disorder in CKD patients. It is largely attributed to decreased
      erythropoietin (EPO) production and iron deficiency. Therefore, besides EPO, therapy includes
      iron replenishment. However, the latter induces oxidative stress. Haptoglobin (Hp) protein is
      the main line of defense against the oxidative effects of Hemoglobin/Iron. There are 3
      genotypes: 1-1, 2-1 and 2-2. Hp 2-2 protein is inferior to Hp 1-1 as antioxidant. So far,
      there is no evidence whether haptoglobin genotype affects iron-induced oxidative stress in
      CKD patients.

      In this proposed study we wished to examine whether Hp genotype influences intravenous iron
      administration (IVIR)-induced oxidative stress in CKD patients, and its impact on the
      response of these patients to L-Carnitine therapy.

      This study will include at least 25 anemic CKD patients (stages 3-4) that will be given a
      weekly IVIR (Sodium ferric gluconate, [125 mg/100 ml] for 8 weeks, and during weeks 5-8 also
      received Carnitine (20mg/kg, IV) prior to IVIR. Weekly blood samples will drawn before and
      after each IVIR for Hp genotype, C-reactive protein (CRP), advanced oxidative protein
      products (AOPP), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), besides complete blood
      count and biochemical analyses.
