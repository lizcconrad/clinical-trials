  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involved Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and more specifically
      computer exercises blended with game activities. It was hypothesized that ICT facilitated,
      game blended cognitive and/or physical exercise improves global cognition when compared to
      control groups; moreover, these improvements may be manifested by brain activity changes; we
      explored the impact of potential moderators on combined exercise-induced cognitive benefits,
      as well as, individual/separate training schemes.

      The study was conducted in the Thessaloniki (Greece), in various centers. It was part of the
      Long Lasting Memories (LLM) project (www.longlastingmemories.eu), which was funded by the
      European Commission (Information and Communication Technologies Policy Support Program
      (ICT-PSP) for a three year period (2009-2012). It used a pre-post-test design with the
      between-participant factor group [intervention(s) vs. passive and/or active control].
      Post-test was conducted within 2 weeks after completion of the exercise period. Interventions
      were carried out in Thessaloniki (Greece) within day care centers, hospitals, senior care
      centers, a memory outpatient center, local parishes, and at participants' homes.

      Centers had to provide 8 exercise weeks, with a frequency of at least 2 physical and 3
      cognitive exercise sessions per week, resulting in at least 16 physical and 24 cognitive
      exercise sessions in total.

      A similar trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov
      Identifier: NCT02267499
