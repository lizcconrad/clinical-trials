      Background:

      - People respond differently when asked about their values. They also respond differently
      when they learn about how their actions affect their lives and health. Researchers want to
      learn more about these differences. This can help them improve public health messages.

      Objective:

      - To see how people respond differently to questions about their values and to information
      about alcohol and breast cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Women age 18 and older who drink 7 or more alcoholic drinks per week.

      Design:

        -  This study will take place online.

        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to a group that will complete a certain task.

        -  Researchers will ask participants to complete 2 small studies:

        -  Values Study. Some participants may write briefly about a value that is important to
           them or to someone they are close to. Some participants will complete a short
           questionnaire instead of the writing exercise.

        -  Alcohol and Breast Cancer Study. Participants will read a health message. This will be
           about the link between alcohol use and increased breast cancer risk. Participants will
           then answer questions about what they read and their beliefs about alcohol and breast
           cancer.

        -  Both studies should take about 30 minutes.

      Self-affirmation, a process by which individuals reflect on cherished personal values is a
      potent means of augmenting the effectiveness of threatening health communications.
      Individuals tend to be defensive against information suggesting their behavior puts them at
      risk for disease or negative health. Previous evidence suggests that self-affirmation may
      reduce defensiveness to threatening health information, increasing openness to the message
      and resulting in increased disease risk perceptions, disease-related worry, intentions to
      engage in preventive behavior, and actual behavioral change. Understanding the mechanisms
      that explain these robust effects would yield evidence important for dissemination, including
      ways to refine self-affirmation interventions and make them more potent, which could change
      the ways that public health messages are constructed. Thus, we aim to elucidate potential
      mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of self-affirmation, including self-activation,
      general affirmation, and domain-specific affirmation. In study 1, female human subjects will
      be randomly assigned to one of eight affirmation or self-activation conditions. Following the
      affirmation or activation task, subjects will read about the documented link between alcohol
      and breast cancer. Finally, they will be asked a series of questions about their intentions
      to reduce drinking, their perceived risk of breast cancer, and their worry about breast
      cancer. Study 2 will replicate study 1, but in a different behavioral domain (fruit and
      vegetable consumption) and a different sample (both males and females who do not meet fruit
      and vegetable recommendations. Study 3 will extend Studies 1 and 2 by examining whether the
      most effective self-affirmations identified in these studies produce short-term increases in
      fruit and vegetable consumption. Drawing on previous research, we hypothesize that these
      inductions will be effective to the degree that they involve a self-affirmation, but will not
      be effective if they involve only other-affirmation or self-activation.
