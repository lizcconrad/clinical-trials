  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemia reperfusion injury may be attenuated by HO-1 induction. Our previous data confirmed
      strong HO-1 induction in peripheral blood cells following heme arginate infusion in healthy
      humans5. Furthermore, we could demonstrate the amelioration of experimental ischemia
      reperfusion injury in the calf musculature by heme arginate in healthy subjects as measured
      by functional MRI6.

      Therefore, we propose that HO-1 induction in the human heart may be a suitable target to
      mitigate cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury.

      The HO-1 induction will be assessed in a clinical trial by myocardial biopsy prior to and
      after aortic cross clamping in subjects with or without preceding heme arginate treatment in
      two different dosages. The HO-1 expression will also be measured in the clinical trials in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. As additional outcome, levels of myoglobin,
      creatine-kinase and troponin T and reactive oxygen species will be measured in plasma
      according to standard laboratory procedures.
