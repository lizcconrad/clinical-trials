      Background:

      - Some growth disorders are caused by a change in genes. Genes are the instructions the body
      uses to function. Changes in genes often cause them not to work correctly. Researchers want
      to use a new technology called exome sequencing, to look at many genes at once. This is done
      by looking at DNA from blood or saliva in a lab. This method may help find the cause of
      disorders that researchers haven t been able to find using past methods.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand genetic causes of growth disorders.

      Eligibility:

      - Children and adults with growth disorders and their family members.

      Design:

        -  Participants will give a small sample of blood and/or saliva.

        -  Researchers will purify DNA from the sample. They will perform exome sequencing and
           other tests to look for changes in genes. Some participants may receive limited or no
           genetic tests. Researchers will let them know if exome sequencing is performed.

        -  Participants may have a medical history, physical exam, and lab tests. They may have
           x-rays or ultrasound tests to study the disorder in their family.

        -  Some participants may be recommended for a specific genetic test from a commercial lab.
           They may have to pay for that test.

        -  Participants will be told about test results that relate to the growth disorder. This
           may happen up to years after the testing. They may have to give another blood and/or
           saliva sample.

        -  Some participants may get results about other health conditions. This will only happen
           if the information would help the person or their family protect their health. They may
           have to give another blood and/or saliva sample.

    <textblock>
      Children often present to pediatricians and pediatric endocrinologists because of abnormal
      body growth, including both childhood growth failure and, less commonly, overgrowth.
      Sometimes the cause is evident, for example, growth hormone deficiency for growth failure and
      growth hormone excess for overgrowth. In other children, the etiology remains unknown despite
      extensive evaluation, resulting in the unhelpful diagnosis of severe idiopathic short stature
      or tall stature. These conditions are quite heterogeneous, including children with isolated
      growth disorders and others who also have other abnormalities such as developmental delay or
      a constellation of congenital anomalies (syndromic growth disorders). Some cases of severe
      growth disorders have a polygenic inheritance while others appear to be inherited as a
      monogenic trait recessive, dominant or X-linked. Because of recent advances in DNA sequencing
      technology, it is now feasible to sequence the exome (portion of the genome that encodes gene
      exons) in families with monogenic disorders and thereby determine the underlying molecular
      etiology.

      We therefore propose a study to identify novel genetic causes of idiopathic growth disorders
      using whole-exome sequencing. The primary goal of this study is to identify novel causes of
      childhood growth disorders in order to improve clinical diagnosis, to provide a more precise
      characterization of associated medical problems, prognosis, and response to treatment based
      on etiology, and to gain new insights into the regulation of human growth, which may
      eventually lead to new therapeutic approaches.

      Subjects will include children and adults with a clearly recognizable phenotype that includes
      either short stature or tall stature and a pedigree that strongly suggests a monogenic
      inheritance. Both syndromic and non-syndromic growth disorders and both proportionate and
      disproportionate growth disorders will be included. Affected and unaffected family members
      (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index case) will
      also be studied because of their importance for this genetic approach. The phenotype will be
      characterized by medical history, physical exam, body measurements, and laboratory
      evaluation. Blood and saliva samples will be collected for whole-exome sequencing and single
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis. Candidate sequence variants will typically be
      verified by Sanger sequencing.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        If a subject meets any one of these criteria, he/she will potentially be eligible to
        participate:

          -  Short stature (height less than - 2 SDS), either currently or previously - or

          -  Tall stature (height greater than + 2 SDS) or

          -  Bone age delay (greater than 3 years) or

          -  Bone age advancement (greater than 2.5 years or greater than 1.5 years with short
             stature) or

          -  Predicted adult height &lt; - 2SD

          -  Growth disorder that was treated promptly, thus maintaining the child s height within
             the normal range, e.g. a subject with congenital growth hormone deficiency or multiple
             pituitary hormone deficiency of unknown genetic etiology who received growth hormone
             treatment beginning in early life or

          -  Family member of subjects who meet any of the above criteria

        The growth disorder can be:

          -  Of postnatal onset (born appropriate for gestational age) or of prenatal onset (small
             for gestational age/large for gestational age)

          -  Non-syndromic or syndromic (accompanied by other malformations/abnormalities)

          -  Proportionate or disproportionate

        The pedigree should suggest a monogenic inheritance:

          -  Autosomal recessive or

          -  Autosomal dominant or

          -  De novo mutation or

          -  X-linked dominant/recessive

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  A non-genetic disorder or condition, either congenital or acquired, that explains the
             growth abnormality, for example, pituitary injury, chronic thyroiditis, whole body
             irradiation, or celiac disease.

          -  A well-documented diagnosis of a genetic disorder or condition that explains the
             growth abnormality and for which the molecular genetic etiology has already been
             identified, for example, SHOX deficiency, hypochondroplasia, or Noonan syndrome.
