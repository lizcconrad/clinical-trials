    <textblock>
      This is a largest cohort study aimed to estimate the overall survival of patients been
      treated with regorafenib for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) within the frame of a french
      compassionate program.

      Regorafenib (REG) is a multi-kinase inhibitor with survival benefits in patients with
      pretreated mCRC, as demonstrated in the phase III CORRECT study. As a result, REG has been
      made available for medical practice use in the US, and in the Europe. However, prescribing
      conditions in the real-life setting are known to be less stringent than selection criteria in
      clinical trials. The REgorafeniB in mEtastatic Colorectal cancer: a French Compassionate
      progrAm (REBECCA) is an ambispective cohort study designed to elucidate safety and
      effectiveness outcomes associated with REG as used in clinical practice for mCRC who have
      been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, available therapies.

      Patients were identified from the database of the French ATU (Temporary Authorization for
      Use), approved by the French Health Authorities to provide early access to innovative, not
      yet approved medicinal products such as REG.

      Baseline patient and tumor characteristics, REG dosing and dose-intensity, REG-related
      adverse events, pre- and post REG treatments, predictors of events, and effectiveness data
      (PFS, OS) were collected from patients who agreed, and whom physicians accepted to
      collaborate on the REBECCA cohort.
