      The purpose of the study is to help make a lower cost automatic blood pressure monitor device
      for diagnosis and monitoring of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women, where automatic blood
      pressure monitoring is limited or not available. The study will compare this low cost device
      to a commercially available system used for pre-eclamptic women in many United States
      hospitals that the investigators will be bringing to Malawi as a part of this study.

      The team hopes to show that this lower cost blood pressure machine works well and can help
      women with pre-eclampsia. The study also aims to see if this machine is easy for the nurse to
      use.

      70 pregnant women who are either at-risk or diagnosed with pre-eclampsia will be enrolled at
      University of Texas Health Science Center Houston. Patient arm circumference will be measured
      with measurement tape.

      They will be seated upright in a comfortable chair with arm at heart level and an arm blood
      pressure cuff from either the automatic blood pressure monitor or a manual sphygmomanometer
      will be placed on the left arm.

      The cuff will be inflated and then deflated until measurement concludes. Heart rate will be
      measured with tactile arterial palpation.The process will be repeated for a total of up to
      nine measurements, alternating between measurements with the automatic blood pressure monitor
      and the manual sphygmomanometer. There will be a waiting period of 45-60 seconds between each
      measurement.

      The results of this study will help researchers understand the performance and usability of
      this device in Malawi and help decide if any design changes are needed.
