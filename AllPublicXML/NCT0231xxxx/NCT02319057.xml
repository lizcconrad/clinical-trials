    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          2. Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history and physical examination.

          3. Females and males between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive).

          4. Body mass index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2 (inclusive, BMI = weight/height2).

          5. Weight of 50-100 kg (inclusive).

          6. Regular intestinal transit (no recent history of recurrent constipation, diarrhoea, or
             other intestinal problems).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Predicted poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the investigator or
             the study centre personnel.

          2. Veins unsuitable for repeated venipuncture or cannulation.

          3. Evidence of clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological, urogenital or
             psychiatric disease as judged by the investigator.

          4. Any condition requiring regular concomitant treatment (including vitamins and herbal
             products) or likely to need any concomitant treatment during the study. Hormonal
             contraception and hormone replacement therapy are allowed.

          5. Susceptibility to severe allergic reactions.

          6. Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study, within 2 weeks
             prior to the first study treatment administration or less than 5 times the half-life
             of the medication. Possible enzyme inducing drugs will be discussed case-by-case with
             the sponsor.

          7. Regular consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol per week for males and 16 units
             per week for females (1 unit = 4 cl spirits, about 13 g of alcohol).

          8. Current use of nicotine-containing products more than 5 cigarettes or equivalent/day.

          9. Inability to refrain from using nicotine-containing products during the stay at the
             study centre.

         10. Inability to refrain from consuming caffeine-containing beverages during the stay at
             the study centre, e.g. propensity to develop headaches when refraining from
             caffeine-containing beverages.

         11. Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 3 months prior to the
             first study treatment administration.

         12. Any clinically significant 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality after a
             10-minute rest in supine position at the screening visit, as judged by the
             investigator. For example:

               -  QTc (calculated with the Bazett's formula) &gt; 470 msec for females and 450 msec
                  for men.

         13. HR &lt; 45 beats/minute or &gt; 100 beats/minute after a 10-minute rest in supine position
             at the screening visit.

         14. At the screening visit systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 90 mmHg or &gt; 150 mmHg after a
             10- minute rest in supine position, diastolic BP &lt; 50 mmHg or &gt; 90 mmHg after a
             10-minute rest in supine position, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, or

               -  decrease of ≥ 20 mmHg of systolic BP or

               -  decrease of ≥ 10 mmHg of diastolic BP after 3 minutes in standing position.

         15. Any abnormal value in laboratory tests, or vital signs, or physical examination
             finding, which in the opinion of the investigator could interfere with the
             interpretation of the test results or cause a health risk for the subject if he takes
             part in the study.

         16. History of drug abuse or positive result in drug abuse test.

         17. Positive serology to human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (HIVAgAb), hepatitis C
             virus antibodies (HCVAb) or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).

         18. Females of childbearing potential if they are not using proper contraception (hormonal
             contraception, intrauterine device [IUD] or surgical sterilization, spermicidal foam
             in conjunction with condom on male partner) during the study. Use of oral/hormonal
             contraception alone is not acceptable. (Note: women of childbearing potential with no
             current heterosexual relationship can be included without contraception according to
             the judgement of the investigator).

         19. Any other condition that in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the
             evaluation of the results or constitute a health risk for the study subject.

         20. Participation in a clinical drug study within 3 months prior to the first study
             treatment administration of this study or earlier participation in a clinical study
             with ORM-12741.
