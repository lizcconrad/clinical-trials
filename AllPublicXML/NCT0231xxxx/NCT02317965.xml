      The purpose of this study is to detect whole chromosome abnormalities on all chromosomes 13,
      16, 18, 21, X and Y, in the fetus through analysis of cell free and compound sample DNA (cf
      DNA and cs DNA, respectively) in maternal blood. In addition, major deletions and
      duplications in chromosomes 1, 4, 5, and 22 will be detected.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Validate the prenatal aneuploidy laboratory developed test (LDT) with maternal blood samples from pregnant women who are undergoing invasive prenatal diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will have a single visit and completion in study occurs once invasive procedure results have been recorded.</time_frame>
    <description>A single 20 mL blood sample will be obtained from each subject during the first or second trimester, blind-coded, and transferred to the Sponsor Laboratory for processing to plasma.
Subjects electing to undergo an invasive procedure for fetal Karyotyping (defined as standard cytogenetics and/or microarray, FISH, QF-PCR) will have the blood sample obtained prior to the procedure.
The performance characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value) of the laboratory developed test to detect whole chromosome abnormalities on all chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, X and Y will be determined using fetal karyotype on specimens obtained by chorionic villus sampling and/or genetic amniocentesis for those subjects who undergo these diagnostic procedures as part of their standard care as the gold standard.</description>
