  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized, double blind placebo-controlled parallel intervention in adults over the age of
      50 will be performed. Participants will receive a supplement capsule containing placebo
      (Crystalline Cellulose) or 500mg of Setria® Glutathione to eat for 120 days. Glutathione is
      hypothesized to replenish the body's reserves that may be depleted through natural aging
      process, poor diet, or due to the detoxification process for drugs. The primary end point is
      the number of healthy days experienced during cold and flu season. Secondary endpoints
      include cellular and biochemical measures from blood samples taken before and after the
      study.

      The long term goal of this investigation is to understand how food components improve immune
      function, both in its ability to respond to pathogens and its ability to turn off when the
      response is no longer needed. The goal of this application is to examine mechanisms by which
      glutathione improves immune cells after consumption. The central hypothesis is that
      glutathione improves redox status within the cell, thereby improving cell function and
      increasing the number of healthy days experienced by the participants.

      After obtaining informed consent, human participants will receive 500 mg/day of Setria®
      Glutathione or placebo for 120 days. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), neutrophils
      and serum will be obtained from blood draws before and after the 120 days. A daily diary of
      illness will be kept by each participant and will record any incidence of illness, the number
      of symptoms per incidence, and the number of days in which symptoms are present. This study
      is powered on the basis that over 120 days, the glutathione-supplemented group would
      experience 3% more healthy days compared to the placebo group. The analysis indicated 60
      people per group. Timeline should be between mid-January to May because the Center for
      Disease Control and Prevention indicates that this is the cold and flu season
      (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm) in the southwest part of the country.
