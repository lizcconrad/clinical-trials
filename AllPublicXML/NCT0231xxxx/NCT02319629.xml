    <textblock>
      Risk factor of cholelithiasis is rapid weight loss after bariatric surgery and change in the
      gallbladder function which is secondary to surgery. Many observational studies support this
      fact, and a high incidence of 28% -71% after gastric bypass surgery (RYGB) was reported in
      them. According to another publication, the incidence of gallbladder diseases is 5-36% after
      jejunoileal bypass surgery and 2.8-36% after gastric bypass surgery.

      Study format: Prospective, randomized, blinded study. 266 candidates for sleeve gastrectomy
      or gastric bypass surgery due to morbid obesity with BMI range of 40-50 and aged 18-65 will
      be studied.

      The patients will be randomly divided into two groups (according to the last digit of the
      identity card number):

        1. Treatment group will receive preventive therapy with Ursodiol 600 mg per day as of day
           10 after the surgery (at the first routine visit after the surgery) and for six months
           or until the formation of gallstones.

        2. Placebo group will receive placebo as of day 10 after the surgery (at the first routine
           visit after the surgery) and for six months or until the formation of gallstones.

    <description>- Six months after the surgery the subjects will be invited to re-evaluation of the presence of gallstones using:
Clinical interview: Did he experience epigastric pain? Was he hospitalized with diagnosis of biliary colic or cholecystitis?
US of the upper abdomen to assess the presence of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening or other disorder.
