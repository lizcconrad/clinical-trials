  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the efficacy of three candidate molecules (Xenbilox,
      Tahor and Resveratrol) in order to decrease the production of oxysterols by reducing the
      synthesis of cholesterol and/or regulate the production of bile acids and/or enabling
      neuroprotective action within the motor neuron.

      The primary objective of the study is:

      - decrease the accumulation of metabolites which can have a negative impact on neurological
      and systemic function of patients with SPG5.

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  confirm the clinical and biological tolerance of the different candidate molecules under
           study

        -  improve the serum bile acid profile of patients with SPG5

    <description>In blood and urines samples of the 12 patients, the following criteria will be assesed in order to observe an evolution of the acid profile:
total biliary acids
ratio of primary/secondary biliary acids
the ratio cholic acids/chenodeoxycholic acids
the ratio chenodeoxycholic acids/ lithocholic acids</description>
