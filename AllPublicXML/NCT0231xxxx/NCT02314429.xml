    <textblock>
      In this first-in-human volunteer phase I clinical trial, a vaginal ring that slowly releases
      lactic acid (racemic mixture) into the vaginal environment, will be inserted in healthy
      volunteering women and left in place for 7 days. The primary objective of this phase I study
      is to assess the safety and the tolerability of this new intravaginal delivery system.

      The eventual goal of this and related studies is to develop a vaginal ring that reduces
      recurrences in women suffering from bacterial vaginosis, which is the commonest form of
      vaginal infection.
