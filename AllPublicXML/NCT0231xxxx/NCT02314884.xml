      A Phase I, Open-label, Dose-escalation Study to Assess the Safety, Tolerability,
      Pharmacokinetics and Preliminary Anti-tumor Activity of Cafusertib Hydrochloride in Patients
      With Advanced Solid Tumors

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate safety, tolerability of cafusertib in Chinese patients with Advanced Solid
      Tumors that are not eligible for conventional or intensive treatment. The dose of cafusertib
      will be escalated to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of cafusertib in advanced cancer patients. At the same time, pharmacokinetic
      characteristics and preliminary efficacy of cafusertib will be observed in advanced cancer
      patients. To determine the recommended dosage regimen for phase II.
