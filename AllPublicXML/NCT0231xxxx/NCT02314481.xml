      DARWIN II is a multi-arm non-randomised phase II trial, Eligible patient will be those who
      relapse with NSCLC (clinical trials.gov ref. NCT02183883),

      The trial will investigate assess if intra-tumour heterogeneity (clonal vs subclonal
      actionable mutation) is associated with PFS.

      Patients 1) without an actionable mutation and PDL1 positive or 2) without an actionable
      mutation and PDL1 negative following first line cytotoxic chemotherapy, will receive
      MPDL3280A a monoclonal antibody targeting anti-PDL1.

      Patients with BRAFV600 mutations, Her2 Amplification, ALK/RET gene rearrangements will be
      enrolled into arms treating with vemurafenib, trastuzumab emtansine and alectinib
      respectively.

      DARWIN II will include extensive exploratory biomarker analysis to investigate a number of
      genomic and immune markers that may predict response to MPDL3280A and help guide future
      clinical trial design.

      DARWIN II is an exploratory phase II study examining the role of intra-tumour heterogeneity
      and predicted neo-antigens on the anti-tumour activity of anti-PDL1 immunotherapy.

      It will examine how clonal dominance and intratumour heterogeneity influence outcomes after
      treatment, offering a unique opportunity to decipher mechanisms of resistance to
      immunotherapy with anti-PDL1. These data will help improve future study design by developing
      greater understanding of patient selection for immunotherapies in patients with NSCLC. The
      relationship between intratumour heterogeneity and cfDNA/CTCs will also be explored in DARWIN
      II, which may develop tools for patient selection and monitoring to be examined further in
      future studies. Results from DARWIN II will help to identify a biomarker for anti-PD-L1
      therapy which could be used for patient stratification in future phase III trials of
      molecules targeting this T-cell inhibitory checkpoint. DARWIN II will also provide
      preliminary data on efficacy of MPDL3280A, which could be used to design randomised studies.

      This is a multicentre non-randomised phase II study based on patients with relapsed NSCLC,
      who have provided a biopsy sample at the time of relapse.

      The study arms:

        -  Arm 1: Patients either 1) without an actionable mutation and PDL1 positive or 2) without
           an actionable mutation and PDL1 negative following first line cytotoxic chemotherapy -
           MPDL3280A

        -  Arm 2: BRAFV600 - vemurafenib

        -  Arm 3: ALK/RET gene rearrangement - alectinib

        -  Arm 4: Her2 Amplification - trastuzumab emtansine
