    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the objective response rate at two months
      (complete disappearance of the disease and partial disappearance of the disease) obtained
      after administration of combination therapy with cetuximab and irinotecan in the patients
      with metastatic colorectal cancer.

      Secondaries objectives will be assessed progression-free survival, overall survival,
      toxicity, quality of life.
