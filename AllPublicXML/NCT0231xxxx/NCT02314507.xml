  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate whether Gua sha is an effective modality for
      relieving chronic low back pain specifically in the aged population by comparing the baseline
      measures of pain intensity, self-perceived disability, back range of motion, back local
      muscle stiffness, depression, sleeping quality, quality of life, biomarkers measurement, and
      analgesic intake on days 1 and 7 after a single session of Gua sha treatment. In addition,
      the investigators are going to compare between Gua sha and hot pack treatments for the above
      parameters.

      Subjects will be randomized to receive firstly either one of the treatment arms, and then
      crossed over to receive another arm after 30 days washing out period. It is expected that Gua
      sha is 1) effective in reducing the intensity of chronic low back pain in the elderly; 2)
      effective in helping one or more outcome measures in this study and 3) more effective on
      relieving the low back pain than hot pack in terms of the outcome measures in this study.

    <description>A smooth, rounded-edged Gua sha tool will be press-stroked into the flesh enough to contact the fascial layer start at the midline of the subject's back. A stroke line is typically 4 to 6 inches long. Press-stroking will be repeated in one direction until the petechiae raises on that stroke line, typically 8 to 12 strokes. Gua sha will then be continued at the next stroke line directly adjacent to the one before, until the area covered the lower one third of the back.</description>
