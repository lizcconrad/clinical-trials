      The overall goal of this clinical study is to characterize the fusion rate of geneX® ds bone
      graft substitute in comparison to autograft, which is considered the gold standard for
      posterolateral fusion. Assessments are made using AP and Lateral x-rays, F/E x-rays, and CT
      scans geneX® ds has been cleared by the FDA for use in these procedures; however this study
      will allow more detailed characterization of geneX® ds performance in the long-term (1 year).
      By using the patient as their own control, direct comparison to autograft can be performed
      while minimizing other variables.

    <description>Fusion will be assessed by a single, independent radiologist using study required x-rays (AP, Lateral, Flexion-Extension) and CT scans. On xray, fusion will be graded for bridging bone and lucencies. Flexion extension x-rays will also be evaluated to determine translational and angular motion. For these evaluations, fusion is defined as translational motion &lt; 3mm and angular motion &lt; 5º.CT assessments of fusion will include qualitative evaluation of the continuity of trabecular bone between the transverse processes, cortication at the peripheral edges of the fusion masses, and the absence of identifiable radiographic clefts. Quantitative volumetric measurements of the fusion mass will be performed by outlining the fusion area in each cross-sectional slice and summing all slices.</description>

        The subject population will include adult (skeletally mature) men and women with spinal
        conditions for which instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) has been indicated as a
        course of treatment. Such spinal conditions may include symptomatic degenerative disc
        disease, spondylolisthesis (Grade I or II), or lumbar stenosis. The study is limited to
        those patients requiring instrumented PLF at one or two levels only. Subjects who are
        undergoing other spinal procedures during the same surgery (such as interbody fusions) are
        also eligible.
