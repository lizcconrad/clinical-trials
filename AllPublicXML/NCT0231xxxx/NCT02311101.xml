  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to establish the safety and toxicity of a combined intravesical mitomycin C
      with BCG for patients with bladder cancer.

      Urine Sample Collection and Handling: Voided urine will be collected pre and post BCG
      procedure. Urinalysis will be performed if participant presents with urinary symptoms.
      Analysis of urinary cytokines as predictors of response to therapy will be conducted by ELISA
      kits.

      Tissue Sample Collection and Handling: Tissue biopsy specimens will be collected pre BCG
      procedure. Analysis of gene expression will be conducted.

      TEST PROCEDURES Subjects will be given one of three concentrations of Mitomycin C (MMC) (10
      mg in 20 mL, 20 mg in 20 ml or 40 mg in 20 ml) for 30 minutes followed by a 10 minute washout
      period. Followed by three concentrations of BCG including ¼ strength, ½ strength, and full
      strength for 2 hours. Dose escalation will take place among subsequent patients and not
      within each patient.

      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to reach the target completion enrollment of 10
      subjects.

      Long-term Follow-up A Chart review will be conducted every three months for 2 years after
      initial 6 month study data collection. Patient charts will be reviewed to assess disease
      progression and any data supporting findings. Long-term follow-up is necessary to determine
      recurrence rates and long-term safety and efficacy of Mitomycin/BCG treatment therapy as well
      as BCG therapy in the control group.

    <description>Intravesical Mitomycin C and intravesical BCG
First intravesical mitomycin C (10 mg) is instilled for 30 minutes. Then the mitomycin is removed and the bladder is gently hand-irrigated with sterile water for 15 minutes in order to facilitate removal of mitomycin C. Then, intravesical BCG (half dose) is instilled for 2 hours under usual conditions. Full dose BCG corresponds to 1 to 8x10^8 colony-forming units of BCG. This study targets patients with BCG-naive or BCG-refractory high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. The first 3 participants received 10mg of MMC and half dose of BCG. The dose was assigned in order of enrollment.</description>
