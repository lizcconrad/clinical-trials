    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate whether advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      techniques such as dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI may be
      used to predict treatment response of brain metastasis after radiosurgery.

    <description>Clinical deterioration will be assessed based on the Karnofsky Performance scale (KPS).
100=Normal no complaints; no evidence of disease.
90=Able to carry on normal activity; minor signs or symptoms of disease.
80=Normal activity with effort; some signs or symptoms of disease.
70=Cares for self; unable to carry on normal activity or to do active work.
60=Requires occasional assistance, but is able to care for most of his personal needs.
50=Requires considerable assistance and frequent medical care.
40=Disabled; requires special care and assistance.
30=Severely disabled; hospital admission is indicated although death not imminent.
20=Very sick; hospital admission necessary; active supportive treatment necessary.
10=Moribund; fatal processes progressing rapidly.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have newly diagnosed brain metastases visible on brain MRI. A biopsy of
             the lesion is not required as long as the patient has a biopsy-proven malignancy
             elsewhere and a clinician deems the lesion to be metastatic.

          -  At least one brain metastasis must be ≥ 1cm to allow adequate quantitative imaging
             measurement for DSC-PMR.

          -  Patient must be clinically eligible for and elect to be treated with GK alone without
             WBRT.

          -  Patient must be ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patient must have Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of at least 60

          -  Patient may be part of other clinical trials (as long as no other local treatments
             beyond GK such as WBRT or other local therapy are indicated to the brain) or imaging
             studies.

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative must be able to understand and willing to
             sign a written informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must not have any medical contraindications to MRI (e.g., unsafe foreign
             metallic implants, incompatible pacemaker, inability to lie still for long periods,
             severe to end-stage kidney disease or on hemodialysis).

          -  Patient must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient must not have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60
             mL/min/1.73m2.

          -  Patient must not have melanoma.

          -  Patient must not have hemorrhagic lesions.
