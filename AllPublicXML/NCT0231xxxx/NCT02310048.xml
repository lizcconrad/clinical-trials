        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Caucasian males aged 18 to 55 years at Screening.

          -  Healthy and free from clinically significant illness or disease as determined by
             medical history, physical examination, laboratory, and other tests at Screening and
             Day -1.

          -  A body weight of â‰¥60 kilograms (kg) and BMI ranging from 18 to 30 kg/m2 at Screening
             or Day -1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence or history of severe adverse reaction or allergy to any medicinal product or
             relevant excipient that is of clinical significance.

          -  Participated in more than three clinical studies of a new chemical entity in the
             previous year or participated in a clinical study of any IMP within 12 weeks or five
             half-lives of the IMP before the administration of the IMP in this clinical study.

          -  Clinically relevant abnormal medical history, physical findings, or laboratory values
             at Screening or Day -1 that could interfere with the objectives of the study or the
             safety of the subject, as judged by the Investigator.

          -  Previous medical history of tuberculosis or in the opinion of the Investigator a
             recurrent medical history of cold sores, pharyngitis, urinary tract infection,
             diarrhoea/dysentery, chest infections, or fungal infection.

          -  Subjects who have received any prescribed systemic or topical medication within 14
             days prior to administration of the IMP(Day 1) unless, in the opinion of the
             Investigator and Sponsor, the medication will not interfere with the study procedures
             or compromise safety. Slow release medicinal formulations considered to still be
             active within 14 days prior to the first dose administration will also be excluded
             unless, in the opinion of the Investigator and Sponsor, the medication will not
             interfere with the study procedures or compromise safety.
