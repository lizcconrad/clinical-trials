    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical tranexamic acid to reduce
      perioperative blood loss, reduction in postoperative drain output and allogenic transfusion
      requirements.

      The proposed study will be a prospective, randomized, double-blind (subject, surgeons,
      investigators, research coordinators) placebo-controlled study. Patients following high
      energy trauma who have sustained thoracic or lumbar spine fractures, dislocations or
      ligamentous injury with resultant instability requiring posterior spinal fusion will be
      enrolled for this study. Furthermore, patients undergoing elective complex deformity surgery
      will also be enrolled. Both populations of patients will be randomized into two groups. Group
      I will receive standard of care operative fixation with topical tranexamic acid intervention
      (test); Group II will receive standard of care operative fixation with normal saline
      (placebo) intervention. This study will have a 2-year follow-up and will consist of three
      periods: screening/enrollment phase up to 21 days from the day of injury to the day of
      randomization and operative intervention, an inpatient data collection period for 4 days
      postoperative, and then a follow-up period for 2-years postoperative (visits occurring at 2
      week, 16 week, 1 year, and 2 year) time points.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reducing perioperative blood loss is critically important in the treatment of multiply
      injured combat casualties, and major blood loss during complex spine trauma surgery is a
      significant concern. Similar to previous studies in dental, cardiac, and total knee
      arthroplasty procedures, the use of topical tranexamic acid during complex combat related
      spine trauma surgery can be a cost-effective and simple route of administration to reduce
      blood loss, with no significant systemic effects. Patients would be expected to benefit
      immediately by decreasing blood loss and the need for blood transfusion postoperatively,
      thereby exposing them to less risk of transfusion reactions or disease transmission. This may
      also potentially decrease the rate of surgical site infection because patients have been
      found to have a significantly increased risk for surgical site infection after blood
      transfusion due to changes in the immune system, and by also decreasing the amount of blood
      that collects under the surgical wound, which serves as excellent medium for bacterial
      growth. The goal of the investigators study is to determine if the use of topical tranexamic
      acid (TXA) in the setting of complex spine trauma surgery reduces blood loss, and
      subsequently reduces the rate of allogenic blood transfusion and surgical site infection.
