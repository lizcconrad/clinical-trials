  <brief_summary>

      Background:

      - Genes are the instructions our body uses to function. Researchers can look for changes, or
      variants, in the genes. The goal of this study is to find new gene changes that lead to lipid
      disorders. Older research methods looked at one or a few genes at a time. Genomic sequencing
      looks at most of the genes at once. Genomic sequencing may find the cause researchers haven t
      been able to find from past methods.

      Objectives:

      - To better understand genetic causes of lipid disorders through genomic sequencing.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 2 and older with unusual lipid disorders, and their relatives.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have
           blood taken. They may give a saliva sample.

        -  Based on the screening test, researchers will chose 3 5 family members to perform the
           genomic sequencing. The sequencing will be done on a sample of DNA collected during the
           blood draw and saliva sample.

        -  Participants may be invited to take part in other protocols that may involve imaging of
           their heart or blood vessels. They do not have to participate. If they do, they will
           sign a separate consent for those tests.

        -  If a participant s family member cannot travel to the NIH, the NIH documents and consent
           will be reviewed during a teleconference. A blood or sputum kit will be mailed to them.

      The primary purpose of this discovery protocol is to identify new lipid genes from subjects
      with rare genetic lipids disorders. We will take advantage of the new technology of whole
      exome sequencing to find the cause of dyslipidemia that we haven t been able to find using
      past methods. We will work with geneticists to review the sequence data for unexpected gene
      changes (incidental findings) that do not explain the lipid disorder but gene changes that
      can cause medical disorders such as rare forms of cancer or heart disease. The opportunity to
      participate in the Clinical Center Genomics Opportunity (CCGO) program will enable us to take
      advantage of our expertise in other rare lipid disorders and translate this knowledge into
      new diagnostics and therapies, which is a key mission of the NIH.
