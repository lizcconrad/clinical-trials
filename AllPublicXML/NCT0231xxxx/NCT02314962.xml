  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic comparison between PET/CT and PET/MRI with integrated perfusion measurement in CT
      and MR. Study aim is to gain knowledge about additional value of CT perfusion and MR
      perfusion in solid tumors concerning tumor physiology, diagnostic accuracy and possibly
      prognostic.
