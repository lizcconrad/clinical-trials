    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that has effects on both
      movement and mental health. One of the most common mental health complications of PD is
      depression. Up to 30% of Parkinson's patients will experience depression at some point. We
      aim to investigate whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a type of
      electrical stimulation for the brain, can improve depression in PD as well as improve motor
      function in PD.

      The purpose of this double-blind, randomized control design study is to investigate the
      efficacy of 15-sessions of tDCS (versus 15-sessions of sham tDCS) to treat depression in PD.
      We will also assess dopamine function in a smaller cohort of participants before and after
      their 15 sessions of tDCS by using PET scanning.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. are outpatients,

          2. are voluntary and competent to consent to treatment,

          3. have a Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) confirmed diagnosis of
             major depressive disorder (MDD),

          4. have a diagnosis of PD according to the UK PD brain bank criteria,

          5. are 19 years of age or more,

          6. have a score &gt; 13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II),

          7. still have depressive symptoms after 6 weeks or more of antidepressant (SSRI)
             medication treatment (and on a stabilized dose of at least 4 weeks),

          8. are able to adhere to the treatment schedule,

          9. are proficient in written and verbal English.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. have a history of substance dependence or abuse within the last 6 months,

          2. have a concomitant significant unstable medical illness,

          3. have active suicidal intent,

          4. have any history of seizure or medication-resistant epilepsy in the family,

          5. have a lifetime Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) diagnosis of
             bipolar I or II disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform
             disorder, delusional disorder, or current psychotic symptoms

             investigator to be primary and causing greater impairment than MDD,

          7. have failed a course of ECT in the current episode or previous episode,

          -  Brain aneurysm clip;

          -  Electrical stimulator for nerves or bones;

          -  Ear or eye implant;

          -  Implanted drug infusion pump;
