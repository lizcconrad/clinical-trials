  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: The project aims to assess if hard ceramic coatings on orthodontic archwires will
      reduce the sliding resistance of archwires in the brackets during orthodontic treatment
      procedures.

      Participants: Up to 80 subjects will be recruited for this study. Subjects between 10 years
      of age and 45 years old will be otherwise healthy subjects previously diagnosed with
      malocclusion.

      Procedures (methods): Each subject will receive an experimental (coated) or a regular
      (uncoated control) orthodontic archwire (AW) for a 3-month treatment. The 3D digital images
      of each subject's dentition will be recorded three times at 0-, 6- and 12-week visits. The AW
      will be removed and retrieved after the 3-month trial.

      In this trial, nano-crystalline ceramics will be applied to the surface of orthodontic
      archwires using ion beam assisted deposition to reduce sliding resistance. Excessive sliding
      resistance works against tooth motion as the bracket slides along the wire into a new
      position. These ceramic coatings will produce more predictable outcomes, requiring less force
      and shorter treatment time. A limited clinical trial will be conducted to demonstrate these
      effects.

      The aim of this project is to assess the clinical efficacy of the new archwires in Stage 1
      (leveling and aligning) and Stage 2 (space closure) of orthodontic treatment using a twin
      bracket. The working hypothesis is that reduction of sliding resistance in bracket-wire
      interfaces will allow effective tooth movement in leveling, aligning, and sliding, while
      minimizing unwanted tooth movement such as lateral (mesio-distal direction) movement due to
      friction. This will be tested in a total of 80 patients who are undergoing active treatment
      in the University of North Carolina (UNC) orthodontic graduate clinic. These patients will be
      comprised of a treatment group (coated) and a control group (uncoated) of 20 each in Stage 1
      and Stage 2 treatment.

      A successful program will demonstrate a clinically significant increase in the amount and
      rate-of-change of tooth movement in leveling, aligning, and sliding teeth.
