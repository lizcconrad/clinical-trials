      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of talazoparib when given together
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to
      other places in the body or cannot be removed by surgery. Talazoparib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Giving talazoparib with carboplatin and paclitaxel may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of
      talazoparib (BMN 673) seven day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BMN
      673 three day schedule in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of BMN 673 in combination with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel.

      II. To determine whether the pharmacokinetic parameters of BMN 673 when given in combination
      with carboplatin and paclitaxel correlate with thrombocytopenia.

      III. To observe and record anti-tumor activity of BMN 673 alone after the combination with
      carboplatin, paclitaxel and BMN673.

      IV. To observe the safety and tolerability of BMN 673 in combination with paclitaxel and
      carboplatin and BMN 673 alone after the combination therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To serially evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics parameters and use indirect
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics models to correlate with tumor response and resistance to
      the combination BMN 673, carboplatin, and paclitaxel therapy.

      II. To explore mechanisms of resistance to the combination of BMN 673 with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of talazoparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      dosing schedules.

      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive talazoparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7, paclitaxel
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      SCHEDULE B: Patients receive talazoparib PO QD on days 1-3, paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days
      1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for 4-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      At any time after 4-6 courses of treatment, patients may continue combination study therapy
      with talazoparib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel, talazoparib and carboplatin, talazoparib alone
      (continuous dosing), or observation without therapy at the discretion of the treating
      physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.

    <measure>Anti-tumor response (as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Responses will be summarized by simple descriptive summary statistics delineating complete and partial responses as well as stable and progressive disease, stratified by treatment schedule. 90% confidence intervals for the proportions of subjects with a confirmed anti-tumor response will be computed for dose levels with 6 or more patients. Exact logistic regression analysis will be performed to evaluate the dose-response relationship. Chi-square or Fisher's exact test will be used to compare responses between treatment schedules.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks after last dose of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of types and severities for each schedule and dose level separately. The number and severity of toxicity incidents will be analyzed descriptively in tabular format. Comparisons between dose level arms will be performed using Fisher's exact test. Ninety percent confidence intervals for dose-limiting toxicity rates will be constructed for dose levels with 6 or more patients.</description>

    <description>All pharmacokinetic parameters will be summarized by treatment schedule dose level using standard descriptive statistics: means, medians, ranges, and standard deviations (if numbers and distribution permit). The Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test will be performed to determine the significance of the association between increasing dose level and each of the pharmacokinetic parameters within each treatment schedule. A Spearman rank correlation analysis will be performed to determine the relationship between actual dose administered and the pharmacokinetic parameters.</description>

    <description>The number and frequency of mutation status changes from the baseline biopsy assessment to the biopsy obtained at the time of progression will be summarized in tabular format. The frequency of mutation status changes will be analyzed using a paired t-test or nonparametric Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. A negative binomial regression model will be utilized to account for the dose effect. The presence of individual mutations will be compared between the baseline and time of progression assessment using a paired McNemar's test. The Benjamini-Hochberg method will also be utilized.</description>

    <description>Maximum concentration levels will be summarized in terms of means, standard deviations and ranges. Linear mixed effects modeling with subject specific random effects will be performed to evaluate maximum concentration and plasma concentration collected on day 1 and day 3 predict changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
