      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy followed by combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Stereotactic body
      radiation therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that delivers one to five high doses of
      radiation directly to the tumor and may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal
      tissue than conventional radiation. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and
      paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy, followed by
      carboplatin, and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation may kill more tumor
      cells and result in a better and more durable response than conventional radiation and
      chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to test the safety of this approach prior to
      larger studies.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety/feasibility of delivering chemotherapy after definitive
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for selected stage/situations of non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 1-year progression free survival in the sub-population of patients with
      stage IB/II NSCLC, i.e. the &quot;curative intent&quot; subgroup of patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy every other day for up to 14 days for a
      total of 5 fractions. After a break period of about 30 days, patients will then start
      chemotherapy. Patients will receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day
      1 and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30-40 minutes on days 1,
      8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have pathologic diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), by
             either histologic biopsy, or cytologic evidence; highly suspicious cytology (i.e.
             abnormal cells suspicious for malignancy) is acceptable, in the setting of a strongly
             positive computed tomography (CT)/positron emission tomography (PET) (standardized
             uptake value [SUV] &gt; 5.0)

          -  Patients must be considered appropriate for stereotactic body radiation therapy
             (SBRT); this is determined on an individualized basis, by the prospective
             multidisciplinary tumor board, that includes representation from surgical, radiation
             and medical oncology; criteria for appropriateness for SBRT include all of the
             following:

               -  Stage I/II non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) - no evidence of distant
                  metastases (patients with up to three lung nodules may be considered to have
                  'multiple primary' lung cancer rather than metastatic lung cancer and thus will
                  be eligible; if a lymph node(s) ≥ 2 cm and/or PET-SUV ≥ 4.0 is identified, biopsy
                  must be performed (and be negative) for the patient to be eligible; patients
                  thought to have M1b disease, or malignant pleural/pericardial effusions are not
                  eligible

               -  Staging including CT chest, PET/CT must be up-to-date, i.e. within 6 weeks prior
                  to registration; brain imaging (contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
                  [MRI] or CT) is suggested for all patients, but is only mandatory for patients
                  with abnormal neurologic exam

               -  Tumor size ≤ 7 cm in greatest dimension based upon an up-to-date CT (and/or
                  CT/PET) within 6 weeks prior to enrollment onto the study; radiation therapy
                  treatment planning imaging is acceptable)

               -  The patient must not be a candidate for (or declines because of high risk)
                  surgical resection because of medical comorbidity/risk; the patient must have
                  undergone an evaluation by an experienced thoracic surgeon within 12 weeks prior
                  to registration; standard justification criteria may include forced expiratory
                  volume in 1 second (FEV1) &lt; 40% predicted; predicted postoperative FEV1 ≤ 30%

                  (corresponds to inability to walk at least 100 yards without rest); baseline
                  hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen [pO2] ≤ 55 mg HG and/or pulse oxygen [ox] &lt;
                  88%), baseline hypercapnia (carbon dioxide [CO2] ≥ 45 mm Hg; there are also
                  other, less objective criteria, including severe end-organ damage from
                  diabetes/hypertension, severe atherosclerotic disease (heart, brain, aorta,
                  peripheral artery)

               -  Tumor(s) must be in a location/configuration such that risk of fistula is
                  considered relatively low; this means that there can be no evidence of tumor

                  or mainstem bronchus or esophagus; additional studies may be needed to assess
                  this, including CT angiogram, MRI, bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy

          -  One or more of the following &quot;risk&quot; criteria for failure with conventional SBRT

                  study for treatment with SBRT is 3 (Three), and all lesions must be amenable to
                  SBRT and treated with SBRT on this study; note that it is not necessary for all
                  lesions felt to be malignant to be biopsied
