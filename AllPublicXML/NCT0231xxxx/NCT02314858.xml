  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is seen in approximately 6% of Americans. It is a serious
      medical condition with significant medical and psychological consequences, including
      diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. The treatment of choice for OSA is
      Positive Airway Pressure therapy (PAP). PAP supplies positive pressure to the upper airway
      creating a &quot;pneumatic splint&quot; to keep the airway open during sleep. Adherence to PAP is
      notoriously low, with as few as 50% reaching minimal guidelines for adherence. One
      comprehensive review of adherence research found that adherence to PAP was less than that for
      any other medical disorder. The problem of adherence is significant not only because of the
      medical consequences that can ensue, but also because third party payers have begun to refuse
      to pay for PAP therapy when adherence is less than optimal, even in the face of clinical
      improvement. This is a critical time to address this problem.

      This research study is designed to identify methods that may help people respond to PAP, the
      most common therapy for OSA. Identifying these methods may be an important way to better care
      for patients with obstructive sleep apnea. With this research, the investigators hope to find
      ways to help people have a better response to treatment and a better quality of life.

    <description>Treatment adherence as measured directly from the participant's PAP device. Adherence is monitored objectively as time at prescribed pressure and daily measures of adherence are transmitted remotely to the study site nightly using a wireless modem. There are several specific adherence measures that will be available from the PAP units. These include the average hours of use per night across all nights, the average hours of use on nights PAP is actually used, and the percentage of nights PAP is used across all nights.</description>

    <description>Our BPV intervention focuses on augmenting risk perception and reducing optimistic bias by showing the patient a dramatic video of his/her own apnea (which shows them struggle to breathe), as well as by explaining the physiological processes involved in an apneic event. Specific apneic events are highlighted and associated decreases in blood oxygen levels are demonstrated via oxygen saturation recording superimposed on the video. This group will receive educational information about OSA, its consequences and the need for treatment.</description>
