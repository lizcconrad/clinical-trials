  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is one the most common causes of chronic pain syndromes in women. It causes
      considerable costs in primary health care setting as well as specialized medical care
      sector.Electrotherapy and exercise therapy has shown to have short-term pain relieving
      effects in randomized controlled trials (RCT) among fibromyalgia patients. However, there is
      sparse knowledge about the effects of long-term RCTs in the treatment of pain in
      fibromyalgia, as there are no publications about cost-effectiveness analysis of such
      treatments.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the BEMER electromagnetic field therapy
      device has beneficial long-term effects in the treatment of pain, and whether it improves
      fibromyalgia patients' quality of life. In addition, this study investigates whether the
      BEMER device treatment is cost-effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia patients.

      The participants of this study are working age female patients from the Central Finland
      Health Care District, and who have been treating because of severe pain. After eligibility
      has been assessed by health-related questionnaire and clinical examination, the participants
      will be randomly assigned into the treatment or control group. Treatment group patients will
      receive the loan activated BEMER-care unit, while controls will receive inactivated sham
      BEMER-unit. All participants will use the device regularly on a daily bases over three
      months. After one month treatment break, the treatment group will become a control group and
      control group will become a treatment group according cross-over design principle. Switching
      the groups will take place by changing the BEMER devices during the break. Throughout the
      study, both participants and researchers are unaware whether the participants are using
      activated or inactivated BEMER-devices. The research will be carried out and coordinated by
      Central Finland Central Hospital, and the research project will take place between September
      2014 and December 2015.
