      To evaluate the improvement in symptoms of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) according to
      the Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Quality- of- Life (QoL) index after add- on therapy of
      Umooze twice daily administration for 56 days in patients with BPH.

      The study product, Umooze, contain Astragalus radix extracts and Soy extracts as the
      combination of 960:40 in one 500 mg tablet. Umooze is sold in the market as food. The
      objective of this study is to evaluate the benefit of Umooze as add- on therapy in BPH, by
      evaluation the improvement in symptoms of BPH assessed according to the International
      Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Quality- of- Life (QoL) index after add- on therapy of
      Umooze in patients with BPH. The IPSS is a validated 7-item urinary symptom severity scale.

      A randomized, two-regimen, placebo-controlled, parallel- design is used in this study in
      which each subject will receive Umooze or placebo. The add- on study product will be
      administered twice daily for 56 days. Benefit will be evaluated at baseline and subsequently
      on the study day 28, 42, and 56, such as IPSS index, QoL index, Qmax, PVR, prostate volume
      and Prostate-specific antigen(PSA).

Var. mongholicus and is used as a tonic in the traditional Chinese medicine. According to the reports submitted by the National Cancer institute of American, people who eat soybean products can reduce the incidence rate for prostate cancer. The composition of Umooze is invented by Golden Biotechnology Corp. against prostatic hyperplasia. Umooze is used as add- on therapy for the subjects who take the medication for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Each subject receives the study product in the morning and evening for a continuous 56- day. Each oral dose of Umooze was given 2 tablets with about 240 ml of water.</description>

Umooze: Umooze is consisted of Astragalus radix extracts and soy isoflavones. Astragalus radix (AR) is the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus Bge. Var. mongholicus and is used as a tonic in the traditional Chinese medicine. According to the reports submitted by the National Cancer institute of American, people who eat soybean products can reduce the incidence rate for prostate cancer. The composition of Umooze is invented by Golden Biotechnology Corp. against prostatic hyperplasia. Umooze is used as add- on therapy for the subjects who take the medication for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Each subject receives the study product in the morning and evening for a continuous 56- day. Each oral dose of Umooze was given 2 tablets with about 240 ml of water.</description>
