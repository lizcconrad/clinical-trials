        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must fulfil all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for

          1. Adult male or female subject, 18-70 years of age, inclusive.

          2. Light- or non-smoking, male and female subjects, 18 to 70 years of age. Note: subjects
             that regularly smoke greater than 10 cigarettes per day will not be considered
             light-smokers and should not be included. Additionally, the use of any cigars, pipes,
             vapor inhalers or any other tobacco containing product is prohibited within 6 months
             prior to drug administration.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 19 and ≤ 40 (kg/m2).

          4. No clinically significant findings in vital signs measurements. The acceptable range
             for seated systolic blood pressure is 90-150 mmHg and for diastolic blood pressure is
             50-95 mmHg.

          5. No clinically significant abnormal laboratory values that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would compromise the subject's safety or the integrity of the study
             results.

          6. Either have: elevated triglyceride levels (2.26 to 4.52 mmol/L [200 to 400 mg/dL]), or
             · triglyceride levels 2.26 to 3.95 mmol/L (200 to 350 mg/dL) and are on stable statin
             therapy.

          7. Total cholesterol levels ≤ 7.75 mmol/L (≤ 300 mg/dL).

          8. Hemoglobin ≥ 135 g/L for males or ≥ 120 g/L for females at screening.

          9. No clinically significant findings in a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)

         10. Have no significant diseases.

         11. Willing to use an acceptable, effective method of contraception.

         12. Be informed of the nature of the study and give written consent prior to any study
             procedure.

         13. Have no clinically significant findings from a physical examination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may be excluded from the study if there is evidence of any of the following
        criteria at screening, check-in, or at any time during the study, as appropriate:

          1. History or presence of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hepatic, renal,
             haematological, gastrointestinal (GI), endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic,
             neurological, or psychiatric disease in the opinion of the PI.

          2. Personal or familial history of bleeding disorder(s), thromboembolic disease, clinical
             GI bleeding, or any history of GI surgery except uncomplicated appendectomy or
             cholecystectomy, or colorectal surgery for polyps, nonmalignant tumors, or
             diverticula.

          3. Positive urine drug/alcohol testing at screening or check-in.

          4. Positive result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B surface antigen
             (HBsAg), or hepatitis C antibodies (HCV).

          5. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within the past 2 years.

          6. Known sensitivity or allergy to fish, shellfish, gelatin or omega-3 products.

          7. Subject is a female who is pregnant or lactating.

          8. Use of any drugs known to induce or inhibit hepatic drug metabolism within 30 days
             prior to drug administration

          9. Donation of blood or significant blood loss within 56 days prior to check- in.

         10. Participation in another clinical trial within 30 days prior drug administration.
