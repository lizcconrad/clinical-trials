      Purpose: To develop a model for internet-based support and coaching to young adults with
      neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). To improve the individual's psychosocial functioning and
      his/her understanding of how he/she is functioning.

      NPD comprise problems with social interaction, attention, impulse control and hyperactivity.
      The most common NPD diagnoses are ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), autism
      spectrum condition (ASC) and Tourette's disorder (TD). In this study the investigators use
      Internet-based treatment for young adults with NPD.

      Method: Support/coaching by using communication over the Internet (chat and e-mail) with
      individuals with NPD. Twice every week during 8 weeks, young adults with NPD are offered
      support and coaching over the Internet by psychologist/educational therapist with great
      experience from NPD. The individuals are assessed before and after treatment pertaining to
      quality of life, sense of coherence, self-esteem, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and
      parents' evaluation of the young adult's situation.

      Aims: To develop an internet-based support and coaching model for young people with autism
      spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and to
      validate the model. Method: A user centred design was applied to develop a model for
      internet-based support and coaching, where individuals received eight-week support via
      internet (chat). The model was validated by ten individuals, 15 to 26 years of age, with ASD
      and/or ADHD. Self-report questionnaires (Sense of Coherence (SOC), the Rosenberg Self Esteem
      Scale, the Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA), Montgomery Ã…sberg
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD)) were
      distributed before and after intervention. A structured interview regarding the quality of
      the model, the Patient perspective of Care and Rehabilitation process (POCR), was used after
      the intervention. Results: The validation showed significant improvement of SOC, self-esteem
      and subjective Quality of Life at follow-up and the majority perceived high
      fulfilment/importance on the POCR. Conclusions: The model can be an important complement to
      other interventions for young people with ASD and/or ADHD.

    <description>The Manchester Short Assessment of Quality of Life (MANSA) is a 16-item scale that consists of four objective QoL questions and 12 questions pertaining to &quot;life as a whole, job (or studies), financial situation, friendships, leisure activities, accommodation, personal safety, people that the person lives with, family and health&quot;.</description>

    <description>Before the individual started with the internet-based support and coaching (IBSC), a meeting with the coach was compulsory to discuss what specific issues they were going to work with during the period of IBSC. The IBSC was offered at fixed times twice a week during an eight-week period. Two meetings between the individual and the coach were included. Between chat sessions the individuals and the coaches could get in touch using the programme's e-mail. The content of the support and coaching was individualised based on each individual's requirement. Once a fortnight a meeting was held with the head of the project and coaches. Issues regarding ongoing support and coaching were addressed.</description>
