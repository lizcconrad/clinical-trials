      Background:

      - By the time diseases of the retina are detected, serious damage has often already been
      done. Researchers want to find better ways of viewing the retina. One way called adaptive
      optics may help detect problems earlier.

      Objectives:

      - To study if adaptive optics can help find better ways to diagnose, treat, and manage
      retinal diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  People over age 12 with an eye disease.

        -  Healthy volunteers over age 12 with 20/20 vision or better.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and eye exams. These may include
           dilating pupils and taking pictures of the eyes.

        -  Participants will have 1 or more study visits. They will have:

        -  Medical and eye history.

        -  Questions about their medications.

        -  Eye exam including pupil dilation.

        -  Adaptive optics imaging. After dilation, participants sit still while looking into an
           adaptive optics instrument. They look at specific places and images are taken of their
           retina.

        -  They may also have:

        -  More images.

        -  Perimetry. Participants look into a lens and press a button when they see a light.

        -  Color vision tests.

        -  Electroretinogram. Participants will get numbing eye drops and special contact lenses. A
           small metal electrode will be put on their forehead. They will look at flashing lights
           and try not to blink.

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to collect and assess adaptive optics (AO)
      retinal images of normal and diseased eyes.

      Study Population: Three hundred and fifty (350) participants with eye diseases and

      250 normal volunteers will be enrolled.

      Design: This is an observational protocol which will enroll 350 participants with various eye
      diseases and 250 age-matched healthy volunteers over five years. In general, participants
      will undergo a complete ophthalmic examination including assessments of visual acuity,
      intraocular pressure, and a dilated ocular examination. Imaging will be performed using
      adaptive optics instruments provided by Canon, Inc and the Medical College of Wisconsin.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome for this protocol is qualitative and quantitative
      assessment of the AO images with comparisons of normal and diseased states.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will be eligible if they:

          -  Are 12 years of age or older.

          -  Have the ability to cooperate with an eye exam and adaptive optics imaging.

          -  Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal
             guardian to do so if they are minor children.

          -  Have an eye disease or are a healthy volunteer with 20/20 or better vision.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Participants will not be eligible if:

        -They have a condition which prevents adequate images from being obtained (e.g. unstable
        fixation or media opacity).

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR FLUORESCEIN AND/OR INDOCYANINE GREEN IMAGING

        Partaicipants are not eligible for fluorescein and/or indocyanine green imaging if they:

          -  Are under 18 years of age.

          -  For participants who will undergo fluorescein imaging have a history of adverse
             reaction to fluorescein.

          -  For participants who will undergo indocyanine green imaging have a history of adverse
             reaction to indocyanine green dye, know or suspected allergies to iodine or shellfish.
