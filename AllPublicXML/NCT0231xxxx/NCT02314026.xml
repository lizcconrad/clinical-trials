      This study's aim is to develop an algorithm for the ¹³C-Octanoate Breath Test with or without
      the ¹³C-Methacetin Breath Test (OBT and MBT respectively) for correlation with histological
      findings associated with of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) and other liver diseases
      using the BreathID® System

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing epidemic in the western world due to the
      contemporary eating habits and life styles.NASH can lead to cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma and
      other liver complications. There are currently some treatments available. The only definitive
      way of detecting NASH in patients with advanced liver disease is by liver biopsy. However,
      liver biopsy has disadvantages, such as sampling errors, chance of complications and does not
      lend itself to following up after treatment.

      A non-invasive test that could potentially replace biopsy and aid in NASH detection and
      treatment monitoring, would improve management of suspected NASH patients without the need
      for biopsy. This protocol will obtain the results of one or two different breath tests to
      provide an accurate evaluation of the liver status in patients at high risk for NASH.
