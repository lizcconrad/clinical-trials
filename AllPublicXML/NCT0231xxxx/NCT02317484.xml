      The purpose of this study is to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of Sodium Glucose
      Co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, ipragliflozin, at doses of 50mg and 100mg, for Type II
      Diabetes under usual care. It is also to investigate and analyze the exploratory influential
      factor of ipragliflozin treatment on clinical efficacy and safety.
