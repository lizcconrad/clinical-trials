  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arthritis is one of the most prevailing causes of disability with knee osteoarthritis (KOA)
      the most common form. The lifetime risk of developing symptomatic KOA by the age of 85 years
      is 44.7%, where females are at a greater risk (1.8 times) than male counter parts. KOA is the
      leading cause of limitations in activities of daily living such as walking and climbing
      stairs particularly in the elderly. This is primarily due to pain and instability of the
      joint resulting in buckling of knees caused by muscle weakness, joint stiffness and damage.
      Patients with KOA have larger variations in muscle strength and are unable to maintain a
      target force combined with impaired ability to perceive joint movement and positioning
      suggests impaired neuromuscular control (NC) may influence KOA. NC refers to the nervous
      system's control over muscle activation contributing to task performance. This study aims to
      establish the role of loss of NC in biomechanical determinants and health outcomes of KOA.

    <description>Neuromuscular control will be assessed through muscle co-activation index from electromyography (EMG) of the hamstrings, quadriceps and gastrocnemius. The electromechanical delay (delay between the onset of EMG and force), active proprioception and force accuracy and steadiness measure determined from submaximal isometric contractions will be used to determine neuromuscular control</description>

    <description>Joint damage scored using the Boston Leeds Osteoarthritis Knee Score (BLOKS) from 1.5T MRI along with pain and function assessed from knee injury and osteoarthritis score (KOOS) and patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) will be used to determine disease outcome.</description>
