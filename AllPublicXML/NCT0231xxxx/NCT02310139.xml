  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a commonly used investigation to diagnose and treat various gastrointestinal
      disorders. In addition, colonoscopy provides the opportunity to remove colonic adenomas this
      removal is also known as polypectomy.

      Polypectomy has proven to reduce occurrence of colorectal cancer and likelihood of dying from
      it. Colonoscopy can be challenging due to technical or patient factors. In a small proportion
      of patients a complete colonoscopy is unsuccessful. Such patients either get referred to a
      tertiary centre with extensive experience in difficult colonoscopy or have an alternative
      test such as CT scan. The investigators unit has accumulated significant experience related
      to previously failed colonoscopy and anecdotally appears to have a high success rate in
      completing the procedure.

      The purpose of this project is to describe the investigators technical approach to management
      of patients with previously failed colonoscopy. There is no additional intervention and the
      project is observational in nature. The investigators will collect data on patient
      characteristics, the reason for the failure and what technique was used to overcome the
      difficulty. The investigators will also note whether the final outcome of the technique had
      any impact on the overall management of the patient.
