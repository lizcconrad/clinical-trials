  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, cohort study to evaluate the potential mechanisms of Saxagliptin
      in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using a comprehensive metabolomic
      method, in combination with fingerprint analysis and target analysis. It is a sub-study of
      STUDY: D168L00008.
