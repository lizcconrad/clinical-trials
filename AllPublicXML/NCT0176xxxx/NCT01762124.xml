  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to determine how a new transcatheter pulmonary
      valve will move and perform once implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medtronic, Inc. is in the process of developing a novel transcatheter device option for
      patients with congenital heart disease, without right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits,
      called the Native Outflow Tract Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve. Given limitations in the
      animal model to confirm device boundary conditions, this feasibility study is proposed to
      characterize that information as well as evaluate safety, procedural feasibility and
      performance data to be used for future development of the device.
