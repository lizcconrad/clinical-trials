      The domestic standards of G-CSF permit the use of the G-CSF only when the ANC(absolute
      neutrophil count) drops to 1,000/uL or below. Therefore it is impossible to inject the G-CSF
      in order to prevent neutropenia. However, 'the 2006 Update of Recommendations for the Use of
      White Blood Cell Growth Factors: An Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guideline(J ClinOncol
      2006; 24:3187-3205)' and the 'NCCN Guideline' have revealed that as a precaution, it is
      appropriate to inject the G-CSF to the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with high-risk factors
      under the anticancer treatment of CHOP-21 Rituximab before the number of neutrophils
      decreases. Thus, it is intended to analyze the risk factors of febrile neutropenia in a
      high-risk group of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with a neutropenic fever who receive the
      CHOP-like regimen and primary G-CSF prophylactic therapy every three weeks. (The definition
      of neutropenic fever is a fever over 38.3 degrees C or continuous fever lasting longer than 1
      hour over 38 degrees C with the number of neutrophil ≤ 500/uL or neutrophil ≤ 1,000/uL in
      case of expected decline to ≤ 500/uL within 48 hours.)
