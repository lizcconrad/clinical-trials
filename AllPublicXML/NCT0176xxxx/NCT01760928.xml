    <textblock>
      A selection of asthma patients were followed during preparation to climb the Aconcagua
      mountain. The primary goal of this follow up was to optimize patients' asthma status. Also
      during expedition, these patients were daily consulted by a physician. All data obtained
      during preparation and expedition will now be retrospectively analyzed.

      Preparation phase:

      Eighteen asthma patients were selected based on physical and medical characteristics. During
      the year of preparation, several time points of evaluation were planned: evaluation at
      baseline, maximal exercise test in hypoxia (FiO2: 11%), 24hour stay at cold air environment.

      At baseline, medical history was evaluated and clinical examination, ECG, lung function,
      Fraction of exhaled NO measurement and histamine provocation were performed.

      During a second visit, patients stayed for approximately one hour in a chamber to simulate
      high altitude (FiO2:11%) and performed a maximal exercise test after 30 minutes of rest.
      Oxygen saturation, ECG and oxygen consumption were continuously monitored. Lung function and
      fraction of exhaled NO were assessed before and after the test. Also, peripheral blood was
      drawn before and after the test. This test allowed us to identify whether patients may
      develop acute mountain sickness later on during expedition.

      During a third visit, patients stayed for 24 hours in a indoor ski centre to practice
      climbing techniques, building up a tent and working with the specialized materials.
      Temperature at the ski piste varies between -5°C and -10°C. Lung function, fraction of
      exhaled NO and induced sputum was assessed before and after the stay at the ski centre.

      During the expedition, clinical status, heart rate and oxygen saturation were measured daily.
      Also, lung function and fraction of exhaled NO were regularly measured. A screening for acute
      mountain sickness was performed daily. Asthmatics patients were supported by two
      pulmonologist. Before and after expedition, spirometry, histamine provocation and induced
      sputum were performed.
