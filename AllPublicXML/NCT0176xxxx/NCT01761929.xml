  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective Phase II study.The purpose of this study is to monitor the side effects
      and treatment outcomes of delivering higher doses of radiation therapy to the tumour, while
      limiting the dose of radiation to the normal tissues. This will be done using a 5 day
      treatment schedule.

      The characteristics of patients whose disease remains confined to limited areas in the long
      term, compared with those who do not will also be described.

      Endpoints are to describe: the proportion of patients with local control for the index site
      at 1 year; the number of index lesion(s) with local control at 1 year; acute and late AEs
      related to SBRT; time to local progression for the index site; time to distant disease
      progression; symptom and QoL profile; median survival.
