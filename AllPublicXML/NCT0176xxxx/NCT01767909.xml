  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An urgent need exists to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can
      arrest or reverse the disease at its earliest stages. The emotional and financial burden of
      AD to patients, family members, and society is enormous, and is predicted to grow
      exponentially as the median population age increases. Current FDA-approved therapies are
      modestly effective at best. This study will examine a novel therapeutic approach using
      intranasal insulin (INI) that has shown promise in short-term clinical trials. If successful,
      information gained from the study has the potential to move INI forward rapidly as a therapy
      for AD. The study will also provide evidence for the mechanisms through which INI may produce
      benefits by examining key cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and hippocampal/entorhinal
      atrophy. These results will have considerable clinical and scientific significance, and
      provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge about insulin's effects on AD pathophysiology.
      Growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain, and that
      insulin dysregulation may contribute to AD pathogenesis.

      This study will examine the effects of intranasally-administered insulin on cognition,
      entorhinal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD. It is hypothesized that after 12 months
      of treatment with INI compared to placebo, subjects will improve performance on a global
      measure of cognition, on a memory composite and on daily function. In addition to the
      examination of CSF biomarkers and hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy, the study aims to
      examine whether baseline AD biomarker profile, gender, or Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE-ε4)
      allele carriage predict treatment response.

      In this study, 240 people with aMCI or AD will be given either INI or placebo for 12 months,
      following an open-label period of 6 months where all participants will be given active drug.
      The study uses insulin as a therapeutic agent and intranasal administration focusing on nose
      to brain transport as a mode of delivery.

    <measure>Change in global measure of cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 12 (ADAS-Cog12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15</time_frame>
    <description>The ADAS-Cog is a psychometric instrument that evaluates memory, attention, reasoning, language, orientation, and praxis. A higher score indicates more impairment. Scores from the original portion of the test range from 0 (best) to 70 (worse) and then number of items not recalled ranging from 0-10 is added for a maximum score of 80. A positive change indicates cognitive worsening. This study will be using the ADAS-Cog12 version, which includes Delayed Word Recall - a measure of episodic memory.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Memory Composite as measured by Story Recall and Buschke Selective Reminding Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 6, 12, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>A memory composite measure combines two episodic memory measures, immediate and delayed recall. Story Recall is a test of contextual verbal recall, in which participants listen to a story containing 44 informational bits that is read once. Participants will be asked to recall the story immediately after the reading and after a 20-minute delay. Credit is awarded for each bit recalled verbatim or accurately paraphrased.
The Buschke Selective Reminding Test measures verbal memory through multiple trials of a list learning task. A list of 12 words is audibly presented to the participants, who then recall as many words as possible. On subsequent trials, participants are only told those words they omitted on the previous trial. The procedure continues until the participant recalls all words on two subsequent trials or to the twelfth trial. After a 30-minute delay, participants recall as many items as possible. The number of items recalled after the delay will be summed.</description>

    <measure>Change in daily functioning as measured by the ADCS-MCI Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL-MCI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 6, 12, and 18</time_frame>
    <description>The Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-ADL) is an activities of daily living questionnaire aimed at detecting functional decline in people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In a structured interview format, informants are queried as to whether participants attempted each item in the inventory during the prior 4 weeks and their level of performance. The questions focus predominantly on instrumental activities of daily living scales (e.g. shopping, preparing meals, using household appliances, keeping appointments, reading). The total score can range from 0-54.</description>
