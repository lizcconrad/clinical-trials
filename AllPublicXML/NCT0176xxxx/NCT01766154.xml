  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tirofiban concentration in the blood over a period
      of 24 hours after tirofiban administration. Subjects with varying degrees of renal
      insufficiency (i.e. kidney function) will be included in the study. Tirofiban is known to be
      cleared from the blood by the kidneys and so people with kidney problems clear tirofiban to a
      slower extent compared to people without kidney problems. By comparing the tirofiban
      concentration profile between subjects with healthy kidney function versus with impaired
      kidney function, a tirofiban dosing recommendation for subjects with impaired kidney function
      can be made.

      This is a non-randomized, single-center, open-label study. A single dose of tirofiban (25
      µg/kg administered intravenously over a 3 min period) will be administered to subjects with
      normal renal function (&gt;90 mL/min CrCl), moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (&lt;30 mL/min
      CrCl) renal impairment with non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency

    <textblock>
      Tirofiban is cleared from the plasma largely by renal excretion. As a consequence, a dosage
      adjustment of 50% of the tirofiban label dosing regimen (0.4 μg/kg/min for a period of 30
      minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.10 μg/kg/min) is recommended in patients with severe
      renal impairment (&lt;30 mL/min CrCl), including those who require hemodialysis. The dosage
      adjustment for the tirofiban high-dose bolus regimen (25 μg/kg bolus followed by a 0.15
      μg/kg/min maintenance) for patients with varying degrees of renal insufficiency is however
      unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the extent of dosage adjustment for the
      high-dose bolus regimen for patients with moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (&lt;30
      mL/min CrCl) renal insufficiency.

      This non-randomized, single-center, open-label study evaluating the pharmacokinetic (PK),
      pharmacodynamic (PD), and safety profile of a single high-dose IV bolus injection of
      tirofiban (25 µg/kg). A single dose of tirofiban will be administered to the subjects with
      normal renal function (&gt;90 mL/min CrCl), moderate (30-59 mL/min CrCl), and severe (&lt;30 mL/min
      CrCl) renal impairment with non-dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency (NDDRI).

    <description>To evaluate the safety profile in normal, moderate and severe renal impaired adult subjects following a single high-dose bolus (3 min IV infusion) of tirofiban (25 µg/kg).
Safety will be assessed for the duration of the subject's participation in the study which will last 3 days. If a serious adverse event is experienced the subject will be followed until the event resolves or the clinical course is stabilized.
The most common adverse event associated with tirofiban is bleeding.</description>
