  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A new formulation of Berinert (CSL830) is being investigated for the management of hereditary
      angioedema (HAE). The main aim of the study is to assess the safety of a single 1500 IU dose
      of the new formulation of Berinert. This study will also look at the pharmacokinetics of
      CSL830 relative to Berinert currently on the market.
