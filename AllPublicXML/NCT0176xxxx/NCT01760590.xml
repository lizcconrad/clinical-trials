    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic
      spine grade 1-4 and grade 5 mobilization to the thoracic spine on cervical spine pain in
      individuals with nontraumatic cervical pain. The immediate effects of thoracic spine
      mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion increases in the cervical
      spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on follow-up visits. There is
      no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments.
      Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research
      should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007)

      The purpose of this research is to compare the effects of two commonly used, safe, thoracic
      spine grade 1-4 and grade 5 mobilization to the thoracic spine on cervical spine pain in
      individuals with nontraumatic cervical pain. The immediate effects of thoracic spine
      mobilization have been shown to facilitate greater range of motion increases in the cervical
      spine and greater pain decreases within a treatment session and on follow-up visits. There is
      no research utilizing pain threshold perception as an objective outcome of these treatments.
      Only one study compared the two treatment techniques and concluded that future research
      should be completed which includes manual therapy for the thoracic spine. (Cleland 2007)

      The subjects will be patients at clinics owned by Physiotherapy Associates, Fit Physical
      Therapy, and Allegheny and Chesapeake PT who seek physical therapy services for nontraumatic
      neck pain. Participation will be entirely voluntary.

      Patients will be offered a chance to participate in the research project on their initial
      visit for Physical Therapy.

      If the PT identifies an appropriate patient they will ask if they are interested in being a
      research subject. The Physical Therapist recruiting subjects all have completed their Doctor
      of Physical Therapy Degree and have advanced training in manual Physical Therapy. The
      techniques employed are considered standard practice and are defined as entry level skills by
      the Commission of Accredidation of Physical Therapy Programs. These techniques are typically
      taught in DPT degree programs.

      If the patient is interested, a description of the study will be provided. A consent form
      will be given to all participants.

      Research Procedures:

        1. Patients who present to one of three Physical Therapy clinics, under the direction of
           three advanced clinicians, will be assessed for their potential participation in this
           research. The treating clinician will recruit appropriate subjects based on includion
           and exclusion criteria and their PT diagnosis. Those that meet the inclusion and
           exclusion criteria will be given the consent form to determine if they wish to
           participate. Each researcher will have formal training in these techniques. Two of the
           clinicians have received their Orthopedic Clinical Specialists certification under the
           examination prcess outlined by the American Physical Therapy association. A third
           researcher has obtained his fellowship designation from the American Academy of
           Orthopedic Manual Physical Therapy. This skill is deemed entry level by the the
           Accredidation Board of the American Physical Therapy Educators. All Therapists will
           undergo a prestudy hands on education program to ensure the use of similar techniques.

        2. If after reading the consent form they agree to participate, they will be given one
           additional form, the Pain Catastrophizing scale, and asked to complete it. The scale,
           NDI, cervical ROM, age, and birthdate will be recorded on a sheet contained in the
           patient's clinical chart.

        3. The PT evaluation will then be completed.

        4. They will then be randomized into one of two groups based on a roll of a die:

           Group One: Mobilization Group: this group will receive grade 1,2,3,or 4 mobilization in
           prone based on the PT's clinical judgement.

           The treatment parameters will be recorded.

           Group Two: Grade 5 mobilization group: this group wil receive a grade 5 mobilization.

        5. Additional treatment including patient eduation, modalities, and exercise will be
           completed as the PT deems appropriate,

        6. The second visit will be scheduled within 24 to 48 hours.

        7. The patient will complete the same forms as were completed during the initial evaluation
           (NDI, PCS) and return them so that the results may berecorded on the record sheet
           identified only with date of birth.

        8. The treatment will be repeated including the manual technique and other treatment deemed
           appropriate by the PT. Additional treatment between the second and last visits will be
           under the sole discretion on the treating PT.

        9. On the discharge visit, the patient will receive the same forms, and be asked how much,
           in terms of %, they feel they have improved. This information will be recorded on the
           deidentified sheet.

      Home exercise programs and patient educaiton will be issued as appropriate.

      A bubble goniometer will be used for range of motion assessment. This is a standard plastic
      device used in PT practice. A Wagner FDX digital force gauge algometer will measure pain
      pressure thresholds.

      Where survey instruments are involved, a copy of the instrument and, for surveys not created
      for this project, assurance that the principal investigator has proper approval to use them.

      The Neck Disability Index or NDI will be used. It is the professional standard for outcomes
      measures for people with neck pain.

      It has been shown to be valid and reliable.

      The Pain Castrophizing Scale will be used. It is a valid and reliable measure of a patient's
      perception of pain and is commonly used.

      The data will be collected by the treating Physical Therapist who has access to the patient
      record for treatment purposes.

      The data will not be used for purposes other that patient care and research purposes.

      Patient's data measures will be collected on a de-identified sheet marked with the patients
      birthday. The will be kept in a locked area in the clinic. The lead investigator will have
      access to the data when the study is completed and transfer it to a locked file cabinet in
      his office for data assessment.

      Following treatment the patient may have mild soreness over the area which was treated. This
      typically diminishes in 24 hours. the patient will be informed of this potential soreness.
      The use of heat and /or ice, exercise, and patient education provided by the Therapist
      concerning activities and posture will also lessen the soreness.
