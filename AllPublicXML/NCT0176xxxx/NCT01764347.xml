      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound
      (TRUS) fusion image-guided prostate biopsy following radical prostatectomy in patients with
      prostate cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as MRI-TRUS fusion image-guided prostate biopsy
      may help find and diagnose prostate cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate accuracy of the new image-guided targeted needle biopsy using the ex-vivo
      human prostate as obtained from fresh radical prostatectomy specimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo robotic radical prostatectomy, followed by 3 MRI-TRUS fusion
      image-guided prostate biopsies.

    <description>A likelihood ratio test will be used to test for independence among lesions within a prostate (corresponding to a lack of systematic MRI-TRUS image distortion and implying that, overall, 1st biopsies to a lesion within one prostate are as likely to accurate as in another prostate).</description>
