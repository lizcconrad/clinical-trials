    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare treatment outcomes between measurement based
      Algorithm Guided Treatment and Treatment As Usual strategies in a Chinese population with
      major depressive disorder.

  <detailed_description>

      The AGT arm includes a 2-step medication monotherapy and a combination treatment algorithm.
      The first step (level 1) includes two medication monotherapy options: escitalopram and
      mirtazapine. For those participants who don't remit with the initial intervention after up to
      6 to 12-week treatment, the second step (level 2) with a variety of treatment options will be
      provided. In level 2 intervention, a switch strategy for those who don't remit with
      escitalopram will be switched to mirtazapine, or for those who don't remit with mirtazapine
      will be switched to escitalopram, combination strategy (i.e. escitalopram plus mirtazapine)
      and augmentation strategy (i.e. escitalopram or mirtazapine plus either rTMS or mECT).
      Participants who don't get remission in level 1 intervention will be encouraged to enter
      level 2 interventions based on intend-to-treatment principle. The TAU arm as control
      intervention is performed using the psychiatrist's individual discretion based on his/her
      expertise and knowledge.

      Participants will be recruited consecutively in 8 psychiatric settings across China and
      randomized into any of the two initial interventions of AGT or TAU arm. Follow-up interviews
      will be performed monthly for all participants who finish any acute treatment of AGT or TAU.
      The follow-up period will last up to 6 months.

    <description>Algorithm Guided Treatment (AGT) strategies include two steps. In the first step, participants will be randomly assigned to escitalopram (10-20mg/d) or mirtazapine (30-45mg/d) group. In the second step those non-remitted will be allocated into a set of different intervention groups including mirtazapine monotherapy (only for those taken escitalopram in the first step), escitalopram monotherapy (only for those taken mirtazapine in the first step), or combination therapies (i.e. escitalopram plus mirtazapine, escitalopram or mirtazapine plus either modified electroconvulsive therapy with 6-10 sessions or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with 20 sessions respectively) according to intent-to-treat principle. Medication dosage in combination therapy has the same range as the first.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Treatment As Usual (TAU)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This control arm refers to routine antidepressant treatment strategies for participants. Any of the new-generation antidepressants including fluoxetine, citalopram, escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, mirtazapine, bupropion, or trazodone, which are all available in Chinese psychiatric clinics, may be used for participants who are randomly assigned to this treatment arm based on clinician's expertise and clinical judgement. The dosage range of any of the above antidepressants depends on clinician's judgement. The follow-up period will last up to 6-12 weeks. During follow-ups, clinician can decide to continue current treatment or start a switch or combination strategy based on his/her own clinical judgement.</description>
