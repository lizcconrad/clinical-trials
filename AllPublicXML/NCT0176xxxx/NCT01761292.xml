    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part, phase 2 study to assess the effects of Givinostat on muscle histologic
      parameters and on clinical parameters in ambulant children with DMD. The safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of Givinostat will also be assessed. All children treated
      in part 2 continue in the extension phase, for a maximum of an additional 12 months.

      Approximately 20 children will be enrolled in the study as follows: the first 4 children will
      be treated at a low dose level of Givinostat.

      If none of the stopping criteria described in the study protocol are met after 2 weeks of
      treatment at the low dose, the review team will determine the escalated dose level (i.e.,
      intermediate dose level) to be used for the treatment of an additional 8 children who will be
      treated at the intermediate dose. The 4 children previously treated at the low dose level
      will also be switched to the intermediate dose level.

      If none of the stopping criteria are met after 2 weeks of treatment at the intermediate dose,
      the review team will determine the subsequent escalated dose level to be used for the
      treatment of an additional 8 children who will be treated at the high dose. All children
      treated at the intermediate dose level will be switched to the high dose level.

      Once all 20 children enrolled during the Part 1 of the study have been treated for at least 2
      weeks, the review team will determine the recommended dose (RD) to be used in Part 2 based on
      the safety and tolerability profile observed and on the pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses. All
      the children enrolled will switch to the RD level, which will be administered for the
      subsequent 12 months of the study (Part 2).

      The additional children (if any) will be enrolled during Part 2 of the study and will receive
      the RD of Givinostat for 12 months.

      The total duration of the study is 15 months and an additional 12 months for the extension
      phase.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male children aged 7 to &lt;11 years with an immunohistochemical and molecular diagnosis
             of DMD.

          2. A parent/guardian and child can comply with all study evaluations/procedures and
             return for all study activities.

          3. Able to complete the 2 screening 6MWTs with a minimal distance of at least 250 m each.
             In addition, the results of these tests must be within Â±30 m of each other.

          4. On a stable dose of systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months.

          5. At least 6 months worth of data on the 6MWT (this will be the &quot;historical&quot; 6MWT). From
             the moment of the historical 6MWT assessment(s), the child must not have received any
             compound that could potentially affect the 6MWT, with the exception of the stable
             steroid treatment.

          6. Parent/guardian has signed the informed consent form and child has assented to be in
             the study (if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy within 6 months prior to the start of
             study drug or change in systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., initiation, change in
             type of drug, dose modification not related to body weight change, schedule
             modification, interruption, discontinuation, or re initiation) within 6 months prior
             to the start of study drug.

          2. Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an
             effect on muscle strength since the time of the historical 6MWT and in any case within
             3 months prior to the start of study treatment (e.g., growth hormone). Vitamin D,
             calcium, and integrators will be allowed.

          3. Surgery that might have an effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months
             before study entry or planned surgery at any time during the study.

          4. Exposure to another investigational drug since the time of the historical 6MWT and in
             any case within 3 months prior to the start of study treatment.

          5. History of participation in gene therapy, cell-based therapy or oligonucleotide
             therapy.

          6. Presence of other clinically significant disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator places the child in unacceptable risk for an adverse outcome or that
             could affect study results.

          7. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or heart failure. If child has a left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt;45% at screening, the investigator should discuss inclusion of child in the
             study with the medical monitor.

          8. Inadequate hematological function

          9. Absolute neutrophil count: &lt;1.5 x 109/L

         10. Platelets: &lt;100 x 109/L

         11. Current or history of liver disease or impairment, including but not limited to an
             elevated total bilirubin.

         12. Inadequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine &gt;2 x the upper limit of
             normal.

         13. Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus at screening

         14. A baseline QTc &gt;450 msec, (as the mean of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes apart) or
             history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome).

         15. Psychiatric illness/social situations rendering the potential child unable to
             understand and comply with the study protocol.
