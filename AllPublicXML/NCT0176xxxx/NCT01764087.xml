      The primary objective of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      KX2-391 in Combination with paclitaxel in Phase I, and to evaluate the efficacy of KX2-391 in
      combination with paclitaxel in patients who are diagnosed as gastric and breast cancer,
      respectively in Phase II.

    <description>The phase I portion is a standard, three-patient per cohort, dose escalation schedule will be used. 3 or 6 subjects with solid tumor per dose group will likely be necessary to determine the MTD of KX2-391 in combination with weekly paclitaxel. With paclitaxel dose fixed at 80 mg/m2/weekly, KX2-391 treatment will be started at 20 mg dose once daily (QD)
The phase II portion of this trial has a design to determine the efficacy of KX2-391 when administered in combination with paclitaxel in 20 subjects with stomach cancer and 20 subjects with breast cancer</description>

    <description>A treatment cycle in phase I will consist of 28 days, according to the following schedule:
KX2-391 20 mg PO once daily, Weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour on day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle.
The trial will initially test the combination of weekly paclitaxel and KX2-391 given PO, once daily , continuously. In case of 2 dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) in the first cohort, this intervention will be terminated
A treatment cycle in phase II will consist of 28 days, according to the following schedule:
KX2-391 MTD PO once daily, Weekly paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 given intravenously over 1 hour on day 1, 8, and 15 of a 28 day cycle.</description>
