      Primary Objective:

      To study the effect of mild and moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of
      SAR302503.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the tolerability of SAR302503 given as a single dose up to 300 mg in subjects with
      mild and moderate and hepatic impairment and in matched subjects with normal hepatic
      function.
