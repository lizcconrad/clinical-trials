  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer who develop stroke are at high risk for future strokes or other clotting
      events. These patients are routinely treated with medicines that thin their blood, including
      enoxaparin or aspirin. However, it is unclear which medicine is best and whether these
      medicines can be adequately studied in a clinical trial.

      The purpose of this Phase I/II study is to determine if a clinical trial of different blood
      thinners in patients with cancer and stroke is possible. In addition, the study aims to
      compare the effects, good and/or bad, of enoxaparin with those of aspirin on patients with
      cancer and recent stroke.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Any adult patient with active systemic cancer diagnosed with acute ischemic stroke at the
        main MSKCC campus or at any of MSKCC's New York City outpatient center WCMC, NYPH/CUMC
        within the prior four weeks would be eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 to 85 years of age.

          -  Active cancer, defined as a pathologic diagnosis of or treatment for any cancer, other
             than basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, within the past six months; or
             patients with known recurrent or metastatic disease within the past six months.

          -  A pathology report issued at the enrolling site confirming the diagnosis of cancer is
             required for enrollment.

          -  Acute ischemic stroke within the prior four weeks, defined as a new neurologic
             deficit(s) with MRI evidence of acute ischemia in a referable location, and no
             clinical or radiologic indication of a non-cerebrovascular mimic, such as a brain
             metastasis, as the etiology of the deficit(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to get brain MRI

          -  Known malignant primary brain tumor.

          -  Diagnosis of intracranial hemorrhage within the past 3 months, including intratumoral
             hemorrhage into brain metastases from a systemic cancer.

          -  Active or serious bleeding within two weeks of enrollment.

             peptic ulcer disease.

             the study period.

          -  Clear indication for antiplatelet agents (e.g., cardiac stents); a patient receiving
             aspirin for primary prevention prior to index stroke may be enrolled as long as study
             investigators believe it would be safe for the patient to stop aspirin if the patient
             was randomized to the enoxaparin arm.

          -  Active bleeding diathesis.

          -  Platelet count of â‰¤ 70,000/mm3, an international normalized ratio (INR) &gt; 1.6, or a
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) &gt; 40 seconds.

          -  Known allergy to heparin or aspirin or a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl.

          -  AST or ALT &gt; 200 U/L.

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 8 gm/dl

          -  Symptomatic carotid stenosis.

          -  Active pregnancy.
