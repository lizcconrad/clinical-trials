      Data collection on the safety and efficacy of Zarzio® / Filgrastim HEXAL® in adult healthy
      unrelated stem cell donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, non-interventional long term data collection study. Adult healthy
      unrelated stem cell donors receiving Sandoz' filgrastim according to the stem cell
      mobilization protocols of the respective apheresis centers will be monitored for safety and
      efficacy during the mobilization period, and a systematic safety data follow-up will be
      implemented for up to 10 years after mobilization.
