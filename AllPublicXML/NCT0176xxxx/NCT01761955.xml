      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of regular low fat diary consumption on
      markers of cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic (cardiometabolic) health including body
      composition (% body fat, body weight), blood lipids, blood glucose, arterial compliance,
      blood pressure, insulin sensitivity and resting metabolic rate.

      This is a multi-centre, randomized, dietary intervention study of 12 months. A total of 100
      overweight/obese individuals will be recruited, half recruited in Adelaide, South Australia
      and the other half from Manitoba, Canada. At baseline, subjects assigned to HD will be given
      standard serves of low fat dairy products (eg. 250mL milk, 200g yoghurt) on a regular basis
      for 6 months and asked to incorporate 4 serves/day into their diet. Volunteers randomized to
      the LD will be asked to continue with their habitual diet and consume less than 2 serves of
      dairy on a regular basis for 6 months. All participants will be asked to complete a food
      frequency questionnaire, physical activity diary, 3-day food record, and keep a record of
      dairy serves (food log) consumed each day. In total, participants will be asked to come to
      the centre 5 times throughout the study. However, the HD group will be asked to return to the
      centre every two weeks to receive diary product and return dairy record (food log). At
      baseline subjects will be asked to attend the Richardson Centre for Functional Foods and
      Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) fasted for various measurements including: body weight, blood
      pressure, arterial compliance, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan for measurement
      of body fat, abdominal fat and bone mineral density, waist and hip circumferences and provide
      a blood sample for the measurement of blood lipids, insulin and glucose.
