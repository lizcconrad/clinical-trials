  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial designed to test the effectiveness of a psychological
      intervention based on group therapy for the caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients. The
      intervention consists of 14 sessions of a cognitive-behavioral psychological group therapy.
      This study aims to demonstrate that Alzheimer's patients' caregivers can benefit from group
      counseling, with an improvement in mood state, quality of life, perceived burden and a
      decrease in anxiety and depression. Two evaluations will be done: before the therapy sessions
      (basal) and when intervention is finished (final).

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to conduct group therapy with Alzheimer's caregivers at three
      centers in the province of Barcelona: Hospital El Carme Badalona, Sanitary Center of Les
      Corts and Sarrià.

      The therapy sessions are conducted by an expert in group therapy (from the sponsor Pasqual
      Maragall Foundation) and the social worker of each of the centers. The study takes place for
      four months and consists of weekly therapy sessions of an hour and a half each (14 sessions
      in total), based on cognitive and behavioral theory. The participants and the control group
      are evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study in terms of mood, quality of life,
      anxiety and depression.

      This study aims to demonstrate that Alzheimer's patient's caregivers can benefit from group
      counseling, resulting in an improvement in their emotional state, perceived burden, quality
      of life and a more positive attitude coping with the new situation.

    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline compared to the control and active arms using the Profile of Mood State (POMS) validated in structure and content for the Spanish language. This scale is a popular instrument for mood evaluation. It comprises 44 items (with a Likert response from 0 to 4), representing six conceptual dimensions: tension, depression,anger, vigour, fatigue and friendliness.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline compared to the control and active arms using the Martin and cols. scale to assess the overload level of the family caregivers of patients with probable or possible Alzheimer's disease or other advanced stage dementia.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Martin and cols. scale is an adaptation of the Zarit questionnaire to assess the overload level of the caregiver. It is a self administered questionnaire, with 22 items with each item scored from 1 ('none') to 5 (`nearly always').</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline compared to the control and active arms using the SF-36 v2 (Short Form-36 Health Survey), a questionnaire that measures the Quality of Life related to Health.</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 has 36 items that assesse eight health concepts: limitations in physical activities because of health problems; limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems); bodily pain; general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; vitality (energy and fatigue); and general health perceptions. This version of the instrument asks for participants to reply to questions according to how they have felt over the previous four weeks. The items use Likert-type scales, some with 3, 5 or 6 points.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline compared to the control and active arms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and 4 weeks post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS is a fourteen item scale with a Likert response from 0 to 3 that generates ordinal data. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.</description>
