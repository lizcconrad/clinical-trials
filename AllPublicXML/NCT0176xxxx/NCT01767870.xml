  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of fecal
      immunochemical test combined with sigmoidoscopy (FITS) for the detection of advanced
      colorectal neoplasia compared to colonoscopy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will evaluate the efficacy of FITS for the detection of advanced colorectal
      neoplasia compared to colonoscopy. This study was designed as multicenter randomized
      interventional study. The expected period are 36months. A total 13 tertiary hospitals will
      participate in the study.

      Subjects will be randomly allocated to FITS group and colonoscopy group. Subjects who undergo
      FITS will be performed by following colonoscopy to confirm the efficacy of FITS. In
      colonoscopy group, subjects as a control group would be performed colonoscopy.
