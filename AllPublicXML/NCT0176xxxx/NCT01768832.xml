  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by substantial disability and reduced quality of
      life, both of which can be attributed in large part to difficulties with walking. Evidence
      suggests that exercise may be an important addition to traditional treatments, particularly
      with respect to addressing walking problems. In particular, dance and treadmill training have
      been individually shown to improve walking performance and quality of life. At present it is
      not clear whether dance or treadmill training have similar effects or if one is superior to
      the other. Furthermore, our understanding of the means by which these exercise interventions
      convey benefits is extremely limited. This study aims to address these knowledge gaps by
      directly comparing dance, treadmill training and stretching (control group). The primary area
      of interest is the effects on gait, with secondary measures of disease severity, balance, and
      quality of life. The investigators will determine not only the effects of the interventions
      on walking performance, but will also investigate the effects of the interventions on
      connections between different parts of the brain and on brain function during imagined
      walking tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will be
      randomly assigned to dance, treadmill training, or a stretching/flexibility control group.
      Participants will be assessed over a period of 6 months at 3 different time points. The
      investigators hypothesize that both dance and treadmill training will lead to improvements in
      forward walking, but that dance will result in greater improvements in backward walking
      compared to treadmill training. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the tango and
      treadmill interventions will have different effects of brain function and brain connections.
      The investigators expect dance to enhance the activity and connections of particular brain
      regions and treadmill training to enhance activity and connections of different brain
      regions. The investigators do not expect changes in brain activity or connections in the
      control group.
