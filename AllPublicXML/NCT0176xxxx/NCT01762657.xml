      The purpose of this study is to determine if oral Cyclosporine A and oral Lansoprazole are
      effective in rendering patients with existing type 1 diabetes, insulin independent. This
      two-arm study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence by
      utilizing the FDA-approved oral immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, and the FDA-approved
      proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. Lansoprazole and other proton-pump inhibitors increase
      gastrin levels. Gastrin was initially shown to have the potential to increase new beta cell
      formation in 1955 (Zollinger RM and Ellison EH. Ann Surg. 1955;142(4):709-23).

      Studies with the immune tolerance agent, Cyclosporine A, previously demonstrated that among
      recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes patients, insulin independence was achieved in as many as
      67.5% of patients within 7 weeks of therapy (Bougneres PF et al. N Engl J Med.
      1988:17;318(11):663-70). Cyclosporine A protected the remaining beta cells from further
      autoimmune attack, but over time, there was limited beta cell regeneration, and insulin was
      ultimately required by all patients. Therefore, this study proposes the usage of Cyclosporine
      A with a beta regeneration agent.

      Follow-up studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing Cyclosporine A for
      20 months, did not demonstrate renal or other side effects (Assan R. et al. Diabetes Metab
      Res Rev. 2002;18(6):464-72). Human clinical trials with gastrin and epidermal growth factor
      demonstrated reductions in daily insulin requirements by much as 75% within 3 months
      following four weeks of therapy among existing type 1 diabetes patients (Transition
      Therapeutics, March 5, 2007 http://www.transitiontherapeutics.com/media/archive.php Accessed
      January 1, 2013). Lack of the ability to sustain these results was likely due to the ongoing
      autoimmune attack on the new beta cells generated by therapy. Gastrin alone has been shown to
      induce beta cell neogenesis from human pancreatic ductal tissue without epidermal growth
      factor in in vitro studies (Suarez-Pinzon WL et al. JCEM. 2005;90(6):3401-3409).

      Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. Despite evidence that many different immune
      tolerance agents have successfully reversed diabetes in rodent type 1 models, none have been
      successful in sustaining insulin independence in man (Ablamunits V et al. Ann NY Acad Sci.
      2007;1103:19-32). The distinctions and complexities of islets in man are far different than
      that of rodents (Levetan CS and Pierce SM. Endocr Pract. 2012 Nov 27:1-36 Epub ahead of
      print). We hypothesize that in man, both an immune tolerance agent and a beta regeneration
      agent are required to sustain insulin independence.

      Based upon proton-pump inhibitors having been shown to increase plasma gastrin levels up to
      10-fold, this clinical trial utilizes the oral proton-pump inhibitor, Lansoprazole. This
      study will determine the safety and efficacy of Cyclosporine A used with and without
      Lansoprazole to determine the impact on insulin independence among patients with existing
      type 1 diabetes.

      Cyclosporine A is utilized to protect the new beta cells formed by Lansoprazole. The
      combination of the two therapies may render reductions in insulin requirements and have a
      greater impact on sustained insulin independence than previously reported with Cyclosporine A
      or gastrin alone among type 1 patients.A

      This 52-week study consists of two treatment arms designed to assess the safety and efficacy
      of achieving insulin independence using:

        -  Oral Lansoprazole/Oral Cyclosporine A

        -  Oral Placebo/Oral Placebo

      It is hypothesized that the combination of oral Cyclosporine A and oral Lansoprazole will
      safely render significantly more patients with existing type 1 diabetes, insulin independent
      and may serve as a novel and innovative treatment approach for patients with type 1 diabetes
      utilizing two FDA-approved therapies.
