    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy as one of the basic modalities of oncology treatment often leaves permanent
      implications and among the most common is infertility as a result of irreversible gonadal
      damage. This project sets the primary target to verify the protective effect GnRH analogues
      administration to protect ovarian tissue during three different regimens of chemotherapy in
      patients with Hodgkin disease (HD) in reproductive age.

    <textblock>
      During the first two years of the project duration the curative anti-tumorous combined
      treatment in fertile patients with Hodgkin disease diagnosis will be carried out. Patients
      are to be divided into three groups according to the clinical stage of the disease and
      treated with the three types of the chemotherapeutic regimens comparable with toxicity.
      Patients will receive GnRH analogues during the chemotherapy for the gonadal protection by
      the mechanism of foliculogenesis inhibition in pre-pubertal stage. At the end of successful
      treatment according to stated criteria the ovarian function of every patient will be
      repeatedly evaluated in relation with toxicity of chemotherapy used. These ovarian function
      results will be compared with control group of patients without gonadal protection, which
      reproductive functions will be evaluated according the same method.
