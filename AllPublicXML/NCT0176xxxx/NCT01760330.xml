    <textblock>
      This project is being used to assess the utility of intravenous acetaminophen in the
      pediatric population undergoing palate repairs. This study is a prospective randomized double
      blinded placebo controlled study. The investigators will have two arms, one group of patients
      will receive intravenous acetaminophen and one group that will receive a placebo at a total
      of four doses over 24 hours. The results of this study may affect the intraoperative
      anesthetic management as well as post-operative surgical management of this specific patient
      population. The goal is to determine the benefit of adding a non-opioid analgesic and
      hypothesizing that it may reduce the amount of narcotic consumption in the post anesthesia
      care unit as well as during the post-operative stay.
