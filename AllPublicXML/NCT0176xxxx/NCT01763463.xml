    <textblock>
      Pneumonia remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults with
      obstructive lung disease. Risk factors for pneumonia, including episodes associated with a
      hospital admission, have been extensively characterized in clinical trials and observational
      studies of patients with COPD, and include older age, lower predicted FEV1 (&lt;50%), prior COPD
      exacerbations, dyspnea , normal to low body mass index (&lt;25), current smoking and certain
      co-morbid conditions (e.g. dementia). The use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) has also been
      identified, as associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD.

      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the magnitude of known risk factors and
      the outcomes of pneumonia requiring hospitalization and the potential effect modification of
      these risk factors by ICS use. The primary endpoints will be severe pneumonia, defined as
      community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) resulting in hospitalization and/or death and
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) diagnosed after two days in the hospital. As a secondary
      endpoint, CAP that did not result in hospitalization or death will be examined. As a
      secondary objective, we will describe characteristics for those patients who develop
      pneumonia requiring hospitalization compared to those with pneumonia not requiring admission.

      This study will use the General Practice Online Database (GOLD), formerly referred to as the
      General Practice research Database (GPRD), a primary care electronic medical record database.

      A new user cohort will be defined among patients with COPD who are 45 years and older in the
      United Kingdom. Patients will be considered a new user of ICS-containing medications if they
      had not received a prescription for an ICS-containing medication in the prior year. The
      comparator treatment group will be new users of long-acting bronchodilators (LABD), including
      long-acting beta-agonists (LABA) or long-acting antimuscarinics (LAMA). In the one year
      washout period, all new users could not have either ICS-containing medications or LABD.

      Prior to conducting the analysis, feasibility analyses will be conducted to evaluate of the
      number of pneumonia events and the number of new users separately to examine the available
      precision based on the study design.

      Patients will be followed from the date of their first eligible prescription (Cohort Entry
      Date) until the earliest of the following: date of study end point (first pneumonia event of
      interest), date of treatment end (up to 60-day gap allowed for each inhaler), date of
      transfer to a new practice, date of ICS initiation (among LABD new users), death or study end
      (end of available data). As part of the primary analysis, patients will be examined for their
      first severe pneumonia (severe CAP, HAP). As a secondary analysis, time to non-severe CAP
      will be examined. Incidence rates of the pneumonia outcomes will be calculated as the number
      of patients experiencing an event divided by the person-years at risk.

      Multivariable analysis will be performed using Cox proportional hazard model with adjustment
      for confounders and medication exposure. To adjust for differences confounding by severity
      due to differences in prescribing between ICS-containing medications and LABD, propensity
      scores (PS) will be utilized using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). The
      propensity score will be estimated to model the probability of a patient receiving
      ICS-containing medication prescription versus receiving a LABD prescription given a patient's
      observed set of baseline covariates.

      Effect modification (statistical interaction) will be evaluated based on available theory and
      include ICS medication use by known risk factors for pneumonia (BMI&lt;21, BMI 21-24.9, BMI ≥25,
      age, GOLD stage III/IV, MRC dyspnea score ≥4, history of pneumonia diagnosis, current smoking
      status, social deprivation quartiles). Additional interactions may be evaluated.

      To test proportionality of the hazard functions, model diagnostics will be performed.

      To compare severe pneumonia with non-severe pneumonia in patients with COPD, characteristics
      of patients experiencing non-severe CAP vs. severe CAP or HAP will be tabulated. To assess
      differences between treatments, clinical and patient characteristics will be compared using
      the chi-square tests or Wilcoxon tests for categorical or continuous data, respectively.
      Severe CAP and HAP may be combined. Modeling of clinical and patient characteristics may be
      considered using logistic regression using CAP vs. severe CAP and then with severe CAP vs.
      HAP.

      Additional analysis or adjustments to the analytic or modeling strategy will be performed if
      the data warrants. A more detailed modeling strategy, including generation of the propensity
      scores and Cox modeling, will be created in a separate analysis plan. Adjustments to the a
      priori plan will be described in the final study report.

      Advantages of the primary care database include the ability to link to secondary care,
      Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), and to examine risk factors for pneumonia included in the
      UK Quality Outcomes Framework for COPD that are not collected routinely in most other
      observational healthcare data sources (e.g., BMI, lung function, smoking history, MRC dyspnea
      score). Another advantage of this study is the new-user design, as it minimizes biases that
      can be caused by alternative designs which compare events between prevalent user groups
      (e.g., survivor bias, covariates altered by prior exposure).

      There are also known limitations of observational database analyses where treatments are not
      randomized, including the potential for confounding by severity that may not be fully
      accounted for in the analysis. ICS-containing medications may be dispensed to patients who
      have more severe COPD than patients who are receiving long-acting bronchodilators alone. In
      this study, we will adjust for disease severity and patient characteristics in the period
      prior to initiation using propensity scores. Medication use in CPRD-GOLD is based on
      prescribed medications recorded by the primary care physician, which might not have been
      dispensed at the pharmacy or ultimately utilized by the patient. Finally, diagnostic
      practices for pneumonia may be different in the UK compared with other countries limiting the
      generalizability.

      As with any outcome of interest, identifying pneumonia in databases is imperfect and there
      may be confusion between diagnoses of pneumonia and influenza or serious exacerbation. To our
      knowledge, the relationship between pneumonia recorded in these primary and secondary care
      databases have not been investigated. In addition, there is lack of agreement between
      pneumonia classification in the absence of chest x-rays, sputum, etc.

      Despite the limitations, this study will provide insights into risk factors for serious
      pneumonia, including whether ICS modify the effect of established risk factors for serious
      pneumonia. The results may identify specific patient groups that are at greatest risk of
      serious pneumonia and may identify where risk minimization and/or medical recommendations may
      be appropriate.

        Patients with COPD who are new users of ICS-containing medications or new user of LABD will
        be included in the study if they are at least 45 years of age and have met the
        inclusion/exclusion. Patients will have at least one prescription for ICS-containing
        medications or LABD from January 2005 (the earliest use) until December, 2010 preceded by a
        year of no use of these medicines . The one-year period of no use is referred to a washout
        period rather than requiring no use of these medications ever in the patient's history.
        Patients would be required to have at least one year in their history prior to new user
        cohort entry to establish baseline disease severity and co-morbidities that would be
        adjusted for in the modeling.
