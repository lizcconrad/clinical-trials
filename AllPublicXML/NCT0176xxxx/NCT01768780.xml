  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various methods are used to assess the level of anesthesia block after spinal anesthesia.
      Among them, ice cubes, alcohol swabs, and needles are commonly used in the clinical setting,
      but ice is limited by difficulties with management and transportation, and needle assessment
      has problems owing to the risk of pain, infection, and injury to the patient.

      Hence, the alcohol swab is commonly used in practice. However, the absence of pain is more
      important in the surgical process, and assessing the pain block level is more feasible in
      practice than assessing the sensory nerve block level using the alcohol swab.

      Therefore, it seems to be better to use the peripheral nerve stimulator for the accurate
      assessment of the pain block level. This has the advantage of continuous measurement of the
      block level, which can be used in a practical manner in conjunction with the surgical
      incision.

      Hence, the author compared the conventional method using the alcohol swab with the use of the
      peripheral nerve stimulator to determine which method is more practical in the measurement of
      spinal anesthesia block level.

    <description>The study subjects were patients with planned orthopedic surgery on the infrapatellar area with spinal anesthesia, and 58 patients were recruited sequentially.
A blood pressure machine, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximeter were connected to the patient in the operating room, and measurements were carried out every 5 minutes. Prior to the induction of anesthesia, the anticholinergic glycopyrrolate 0.1 ㎎ was intravenously administered after the confirmation of intravenous line opening status.
For spinal anesthesia, the patient was arranged in the lateral recumbent position, and then the L 3-4 area was disinfected. Depending on the surgical region, height, and weight of each patient, 10-15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine was administered through a 25 G needle.</description>
