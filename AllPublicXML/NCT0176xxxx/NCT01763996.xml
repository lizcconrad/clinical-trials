      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of febuxostat on coronary artery flow in
      patients with coronary artery disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called febuxostat. Febuxostat is being tested to treat
      people who have angina. This study will look at the heart and blood flow of people who take
      febuxostat.

      The study will enroll approximately 30 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups (or sequences)—which will
      remain undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an
      urgent medical need):

        -  Sequence 1: 6 weeks febuxostat followed by 6 weeks of placebo.

        -  Sequence 2: 6 week placebo followed by 6 weeks of febuxostat

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have angina symptoms during the
      study.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 16 weeks. Participants will make 7 visits to the clinic
      including a final visit 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
