  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the efficacy and feasibility of a mifepristone
      combined with misoprostol medical abortion regimen in terminating pregnancies 13-22 weeks in
      Armenia.

      Women who were deemed eligible for the study by the provider gave informed consent. They took
      200 mg of mifepristone orally at the study clinic. In 24-44 hours, they returned to the
      clinic for induction with misoprostol. They were admitted as inpatients at the clinic and
      took 400 mcg of buccal misoprostol every 3 hours until the fetus and placenta were expelled.
      If there was no full expulsion after 10 doses of misoprostol, the provider used their
      discretion to determine the appropriate clinical course of action. After responding to
      questions about their experience with the procedure, women were discharged from the study.
