    <textblock>
      Older adults caring for others often neglect their own health. This research is being done to
      see if helping caregivers focus on their own needs can improve their health and ability to
      care for others

      The specific aims are to evaluate the Care4U intervention in order to refine the intervention
      for a larger clinical trial, which includes 1) subject acceptability of the intervention, 2)
      evaluation of intervention delivery, fidelity, and data collection, and 3) evaluation of the
      components of the intervention (patient activation, knowledge, self-efficacy, and CV
      self-management strategies).

      Recruitment was conducted in 2 acute care hospitals from April 2013 through Dec 2013. Six
      caregivers were enrolled during this time, with one dropping out after baseline.

      The participants completing the study (n=5) provided data related to the aim. Four
      participants were able to use Adobe Connect via the provided laptops with written
      instructions and phone coaching. Delivery of the intervention via Adobe connect was enjoyed
      by the participants, with minimal connectivity problems. Participants were interested in
      websites and videos related to their health, but did not relate exploring these links on the
      laptop desktop without suggestion from the PI.
