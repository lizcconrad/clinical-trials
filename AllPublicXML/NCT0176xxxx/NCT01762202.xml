      Assessment of safety and efficacy of with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) combined with
      ofatumumab (FCO2) in previously untreated &quot;young&quot; patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
      (CLL).

    <textblock>
      Given that:

        -  rituximab, fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FCR) front-line treatment was associated
           with a high OR rate, superior PFS and OS as compared to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide
           regimen;

        -  a direct relationship between the dose of rituximab and the response rate has been
           reported;

        -  ofatumumab, as single agent, proved activity in CLL patients with refractory disease;

        -  ofatumumab, fludarabine and cylophosphamide (O-FC) front-line treatment has been
           associated with a high complete response (CR) rate;

        -  the expected grade 3-4 granulocytopenia could led to reduce the dose intensity of study
           drugs (FC) and increase the infection rate; a schedule combining FC with an increased
           dose of ofatumumab associated to primary phrophylaxis of granulocytopenia could be
           associated with an improvement in the CR rate. The purpose of this study is to determine
           whether we could improve the CR rate of the golden standard treatment for fit patients
           with CLL , the FCR regimen, with a chemoimmunotherapy including FC combined with an
           increased dose of the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab, given every other week (FCO2)
           associated with a primary prophylaxis of granulocytopenia.
