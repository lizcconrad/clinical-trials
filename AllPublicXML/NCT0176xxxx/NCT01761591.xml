      The purpose of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the clinical benefit
      and impact on resource utilization of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) with the
      Svelte Acrobat Stent System compared to any other CE marked bare metal stent (BMS)
      implantable via direct stenting or after lesion pre-dilation, in patients with coronary
      lesions that are eligible for direct stenting and who are recruited and treated so as to
      reflect real-life routine practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to test the following hypotheses:

        1. The evaluated stent is clinically non-inferior to control BMS in terms of freedom of
           MACE

        2. The evaluated stent is clinically beneficial compared to control BMS by reducing
           exposure to radiations, amount of contrast medium administered, procedure time, as well
           as amount of administered heparin,

        3. The evaluated stent does not result in more frequent adverse events than control BMS,

        4. The evaluated stent improves direct stenting success while not decreasing procedural
           success compared to control BMS.

        5. Resource utilization (R.U.):

             1. Hospital-perspective resource utilization during the index admission and index
                procedure is not greater with evaluated the stent and potentially lower than with
                control BMS

             2. Resource utilization over a 6-month time-horizon, in relation to routine follow-up
                and MACE, is not greater with the evaluated stent than with control BMS.
