    <textblock>
      Retrospective review of the medical files of 115 patients with neuroendocrine tumours who
      were treated with Lutetium-177 DOTA-TATE under Health Canada's Special Access Programme (SAP)
      at the Cross Cancer Institute between January 2010 and April 30, 2014. Efficacy, safety, and
      other relevant data will be collected to support a separate clinical trial application.
