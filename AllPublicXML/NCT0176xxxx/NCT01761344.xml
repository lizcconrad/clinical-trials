  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aldosterone is a hormone produced in the adrenals that helps regulate the salt balance and
      blood pressure. Primary hyperaldosteronism is one of the main endocrine causes of secondary
      hypertension. The overproduction of aldosteron might in some cases be due to unilateral
      hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex or a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma. In these
      cases the adrenal can be removed and the patient cured of hypertension. The clinical
      evaluation of patients with confirmed primary hyperaldosteronism therefore includes selective
      sampling of blood from the adrenal veins to determine lateralization of overproduction. This
      is executed as an interventional radiological procedure.

      The adrenal vein sampling is challenging, and success is determined by measuring another
      adrenal hormone named cortisol in the blood samples as a marker of a correctly drawn sample.
      By routine laboratory assays the procedure is evaluated after the patient has been discharged
      from the hospital. In the study a rapid assay of cortisol will be evaluated, allowing the
      radiologist to draw new samples during the same procedure if the first set of samples is
      unsuccessful. The study hypothesis is that intraoperative measurement of cortisol is a useful
      tool to evaluate successful sampling, and that fewer patients will need a repeated procedure.
