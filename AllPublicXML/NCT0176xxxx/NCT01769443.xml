  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of desensitization therapy, which includes
      VELCADE® (bortezomib) and plasmapheresis, on select sensitized patients awaiting heart
      transplantation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bortezomib works by decreasing plasma cells in the blood. Plasma cells produce antibodies.
      Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes antibodies from the blood. Plasma cells and
      antibodies produced by plasma cells can be involved in organ rejection after transplantation.

      This trial will evaluate if decreasing plasma cells and antibodies with bortezomib and
      plasmapheresis can reduce complications while participants are waiting for their heart
      transplant. The evaluation of efficacy is defined by a lower complication rate while on the
      heart transplant waitlist.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>The study planned to enroll 80 participants; however, the decision to terminate the study was made due to the very slow rate of participant accrual and the inability to meet the recruitment goal within the funding period. Only 2 participants were enrolled at one site before study recruitment status changed to &quot;Active, not recruiting.&quot;</recruitment_details>

          <description>Plasmapheresis with concomitant bortezomib.
Plasmapheresis will be given for 3 consecutive days (treatment days 0, 1 and 2) within 2 weeks of Status I listing for heart transplantation. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that involves the extracorporeal separation of plasma from cellular blood components by centrifugation or membrane filtration, which removes the alloantibody. The plasma depleted blood is reconstituted with exogenous fresh-frozen plasma or albumin solution which is then infused back into the patient.
Four doses of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) were administered intravenously on treatment days 0, 3, 7 and 10. The first dose was given between 4-8 hours after the first plasmapheresis session was completed and there was at least 96 hours between the second and third dose of bortezomib</description>

            <description>Plasmapheresis with concomitant bortezomib.
Plasmapheresis will be given for 3 consecutive days (treatment days 0, 1 and 2) within 2 weeks of Status I listing for heart transplantation. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that involves the extracorporeal separation of plasma from cellular blood components by centrifugation or membrane filtration, which removes the alloantibody. The plasma depleted blood is reconstituted with exogenous fresh-frozen plasma or albumin solution which is then infused back into the patient.
Four doses of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) were administered intravenously on treatment days 0, 3, 7 and 10. The first dose was given between 4-8 hours after the first plasmapheresis session was completed and there was at least 96 hours between the second and third dose of bortezomib</description>

            <description>Plasmapheresis with concomitant bortezomib.
Plasmapheresis will be given for 3 consecutive days (treatment days 0, 1 and 2) within 2 weeks of Status I listing for heart transplantation. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that involves the extracorporeal separation of plasma from cellular blood components by centrifugation or membrane filtration, which removes the alloantibody. The plasma depleted blood is reconstituted with exogenous fresh-frozen plasma or albumin solution which is then infused back into the patient.
Four doses of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) were administered intravenously on treatment days 0, 3, 7 and 10. The first dose was given between 4-8 hours after the first plasmapheresis session was completed and there was at least 96 hours between the second and third dose of bortezomib</description>

Plasmapheresis is a procedure that involves the extracorporeal separation of plasma from cellular blood components by centrifugation or membrane filtration, which removes the alloantibody. The plasma depleted blood is reconstituted with exogenous fresh-frozen plasma or albumin solution which is then infused back into the patient.
Four doses of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m^2) were administered intravenously on treatment days 0, 3, 7 and 10. The first dose was given between 4-8 hours after the first plasmapheresis session was completed and there was at least 96 hours between the second and third dose of bortezomib</description>
