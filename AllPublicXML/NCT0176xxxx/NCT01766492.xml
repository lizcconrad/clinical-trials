  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quality of life data following SBRT for prostate cancer has been obtained in only a small
      numbers of patients. A prospective study using validated quality of life questionnaires is
      needed to determine outcomes after treatment with SBRT. Our study will be the first essential
      step in developing a better evidence base on the comparative risks and benefits of SBRT
      treatment with regards to quality of life assessment and outcomes.

      Study Design (for example, hypothesis, research question, standard and experimental
      procedures, special or unusual equipment or procedures):

      The main goal of this study is to evaluate quality of life outcomes and changes in patient
      reported symptoms (e.g. urinary, bowel and sexual function) in patients receiving SBRT
      treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Validated quality of life questionnaires
      will be administered in a deidentified, prospective fashion. Eligible subjects will be
      patients undergoing SBRT treatment for prostate cancer.

      Hypothesis: Patients undergoing SBRT will have similar cancer control and symptoms as men who
      are treated with other radiation therapy modalities.

      Primary objective: To evaluate quality of life outcomes (e.g. fatigue, urinary, bowel and
      sexual function) for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer treated with SBRT.

      Secondary objectives: Prospective data on cancer control and toxicity following SBRT for
      clinically localized prostate cancer.
