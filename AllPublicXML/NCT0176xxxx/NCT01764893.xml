  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The null hypothesis for this study is that the combination of solifenacin and Percutaneous
      Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) is not different from PTNS alone. However the investigators
      anticipate a 20% improvement in patients receiving combination therapy as measured by the
      OAB-q (Overactive Bladder questionnaire) scores.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Enrolling too slowly due to insurance plans no longer covering the cost of the Percutaneous
    Tibial Nerve Stimulation treatment.
