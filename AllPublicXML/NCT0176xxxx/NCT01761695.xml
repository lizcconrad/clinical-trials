  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators would like to propose a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study
      for patients who will be diagnosed and/or treated for chronic myeloid leukemia at Asan
      Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, to use the acquired data for fundamentals of other
      retrospective analysis.

      1. Acquisition of informed concent form

        2. Data acquisition from medical record including

             -  demographic / disease-associated factors

             -  details of treatment, and its results

             -  complications during treatment

             -  genetic data

             -  survival outcome (upto 30 years)

        3. Accumulation of data for 30 years

        4. Use of data for other retrospective analysis (including Asan Medical center Cell Banking
           basic data)

      Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood (for its mononuclear cells) will be collected,
      processed, and cryopreserved for future analysis of DNA or cell culture. Acquisition of
      biospecimens will be proceeded if patient agree with the informed consent for donation of
      biospecimen to 'Asan Medical Center Biomaterial Resource Banking Center'. This registry data
      will be used as a basic demographic and clinical information for the biospecimens.
