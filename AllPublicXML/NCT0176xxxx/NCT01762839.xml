    <textblock>
      This study will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel
      design study with an open label positive-control moxifloxacin arm to evaluate the effect of
      supratherapeutic dose of oritavancin on the QT and QTc intervals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Able to give written informed consent before initiation of any study related
             procedures and willing to comply with all required study procedures.

          2. Healthy, male and female between 18 and 60 years old, BMI between 18 kg/m2 and 30
             kg/m2

          3. In good health based upon results of medical history, physical examination, no
             clinically significant 12-lead ECG results, and laboratory test results.

          4. Serum magnesium and potassium levels within the normal range at screening.

          5. Agree to abstain from alcohol, caffeine-, and xanthine-containing products, all kind
             of energy drinks and the consumption of grapefruit juice and orange juice from 48

             vancomycin, televancin, daptomycin, or teicoplanin) or any of their excipients. Note:
             patients who have had histamine-like infusion reactions to a glycopeptide are not
             excluded

          2. A resting pulse rate &lt; 50 beats per minute (bpm) or &gt; 100 bpm

          3. Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg

          4. A QTcF &gt;450 msec (males) or &gt; 470 msec (females)

          5. Respiratory difficulties, or a history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease

             implantable or injectable birth control; and estrogen, testosterone, and/or
             progesterone replacement in menopausal women)

          7. Unwilling to abstain from smoking for the duration of the study.

          8. Any clinically-significant, underlying abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or
             morphology of the resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc
             interval changes

          9. Positive result for the urine or serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) test
             administered at screening (females with child bearing potential)

         10. A past medical history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities or a family history
             (grandparents, parents, or siblings) of either a long or a short QT syndrome

         11. Personal history of unexplained syncope.

         12. Women who are pregnant or nursing, or who are of childbearing potential and unwilling
             to use at least 2 acceptable methods of birth control (eg, prescription oral
             contraceptives, contraceptive injections, contraceptive patch, intrauterine device,
             barrier method(s) or male partner sterilization). Women â‰¥2 years postmenopausal or
             surgically sterile are exempt from this exclusion

         13. A history of hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or any member of the quinolone class of
             antimicrobial agents

         14. Positive virology screen for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C
             virus (HBV or HCV, respectively)

         15. Participated in other clinical research studies involving the evaluation of other
             investigational drugs or devices within 30 days of enrollment

         16. Any condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would put the subject at
             increased risk from participating in the study.
