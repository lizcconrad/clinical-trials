      This study will test whether a tailored, online educational intervention increases HPV
      vaccine uptake and intent among female college students.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MeFirst is the first web-based, online, educational tool designed to promote Human
      Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine awareness and understanding in an effort to improve HPV vaccine
      intent and uptake among female university students. HPV is the most common sexually
      transmitted infection and causes genital warts and cancer. The HPV vaccine has been
      recommended for girls ages 11-26 since 2006, yet vaccination rates remain low. Tailored
      online interventions may be more effective tools to promote behavior change among college
      students than traditional static interventions. The proposed study is a randomized controlled
      trial testing the efficacy of the MeFirst tool vs. standard static educational material on
      increasing HPV vaccination intent and uptake among female university students aged 18-26.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effect of the MeFirst tool, a tailored, online HPV vaccination decision-making guide, on HPV vaccination intention and/or uptake.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post intervention, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Intention will be assessed on a five-point scale immediately after and at 3 and 12 months. Uptake will be assessed by yes/no/don't know response to the statement, &quot;I have received at least 1 dose of the HPV vaccine&quot; at 3 and 12 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the effect of the MeFirst tool on HPV-related knowledge.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post intervention, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing 5 or 10-point scales measuring participants' HPV-related knowledge (HPV, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer) immediately post-intervention and at 3 months and 12 months.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Determine acceptability of the MeFirst tool to participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately post intervention, 3 months and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants answer five 5-point scale questions about the acceptability of the MeFirst tool immediately post intervention, and at 3 months and 12 months.</description>
