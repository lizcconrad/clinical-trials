  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are conducting research about oxygen levels in the body and whether it is
      possible to use a device to measure oxygen in the body's tissues noninvasively, without blood
      draws or a catheter (a plastic tube placed in a vein). Investigators would like to know how
      this device compares to standard measurements using blood from a catheter. This may help
      treat patients who may not be getting enough oxygen to their body.

      Investigators will enroll patients in the pediatric intensive care unit who have an
      indwelling catheter that allows measurement of central venous oxygen saturation. Measurements
      of central venous oxygen saturation using blood oximetry will be compared with measures of
      tissue oxygenation at the buccal mucosa using a Raman spectroscopy tissue oximeter.
      Investigators will also measure the status of the sublingual microcirculation utilizing
      sidestream dark field microscopy. Basic demographic and clinical variables such as ongoing
      vasoactive infusions, mechanical ventilation, and laboratory data will also be collected.

    <measure>tissue oxygenation level as measured by raman spectroscopy device</measure>
    <time_frame>The measures will occur twice within the first 24 hours of admission to the pediatric ICU and then whenever a central venous oxygen saturation is measured by the clinical care team until the patient is discharged from the pediatric ICU.</time_frame>

    <measure>Microcirculation as recorded by sublingual video microcirculation recorder.</measure>
    <time_frame>Twice in the first 24 hours after PICU admission</time_frame>
    <description>Two video clips will be recorded of the sublingual microcirculation in each patient within the first 24 hours of admission to the PICU.</description>

    <measure>Vital signs as recorded by Bioinformatically enabled armband monitor (BEAM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Continuous from PICU admission through 24 hours of admission</time_frame>
    <description>Bioinformatically enabled armband monitor (BEAM) will be placed on the patient's upper extremity for the first 24 hours of their admission and will be subsequently removed. The data will be stored in the device and investigators and clinicians caring for subjects will be blinded to the device output as data is collected. The device continually captures physiologic data such as heart rate, ECG results, and temperature.</description>
