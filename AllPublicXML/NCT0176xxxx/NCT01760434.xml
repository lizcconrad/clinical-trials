      scoliosis.

      The investigators hypothesize that sagittal alignment and thoracic volumes will predict
      successful treatment outcomes as measured by improved pulmonary function and health-related
      quality of life in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients at a minimum 20-year follow-up.
      Significant focus has been placed on the coronal plane in order to determine treatment
      indications for scoliosis, but with new understanding about the important of sagittal balance
      and pulmonary function, the treatment indications should be broadened. Thus, the
      investigators propose the following study to explore parameters associated with a durable and
      acceptable outcome following scoliosis treatment, minimizing the need for further surgery and
      to optimizing quality of life and pulmonary health. Beyond the standard radiographs and
      Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) scores, this study undertakes a comprehensive assessment of
      health-related quality of life, chest asymmetry and body satisfaction scoring, sagittal plane
      parameters, and 3D modeling of the childhood and current spinothoracic deformity. Thus, the
      investigators research team is uniquely poised to determine broader treatment indications for
      scoliosis. The overarching goal of this research effort is to determine new parameters based
      on thoracic volume and sagittal plane alignment in addition to coronal deformity in order to
      determine the appropriate treatment threshold for surgical intervention in children with
      adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
