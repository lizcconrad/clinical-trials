      To demonstrate that patients treated with cangrelor can be directly switched to oral
      ticagrelor and that patients treated with ticagrelor can be switched to cangrelor without a
      significant decrease in the extent of inhibition of platelet aggregation.

    <measure>Extent of Preservation of Inhibitory Effect Compared With Effect Observed With Cangrelor Alone (at Timepoint 1, Either at 0.5 Hours or 1.25 Hours) or Ticagrelor Alone (Measured 5.25 Hours After Initiation of Cangrelor on Day 1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 measures taken at 2 timepoints after cangrelor infusion start: 0.5 or 1.5 hrs (Timepoint 1) and 5.25 hrs (TImepoint 2)</time_frame>
    <description>A reference point was chosen for comparison and designated the first draw during the cangrelor infusion (0.5 hours or 1.25 hours) as the reference for the effect of cangrelor and designated the final draw on study Day 1 (5.25 hours, or 3.25 hours after cangrelor had been discontinued) as the reference for the effect of ticagrelor. Residual platelet reactivity (the extent of aggregation in the presence or absence of the study drugs) was examined for each of the endpoints using light transmittance aggregometry. Residual platelet reactivity (PR) was measured in response to 20 µmol adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 300 seconds (final/terminal aggregation response).</description>

        <description>A reference point was chosen for comparison and designated the first draw during the cangrelor infusion (0.5 hours or 1.25 hours) as the reference for the effect of cangrelor and designated the final draw on study Day 1 (5.25 hours, or 3.25 hours after cangrelor had been discontinued) as the reference for the effect of ticagrelor. Residual platelet reactivity (the extent of aggregation in the presence or absence of the study drugs) was examined for each of the endpoints using light transmittance aggregometry. Residual platelet reactivity (PR) was measured in response to 20 µmol adenosine diphosphate (ADP) at 300 seconds (final/terminal aggregation response).</description>
