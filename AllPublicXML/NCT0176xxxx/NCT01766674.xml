  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial among 100 total males and females with hyperkyphosis,
      aged 60 years and older, to determine the effects of an exercise intervention that includes
      high intensity spinal muscle strengthening exercises compared to a usual care waitlist group.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants assigned to the intervention group will receive a high-intensity spinal
      strengthening group exercise program for 1 hour twice per week for 12 weeks, with home
      practice. The exercise program is outlined below in Table 2. The participants assigned to the
      control group will be receive usual care and be enrolled in a waitlist group. A physical
      therapist will teach the high-intensity spine strengthening exercise intervention sessions.
      Additionally, physical therapy graduate students will attend all exercise sessions to help
      ensure the safety of all participants and maintain a ratio of no more than five participants
      to one teacher. Participants in the control group will crossover to the spinal strengthening
      exercise group after 12 weeks and receive the intervention for 12 weeks.

      All potential participants will be screened initially with a medical screening exam, and
      their primary care provider will be contacted by the study physician for approval for study
      participation. The participant will sign the medical release giving their primary care
      provider permission to release medical information to the study physician. The primary
      outcome will be change in Cobb angle of kyphosis over 12 weeks calculated from measurements
      taken from lateral spine radiographs and change in the Physical Performance Test (PPT). The
      investigators will also assess the effect of the exercise intervention on the secondary
      outcomes of physical function, strength and quality of life. The investigators will also use
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine bone mineral density before the study
      intervention. Study participants will receive an actigraph to measure physical activity
      throughout the study.

      For participants in the control group who crossover to the exercise intervention group at 12
      weeks will receive an additional lateral spine radiograph at the end of the intervention.

      Both groups will receive a copy of the study exercise DVD at the end of the study.

Each exercise session will be preceded by light aerobic activity, ended with cool-down and stretching the neck, chest and all extremities. All participants will be carefully monitored to ensure that all exercises will be performed slowly, with correct body alignment and technique to minimize risk of injury.</description>
