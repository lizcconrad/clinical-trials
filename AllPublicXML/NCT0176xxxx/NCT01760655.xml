    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies reduced-intensity conditioning before donor stem cell transplant
      in treating patients with high-risk hematologic malignancies. Giving low-doses of
      chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the
      growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the
      donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help
      destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the
      donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this
      effect.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      1. To compare the rate of disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year post hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) in patients undergoing HSCT treated on this successor Thomas Jefferson
      University (TJU) 2 Step reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) haploidentical regimen and
      compare it with that of the initial 2 Step RIC regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the 100 day regimen-related mortality (RRM) in patients undergoing HSCT on
           this treatment protocol.

        2. To determine the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in patients
           undergoing treatment on this regimen.

        3. To evaluate engraftment rates and lymphoid reconstitution in patients treated on this
           trial.

        4. To assess overall survival at 1 and 3 years past HSCT in patients treated on this trial.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV)
      over 60 minutes on days -15 to -12, thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -15 to -13, donor
      lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on day -6, and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2.
      Patients also undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on day -10.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive tacrolimus IV on days -1 to 42 followed by taper and
      mycophenolate mofetil IV twice daily (BID) on days -1 to 28.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

               3. Myelodysplasia (MDS) other than refractory anemia (RA), refractory anemia with
                  rare sideroblasts (RARS), or isolated 5q- syndrome subtypes.

               4. Hodgkin's or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2nd or greater remission or with
                  persistent disease.

                  evolution to acute leukemia

               9. Any hematological malignancy not cited above which is thought to be high-risk
                  with increased chance of post HSCT relapse. Patients in this category require
                  specific approval of the PI and the TJU BMT attending physician group for
                  entrance.

              10. Any hematological malignancy or dyscrasia not cited above which is thought to be

                  therapy precluding TBI, or a past history of myeloablative therapy, precluding a
                  2nd myeloablative regimen.
