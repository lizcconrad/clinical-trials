      This multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of Fufangdanshen Tablets in patients with vascular dementia. All patients will
      initially receive placebo for a 2 weeks period and then will receive Fufangdanshen Tablets or
      placebo for 6 months. The primary measures of effectiveness include the change from baseline
      to the end of treatment in the ADAS-cog/11 score (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale: sum
      of 11 cognitive items) and the CIBIC-plus score (Clinician's Interview Based Impression of
      Change - Plus Caregiver Input). Additional measures of effectiveness include the change from
      baseline to the end of the treatment in the MMSE score (Mini-mental State Examination), the
      ADL (Ability of Daily Living) score. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, laboratory tests) will be performed
      throughout the study. Patients who complete the double-blind portion of the study will be
      followed up 12 weeks. Effectiveness will be assessed at 12 weeks, 24weeks and 36 weeks.
      Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events, ECGs, physical examinations, laboratory
      tests) will be performed at 12 weeks, 24weeks and 36 weeks of the study. The study hypothesis
      is that Fufangdanshen Tablets will be effective in the treatment of patients with vascular
      dementia and will be well tolerated. Double-blind: Fufangdanshen Tablets: 3 tablets per time,
      3 times per day, and placebo : 3 tablets per time, 3 times per day. The placebo has similar
      smile and appearance as the Fufangdanshen Tablets.
