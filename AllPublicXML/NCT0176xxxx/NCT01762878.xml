  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2269557 is potent and highly selective inhaled phosphoinositides 3-kinases -delta
      (PI3K-delta) inhibitor being developed as an anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of
      inflammatory airway diseases. GSK2269557 has already been administered as a nebulized
      solution in single and repeat doses to humans and has been well tolerated across the range of
      doses used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat inhaled doses of GSK2269557 as a dry powder. This study
      is the first administration of dry powder GSK2269557 in humans.

      Part A will consist of four treatment periods separated by at least 14 days wash out periods.
      In each treatment period there will be 12 subjects receiving GSK2269557 and 4 subjects
      receiving placebo. The doses of GSK2269557 planned for Part A are 100 micrograms (mcg), 500
      mcg and 3000 mcg. Blinded safety and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be reviewed
      before each dose escalation. Part B will be a parallel group design conducted in a separate
      group of subjects from Part A. Nine subjects will receive repeat doses of GSK2269557 and 3
      subjects will receive repeat doses of placebo for 14 days. The total daily dose will be the
      same as the dose that was well tolerated in Part A. The study duration, including screening
      and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 82 days for subjects in part A and 55 days for
      subjects in part B of the study.

             outside the reference range expected for them and the population being studied may be
             included only if the Investigator believes that the finding is unlikely to introduce
