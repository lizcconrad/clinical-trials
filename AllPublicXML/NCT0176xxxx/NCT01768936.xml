  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels are monitored in patients with secondary peritonitis after
      initial operative focus elimination to investigate the PCT ratio's impact on decision-making
      for or against early relaparotomy in the on-demand relaparotomy concept of secondary septic
      peritonitis.

    <description>definition of 'focus elimination': patients with intestinal perforation or anastomotic leakage develop (local) peritonitis and consecutive abdominal sepsis. These patients need surgical intervention for focus elimination. This operative intervention aims to eradicate all infectious material and is intended to remove the leaking intestinal lesion. Whether this focus is eliminated or not can be controlled by either planned relaparotomy (normally within 48h after the first operation) or on demand relaparotomy in case of clinical deterioration. The focus can be assumed to be eliminated in all cases where either relaparotomy reveals no ongoing infection or persisting focus and whenever a patient recovers rapidly after initial surgery.</description>
