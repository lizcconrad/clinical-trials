  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced plasma nitrate (NOx) levels and increased urinary norepinephrine (U-NE) levels have
      been described in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and are reverted by continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). The investigators wanted to know the effect of CPAP on these
      biomarkers in mild-moderate OSA.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare NOx and U-NE levels and blood pressure (BP) between male
      patients with mild-moderate and severe OSA and determine the impact of 1 month of CPAP
      therapy on these parameters.

      The investigators undertook a prospective study of 67 consecutive OSA patients (36
      mild-moderate, 31 severe). Measurements of plasma NOx at 11 pm, 4 am and 7 am, 24-h U-NE and
      ambulatory BP were obtained at baseline and after 1 month of CPAP.
