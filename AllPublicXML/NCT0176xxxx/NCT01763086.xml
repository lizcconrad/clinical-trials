    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the utility of treating patients experiencing poor
      graft function after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with ex-vivo-expanded
      BM-drived mesenchymal stem cells from third-party donors. Our first objective was to evaluate
      the effect of such treatment on poor graft function, and second object was to investigate the
      safety of such treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(allo-HSCT) can cure many hematologic
      diseases. Although good progress has been made in the prevention and treatment of side
      effects associated with transplantation, poor graft function (PGF) remains an important
      complication that occurs in 5-27% of patients, and is associated with considerable morbidity
      and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications. Treatment of PGF usually
      involves the prescription of hematopoietic growth factors such as granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or repeat transplantation, but these methods are
      associated with short-term effect and a significant risk of graft-versus-host disease（GVHD）
      development, respectively.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be isolated
      from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of human MSCs
      are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment, preventing and
      treating graft-versus-host disease after allo-HSCT and so on. However, the efficacy of
      treatment of PGF that develops after allo-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a
      third-party donor is rarely reported. If such treatment could be shown to be effective and
      safe, BM-derived MSCs could potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would
      have a major impact because the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly,
      and often impractical if the clinical status of a patient is urgent.

      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors in treating patients with PGF
      after allo-HSCT.

    <description>Hematopoietic reconstitution post-transplantation is defined as reconstitution of both neutrophil and platelet numbers. Neutrophil reconstitution is defined as occurring on the first 3 consecutive days with an neutrophil(NEU)&gt;0.5×10^9/L, and platelet (PLT) reconstitution is defined as the first &gt;20×10^9/L for 3 consecutive days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>infections, primary underlying disease relapse and any toxic side effects of MSCs treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Infections will be mainly focused within the first 100 days after MSCs treatment. Toxic side effects of treatment includes acute toxicity and late side effects. Acute toxicity principally involves the heart,live and kidney. Late toxic side effects involves principally the development of secondary tumors and relapse of the primary disease.</description>

    <description>Mesenchymal stem cells will be intravenously infused via a central venous catheter,at a dose of 1×10^6 cells/kg, over 15 min. The vital signs of all patients will be closely monitored during and for 24h after MSCs administration. If the NEU and PLT levels do not attain the completely response(CR)standards within 14d, a second course of MSCs treatment will be given.</description>
