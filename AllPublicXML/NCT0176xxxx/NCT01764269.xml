      In this study, the investigators will prospectively assess fever rates in 24-59 month old
      patients during days 0-10 after administration of inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) or live
      attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Children in one of three study sites who receive these
      vaccines as part of their routine care can enroll in this study if their parent has the
      ability to receive and send text messages. Children enrolled in this study will be observed
      for an eleven day period starting on the day of vaccine administration via a series text
      messages to their parents.
