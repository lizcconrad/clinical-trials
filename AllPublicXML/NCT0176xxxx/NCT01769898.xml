      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks treatment with
      theophylline plus low-dose formoterol-budesonide in subjects with bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is an orphan disease caused by the pathogenic vicious
      circle including infection, inflammation and airway repair. Today's principle of treatment is
      to break the cycle of inflammation and infection. Nowadays, most clinical trials are
      anti-infective treatment by antibiotics trying to break this cycle by reducing the bacterial
      load, which may cause bacterial resistance. There were still some anti-inflammation trials by
      using inhaled corticosteroids(ICS). Tsang and Martínez-García showed that inhaled
      corticosteroids reduced IL-1,IL-8 levels and sputum inflammation cells, and improved sputum
      volume as well as quality of life, though the corticosteroid must be high dose or medium dose
      combined with long-acting ß2 adrenergic agonists. As described in asthma and chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD), theophylline can improve the activity of histone
      deacetylase (HDAC) and then enhanced the anti-inflammatory effect of steroids. We hypothesis
      that theophylline may have the same effect in subjects with bronchiectasis. Theophylline plus
      inhaled low-dose formoterol-budesonide may improve quality of life and reduce airway
      inflammation.
