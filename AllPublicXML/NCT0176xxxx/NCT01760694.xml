      To assess the ability of a combination of updated and approved modalities in the treatment of
      first line pancreatic cancer patients to increase the time to Progression Free Survival

      For resectable patient; surgery with Intraoperative Radiation Therapy (IORT). Radiation
      Therapy within 6-8 weeks after surgery followed by FOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks starting within
      12 weeks of surgery.

      For marginally resectable patients; the patients will have 2-3 cycles of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy of FOLFIRINOX and then restaged, undergo surgery with IORT within 2-4 weeks
      following chemotherapy. Then radiation therapy starting within 6-8 weeks. Followed by
      FOLFIRINOX every 2 weeks starting within 12 weeks of surgery for a total of 2-4 cycles.
