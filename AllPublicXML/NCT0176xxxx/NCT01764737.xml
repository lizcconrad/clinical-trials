    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV administration of
      VX15/2503 in patients with multiple sclerosis. The escalation part of the study will
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the Maximum Administered Dose if no MTD is
      found.

    <textblock>
      VX15/2503-N-101 is a single ascending dose-escalation, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV-administered VX15/2503
      in patients with multiple sclerosis. This will be accomplished by using a dose escalation
      procedure starting at a low dose of VX15/2503 and will continue based on predefined
      parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. Patients will be randomized at a
      4:1 ratio to receive VX15/2503 to placebo. The patients and the study team will be blinded to
      the treatment that each patient receives.

      The study drug, VX15/2503, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the semaphorin 4D
      (SEMA4D; CD100) antigen. Experimental evidence suggest that antibody neutralization of SEMA4D
      may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating multiple sclerosis.
