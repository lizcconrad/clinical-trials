  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ImmuKnow detects cell-mediated immunity in solid-organ transplant recipients undergoing
      immunosuppressive therapy. Increasing ImmuKnow values indicate a decrease of
      immunosuppression and decreasing ImmuKnow values suggest an increase of immunosuppression.
      The test measures the amount of ATP produced in CD4+ lymphocytes as a biomarker of lymphocyte
      activation. This study uses the ImmuKnow assay to proactively adjust immunosuppressive
      therapy in adult liver transplant recipients to reduce the risk of adverse events

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We performed a randomized prospective interventional trial where the Interventional group had
      immunosuppression modified according to ImmuKnow values. Immunosuppression was decreased by
      25% if ImmuKnow values were less than 130 ng/mL ATP. Similarly, immunosuppression was
      increased by 25% if ImmuKnow values were greater than 450 ng/mL ATP. Immunosuppression of the
      Control group was managed by the Standard of Care at our institution. ImmuKnow was performed
      before liver transplant, after surgery and at each clinic visit with the approximate
      schedule: day 1; weekly, weeks 1-4; week 6; week 8; monthly, months 3-6; and months 9 and 12.
      ImmuKnow testing was repeated within 7 days of a suspected/confirmed rejection or infection
      and again within 1 week of resolution.

    <description>Tacrolimus dose was reduced by 25% when ImmuKnow values were below 130 ng/mL ATP and increased by 25% when ImmuKnow values exceeded 450 ng/mL. Further reductions or increases were made after serial measures until ImmuKnow values stabilized between 130 and 450 ng/mL ATP. The values of 130 and 450 ng/mL ATP were previously documented as thresholds for risks of infection and rejection, respectively with a value of 280 ng/mL corresponding with the greatest negative predictive value for either event</description>
