  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laboratory studies suggest that the study drug may stop cancer cells from growing by
      affecting an interaction between proteins in the cells referred to as cAMP-response
      element-binding protein and ß-catenin.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine the highest safe dose of study drug that
      may be used when it is given together with a chemotherapy drug to patients with cancer of the
      pancreas.

    <textblock>
      PRI-724 is a small molecule antagonist that binds to the co-activator CBP thereby
      specifically inhibiting the subset of Wnt/β-catenin-driven genes that are up-regulated in
      cancer cells. PRI-724 is being developed as a potential antineoplastic agent.

      Purpose:

      To determine the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) of sequential escalating doses per cohort of PRI-724 administered in combination
      with gemcitabine to patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is locally advanced,
      metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line therapy after failing
      first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX (i.e., folinic acid [leucovorin], fluorouracil,
      irinotecan, oxaliplatin)

        -  PRI-724: 320, 640, 905 mg/m2/day, continuous intravenous (CIV) infusion over 24 h, daily
           × 7 days, 1 week on with 1 week recovery × 2 (4 weeks equals 1 cycle)

        -  Gemcitabine: 1000 mg/m2 IV over 30 minutes; 3 weeks on with 1 week recovery (4 weeks
           equals 1 cycle)

      Patients with documented, measurable or evaluable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas that is
      locally advanced, metastatic, or otherwise inoperable, who are candidates for second-line
      therapy after failing first-line therapy with FOLFIRINOX, will be entered into this phase 1b,
      multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation per cohort study. The trial is
      designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, DLT(s), and MTD of escalating doses of
      PRI-724, a CBP/ β- catenin inhibitor, when administered in combination with a standard dose
      of gemcitabine. Correlative studies include characterization of the PK profiles of PRI-724
      and gemcitabine, evaluation of the utility of potential PD markers of PRI-724 activity, as
      well as preliminary assessment of the antineoplastic activity of PRI-724 plus gemcitabine in
      this patient population.
