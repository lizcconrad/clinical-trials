    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if study drug (BMS-986020) dose of 600 mg once
      daily or 600 mg twice daily for 26 weeks compared with placebo will reduce the decline in
      forced vital capacity (FVC) and will be well tolerated in subjects with idiopathic pulmonary
      fibrosis (IPF).

               -  use of over-the-counter medications and herbal preparations, within 4 weeks
                  before study drug administration except those medications cleared by the BMS
                  medical monitor

               -  For subjects taking statins, there are restrictions on the maximum allowable
                  doses for statins listed below. If subjects are currently taking statins and
                  their doses are higher than those mentioned below, please reduce the dose to the
                  maximum allowable dose.

        Additionally, if subjects are on statins and ready to start dosing, these subjects should
        limit statin doses by maximal allowable dose or lower for at least 5 days prior to the
        first BMS-986020 dosing. Shorter durations may be considered in select cases after
        discussion with the medical monitor.

        Maximum allowable dose for statins:

          -  Simvastatin 20 mg QD

          -  Pitavastatin 2 mg QD

          -  Atorvastatin 40 mg QD

        Physical and Laboratory Test Findings

          1. Has any of the following liver-function test criteria above the specified limits:
             total bilirubin &gt;1.5 x ULN, excluding subjects with Gilbert's syndrome; aspartate or
             alanine aminotransferase (AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT) greater than 3 x ULN; alkaline
             phosphatase greater than 2.5 x ULN.

          2. Has creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute, calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault
             formula.

          3. Has ECG result with a QT interval by Fridericia's correction (QTcF) of 500 msec or
             greater or an uncorrected QT of 500 msec or greater at screening. Note: For subjects
             with a machine read QT interval of &gt;500 msec, if their heart rate is &gt; 100 bpm, the
             machine read QT interval (either corrected or not) may not be accurate. If the
             investigator is uncertain about the QT abnormality, it is recommended that ECGs be
             over-read by a cardiologist. The manually read QT interval by a cardiologist should be
             used for assessment of eligibility whenever possible.

        Allergies and Adverse Drug Reaction Has had prior use of BMS-986020 or has known
        hypersensitivity to any of the components of study treatment.

        Other Exclusion Criteria

          1. Is not a suitable candidate for enrollment or is unlikely to comply with the
             requirements of this study, in the opinion of the investigator.

          2. Has smoked cigarettes within 4 weeks or screening or is unwilling to avoid tobacco
             products throughout the study.

          3. Is expected to receive a lung transplant within 1 year from randomization or, for
             subjects at sites in the United States, is on a lung-transplant waiting list at
             screening.

          4. Prisoners or subjects who are involuntarily incarcerated.

          5. Subjects who are compulsorily detained for treatment either of a psychiatric or
             physical (e.g., infectious disease) illness.

          6. Inability to comply with restrictions and prohibited activities/treatments as listed
             in Section 3.3 of the Protocol.
