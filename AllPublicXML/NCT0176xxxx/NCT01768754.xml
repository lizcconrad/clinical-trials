  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing body of evidence suggests that in individuals with chronic lung disease their walk
      speed is related to their daily function and quality of life. It is possible to assess their
      usual (routine) and fast walking speeds by getting them to walk in a flat hallway.

      In individuals with chronic lung disease, we anticipate that their usual walk speed will be
      helpful in exercise prescription and use in multidimensional scoring systems. However, it is
      important to first determine the measurement properties of these two walk speeds.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Coefficient of repeatability for usual and fast walk speeds</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and over 1 week period.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to demonstrate their usual and fast walk speeds over the middle 10 meters of a 30 meter straight track using optical sensors and a hand-held stopwatch. Participants will be instructed to walk at their 'usual' and 'fast' speeds as standardized instructions. The walk test will be repeated after a 5 minute rest and then repeated on two subsequent days, at the same time of day, within one week. This will be simply observational in nature with no planned intervention aside for controlling walking environment.
The primary outcome is going to report a change in walk speeds from baseline and at 1 and 2 days using repeated measures as described by Bland and Altman (reference below).</description>

    <description>Stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will demonstrate their usual and fast walking speeds over a 30 m course, with speed calculated over the middle 10 m using optical sensors. The test will be repeated after a 5 minute rest; this procedure will then be repeated on two subsequent days, at the same time of day, within one week.</description>
