  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a rapid follow up for elderly patients in a Geriatric Clinic
      discharged from the Emergency Department (ED) will have fewer unplanned return ED visits and
      fewer unplanned hospital admissions with no attendant increase in mortality.

      Patients 75 years of age and older will be randomized following discharge from the ED into
      two groups. The first will receive standard post ED care. The second will receive an
      appointment to our Geriatric Clinic within 2-3 days for stabilization, further treatment and
      contact with the patient's primary physician to communicate the course of the patient's
      illness and to schedule subsequent follow-up with the patients regular medical provider.

      There will be two primary outcomes: The first will be a composite of morality and/or return
      to the ED at 30 days, and the secondary primary outcome will be mortality. Economic data
      regarding resource utilization by patients will also be analyzed.
