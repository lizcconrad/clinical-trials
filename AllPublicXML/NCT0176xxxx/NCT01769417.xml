    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first time in human study enrolling approximately 33 healthy adult
      subjects (18-65 yrs) from one study site. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability and PK of MEDI4893 in healthy adult volunteers administered as a single
      IV dose compared with placebo, across 4 cohorts. The 4 dose cohorts will enroll sequentially.
      Subjects will be followed for safety from the time of Informed Consent through 360 days post
      dose.

      This is a phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of MEDI4893, an extended half-life
      human monoclonal antibody against Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin, in healthy adult
      subjects. Approximately 33 subjects will be enrolled across 4 fixed dose cohorts at 1 study
      site . This study will last approximately 389 days, constituting a screening period of up to
      28 days, 1 day of investigational product administration, and a 360 day safety follow up
      period.

          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, HIPAA) obtained
             from the subject prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including
             screening evaluations.

          3. Females of childbearing age using contraception for at least 28 days prior to
             receiving the dose of investigational product, and for 1 year after receiving IP.

          4. Weight ≥ 45 kg and ≤ 110 kg at screening.

          5. Healthy by medical history and physical examination at screening.

          6. Systolic blood pressure (BP) &lt; 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg at screening.

          7. Normal electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening.

             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or study
             results.

          2. Employees of the sponsor, clinical study site, or any other individuals involved with

               4. AST, ALT, BUN, serum creatinine &gt; upper limit of normal (ULN).

               5. Positive Urine Class A drug screen.

               6. Other abnormal laboratory values in the screening panel, which in the opinion of
                  the principal investigator, are judged to be clinically significant or
                  potentially confound study results.

         17. Pregnant or nursing mother.

         18. Active alcohol or drug abuse or history of alcohol or drug abuse that, in the opinion
             of the principal investigator, might compromise subject safety, study safety
             assessments, or ability of subject to comply with study requirements.

         19. Concurrent enrollment in another interventional study.
