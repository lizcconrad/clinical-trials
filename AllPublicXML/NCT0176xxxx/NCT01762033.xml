    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a study will investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of ASONEP™
      (sonepcizumab/LT1009) when administered intravenously once a week, every 4 weeks (or cycle),
      to subjects with refractory renal cell carcinoma (RCC) until the disease progresses. Subjects
      who have failed 3 prior treatments for RCC including vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) and/or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or who have tumors that cannot
      be surgically removed will be eligible for screening.

      LT1009-Onc-002 is a Phase 2a open-label, multi-center study designed to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of ASONEP (sonepcizumab/LT1009) monotherapy in subjects with advanced,
      unresectable, refractory RCC who have previously failed up to 3 therapies, including VEGF
      and/or mTOR inhibitors. Two cohorts will be enrolled for a total of up to 39 subjects.
      Subjects will receive an intravenous (IV) infusion of ASONEP™ over 90 minutes at 24 mg/kg
      once a week and progression-free survival (PFS) will be assessed after 8 weeks of treatment.
      Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 22 subjects. A second cohort of up to 17 subjects will be
      enrolled if at least 12 out of 22 subjects from Cohort 1 demonstrated PFS at 8 weeks. Weekly
      dosing will take place from the date of randomization until the date of first documented
      progression or date of death from any cause, whichever comes first.

    <description>The study will use a two-cohort design based on an 8-week PFS rate. Treatment will be considered promising if at least 12 out of the first 22 eligible subjects entered in the Cohort 1 of the study are progression free at Week 8. Enrollment of Cohort 2 will then proceed and be considered worthy of further evaluation if at least 25 out of 39 eligible subjects are progression free at Week 8. If no efficacy signal is observed after enrollment of 22 subjects in Cohort 1, the second cohort will not be enrolled and the clinical study may be stopped.</description>
