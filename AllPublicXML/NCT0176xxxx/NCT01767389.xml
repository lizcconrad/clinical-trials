    <textblock>
      This study will assess the utilization patterns (adherence, source of the index antidiabetic
      agent (ADA) and treatment modification) of the marketed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
      receptor agonists (exenatide and liraglutide), dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors
      (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, and linagliptin) and other ADAs and the incidence rate of acute
      pancreatitis among the users of these GLP-1 receptor agonists and users of DPP-4 inhibitors,
      separately, in comparison to other ADAs.

      The proposed study will help in understanding the treatment utilization patterns and the
      incidence rate of acute pancreatitis among users of the marketed GLP-1 receptor agonists.
      This study differs from previous observational studies by including both exenatide and
      liraglutide and follow-up time is expected to be longer in the current study (2005 - 2011).

      This study will be a retrospective cohort study conducted in the Truven (Thomson Reuters)
      commercial health insurance database from 2005-2011.

    <description>For acute pancreatitis: the study outcome will be the first incidence of acute pancreatitis identified by the ICD-9 code of 577.0 listed as a primary discharge diagnosis on a hospitalization claim. Adherence to GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors and other ADAs will be measured by Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). MPR will be calculated at the class-level for each of the classes of ADA until one of the censoring events.</description>

        The study population will include subjects aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 64 years as of index date and
        those who have continuous enrolment for at least 12 months in Truven (Thomson Reuters)
        commercial health insurance database from 2005-2011. The Truven database captures
        person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and enrolment across inpatient,
        outpatient, prescription drug, and carve-out services from a selection of large employers,
        health plans, and government and public organizations. This databases links paid claims and
        encounter data to detailed patient information across sites and types of providers, and
        over time. The annual medical databases include private sector health data from
        approximately 100 payers. Historically, more than 500 million claim records are available
        in the database. The Commercial Claims and Encounters Database represents the medical
        experience of insured employees and their dependents for active employees, early retirees,
        COBRA continues, and their dependents i

             codes 250.x0 or 250.x2 (excluding 250.x1 and/or 250.x3 - Type 1 diabetes and 648.0x -
             gestational diabetes)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  For the objective of evaluating the association between GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4
             inhibitors and acute pancreatitis as compared to the association observed between this
             outcome and the use of other ADAs, subjects having evidence of pancreatic disease (ICD
             9 code of 577.xx) in the pre-index period (12 months before the index date) will be
