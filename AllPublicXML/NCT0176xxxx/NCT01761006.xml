  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) goes
      up during an acute exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) and whether
      the level of exhaled nitric oxide returns to normal in the weeks after an exacerbation.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) goes
      up during an acute exacerbation of COPD and whether the level of exhaled nitric oxide returns
      to normal in the weeks after an exacerbation. FeNO is measured with a medical device called
      the NIOX MINO®. The NIOX MINO® device has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) for use in children and adults age 7 and older to measure Fractional Exhaled Nitric
      Oxide (FeNO) in human breath.This information will be useful for determining whether FeNO may
      help predict the development of a COPD exacerbation and/or be useful for identifying patients
      who will have a beneficial therapeutic response to inhaled or systemic corticosteroids during
      a COPD exacerbation.
