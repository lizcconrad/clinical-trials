  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open label, two stage, phase II study of dovitinib in patients with
      advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM). The primary purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the potential efficacy of dovitinib in the second- or third-line treatment of MPM
      using progression free survival (PFS).

                  positive HCV RNA testing (note: in a patient with known anti-HCV but with a
                  negative test for HCV RNA, re-testing for HCV RNA 4-6 months later is requested
                  to confirm the resolution of HCV infection)
