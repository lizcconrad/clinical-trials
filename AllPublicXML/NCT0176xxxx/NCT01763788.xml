      The purpose of the Phase 1b portion of the study is to investigate how the body tolerates
      necitumumab, in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy as first line
      treatment in participants with Stage IV squamous NSCLC and to determine the recommended dose
      for the subsequent Phase 2 portion of the study.

      The purpose of the Phase 2 portion of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of necitumumab in
      combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy in participants with Stage IV
      squamous NSCLC in a first-line setting.
