    <textblock>
      This retrospective cohort study will assess the association of benign prostatic hyperplasia
      (BPH) treatment (5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5ARI) and alpha-blocker medications) with the
      occurrence of prostate cancer related mortality. This study will also assess a number of
      secondary endpoints including prostate cancer mortality or metastatic prostate cancer, and
      all cause mortality.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study from 1992-2010 will be conducted using data from 4 Kaiser sites:
      Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC), Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC),
      Kaiser Permanente Northwest (KPNW), and Kaiser Permanente Colorado (KPCO). Men treated with
      BPH medications, 5ARIs (with and without concomitant and/or previous alpha-blocker use) will
      be compared to men treated with alpha-blockers. A matched design will be used with each man
      treated with 5ARIs being matched with 5 or 6 men treated with alpha-blockers. Men 50 years or
      older at the time of their first prescription for a study defined BPH medication, initiating
      treatment between 1992 and 2008 with at least 1-year of coverage in the healthcare system
      before the first prescription for BPH medication and at least 3 consecutive prescriptions (90
      days of supply) for a BPH medication will be eligible for inclusion in the study. Men with a
      diagnosis of prostate cancer any time before the first prescription for BPH medication,
      having a diagnosis of prostate cancer within 3 months after initiation of their first BPH
      medication, and those treated with finasteride 1mg prior to their BPH medication will be
      excluded from the study. 5ARI initiators will be matched to alpha-blocker users in a ratio of
      1:5 or 1:6 to yield an overall matching ratio of 1:5.4. Matching factors include age (+/- 1
      year), timing of BPH treatment initiation (+/- 1 year), race, and duration of prior use of
      alpha-blockers. Based on the feasibility study from KPSC, there will be approximately 284,000
      men treated with BPH medications meeting eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study
      sample.

      The data will be analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves comparing the 5ARI vs alpha-blocker users
      for the primary and secondary study outcomes, without any adjustments. Additionally, a plot
      of cumulative incidence, adjusting for competing risks of death, will be constructed allowing
      for the investigation of the effect of competing risks on the Kaplan-Meier probability
      estimates. Crude mortality rates and incidence rates of metastatic cancer will be calculated.
      Cox proportional hazard regression models will be fit to compare the primary and secondary
      outcomes between groups using hazard ratios, while adjusting for pre-treatment
      characteristics.

        All men age 50 years and older treated with a BPH medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker)
        will be eligible for inclusion. Participants are not required to have a BPH diagnosis at
        the time of their first 5ARI or alpha-blocker prescription as based upon data from the
        feasibility report approximately half of all men received their first recorded BPH
        diagnosis after initiating treatment. Furthermore, approximately 25% of participants
        treated with 5ARIs or alpha-blockers did not have a diagnosis code for BPH in their medical
        record. BPH diagnosis codes were not used in a consistent way historically in the Kaiser
        data. Men should have coverage within the healthcare system for at least 1-year before the
        first BPH medication prescription. Men with a history of prostate cancer or who develop
        prostate cancer within &lt;3 months of starting their first BPH medication are not eligible
        for inclusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that are Male

          -  Patients that have a new prescription for BPH medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker)
             in 1992 or later that is identified as appropriate treatment for BPH/LUTS from the KP
             National Pharmacy guidelines.

          -  Patients with a treatment with BPH medication must be initiated prior to Jan1, 2008.

          -  Patients age 50 years or older at time of treatment with 5ARI or alpha-blocker.

          -  Patients with at least 1-year of coverage in the healthcare system before the first
             prescription for BPH medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker).

          -  Patients with at least 3 consecutive prescriptions (90 days of supply) for a BPH
             medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer any time before the first prescription
             for BPH medication (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker).

          -  Patients with a dagnosis of prostate cancer within 3 months after first BPH medication
             (5ARI and/or alpha-blocker)

          -  Patients treated with Finasteride 1mg prior to BPH medication. Finasteride 1mg is the
             dose approved for androgenic alopecia and as the target population for this study is
             men with treated BPH, we will exclude all men treated with the 1mg dose.
