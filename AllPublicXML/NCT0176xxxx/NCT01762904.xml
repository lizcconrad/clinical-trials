  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are few options for skin antisepsis, commercially antiseptic triclosan is
      mainly used. To have more options, this study is necessary, where investigators will
      determine the residual effect of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol and 1% triclosan
      in 70% isopropyl alcohol and choose the one with the best characteristics for skin
      antisepsis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      2% chlorhexidine has been used as an antiseptic for invasive procedures, such as the skin
      preparation for surgery or insertion of intravascular catheters, thereby decreasing the
      incidence of infections. The preparation of the skin with antiseptics, helps mechanically
      clean the surface of the skin to be subjected to surgical intervention, removing fat, sweat,
      dead cells and kill bacteria that are in the skin. It has been shown that 2% chlorhexidine in
      solution with 70% isopropyl alcohol has greater activity than chlorhexidine in aqueous
      solution. The constant use of triclosan causes resistance of some microorganisms on some
      antibiotics.It has been shown that 0.5% of triclosan in 60% alcohol isopropyl chlorhexidine
      is more effective than alcohol. The aim of the study is to know if 2% chlorhexidine has more
      residual effect than triclosan 1%, both antiseptic diluted in 70% isopropyl alcohol.

    <description>135 determinations to evaluate residual effect of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol.
All volunteers was provided with a neutral soap without antiseptics for use of two weeks. 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol was tested. Were prepared the skin area of 25 cm2 randomly selected. The solution remained on the skin for 60s, 3h and 24h, everyone on different days.
Cultures was taken with a scrub-cup of 5 cm2 pressed over the skin, added a 3 mL of culture broth. The skin was scrub with a sterile rubber policeman for 1 minute and the procedure conducted once again. Both aliquots came together in a sterile tube, a sample of 50 microliters were spread in a plate containing a neutralizing agar and were incubated at 35°C for 24 h.</description>

    <description>All volunteers will be provided with a neutral soap and shampoo without antiseptics for use during a period of two weeks (phase of stabilization of the skin flora). Two antiseptics (2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol and 1% triclosan in 70% isopropyl alcohol) and two controls (Scrub the skin without prior application of any substance and Deionized water redistilled) will be tested as skin antiseptics. The intervention consists of preparing four skin's areas with antiseptics and controls, two in each arm of the volunteer. These ones were approximately 25 cm2 on the forearm for each antiseptic or control. The substances will be applied in an outward circular motion using a sterile swab soaked with the solutions. The solution will remain on the skin for 60 seconds, 3 hours and 24 hours before the bacterial culture will be conducted. For the control where it will be does not apply any substance, the scrub starts immediately.</description>

          <title>Whole Group of 135 Units of Measurement</title>
          <description>The arm is composed of 135 units of measurement, it means, 540 determinations to test 2% chlorhexidine gluconate in 70% isopropyl alcohol and 1% triclosan in 70% isopropyl alcohol and two controls.
The principal unit of measurement it will be four determinations of bacterial counts in a subject for antiseptics and controls to test each of the application sites, and determination as to each separately sampling for each area for each antiseptic forearm. The same subject may be assessed up to three separate occasions provided only after a minimum period of two weeks between each determination.
Interventions:
Biological: Bacterial culture of the prepared skin's areas with two antiseptics and two controls
Other: Preparing skin's areas to be tested with two antiseptics and two controls</description>

        <title>Evaluate the Residual Effect of Chlorhexidine 2% / Isopropyl Alcohol 70% Administered Topically</title>
        <description>135 determinations to evaluate residual effect of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol.
All volunteers was provided with a neutral soap without antiseptics for use of two weeks. 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol was tested. Were prepared the skin area of 25 cm2 randomly selected. The solution remained on the skin for 60s, 3h and 24h, everyone on different days.
Cultures was taken with a scrub-cup of 5 cm2 pressed over the skin, added a 3 mL of culture broth. The skin was scrub with a sterile rubber policeman for 1 minute and the procedure conducted once again. Both aliquots came together in a sterile tube, a sample of 50 microliters were spread in a plate containing a neutralizing agar and were incubated at 35°C for 24 h.</description>

        <description>135 units of measurement to test two antiseptics and two controls. Principal unit of measurement: four determinations of bacterial counts in a subject for antiseptics and controls to test each of the application sites.
All volunteers was provided with a neutral soap without antiseptics for use of two weeks. 2% chlorhexidine in 70% isopropyl alcohol and 1% triclosan in 70% isopropyl alcohol, Deionized water redistilled and Scrub the skin without prior application of any substance was tested. We prepared four skin's areas of 25 cm2, two in each forearm. The solution remained on the skin for 60s, 3h and 24h.

Cultures was taken with a scrub-cup of 5 cm2 pressed over the skin, added a 3 mL of culture broth. The skin was scrub with a sterile rubber policeman for 1 minute and the procedure conducted once again. Both aliquots came together in a sterile tube, a sample of 50 microliters were spread in a plate containing a neutralizing agar and were incubated at 35°C for 24 h.</description>
