      This study will evaluate effectiveness and adherence of the nasal expiratory positive airway
      pressure (NEPAP) device as an an alternate therapy for children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea
      Syndrome (OSAS). NEPAP is currently approved for use only in adults.

      The nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (NEPAP) device has been used to treat OSAS in
      adults. A disposable device is placed in each nostril at night and attached with adhesive.
      The device acts as a one-way valve, during inspiration the valve opens, with negligible
      resistance to flow. During expiration, the valve closes and airflow is directed through small
      air channels, increasing resistance. The increased resistance helps to maintain the upper
      airway pressure during the critical end-expiratory period when the upper airway has been
      found to be most narrow in the breaths preceding an apnea event. In contrast to Continuous
      Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) which provides positive pressure during both inspiration and
      expiration, NEPAP creates pressure during expiration. NEPAP is a potential alternative
      therapy which is less cumbersome than CPAP and may increase adherence.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects age 5-16 years (note: Due to the size of the devices, it is expected that
             most children will be at least 8 years old, but a few may be younger. Subjects will be
             evaluated in clinic to fit for size and habituate to the device)

          2. OSAS (AHI &gt; 5/hr)

          3. Subject has had adenotonsillectomy or is not a candidate for adenotonsillectomy

          4. Subject is non-adherent to CPAP or is seeking an alternative therapy

          5. Tolerance of NEPAP device during a daytime session

          6. Parental/guardian permission (informed consent) and if appropriate, child assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe developmental delay thought to involve a high risk of aspiration

          2. Family does not understand English well enough to perform the standardized, validated
             questionnaires.

          3. Age &gt;16 years since results may be similar to adult studies in these older patients.

          4. Severe breathing disorder (including respiratory muscle weakness, bullous lung
             disease, bypassed upper airway, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum)

          5. Severe heart disease (including heart failure)

          6. An acute upper respiratory (including nasal, sinus or middle ear) inflammation or
             infection or perforation of the ear drum

        Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria will not be enrolled. Any
        violations of these criteria will be reported in accordance with Institutional Review Board
        (IRB) Policies and Procedures.

        Study members will not recruit females who are known to be pregnant. However, if a subject
        becomes pregnant during the study, we will continue to use the device. Pregnancy is not an
        exclusion criterion as positive airway pressure therapy does not harm the pregnant woman or
        fetus.
