    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cryosurgery and radiation therapy in treating patients with
      painful bone metastases. Cryosurgery kills tumor cells by freezing them. Radiation therapy
      uses high-energy x-rays and other types of radiation to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.
      Giving cryosurgery together with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the potential for efficacy and safety of combining percutaneous computed
      tomography (CT)-guided cryoablation and radiotherapy for the palliation of osseous
      metastases.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo cryosurgery. Beginning 2 weeks later, patients undergo 1, 10, or 15
      fractions of radiation therapy 5 days per week for 1-3 weeks. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours and weeks 1-2, 4,
      12, 18, and 24.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) confirmed metastatic disease with a
             new tumor involving or abutting bone that has the clinical and imaging features of
             metastatic disease

               -  If the nature of the metastatic disease has been previously documented, index
                  tumor to be treated does not require further documentation (i.e., biopsy)

          -  Current analgesic therapies have failed (worst pain of 4 or above as measured by Brief
             Pain Inventory [BPI], despite analgesic therapy) OR the subject is experiencing
             intolerable side effects that preclude analgesic use (resulting in pain of 4 or above,
             as measured by BPI)

             painful metastatic sites may be present)
