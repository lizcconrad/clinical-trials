  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an experimental research study for pregnant women between 23 and 37 weeks age of
      gestation who will be having a baby sooner than term. This study is to learn if waiting 20,
      40, or 60 seconds to clamp the umbilical cord after baby delivers will improve his/her
      outcome and overall health. Benefit to the baby may come by increasing the amount of blood in
      the baby's body, reducing the need for possible transfusion later, and possible prevention of
      other complications caused by too little blood in the baby. Possible reduction of cerebral
      palsy may be realized by a longer interval for cord clamping.

      Intention is to enroll every preterm delivery into this trial containing six groups of
      patients, vaginal or cesarean delivery with clamping of the cord at 20, 40 or 60 seconds.
      Expectation is 1500 deliveries over 2 year period of time. Randomization upon entry to L&amp;D
      unit. Removal from study if resuscitation deemed urgent by newborn staff. Strong effort to
      keep newborn warm using appropriate measures. Evaluation to determine if there are
      differences in transfusion, anemia, time to onset of spontaneous respiration, occurence of
      IVH or CP.
