  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coumadin drug-drug interactions (DDI) are frequent. Patients in permanent use of coumadin are
      advised to avoid traditional nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to avoid risk of bleeding.
      New selctive cyclooxygesase 2 inhibitors arisen as potential option for treating pain and
      inflamation in these patients once interactions with coumadin are supposed to be lower. The
      CI(R)CA study was made to evaluate in a prospective fashion the occurrence of DDI with new
      cyclooxygenase antiinflammatory drugs and coumadin when compared to acetaminophen and
      placebo.

      The CI(R)CA study included patient diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in permanent use
      of coumadin. Eligible patients were invited to use in a prospective cross-over mode two weeks
      of celecoxib, rofecoxib, acetaminophen and placebo with two weeks of wash out between drugs.
      Their international normalized ratio (INR) were measured before and during the use of each
      study drug. The interaction with coumadin was evaluated according to increases or decreases
      on the INR after each medication.
