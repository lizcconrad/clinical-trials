      The purpose of this research study is to compare the effects (good and bad) on women and
      their cancer using proton radiation therapy.

      This study is being done to see if proton radiation therapy will prove to be beneficial for
      women with early stage breast cancer. A clinical study is necessary to compare the results
      (good or bad) of proton radiation therapy.

      Current standard of care for early stage breast cancer is mastectomy or breast conserving
      therapy with whole breast irradiation following lumpectomy. However, studies of breast cancer
      recurrence have demonstrated the majority of tumors to recur in or adjacent to the original
      tumor site. The question has thus been raised as to whether radiation to the whole breast is
      necessary or justified. Limiting radiation to the area of the original tumor may reduce acute
      and long-term skin and organ toxicities while making radiation therapy more convenient and
      less expensive. Several clinical trials are underway comparing partial breast irradiation
      (PBI) to whole breast irradiation. Numerous centers are offering partial breast irradiation
      outside of clinical trials as well, despite the lack of long-term safety and efficacy data on
      PBI.

      Available PBI methods include brachytherapy, in which catheters or balloons are surgically
      inserted to deliver radiation therapy to the lumpectomy cavity, and conventional external
      beam radiation therapy, or EBRT. External beam photon therapy is attractive for its
      non-invasive nature and ability to deliver a more homogenous dose distribution compared to
      brachytherapy, however it also delivers a greater radiation dose to surrounding normal breast
      tissue.Proton therapy has the capacity to provide the same advantages as photon EBRT while
      minimizing dose to normal surrounding tissue. Clinical data on PBI with protons is minimal,
      however, leaving many questions unanswered. The impetus behind this protocol is to address
      these gaps by further investigating the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of proton therapy
      for partial breast irradiation.

    <description>Freedom from failure (FFF): The events for FFF will be the first ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence. It is expected that less than 3% of patients will experience an ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence (FFF ≥ 97%). A recurrence rate of ≥ 10% (FFF ≤ 90%) is considered unacceptable. Therefore, the null hypothesis is the FFF of ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence is 90% or lower and the alternative hypothesis is that FFF of ipsilateral breast cancer is 97% or higher.</description>
