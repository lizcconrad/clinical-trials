      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of peroral endoscopic
      myotomy (POEM) compared with pneumatic dilation in the treatment of esophageal achalasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal achalasia is an esophageal motor disorder, which is characterized by the absence
      of esophageal peristalsis combined with a defective relaxation of the lower esophageal
      sphincter (LES). The major symptoms of esophageal achalasia are dysphagia, chest pain, and
      regurgitation of undigested food.

      Currently, treatment options mainly focus on relief of the symptoms by reducing the LES
      pressure. Pneumatic dilation is the main endoscopic therapies for esophageal achalasia.
      However, the patients need repeat treatment to maintain therapeutic success and there is a
      risk of perforation (1%-3%). For surgery approaches, the laparoscopic Heller's myotomy (LHM)
      combined with Dor's antireflux procedure has gained considerable interest. The LHM can
      sustain therapeutic effects for long-term in approximately 80% of patients.

      Recently, Inoue et al. succeeded in treating achalasia endoscopically with a method called
      peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) and achieved promising results in short-term. Technically,
      POEM derived from natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and endoscopic
      submucosal dissection (ESD), in which a submucosal tunnel is created after submucosal
      injection, and then an endoscopic myotomy was made at the gastroesophageal junction.

      However, the long-term efficacy and safety of POEM were not determined, and there was no
      prospective study that compared the POEM with other conventional treatment. Therefore, we aim
      to determine the efficacy and safety of POEM, compared with the pneumatic dilation, in the
      treatment of esophageal achalasia.

    <description>Therapeutic success is defined as a symptom control to an Eckardt score of 3 or less.
The Eckardt score is the sum of the symptom scores for dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain (with a score of 0 indicating the absence of symptoms, 1 indicating occasional symptoms, 2 indicating daily symptoms, and 3 indicating symptoms at each meal) and weight loss (with 0 indicating no weight loss, 1 indicating a loss of &lt;5 kg, 2 indicating a loss of 5 to 10 kg, and 3 indicating a loss of &gt;10 kg) (Eckardt, V. Gastroenterology, 1992. 103(6): p. 1732-8.)</description>

    <description>The basal LES pressure and the swallow-induced LES relaxation will be monitored and measured at the end of expiration. After introduction and equilibration, basal pressure is monitored during at least 5 minutes. Swallow-induced relaxation of the sphincter is assessed by 5 ml wet swallows, at least 30 s apart.</description>

    <description>Entry to submucosal space. After submucosal injection, a 2-cm longitudinal mucosal incision is made at approximately 13 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).
Submucosal tunnelling. A long submucosal tunnel is created to 3 cm distal to the GEJ.
Endoscopic myotomy is begun at 3 cm distal to the mucosal entry point, and is carried out in a proximal to distal direction to a total length of 10 cm.
Long endoscopic myotomy of inner circular muscle bundles is done, leaving the outer longitudinal muscle layer intact. The expected end point of myotomy is 2 cm distal to the GEJ.
Closure of mucosal entry: the mucosal incision is closed using hemostatic clips.
