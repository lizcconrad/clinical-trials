      This study will compare alignment criteria in the Oxford Partial Knee using conventional
      instrumentation and Signature Custom Guides in order to determine if the use of the Signature
      Custom Guides results in a higher percentage of knees achieving optimal alignment. The study
      will also examine outcomes with high volume surgeons (&gt;30 cases/year) and low volume surgeons
      (&lt;10 cases/year).

      The primary objectives of this global clinical study are to collect data to assess the
      following clinical evidence parameters that were gathered from Biomet team members and KOL
      globally for this product:

        1. Evaluate the performance &amp; accuracy of the Oxford Partial Knee System with Signature
           Knee Guide in comparison to conventional instrumentation.

        2. Compare the accuracy of Signature Guides between two user profiles: high volume surgeons
           &amp; low volume surgeons in a global mix.

        3. Assess potential economic &amp; efficiency advantages in the short term and long-term: OR
           efficiency, patient quality of life and activity, clinical outcomes.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Intended for use in individuals with osteoarthritis or Avascular necrosis limited to
             the medial compartment of the knee that is also lacking patellofemoral or lateral
             compartment disease.

          -  Use of cementless femoral fixation is permitted outside of the United States if it
             complies with all local, state, and/or national and international regulations. The
             same technique must be used consistently throughout the course of the study with all
             cases

          -  Patients 21 and over

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of Cementless Fixation in the United States

          -  Infection, sepsis or osteomyelitis

          -  Use in lateral compartment of the knee

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease

          -  Revision of failed prosthesis, failed upper tibial osteotomy, or post traumatic
             arthritis after tibial plateau fracture

          -  Insufficiency of the collateral, anterior, or posterior cruciate ligaments which would
             preclude stability of the device.

          -  Disease or damage to the lateral compartment of the knee

          -  Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who is incapable of
             following directions

          -  Osteoporosis in the United States / Insufficient bone stock outside the United States

          -  Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation

          -  Osteomalacia

          -  Distant foci of infections which may spread to implant site

          -  Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss, or bone resorption apparent on
             roentgenogram

          -  Vascular insufficiency, muscular atrophy, neuromuscular disease.

          -  Incomplete or deficient soft tissue surrounding the knee.

          -  Charcot's disease

          -  A fixed varus deformity (not passively correctable) of greater than 15 degrees

          -  A flexion deformity greater than 15 degrees.

          -  Non-staged Bilateral patients

          -  Patients who refuse, cannot, or should not receive a CT or MRI. Since patients are
             randomized into treatment groups, all patients must be able to receive an MRI (should
             follow local MRI screening protocol). This excludes patients who have metal artifacts
             in the knee, patients who are too large to fit into the knee coil, patients with
             pacemakers, patients unable to lie still for the duration of the MRI, and patients who
             are claustrophobic.
