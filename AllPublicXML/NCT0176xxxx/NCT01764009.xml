      The objective of the present trial is:

        -  to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and
           recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of intramuscular electrotransferred Plasmid AMEP in
           patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma.

        -  to determine the local and general safety of intramuscular electrotransferred Plasmid
           AMEP

        -  to evaluate the efficacy of intramuscular electrotransferred Plasmid AMEP
    </textblock>

      In this open-label, multicentre, dose escalation phase I study, successive cohorts of 3
      patients suffering from advanced or metastatic melanoma will be electrotransferred increasing
      doses of Plasmid AMEP into muscle. Treatment will be repeated every 28 days until progression
      or limiting toxicity.

      Consecutive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients will be treated with increasing doses of Plasmid AMEP
      at three dose levels: 0.25 mg, 1 mg and 4 mg according to an adapted 3+3 design. There will
      be no intra-patient dose escalation.
