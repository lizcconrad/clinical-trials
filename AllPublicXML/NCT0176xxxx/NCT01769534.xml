  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to follow patients, who have small mucinous cysts in the
      pancreas, prospectively over a 5-year period.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will present to our endoscopy unit for EUS-FNA to work up pancreatic cystic
      lesion(s). At that time, we will recruit them to be in the patient registry and tissue
      repository. Their enrollment in the patient registry will allow us to contact them annually
      for survey purposes. Their enrollment in the tissue repository will allow us to store
      left-over pancreatic cyst fluid that was already aspirated for analysis (as part of the
      standard-of-care workup for pancreatic cysts).
