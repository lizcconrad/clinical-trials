  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of [18F]Florbetapir positron
      emission tomography (PET) for assessment of demyelination in the patients with relapsing
      remitting multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of [18F]Florbetapir as an
      imaging tool to detect demyelination in the brain of MS research participants and compare to
      similarly aged healthy subjects.
