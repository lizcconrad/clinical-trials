  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease afflicting to two thirds of Americans. Today, an
      estimated 43 million individuals have arthritis. By 2020, more than 59.4 million Americans
      will be affected by the disease. Despite the relative good track record of total knee
      replacement, it remains a biomedical device that can fail over time. A recent study looking
      at the current mechanisms of total knee replacement failures, listed polyethylene wear and
      osteolysis around implants. The material used for polyethylene insert as well as the
      conformity of articular surface of implants has been modified to decrease wear. While
      introducing modularity, the usage of metal backing in tibial base plates became obvious as it
      offered better stress distribution to the proximal tibial bone. However, it introduced other
      modes of failures. Micromotion has been demonstrated between the metal backing and the tibial
      liner, and produced backside polyethylene wear in 44% of implants at retrieval for revision.
      Factor influencing the surgeon's choice of implant include: reproductibility and longevity of
      results, technical difficulty of implantation, cost, and impact on bone stock. The modulus of
      elasticity of the tibial base plate has a direct effect on periprosthetic bone biology.
      Studies have described a significant decrease in postoperative Bone mineral density (BMD),
      adjacent to the implants, after total knee replacement. No study, to our knowledge, has
      looked at BMD in vivo after total knee replacement comparing different tibial base plate
      designs. Direct effect of changes in design on overall implant survival can be studied with
      randomized clinical trials isolating specific variables. No randomized clinical trial has
      looked at tibial insert stiffness and modularity, and it effect on bone density changes,
      synovitis, osteolysis or survivorship. In order to isolate stiffness and modularity as study
      variables, one would aim at randomizing an homogenous patient population undergoing total
      knee arthroplasty with implants of similar articular geometry designs with different tibial
      insert modularity and stiffness.
