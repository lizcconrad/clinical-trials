Participants who had no rescue therapy within specified study period were considered as censored observations at the last available contact date up to specified study period.</description>

        <description>Information on cardiovascular (CV) risk factors was collected at baseline. Deaths and nonfatal cardiovascular adverse events (AEs) were adjudicated by an external committee of physicians with cardiology expertise. Nonfatal cardiovascular AEs to be adjudicated included myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary interventions, and cerebrovascular events, including cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and transient ischemic attack. The number of participants with CV events confirmed by adjudication is summarized cumulatively at 24 weeks plus 30-day follow up. Serious and all other non-serious adverse events regardless of causality are summarized in the Reported Adverse Events module.</description>
