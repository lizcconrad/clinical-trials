      The purpose of this study is to assess the control of COPD using a symptom and exacerbation
      risk based treatment strategy based on GOLD 2011. This study is conducted in Japanese
      subjects with COPD and assess whether the GOLD 2011 strategy is effective in medical practice
      in Japan.

      PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale Both ADOAIR and tiotropium bromide ( hereinafter tiotropium）are
      now well established, effective treatments for COPD and are frequently co-prescribed
      (hereinafter TRIPLE therapy). The addition of ADOAIR to tiotropium improves lung function and
      quality of life and may further reduce exacerbations. GOLD 2011 thus recommends TRIPLE
      therapy as the second choice of COPD treatment strategy. However, the criteria for switching
      from each individual treatment to TRIPLE therapy are not clearly shown so far.

      This study will be conducted in Japanese subjects with COPD and will assess whether the GOLD
      2011 strategy is effective in medical practice in Japan.

      Objective(s) The objective of the study is to assess the control of COPD using a symptom and
      exacerbation risk based treatment strategy based on GOLD 2011.

    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The randomized treatment could be switched to TRIPLE therapy in the case that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not controlled by the randomized treatment. Participants on TRIPLE therapy received SAL/FLU 50/250 µg BID plus TIO 18 µg QD together. The percentage of participants who were able to remain on the randomized treatment was calculated by the following formula: 100 minus percentage of participants who switched over to TRIPLE therapy.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Switched to TRIPLE Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Switched to TRIPLE therapy is defined as: 1. Date of switch: when SAL/FLU or TIO was administered additionally to randomised treatment. 2. Date of randomisation was a start point and timing of switching (first switch if there are more than once) to TRIPLE was event. For participants without switching, last day of study or follow up period was regarded as censored. Percentage of participants who switched to TRIPLE therapy was calculated as: number of participants who switched to TRIPLE therapy divided by number of evaluable population and then multiplied by 100.</description>

        <description>The randomized treatment could be switched to TRIPLE therapy in the case that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not controlled by the randomized treatment. Participants on TRIPLE therapy received SAL/FLU 50/250 µg BID plus TIO 18 µg QD together. The percentage of participants who were able to remain on the randomized treatment was calculated by the following formula: 100 minus percentage of participants who switched over to TRIPLE therapy.</description>

For participants without switching, last day of study or follow up period was regarded as censored.

        <description>EXACT is a 14-item patient questionnaire used as a measure of respiratory symptoms (reported as units on a 0 [best health status] to 100 [worst possible status] scale). Scores were assessed at Baseline, Week 1-4, Week 5-8, Week 9-12, Week 13-16, Week 17-20 and Week 21-24. Daily EXACT total score is obtained as total score of 14 items from diary. Daily E-RS total score as 11 items and Daily E-RS subscale scores are subset of E-RS total score.
Mean EXACT total score is mean value of daily EXACT total score within subject by every 4 weeks(Week1-4, Week5-8, Week9-12, Week13-16, Week17-20, Week21-24). Same calculation of mean values are applied to E-RS total and E-RS subscale scores.</description>

        <title>EXACT Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) Total Score</title>
        <description>The E-RS total score is an 11-item patient questionnaire, which provides information specific to respiratory symptoms-severity of respiratory symptoms overall and severity of breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms. Scores were assessed at Baseline, Week 1-4, Week 5-8, Week 9-12, Week 13-16, Week 17-20 and at Week 21-24. Daily EXACT total score is obtained as total score of 14 items from diary. Daily E-RS total score as 11 items and Daily E-RS subscale scores are subset of E-RS total score.
Mean EXACT total score is mean value of daily EXACT total score within subject by every 4 weeks(Week1-4, Week5-8, Week9-12, Week13-16, Week17-20, Week21-24). Same calculation of mean values are applied to E-RS total and E-RS subscale scores. Scores range from 0-100, high value in score indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Participants were assessed for COPD symptoms by means of CAT at each Visit. This assessment was performed prior to the spirometry testing. A CAT total score of less than 10 represents best health status and greater than 15 represents worst health status. Scores were assessed at Visit 1 (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8), Visit 5 (Week 8), Visit 6 (Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 16), and Visit 8 (Week 24). Scores range from 0 to 40, high value in score indicate worse outcome.</description>

        <description>FEV1 is defined as the volume of air forcefully expelled from the lungs in one second. At Screening (Visit 1) spirometric assessments were conducted before (Visit 1A) and 30 to 60 minutes after a bronchodilator challenge (400 µg of salbutamol) (Visit 1B). FEV1 during each visit are presented. FEV1 was assessed at Visit 1A (Screening), Visit 1B (Screening), Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8), Visit 5 (Week 8), Visit 6 (Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 16), and Visit 8 (Week 24).</description>

          <title>Number of Participants in Each Treatment Efficacy Grade Evaluated by Participants</title>
          <description>Participants evaluated treatment efficacy by using the following grades: significantly improved (SII), moderately improved (MOI), mildly improved (MII), no change (NC), mildly worse (MIW), moderately worse (MOW), and significantly worse (SIW). Treatment efficacy was assessed at Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8), Visit 5 (Week 8), Visit 6 (Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 16), and Visit 8 (Week 24).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants in Each Treatment Efficacy Grade Evaluated by Physician</title>
        <description>Physician evaluated treatment efficacy by using the following grades: significantly improved (SII), moderately improved (MOI), mildly improved (MII), no change (NC), mildly worse (MIW), moderately worse (MOW), and significantly worse (SIW). Treatment efficacy was assessed at Visit 3 (Week 4), Visit 4 (Week 8), Visit 5 (Week 8), Visit 6 (Week 12), Visit 7 (Week 16), and Visit 8 (Week 24).</description>
