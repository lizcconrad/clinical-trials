      Background: Studies regarding the effects of high protein (HP) diet on cardiovascular (CVD)
      risk factors have reported contradictory results.

      Objective: In present study, we aimed to determine the effects of HP diet on CVD risk factors
      and hs-CRP among overweight and obese women.

      Design: In this randomized controlled trial, we recruited 60 overweight and obese women, aged
      20-65 years into HP or control energy restricted diets for three months (protein,
      carbohydrate, fat: 25%, 45%, 30% vs. 15%, 55%, 30%, respectively). Total protein amount,
      divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed (half/half)
      between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, hs-CRP, lipid profile, systolic and
      diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the standard
      guidelines.
