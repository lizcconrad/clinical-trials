  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferential current has shown promising results for treating psoriasis with a good
      tolerance. Prospective randomized studies versus placebo are required to confirm the interest
      of such an approach.

      The Main objective is to assess the efficacy of interferential current for treating
      palmoplantar psoriasis.

      Secondary objectives is to assess the subjective efficacy by the patients, the efficacy on
      the nails, to study the potential side effects.

      Interferential current has shown promising results for treating psoriasis with a good
      tolerance. Prospective randomized studies versus placebo are required to confirm the interest
      of such an approach.

      Main objective To assess the efficacy of interferential current for treating palmoplantar
      psoriasis.

      Secondary objectives To assess the subjective efficacy by the patients, the efficacy on the
      nails, to study the potential side effects.

      Patients Patients from 18 to 90 year-old with psoriasis on the hands and/or feet. Length of
      the study: 12 months Methods Monocentric randomized comparative study versus
      placebo.Intervention V0 : Selection: Information of the patient, control of inclusion and non
      inclusion criteria.

      V1 : Control of inclusion and non inclusion criteria (treatment against psoriasis have to be
      discontinued for at least 3 weeks and 3 months for anti-IL12/23). Clinical scores and
      photographs. Explanation of the functioning of the device, then the treatment is followed at
      home, twice a day 5 minutes. 10% salicylic acid ointment will be applied after each session.

      V2 : End of the treatment (12 weeks after V1). Clinical scores and photographs. V3 : End of
      the follow-up (24 weeks after V1). Clinical scores and photographs.
