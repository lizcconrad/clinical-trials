    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gather clinical and economic evidence on the use of robotics
      for bariatric surgery (gastric bypass).

      This monocentric, randomized, single blind, controlled study will evaluate post-operative
      pain, quality of life and appetite, post-operative complication incidence. It will also
      provide information on direct and indirect costs of surgery.

      Robot-assisted Surgery Versus Conventional Laparoscopy in Bariatric Surgery (Gastric Bypass):
      a prospective, single-blind, randomized, non-inferiority, and controlled study The main
      evaluation criterion is 24h post-operative pain assessed using visual analog scale (VAS).
      Secondary criteria included for clinical assessment: post 24h pain, excess weight loss,
      quality of life, appetite, complications, conversion rate; and for health-economics
      assessment : duration of surgical steps, length of stay, return to normal activity and their
      conversion to cost, consumables, estimation of indirect costs and benefits (e.g., robotics
      perception, publication).

      In this study, main inclusion criteria include major obesity (IMC ≥ 35) with co-morbidities
      or morbid obesity (IMC ≥ 40), scheduled gastric bypass surgery Main contraindications are
      previous bariatric surgery and previous major abdominal surgeries To test robotic-assisted
      surgery non-inferiority on VAS pain score 24h post-surgery, a total of 128 patients (64 per
      arm) is to be included (alpha 2,5%; power 90%; drop-out rate: 5%).

      The study will include 12 months of follow-up post-surgery for each patient. The total study
      duration is 2 years and 3 months.
