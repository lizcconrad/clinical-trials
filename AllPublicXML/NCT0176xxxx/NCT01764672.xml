  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to use graph theory to examine how the organization of the
      functional brain network may be altered by the administration of methylphenidate. This effect
      is to be compared between methylphenidate intake and placebo intake, as well as between
      healthy adult males and adult males with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
      Disorder.

    <description>The primary objective in the current trial is to use graph theory to examine how the organization of the functional brain network may be altered by the administration of methylphenidate. The main question we intend to answer in this study, is whether, and if so to what extent, methylphenidate affects the organization of brain networks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The difference in functional connectivity as measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging between participants with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and healthy controls.</measure>
    <time_frame>After the last patient has completed the last visit, which is expected to be two years after the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>To examine if any of the effects on brain connectivity differ between participants with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder versus healthy controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation of graph metrics (as a measure of functional network organization) with performance (scores) on cognitive tasks and blood levels of methylphenidate.</measure>
    <time_frame>After the last patient has completed the last visit, which is expected to be two years after the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>To examine how a reorganization of brain networks as described in the primary objective is related to improvements in cognitive performance and to blood levels of methylphenidate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The correlation of whole brain cortical thickness and white matter volume as measured with Magnetic Resonance Imaging with both graph metrics as measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and scores on cognitive tests.</measure>
    <time_frame>After the last patient has completed the last visit, which is expected to be two years after the start of the study</time_frame>
    <description>To examine if certain network structures of the brain, such as cortical thickness and white matter volume, are related to susceptibility to medication efficacy and if the structural qualities are related to cognitive performance.</description>
