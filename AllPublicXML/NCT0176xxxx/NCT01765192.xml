      This study will evaluate the effect of roflumilast 500 μg once daily (QD) plus montelukast 10
      mg QD versus 10 mg montelukast QD alone on predose (trough) prebronchodilator forced
      expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested to
      treat people who have asthma. This study will look at lung function and asthma symptoms of
      people who take roflumilast in combination with montelukast.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second of a forced exhalation. FEV1 will be measured using spirometry in accordance with the American Thoracic Society / European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) consensus guidelines. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline FEV1 measurement as the covariate was used for analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>FVC is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC will be measured using spirometry in accordance with ATS/ERS consensus guidelines. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline FVC measurement as the covariate was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-Dose (Trough) Pre-Bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) 25-75%</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>FEF is a measure of how much air can be exhaled from the lungs. It is an indicator of obstruction of the smaller airways. FEF25-75% is the mid-flow rate or forced expiratory flow occurring in the middle 50% of the patient's exhaled volume, and will be measured using spirometry in accordance with ATS/ERS consensus guidelines. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline FEF measurement as the covariate was used for analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pre-Dose (Trough) Pre-Bronchodilator Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is a person's maximum speed of expiration. It measures the airflow through the bronchi and thus the degree of obstruction in the airways. PEF will be measured using spirometry in accordance with ATS/ERS consensus guidelines. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline PEF measurement as the covariate was used for analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>PEF will be measured at home using portable electronic peak flow meter. The participant will record PEF daily in the morning immediately after getting up. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline PEF measurement as the covariate was used for analysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daytime Asthma Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will assess their daily day-time asthma symptoms according to the following scale: 0: Very well, no symptoms. 1: One episode of wheezing, cough or breathlessness. 2: More than one episode of wheezing, cough or breathlessness without interfering with normal activities. 3: Wheezing, cough or short of breath most of the day which interfered to some extent with normal activities. 4: Asthma very bad. Unable to carry out daily activities as usual. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline Daytime Asthma Symptoms measurement as the covariate was used for analysis. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Nighttime Asthma Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Days 1 and 56) and after 4 weeks of treatment (Days 28 and 84)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will assess their daily night-time asthma symptoms according to the following scale: 0: No symptoms, slept through the night. 1: Slept well but some complaints in the morning. 2: Woke up once because of asthma (inclusive early awakening). 3: Woke up several times because of asthma (inclusive early awakening). 4: Bad night, awake most of the night because of asthma. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline Nighttime Asthma Symptoms measurement as the covariate was used for analysis. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Daytime Asthma Symptoms</title>
        <description>Patients will assess their daily day-time asthma symptoms according to the following scale: 0: Very well, no symptoms. 1: One episode of wheezing, cough or breathlessness. 2: More than one episode of wheezing, cough or breathlessness without interfering with normal activities. 3: Wheezing, cough or short of breath most of the day which interfered to some extent with normal activities. 4: Asthma very bad. Unable to carry out daily activities as usual. An ANCOVA model with treatment sequence, treatment period, and study treatment as fixed factors with Baseline Daytime Asthma Symptoms measurement as the covariate was used for analysis. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>
