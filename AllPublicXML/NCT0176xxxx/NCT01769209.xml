  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well giving bortezomib together with combination chemotherapy
      works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
      Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of bortezomib in combination with a chemotherapy backbone of
      doxorubicin (doxorubicin hydrochloride), vincristine (vincristine sulfate), PEG-asparaginase
      (pegaspargase), and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression free survival. II. Estimate the rate of complete response (CR) and
      CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) after this re-induction compared to a historical
      baseline.

      III. Estimate failure-free survival (FFS) and survival percent at 1 year compared to a
      historical baseline.

      IV. Assess safety and tolerability of the study drug. V. Determine whether bortezomib induces
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) in circulating acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blast cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; doxorubicin
      hydrochloride intravenously (IV) on day 1; pegaspargase IV or intramuscularly (IM) on days 5
      and 22; vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) daily on
      days 1-14; cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1 and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on day
      15. Patients with central nervous system disease receive intrathecal treatment per
      investigator's discretion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          -  Female subjects who:

               -  Are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening visit, OR

                  form through 30 days after the last dose of bortezomib, or agree to completely
                  abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  Male subjects, even if surgically sterilized (i.e., status post vasectomy) who:

               -  Agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire study
                  treatment period and through a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of study
                  drug, OR

               -  Agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  • The patient has relapsed or refractory B or T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that

             clinical study

          -  Diagnosed or treated for another malignancy within 2 years of enrollment, with the
             exception of complete resection of basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of
             the skin, an in situ malignancy, or low-risk prostate cancer after curative therapy

          -  Participation in clinical trials with other investigational agents not included in
             this trial throughout the duration of this trial

          -  Radiation therapy within 3 weeks before randomization; enrollment of subjects who
             require concurrent radiotherapy (which must be localized in its field size) should be
             deferred until the radiotherapy is completed and 3 weeks have elapsed since the last
             date of therapy
