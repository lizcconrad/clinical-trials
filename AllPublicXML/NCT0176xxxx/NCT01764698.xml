  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent among those with substance use disorders, but the
      majority of addictions treatment centers provide little to no evidence-based treatment for
      anxiety disorders. Furthermore, tension reduction models suggest that treating anxiety should
      also improve substance use outcomes. This study is aimed at improving symptoms for people who
      have substance use and anxiety problems. The study is comparing regular Intensive Outpatient
      treatment for addiction to Intensive Outpatient treatment for addiction plus treatment for
      anxiety disorders. Clinicians at a community addictions clinic will participate by receiving
      training in delivering cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders and will deliver
      the treatment to the patient participants. They will also complete some questionnaires.
      Patient participants will be asked to complete a baseline assessment. Those who are eligible
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. Those who are assigned to
      addiction treatment as usual will continue their regular care at the Matrix Institute.
      Participants who are assigned to also receive the anxiety treatment will be asked to
      participate in 6, 90-min treatment sessions and an orientation session. All participants will
      be asked to complete post-treatment and follow-up assessments. The assessments should take
      approximately 1 hour, and the follow-up assessment will be completed 6 months after treatment
      is over. It is hypothesized that those who get the additional anxiety disorder treatment will
      show greater improvement in anxiety and substance use outcomes than those who get Intensive
      Outpatient Program without the anxiety disorder treatment.
