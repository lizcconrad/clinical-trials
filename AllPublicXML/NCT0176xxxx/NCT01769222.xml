    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best of dose ipilimumab when given
      together with local radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with
      recurrent melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as ipilimumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Radiation therapy uses high energy x rays to kill cancer
      cells. Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together with radiation therapy may be an effective
      treatment for melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon, or rectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1. To assess the safety of combining intratumoral anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated
      protein 4 (CTLA4) immunotherapy with local radiation therapy in patients with melanoma,
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and colorectal carcinoma with a monotherapy ipilimumab safety lead-in.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To assess the induction of an anti-tumor immune responses using laboratory correlative
           studies.

        2. To determine tumor response rates and duration of response at unirradiated tumor sites
           in patients with advanced malignancies.

        3. To identify putative immunologic biomarkers of tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of ipilimumab, followed by a phase 2 study.
      Only a few subjects participated in the phase 1 portion of this study. The phase 2 portion of
      this study was not conducted.

      Patients receive ipilimumab intratumorally on day 1 and undergo local radiation therapy
      within 48 hours for at least 3 fractions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 and 8 weeks, and then
      every 24 weeks for 5 years.

             stopped; sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during
             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized; before
             study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy during
             study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional pregnancy; all
