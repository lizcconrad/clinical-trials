  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing demands of patients concerning refractive outcome after cataract surgery,
      toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) that correct corneal astigmatism have been introduced more
      widely to cataract surgery. Originally toric IOLs were used mainly for patients with high
      degrees of astigmatism, especially after corneal surgical procedures such as penetrating
      keratoplasty. Since a couple of years, toric IOLs are available from numerous manufacturers
      to correct lower amounts of astigmatism which are much more prevalent with about 30% having a
      corneal astigmatism of 0.75D or more in the cataract population. This should result in less
      spectacle dependence of patients due to the astigmatic correction.

      The alternative method to reduce corneal astigmatism as part of cataract surgery is to make
      incisions on the steeper axis of the cornea such as limbal relaxing incisions or an
      additional clear corneal incision opposite (OCCI) to the main cataract opening. These
      techniques are in use since more than 2 decades and are widely used in clinical routine. As
      with toric IOLs, precise alignment of the cuts with the axis of astigmatism is essential. The
      disadvantage of the incisional techniques is the variability of the effect between patients
      since it depends on factors such as the extent of scaring of the cuts after surgery as well
      as corneal thickness. The main advantage is the simplicity of the technique and the lower
      cost.

      Aim of this study is to compare toric IOL implantation and opposite clear corneal incision
      during cataract surgery to correct corneal astigmatism.
