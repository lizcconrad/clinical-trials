    <textblock>
      Multi-center, non-randomized, open-label, single-dose, parallel group study to determine the
      effect of impaired hepatic function on the PK of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide
      metabolite following a single oral dose of 33mg/kg Ferriprox®.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-marketing study to evaluate the effect of impaired hepatic function on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of deferiprone and its 3-O-glucuronide metabolite and on the safety of
      Ferriprox® in subjects with mild and moderate hepatic impairment as compared to healthy
      volunteers.

    <time_frame>24-hour interval</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative amount of deferiprone and deferiprone 3-O-glucuronide excreted in the urine. Urine samples were collected at the intervals of -2 to 0 hours pre-dose, and 0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-12 ,and 12- 24 hours post-dose.
Note: For unknown reasons, the urine samples for one subject in the moderate hepatic failure group had low or zero volume and there were no measurable levels of deferiprone or its metabolite in any of the samples. Accordingly, the urine PK results were derived both with and without this subject's data, and are here presented without them (i.e., N=6 rather than 7).</description>

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          1. For subjects with hepatic impairment, fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic

             pulmonary, hepatic (except for subjects assigned to one of the hepatically impaired
             groups), renal, hematologic, gastrointestinal, endocrine (except for subjects with
             hepatic impairment with clinically stable and treated diabetes, hypertension and
             thyroid disorders), immunologic, dermatologic, neurologic, or psychiatric disease;

          4. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract which may interfere with drug
             absorption or may otherwise influence the PK of the investigational medicinal product
             (e.g. resections of the small or large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic
             diarrhea, chronic vomiting, clinically unstable endocrine disease, severe infections,
             acute inflammations, etc.);

          5. Received a pharmacological agent in another clinical trial within 28 days prior to the
             first dose of the study;
