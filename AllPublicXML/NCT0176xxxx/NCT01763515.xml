      Knee osteoarthritis is a common problem with the disease prevalence increasing with advancing
      age. This study will be performed in the purpose of determination the effects of laterally

    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis is a common problem with the disease prevalence increasing with advancing
      age. Because of the high incidence of knee osteoarthritis in the elderly and the seriousness
      of drug effects in this age group and lack of controlled study in our country regarding the
      possible benefits or lack of benefit of laterally wedged insoles in patients with knee
      osteoarthritis and also due to strike, and results of mixed in other studies, this study will
      be performed in the purpose of determination the effects of laterally wedged insoles on
      symptoms reduction of patients with knee osteoarthritis.
