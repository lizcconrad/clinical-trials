    <measure>Assess the Sensitivity and Specificity of [124I]FIAU PET-CT Scanning in Detecting Osteomyelitis as Determined by Bone Biopsy in Patients With Diabetic Foot Infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 hours</time_frame>
    <description>A bone biopsy was obtained through a noninfected area and submitted for histology and microbiologic culture. Cultures were also to be obtained by biopsy after debridement of the ulcer from a clean base. Subjects were dosed with [124I]FIAU. PET-CT scanning were performed. All PET, PET-CT, and CT images, both attenuation corrected and uncorrected, were to be evaluated centrally and independently. Results from the bone biopsies were not available to the central reader of the PET-CT images. The sensitivity and specificity of [124I]FIAU PET-CT scanning in detecting osteomyelitis was determined based on its correlation with bone biopsy, the truth standard.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients &gt;/= 18 years on the day of signing consent.

          2. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type I or II, as evidenced either by HbA1c&gt;6.5% or
             receipt of antidiabetic medication at time of enrollment.

          4. An inframalleolar ulcer of perfusion, extent/size, depth/tissue loss, infection and
             sensation (PEDIS) grade 2 or 3. At the discretion of the Investigator, patients with
             PEDIS grade 4 infections may be included if they are sufficiently stable.

             preclude the time needed for PET-CT scanning, or clinical instability that precludes
             PET-CT scanning.

          3. History of an inherited mitochondrial disorder (eg. Leber's hereditary neuropathy,
             neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and ptosis [NARP], myoneurogenic
             gastrointestinal encephalopathy [MNGIE], myocolonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers
             [MERFF] and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like
             syndrome [MELAS])

        <description>A bone biopsy was obtained through a noninfected area and submitted for histology and microbiologic culture. Cultures were also to be obtained by biopsy after debridement of the ulcer from a clean base. Subjects were dosed with [124I]FIAU. PET-CT scanning were performed. All PET, PET-CT, and CT images, both attenuation corrected and uncorrected, were to be evaluated centrally and independently. Results from the bone biopsies were not available to the central reader of the PET-CT images. The sensitivity and specificity of [124I]FIAU PET-CT scanning in detecting osteomyelitis was determined based on its correlation with bone biopsy, the truth standard.</description>
