  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to pediatric rehabilitation services have often cognitive
      deficits/intellectual disabilities.Neurocognitive assessment is, hence, important when
      designing treatment plans.

      Children and adolescents with cognitive deficits and intellectual disabilities (ID) have a
      high risk of developing mental health problems. There is lack of knowledge about such
      comorbid mental disorders in the health service. There are also few validated instruments for
      assessing mental disorders among children and adolescents with cognitive deficits and ID both
      in Norway and abroad.

      The main aims of the current multicentre study are to:

      Investigate psychometric properties of different psychiatric instruments for children and
      adolescents. Investigate change and stability of symptoms over time. Investigate user
      satisfaction. The study will include Pediatric Rehabilitation Services at hospitals in
      Tromsø, Hammerfest and Bodø and will include in total 320 patients aged 4 to 18. We will use
      information from parents, teachers and patients, in addition to clinician-rated measures.
      Patients will be assessed at intake and after six months. We have conducted a pilot study in
      the period from 2012 to 2013.

      1. Investigate psychometric properties of a structured psychiatric interview

           (DAWBA) and a symptom measure (SDQ) in clinical samples of children and

           adolescents with cognitive deficits and intellectual disabilities. We will

           investigate the instruments' reliability and convergent validity with the

           Aberrant Behavior checklist (ABC), the DBC and the Social Responsiveness

           Scale (SRS), in addition to the clinician-rated severity of children's mental

           health problems measured with the CGAS and HoNOSCA.

        2. The psychiatric instruments will be administrated at intake and after six

           months. We will investigate prevalence rates and indicators of disorder

           severity (comorbidity and persistence), including risk factors (socioeconomic

           status, parenting styles).

        3. Investigate user satisfaction with the health service, i.e., the Pediatric

      Rehabilitation Services.
