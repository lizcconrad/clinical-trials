      The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy, carbidopa dose response and
      safety of ODM-101, a new combination of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone in the treatment
      of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, crossover, multicentre,
      phase II proof of concept study in patients with PD and end-of-dose motor fluctuations. The
      patient's individually optimised daily levodopa regimen must be kept stable for at least 2
      weeks before randomisation. The patients will be randomised to receive ODM-101 with 65 mg of
      carbidopa, ODM-101 with 105 mg of carbidopa and Stalevo® according to a 3-period crossover
      design.

      The study consists of a screening period, 3 treatment periods and a post-treatment period.
      For each patient,there will be 9 visits: a screening visit performed 7-28 days before
      randomisation, a randomisation visit (visit 1), 6 visits during the 3 treatment periods (i.e.
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks after randomisation and the start of the study treatment; visits
      2-7), and an end-of-study visit 7-21 days after the last visit of the last treatment period.
      The duration of study will be 14-23 weeks for each patient.

      The patients switch to study drugs after all assessments have been done at visit 1. The
      strength of the levodopa in the study drug is determined by the patient's individually
      optimised levodopa regimen before randomisation. During the first 2 weeks of each treatment
      period, the patient's levodopa strength (but not frequency) in the study drug will be
      adjusted as necessary by the investigator. For the remaining 2 weeks of each treatment
      period, the levodopa strengths should be kept stable.

      Unscheduled visits maybe performed during the first 2 weeks of each treatment period, if
      there is a need to adjust the levodopa strength. In case the patient has not contacted the
      study centre within a week after the start of the treatment period, the study personnel will
      phone the patient to ensure that the symptoms and possible adverse events (AEs) are
      sufficiently controlled and captured, and to assess the need to adjust the levodopa
      treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          -  Male or female patients with idiopathic PD according to the United Kingdom brain bank
             criteria with end-of-dose -motor fluctuations.

             daily levodopa dose in the range of 400-1400 mg. One evening dose of
             controlled-release formulation of levodopa/DDCI is allowed providing that it is
             included in the total daily levodopa dose in the range of 400-1400 mg mentioned above.
             Use of additional soluble levodopa formulations as rescue treatment, such as Madopar
             LT or Quick, up to a maximum of 4 doses per week is allowed; however, its use should
             be avoided on days during which PD status (diary) is recorded. The levodopa dose from

             antipsychotic drugs, 1 evening dose of an atypical antipsychotic is allowed.

          -  Severe dyskinesias as judged by the investigator; however, mild to moderate dyskinesia
             not significantly affecting patient's activities of daily living is allowed.
