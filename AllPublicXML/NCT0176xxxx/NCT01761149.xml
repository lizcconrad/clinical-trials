  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extensive clinical studies have shown that intraoperative infusion high dose of remifentanil
      (0.2ug/kg/min) induced postoperative hyperalgesia. Recent experimental study however suggests
      that higher dose of remifentanil may attenuate postoperative hyperalgesia. Thus, the present
      study is designed as a &quot;proof of principle&quot; study and hypothesizes that higher dose of
      remifentanil may reduce postoperative pain in patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remifentanil, an ultra-short acting opioid, is widely used in the patients undergoing
      surgery. However, extensive studies report that remifentanil,administered at 0.2ug/kg/min or
      0.4ug/kg/min intraoperatively, can result in postoperative hyperalgesia and increase the
      consumption of analgesics when compared with low dose (0.05ug/kg/min). However, a recent
      experimental study shows that large dose of remifentanil can inhibit pain hypersensitivity
      through erasing the spinal sensitization of pain. The present study thus hypothesizes that
      higher dose of remifentanil (1.2ug/kg/min) may attenuate postoperative pain. The present
      study will compare the effect of two different dose of remifentanil (0.2ug/kg/min and
      1.2ug/kg/min) on postoperative pain. Patients undergoing thyroidectomy will be recruited, and
      mechanical threshold will be measured in the remote region of surgical site preoperatively.
      The patients will be randomly divided by two groups, 0.2ug/kg/min (group I) and 1.2ug/kg/min
      (group II). After operation, mechanical threshold and visual analogue scale (VAS) will be
      measured as the indicators of postoperative pain. The consumption of morphine will also be
      compared between these two doses of remifentanil.

      The present study may find optimized dose of opioid usage in the patients undergoing surgery
      to relieve the postoperative pain.

    <description>Quantitative sensory threshold in the remote uninjured site (here, the inner forearm) is commonly used to examine the occurrence of postoperative hyperalgesia. The present study will examine the mechanical threshold in two different doses of remifentanil to determine whether high dose of remifentanil induces hyperalgesia</description>

    <description>VAS is widely used to assess postoperative pain. It will be divided as 10 points. Zero refers to no pain and ten refers to extremely pain. Based on this way, we can know the difference of postoperative pain in these two different groups.</description>
