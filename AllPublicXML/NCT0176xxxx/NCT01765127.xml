  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This post-marketing Modified Prescription-Event Monitoring (M-PEM) safety study of asenapine
      (SYCRESTÂ®) is to be carried out by the Drug Safety Research Unit (DSRU) as part of the Risk
      Management Plan required by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to
      further investigate the safety profile of asenapine in clinical practice. The aim of this
      study is to proactively capture safety and drug utilisation data in the post-marketing phase
      of license approval of asenapine as prescribed to patients by general practitioners (GPs) in
      England. This data is obtained through the completion of questionnaires by GPs.

          -  Patients for whom a study questionnaire containing useful information has been
             returned, will be included in the study cohort regardless of the dose or frequency of
             administration of asenapine, and irrespective of whether any medicines are
             concurrently administered.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patient no longer registered with the practice

          -  patient for whom no information is provided on study questionnaire

          -  patients for whom the index date is an improbable date (i.e. before market launch
             date)

          -  patients for whom the GP reports that the patient did not take or was never prescribed
             asenapine
