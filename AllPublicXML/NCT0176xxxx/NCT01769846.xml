  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in intensive care and mechanical ventilation (MV) in the past two decades have
      increased critically ill patient survival. However, some patients require prolonged MV (PMV)
      and are deconditioned due to respiratory insufficiency caused by underlying disease, adverse
      effects of medications, and prolonged immobilization. Patients in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) are often confined to their beds, which results in inactivity, immobility, and severe
      osteomyoarticular system dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that an early mobilization protocol
      improves muscle thickness (MT) of the quadriceps femoris, peripheral muscle strength,
      perceived functional status, gait speed, quality of life, duration of mechanical ventilation,
      ICU length of stay of the critically ill patient.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of implementation an early mobilization
      protocol in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of
      Santa Maria.

    <description>Early Mobilization protocol: Patients in the treatment group additionally received a progressive cycling exercise session 7 days a week, until the last day of ICU stay, using a bedside cycle ergometer (MOTOmed Letto 2, RECK-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Betzenweiler, Germany). Cycling exercise will be realized during 30 consecutive minutes, initially in continuos and passive (classified patients with RASS - 4) exercise, at a fixed pedaling rate of 20 cycles/min and after in actively (classified patients with RASS 0), with an exercise intensity of 3-5 on the Borg rate of perceived exertion scale.</description>

    <description>Group will undergo usual mobilization per standard ICU care. Conventional physical and respiratory therapy were provided by the ICU physical therapists twice daily, for approximately 30 min, 7 days per week. The protocol included vibrocompression maneuvers; lung hyperinflation by the mechanical ventilator; and tracheal aspiration, when necessary; as well as passive and active-assisted motor exercises for arms and legs, depending on the clinical course of patients.</description>

    <description>Patients in the treatment group additionally received a cycling exercise session 7 days a week, using a bedside cycle ergometer (MOTOmed Letto 2, RECK-Technik GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Betzenweiler, Germany). The device offers the possibility to conduct passive or active cycling at six levels of increasing resistance. The aim of each session was to have the patient cycle for 30 mins at an individually adjusted intensity level. Patients were placed in a comfortable position in between the supine and the semirecumbent position.</description>
