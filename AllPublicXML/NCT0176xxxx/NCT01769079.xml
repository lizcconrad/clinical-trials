  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic treatment of stable angina with nitrates long and short action is extremely frequent.
      In clinical practice the most commonly observed is a combination of anti-anginal agents,
      usually including nitrates fixed in an attempt to improve the quality of life of patients,
      which is not always met with success.

      Numerous questions and problems are seen with chronic use of oral nitrates. From a practical
      standpoint, some advocate the withdrawal of medication in stable patients, while many
      physicians still hesitate to withdraw the medication by the lack of definitive information
      about its consequences. In this sense there is a rationale for the attempted removal of
      nitrate fixed these patients, although evidence to support this action have not been
      adequately evaluated.

      The Ischemic Heart Disease remains in recent years as a major cause of mortality in most of
      the world, and also the disease that consumes more resources in health in industrialized
      countries. The use of fixed nitrate in patients with stable angina is quite common, but there
      is a scarcity of studies showing the need for this medication in this class pacientes.Este
      study aims to evaluate the consequences of the withdrawal of fixed nitrate in patients with
      stable angina class I and II, hemodynamically stable for the past six months, as the
      frequency and duration of episodes of angina, silent ischemia and functional capacity by
      exercise testing, 24-hour Holter and measurement of quality of life and adherence to therapy.
      For this purpose, a randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial was designed to placebo
      (intervention group) X nitrate (control group) in a follow-up period for 4 months. Both
      groups will receive three evaluations (baseline, 30 days and 120 days) during follow-up.
