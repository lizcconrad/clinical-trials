          -  Skeletally mature males or females, aged 21 to 65 years old, inclusive.

          -  Single, or adjacent, 2-level degenerative disc disease at C3-C7, inclusive.

          -  Subject is a surgical candidate for an anterior approach to the cervical spine.

          -  Minimum of 6 weeks of unsuccessful conservative treatment.

          -  Subject with at least moderate preoperative pain and functional impairment

          -  Subject is mentally and physically able to comply with protocol, postoperative
             compliance instructions, and follow-up schedule through 2-years.

          -  Subject must understand and sign the written Informed Consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with axial neck pain only who does not demonstrate concurrent arm pain or
             progressive neurological deterioration (specifically numbness or muscle weakness in
             the arm).

          -  An active infection at the operative site or active systemic infection at the time of
             surgery.

          -  Known or suspected allergy to titanium, polyurethane, cobalt, chromium, molybdenum or
             silicone.

          -  Previous spinal fusion at the involved, or adjacent, cervical level(s).

          -  Congenital or acquired structural defect at the operative levels (s) or their
             immediately adjacent level(s).

          -  Significant osteoporosis in the cervical spine.

          -  The investigator should assess if the subject has any of the following conditions at
             the index or adjacent level(s) which excludes the subject from study participation:

          -  Cervical facet degeneration of the involved C3-C7 levels.

          -  Previous trauma to, or fusion in, the C3-C7 levels.

          -  Cervical instability at the index level(s) on neutral lateral or flexion/extension
             x-rays.

          -  Radiographic findings of a fused or total collapsed disc.
