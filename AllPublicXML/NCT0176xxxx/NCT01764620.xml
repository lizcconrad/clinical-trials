  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of muscle fatigue in the scapular
      kinematics of overhead athletes with and without using a kinesio taping technique for
      facilitating lower trapezius function. The hypothesis is that the taping technique could
      compensate for the negative effects caused by muscle fatigue in the scapular kinematics of
      healthy overhead athletes.

    <textblock>
      Muscle fatigue is a potential cause of shoulder injuries in overhead athletes. Considering
      the important role of lower trapezius for functional scapular stability, it is suggested that
      a kinesio taping technique for facilitating its function could compensate for the negative
      effects of muscle fatigue on scapular kinematics. This is a randomized crossover study and
      all included athletes will be evaluated in three sessions, with a period of seven days
      between them: Control (fatigue protocol, without taping), Kinesio Taping (fatigue protocol
      with elastic taping applied with tension) and Sham (fatigue protocol with taping applied
      without tension). During each session, tridimensional kinematics of scapula and humerus and
      electromyography of serratus anterior and trapezius (upper and lower portions) muscles of
      dominant shoulder will be evaluated, during scaption and throwing movements, immediately
      before and immediately after the fatigue protocol.The changes in scapular movements (before
      versus after the fatigue protocol) will be compared among the sessions.

    <description>Electromyographic median frequency will be measured from upper and lower trapezius and serratus anterior muscles in order to determine muscle fatigue development and if the changes depending on the intervention used. These assessments will be performed in two moments (an average of 3 minutes before and an average of 3 minutes after the fatigue protocol) in each one of the 3 sessions(with an interval of 7 days between them). In each session the athletes will perform the fatigue protocol using either a kinesio taping application, or a sham application or without using any taping, in random order.The changes in each session (before and after fatigue) will be compared among the sessions (without taping, with kinesio taping application and sham).</description>
