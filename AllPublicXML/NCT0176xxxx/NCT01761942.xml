      in treating anorexia nervosa.

      10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy and
      safety of omega-3 fatty acids with placebo in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. Patients
      will be randomly assigned to blinded study treatment. Double-blind treatment will be preceded
      by a medication washout period of 1-28 days if necessary. Some patients may be taking
      anti-depressants or anti-psychotics, e.g. fluoxetine, prior to admission to the study. In
      such case the wash out period will depend on the medical treatment (dependent on the drug
      given) given prior to qualification to the study. Patient will be treated as inpatients
      during 10 weeks of the study. The study will recruit female inpatients with anorexia nervosa
      (aged 12 to 19 years), with DSM-IV and ICD-10 diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.BMI below 5
      percentile and EAT-26 score &gt; 30 is required at both screening and randomization.
