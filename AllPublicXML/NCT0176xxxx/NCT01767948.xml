  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (how the drug concentrations
      change over time) of PCI 32765 in participants with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic
      impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-dose,
      multi-center (study conducted at multiple sites), non-randomized study to access the
      pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in participants who either have mild, moderate, or severe
      hepatic impairment or qualify for the control group (normal liver function). The study mainly
      consists of 3 phases: screening phase (within 21 days prior to the first dose of study
      medication), treatment phase, and a follow up phase (10 to 12 days after the last dose of
      study medication). In the treatment phase, participants will receive single oral dose of
      PCI-32765 on Day 1. Liver impairment will be classified according to the Child-Pugh
      Classification of Severity of Liver Disease, as: normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Total 30
      participants (24 with hepatic impairment [6 mild, 9 moderate and 9 severe] at baseline and 6
      in the control group according to Child-Pugh criteria) will be enrolled. Participants in the
      control group will be enrolled after the participants with mild or moderate hepatic
      impairment have completed the study. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of study for each participant will be approximately
      for 29 to 33 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Stable hepatic function as confirmed by the serum bilirubin and transaminase levels
             measured during screening and those measured within 48 hours prior to PCI-32765
             administration
