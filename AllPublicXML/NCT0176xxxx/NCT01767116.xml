      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and antiviral activity of
      ABT-450/ritonavir/ABT-267 (ABT-450/r/ABT-267; ABT-450 also known as paritaprevir; ABT-267
      also known as ombitasvir) and ABT-333 (also known as dasabuvir) with and without ribavirin
      (RBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1b (HCV GT1b) infection without
      cirrhosis.

    <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.
The primary efficacy endpoints were noninferiority of the percentage of participants who achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment in each treatment arm (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus either placebo RBV or RBV) compared with the historical control rate for noncirrhotic, treatment-naïve participants with HCV GT1b infection treated with telaprevir and peginterferon/RBV (pegIFN).</description>

    <description>Virologic failure during treatment was defined as rebound (confirmed HCV RNA greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation [≥ LLOQ] after HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ during treatment, or confirmed increase from the lowest value post baseline in HCV RNA [2 consecutive HCV RNA measurements &gt; 1 log10 IU/mL above the lowest value post baseline] at any time point during treatment), or failure to suppress (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ persistently during treatment with at least 6 weeks [≥ 36 days] of treatment).</description>

        <description>The percentage of participants with sustained virologic response (plasma Hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid [HCV RNA] level less than the lower limit of quantitation [&lt; LLOQ]) 12 weeks after the last dose of study drug. The LLOQ for the assay was 25 IU/mL.
The primary efficacy endpoints were noninferiority of the percentage of participants who achieved sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment in each treatment arm (ABT-450/r/ABT-267 and ABT-333, plus either placebo RBV or RBV) compared with the historical control rate for noncirrhotic, treatment-naïve participants with HCV GT1b infection treated with telaprevir and peginterferon/RBV (pegIFN).</description>
