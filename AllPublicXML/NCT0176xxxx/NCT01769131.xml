      An Allis clamp causes less pain and bleeding than a single tooth tenaculum when used for
      mobilization of the cervix during common gynecologic office procedures.

      The primary object is to determine the presence of a difference in pain perception between
      the two instruments.

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the differences in the frequency of bleeding, that
      requires treatment, after removal of the instrument and the need to use an alternative
      instruments.
