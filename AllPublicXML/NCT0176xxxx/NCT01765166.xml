    <textblock>
      This Competing Renewal project continues the research and development of a parent-focused
      intervention, Parent Guide to SSGRIN, which parallels an established child-focused
      intervention [Social Skills GRoup INtervention (S.S. GRIN); for children ages 8-12 years], in
      order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home environment.
      A primary goal is to address questions of relative impact, longer-term treatment benefits,
      and differential treatment effects of the Parent Guide training on children's social skill
      development across settings and populations.

      This Competing Renewal project continues the research and development of a parent-focused
      intervention, Parent Guide to SSGRIN, which parallels an established child-focused
      intervention [Social Skills GRoup INtervention (S.S. GRIN); for children ages 8-12 years], in
      order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home environment.
      A primary goal of this Competing Renewal is to conduct a rigorous, large-scale, longitudinal
      research project that is adequately powered to address questions of relative impact,
      longer-term treatment benefits, and differential treatment effects of the Parent Guide
      training on children's social skill development across settings and populations. Though
      schools often struggle with how to increase parent involvement in school-based programs,
      school officials report that it is infeasible for them to conduct the full series of
      in-person parent training groups as the Parent Guide's current curriculum demands; therefore,
      a second goal of this Competing Renewal is to test a Home-study version of the Parent Guide
      to bridge training into the home environment. The Home-study version of the Parent Guide will
      be included as a separate treatment condition within the effectiveness trial. This clinical
      trial will provide S.S.GRIN treatment for 240 children ages 8-12 and vary the level of parent
      intervention to determine the effectiveness of the two variations of Parent Guide to
      S.S.GRIN. Parents will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions: (1) Parent Guide
      treatment; (2) Parent Guide-Home Study treatment; (3) parent attention control; or (4) no
      treatment. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month post-treatment, and 12 month post-treatment
      data will be collected assessing children's social skill development from children, parents,
      and teachers. Based on past clinical experience, the probability of adverse psychological and
      behavioral effects from behavioral intervention is very low; however, to ensure participants'
      safety, a data and safety monitoring plan will be in place.

    <description>Children will participate in traditional SSGRIN treatment, and parents will participate in a weekly support group to meet with other parents regarding their child's peer relations and behavior. The support group will meet for a parallel amount of time (1 hour/week for 10 weeks) and be facilitated by two parents with no SSGRIN or Parent Guide experience. The PAC condition will reflect the social support functions of a parenting group, but no therapeutic skills training or other instructional materials will be provided.</description>

Families will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions(approximately 25% each): (a) Traditional SSGRIN child treatment with no parent involvement (ChO), (b) SSGRIN child treatment plus parent attention control (PAC), (c) SSGRIN child treatment plus Parent Guide-Home-study treatment (PG-HS), or (d) SSGRIN child treatment plus traditional Parent Guide treatment (PG).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:children ages 8-12 experiencing peer difficulties who are English
        speaking. To confirm eligibility regarding peer difficulties, 3-C staff will conduct a
        brief (5 minute) phone-survey with parents for two sub-scales of the Social Skills Rating
        System: Parent Form (SSRS; Gresham &amp; Elliott, 1990). To be eligible for participation, a
        child must have a standard score either (a) less than one standard deviation (std) on the
        Social Skills Scale (&lt;84%ile) or (b) greater than one std on the Problem Behavior Scale
        (&gt;84%ile).

        Exclusion Criteria:SSGRIN group therapy is not recommended for extremely aggressive
        children (DeRosier, 2005), so any child scoring higher than two std on the Externalizing
        Problem Behavior Scale (&gt;97%ile) will be excluded from participation and referral sources
        to other appropriate community resources will be given to parents.
