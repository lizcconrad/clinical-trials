  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multinational, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      using a Bayesian design with response adaptive randomization across placebo or 5 active arms
      of BAN2401 to determine clinical efficacy and to explore the dose response of BAN2401 using a
      composite clinical score (ADCOMS). BAN2401-G000-201 is an 18-month study in which 3 dose
      levels (2.5, 5, and 10 mg/kg) are given biweekly (once every 2 weeks) to separate groups of
      participants and 2 dose levels (5 and 10 mg/kg) are given monthly to separate groups of
      participants. Participants will be from 2 clinical subgroups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
      due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. Frequent interim
      analyses will be conducted to continually update randomization allocation on the basis of the
      primary clinical endpoint. In the event of early success in the Core Study at any interim
      analysis (IA) or at the Bayesian analysis at 12 months of treatment, an open label extension
      (OLE) Phase will be implemented to allow for up to 60 months (5 years) of additional
      treatment. The OLE will not be conducted if early success is not achieved at any IA or at the
      Bayesian analysis at 12 months of treatment.

             findings on brain MRI at Screening

          6. A prolonged QT/QTc interval (QTc greater than 450 ms) as demonstrated by a repeated
