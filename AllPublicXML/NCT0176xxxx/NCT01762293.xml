  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Famitinib is a tyrosin-inhibitor agent targeting at c-Kit, VEGFR2, PDGFR, VEGFR3, Flt1 and
      Flt3, and it's anti-angiogenesis effect has been viewed in preclinical tests. Phase I study
      has shown that the toxicity is manageable.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Famitinib can improve progression free
      survival compared with placebo in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who failed in
      previous at least two lines of chemotherapy.
