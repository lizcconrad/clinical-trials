  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We wish to see whether topiramate (an anti-epileptic agent) improves the outcome of babies
      with neonatal hypoxic encephalopathy who are receiving whole body cooling.

    <textblock>
      Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a devastating and unexpected disease in newborns
      that affects 1.5-2.6 per 1000 live births. Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has a mortality
      rate of up to 30% and survivors are at significant risk for adverse long-term outcomes,
      including seizures, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. The investigators propose a
      randomized controlled study comparing therapeutic hypothermia alone, or therapeutic
      hypothermia combined with topiramate. The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant therapy
      with topiramate will reduce short term severity of HIE including seizures (the primary
      outcome), a composite HIE severity score, and reduce the time of normalization of the
      amplitude integrated aEEG. The investigators further hypothesize, that it will improve longer
      term outcomes such as developmental outcome. The primary hypothesis is that seizures before
      hospital discharge (or before 4w post-natal age (which ever is earlier) will be significantly
      reduced in the topiramate group compared to the control group
