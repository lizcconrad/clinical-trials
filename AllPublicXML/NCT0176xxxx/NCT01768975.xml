      The purpose of this trial is to investigate the efficacy and safety of OLT1177 Gel in
      subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee following
      cessation of pain therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, repeat-dose, multi-center Phase 2
      efficacy and safety clinical trial of subjects with moderate to severe pain associated with
      osteoarthritis of the knee. Eighty-four subjects, randomized in a 2:1 ratio (OLT1177 Gel to
      vehicle control) will receive up to 40 doses of the Investigational Drug (56 subjects OLT1177
      Gel and 28 subjects vehicle control) over 14 consecutive days given 3 times per day (4 mL per
      dose, TID on Days 1 - 13 with only one dose administered on Day 14, assuming TID on Day 1)
      and will have safety data collected through Day 28. Subjects with moderate to severe pain
      associated with osteoarthritis of the knee will be evaluated twice for eligibility: 1) at the
      Screening visit; and 2) at the Baseline (Day 0) visit, after a 7-day washout period of all
      pain medications except for trial provided Rescue Medication (500 mg/dose of acetaminophen)
      for those that experience unacceptable pain during the washout and 14-day treatment period.

      Subjects will be encouraged not to take any pain medication during the 7-day washout period;
      however, for the first 5 days they are allowed to take only Rescue Medication. No pain
      medication, including Rescue Medication, is allowed during the 2-day pain intensity
      assessment period or within 48 hours of the Baseline (Day 0), Day 7 and Day 14 visits.

      Subjects will be asked to record and report their level of pain at different time points
      throughout the 14-day trial.
