    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the beneficial effects of an optimized berries
      extracts on diabetes and cardiovascular diseases prevention. Our hypothesis is that including
      a polyphenol rich berries extract in daily feeding will improve insulin sensitivity, glucose
      tolerance, pancreatic β-cells function, lipids and inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress
      markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is an up rising disease that makes it a major public health problem. While
      221 millions cases were estimated in 2010, the prevalence would be 366 millions in 2030. It
      is well recognized that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables can lower the incidence
      of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and inflammatory
      diseases. Recently, Drs Desjardins, Abrams and Marette's research team discovered a high
      amount of a sesquiterpene in berries. This molecule is recognized for its ability to improve
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and to lower pro-inflammatory profile of obese
      mice. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a polyphenol rich berries extract
      mix on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, pancreatic β-cells function, lipids and
      inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress markers, on human obese subjects that have insulin
      resistance.

    <description>Men and women are assigned to an uncontrolled nutritional intervention where they have to consume every day one of the beverage. Half of the subjects consume the experimental beverage containing polyphenols from berries extracts, the other half consume a placebo beverage without polyphenols. The polyphenol containing beverage daily supply 1,84 g of a strawberry and cranberry extract. This amount give the equivalent of 333 mg of polyphenols, thus corresponding to a daily consumption of one cup of berries. The placebo beverage is also a fruit taste beverage, but without polyphenols. Both beverage are isocaloric, with same appearance and taste. A 2 weeks stabilisation period precede the 6 weeks experimental period. During these two periods, subjects are advise to maintain their habitual caloric intake and their habitual activity level, and to avoid consumption of particular food with a high polyphenol content.</description>
