  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a report of a protocol developed to improve asthma and COPD care in a primary care
      setting. The study was approved by an Ethics Committee and support by the Canadian Thoracic
      Society through an unrestrictive grant from GlaxoSmithKline. However, the study could not be
      done and the investigators report why, discussing the difficulties to perform such study.
      This information should be very useful to investigators planning this sort of study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the two most common chronic
      pulmonary ailments in Canada, affecting about 2.5 million and 750 thousand individuals,
      respectively. In the last two decades, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) has successfully
      developed and disseminated evidence-based asthma and COPD clinical practice guidelines.
      However, evidence suggests that guideline implementation in these diseases remains
      inadequate.

      Successful guideline implementation requires tailoring of selected strategies to settings and
      population-specific barriers, based on established theories and principles. In 2004, the CTS
      and its collaborators organized a symposium in Quebec City, to discuss existing barriers to
      respiratory guideline implementation and possible knowledge translation (KT) strategies. This
      was followed in the fall of 2007 by an expert-led workshop on guideline implementation
      strategies.

      Herein, the investigators report the planned methods and outcome of a project which resulted
      from these meetings. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of a multi-faceted KT
      strategy in improving concordance with COPD and asthma guidelines among primary care
      physicians (PCPs) in Canada, but was aborted due to inadequate PCP recruitment. The
      investigators discuss the difficulties encountered in recruiting PCPs, factors which may have
      influenced recruitment, and alternative strategies. The goal of the investigators is to
      provide practical lessons to inform the design of future KT initiatives with similar
      interventions and/or a similar target audience.

    <description>The co-primary outcomes (for asthma and COPD) were defined as the change in patient-reported physician conformity to each of the following key guideline recommendations, measured through a questionnaire (Appendix 1):
A) For asthma, assessment of asthma control, defined as ascertainment of at least 2 of the 5 asthma control questions recommended by the Canadian Asthma Guidelines. Stratified physician randomization would randomize 75% of PCPs to the TIS group and 25% to the SP group.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Physician Practice Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>First visit</time_frame>
    <description>Secondary outcomes collected through the patient questionnaires included other guideline-recommended physician behaviours. For asthma, these included spirometry performance, asthma action plan provision and review, inhaler technique review, and maintenance anti-inflammatory medication prescription when indicated. For COPD, these included spirometry performance, inhaler technique review, exacerbation screening, long-acting bronchodilator prescription when indicated, and smoking cessation efforts in smokers. A separate questionnaire measured physician self-reported changes in knowledge and adherence to guideline-recommended behaviours (the &quot;Physician Practice Assessment Questionnaire&quot;) (PPAQ)</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Primary care physicians were eligible if they: 1) managed at least 15 patients with asthma
        and 15 patients with COPD per month in an office setting; and 2) agreed to designate an
        appropriately trained person at his/her site to identify eligible study patients, collect
        consent, and provide a questionnaire to patients.

        Patients were eligible if they: 1) spoke French or English; and 2) had a diagnosis of
        asthma or COPD (as per their participating PCP). Furthermore, patients with asthma had to
        be between 18 and 45 years of age, and patients with COPD had to be between 40 and 75 years
        of age and have a smoking history of &gt;10 pack-years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Physicians were excluded if they: 1) had presented at a continuing medical education (CME)
        event on asthma or COPD in last year; 2) had completed any specialty training in
        respiratory diseases; or 3) practiced primarily at walk-in clinics, with children, or in
        emergency departments.

        Patients were excluded if they: 1) had any condition which could interfere with study
        measurements (as per their participating PCP); 2) had any known respiratory disorders other
        than asthma or COPD; or 3) were currently participating in another clinical trial.
