    <textblock>
      Current therapeutic options for a well-recognized group of patients with anginal symptoms—a
      positive exercise tolerance testing, SPECT or perfusion defect in MRI but angiographically
      normal coronary arteries—are limited. The condition, referred to as microvascular angina
      (MVA) or cardiac syndrome X, is not as benign as originally reported—patients presenting with
      unstable angina and nonobstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease have a 2% risk of
      death or myocardial infarction at 30 days of follow-up. It is more common in women in whom
      the first presentation of angina occurs either perimenopausally or postmenopausally. Aberrant
      flow-mediated coronary vasomotion is pivotal in the pathogenesis (systemic) impairment in
      endothelial function. Indeed, some centers use systemic assessments of vascular function in
      their diagnostic pathways for this group of women. It was recently suggested that endothelial
      dysfunction may lead to myocardial ischemia.

      In the present study, the investigators tested the hypothesis that udenafil offers dual
      benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in women with angina,
      perfusion defect in cardiac MRI, and normal coronary arteries.

      The aim of this study is that udenafil offers dual benefits of improving vascular function
      and lessening ischemia in women with microvascular angina, perfusion defect in cardiac MRI,
      and normal coronary arteries.

      The UMPIRE trial is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial,
      designed to evaluate the effect of udenafil in improvement of myocardial stress perfusion
      defect in cardiac MRI, in women patients with microvascular angina. A total of 70 patients
      will be randomized to udenafil(100 mg q d) or placebo treatment. The primary end point of the
      study is Change of perfusion defect over 25% of baseline defect in adenosine-stress cardiac
      MRI after 3-month treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study are change of perfusion
      defect less than 25% of baseline defect in adenosine-stress cardiac MRI after 3-month
      treatment, decrement of frequency of chest pain, improvement of ST-depression in stress test,
      improvement of duke score in stress test, improvement of QoL assessment by SF-36
      questionnaire, improvement of sexual dysfunction assessment by BISF-W self-questionnaire and
      improvement of biomarkers foe endothelial function.
