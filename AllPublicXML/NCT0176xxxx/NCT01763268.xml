    <textblock>
      Open-label, single-arm trial, Primary Objectives included:

        1. To assess the immunogenicity of TrivivacTM administered in healthy infants aged between
           9-14 months.

        2. To assess the safety (reactogenicity) of TrivivacTM administered in healthy infants aged
           between 9-14 months.

      The study will be done on healthy infants, 9-14 months of age. After enrolment, the infants
      will be given one dose of primary vaccination MMR (TrivivacTM),SEVAPHARMA BiogenetechLtd.
      study vaccines will be administered subcutaneously into the anterolateral aspect of right
      thigh.outer aspect of the upper arm. Subjects will be followed at approximately 6 weeks after
      primary vaccination to evaluate response to primary immunization of this vaccine. Blood
      sample will be collected from subjects at visit 1 (prior to immunization) and visit 2 (6
      weeksone month after completion of this first dose of immunization). The serum samples will
      be analysed for Anti-measles, Anti-mumps and Anti-rubella antibodies. Proportion of subjects
      achieving seroprotection and geometric mean titers of antibody against measles, mumps,
      rubella at 6 weeks after one dose vaccination of MMR vaccine at aged 9-14 months will be
      evaluated. Adverse reactions will be observed on each vaccination day (up to 30 minutes) and
      for 4 days (Day 0-3) after each dose. Adverse reactions will also be monitored for 30 days
      following each vaccination. Serious adverse events will be monitored for the entire study
      duration.

    <time_frame>6 weeks after vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity of Trivivac vaccine is determined by proportion of subjects achieving seroprotection against measles, mumps and rubella at 6 weeks (42 days) after application of first dose of vaccine MMR. The amount of specific antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella will be evaluated in sera collected approximately 42+ 7 days following primary vaccination with the Trivivac vaccine.
Seroconversion and GMT against measles, mumps, and rubella will be defined by Enzyme immunoassay for the qualitative detection and quantitative determination of specific IgG antibodies against measles, mumps and rubella virus in human serum (EnzygnostÂ® Anti-Measles Virus/IgG, Anti-Mumps Virus/IgG and Anti-Rubella Virus/IgG; SIEMENS).</description>

             study entry.

          2. Infants with good health as determined by: Medical history, Physical examination,
             Clinical judgment of the investigator

          3. Infants who are not seroprotected against MMR virus by virtue of previous immunization
             and/or proven prior infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children whom parents or LAR are unwilling or unable to give written informed consent
             to participate in the study.
