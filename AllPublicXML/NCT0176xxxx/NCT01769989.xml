    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrodermabrasion improves the cosmetic
      appearance of raise or bumpy scars or scars that are a different color or texture than the
      surrounding skin resulting from dermatologic surgery and whether it is as good as to the
      already used method of dermabrasion.
