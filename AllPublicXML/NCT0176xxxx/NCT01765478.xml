  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HM71224 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK). BTK is a
      member of the Tec family of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases. BTK is mostly expressed in
      hematopoietic cells such as B cells, mast cells and macrophages. BTK plays key roles in
      multiple cell signaling pathways including B-Cell Receptor (BCR) and Fc receptor (FcR)
      signaling cascades and is an essential mediator not only in B-cell dependent but also in
      myeloid cell dependent inflammatory arthritis. HM71224 has been selected as a novel
      therapeutic agent for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      In view of the above, further development of HM71224 for the treatment of RA is warranted. In
      this first-in-man (FIM) study, a single and multiple dose escalation design will be employed,
      in which the primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the compound.
      The biomarkers included as pharmacodynamic (PD) variables are chosen as they are indicators
      for any effects of HM71224 on the expected mode of action (pBTK, pPLCγ, and pERK).

      Primary objective

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability, and if possible maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
           HM71224 after single and multiple ascending dose administration in healthy subjects.

      Secondary objective

        -  To determine the PK of HM71224 and selected metabolites (M1 and M2) following single and
           multiple oral dose administration of HM71224.

        -  To assess the PD effects of HM71224 on the biomarkers pBTK, pPLCγ, and pERK.

        -  To assess whether the PK of HM71224 is affected by food.
