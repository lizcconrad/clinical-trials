  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of two
      different doses of BI 201335, administered as soft gelatine capsule in comparison to the
      equivalent doses of three different oral solution per dose of BI 201335.

      <population>This trial was an open-label study consisting of two (40mg and 120mg Faldaprevir) 4-way crossover groups. All subjects were to receive 4 treatments: either treatments A, B, C, and D (20 subjects) or treatments E, F, G, and H (36 subjects). Subjects were randomised to 1 of the 4 treatment sequences for each dose group to be tested in a 1:1:1:1 ratio</population>

          <title>120mg Faldaprevir: Sequence Group HGEF</title>
          <description>120 mg group: The reference treatment was a single 120 mg dose (consisting of three 40 mg faldaprevir soft gelatine capsules, treatment E) and the test treatments were single 120 mg doses of 3 different faldaprevir oral solutions (treatments F, G, and H).
The order of treatment administration in this sequence group is HGEF with washout phases of at least 14 days between drug administrations.
