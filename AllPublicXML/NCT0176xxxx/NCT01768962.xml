             range of normal according to the clinical judgment of the IoR/designee is considered
             expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.

             examination findings may be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a
             non-exclusionary severity grading or resolved. If improvement to a non-exclusionary

             participant may be enrolled.

          6. Any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude informed
