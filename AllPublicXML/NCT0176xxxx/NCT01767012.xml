  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Modern phacoemulsification techniques have made cataract surgery safe and efficient over the
      past several decades. Although the phacoemulsification procedure has improved greatly,
      cataract surgery still involves trauma. One of the surgical traumas during cataract surgery
      is the direct trauma of the anterior uvea, resulting in a later chronic immune reaction of
      the uvea to the implanted intraocular lens (IOL). 1 The breakdown of the blood-aqueous
      barrier (a measure of the uveal reaction) clinically presents as flare in the anterior
      chamber. 2 Petternel et al. 3 explained that the protein content of the aqueous humor may
      mainly arise from the iris root and iris vessels in the anterior chamber. The peak of this
      flare and cell intensity in the anterior chamber was shown to be reached during the first two
      days after cataract surgery 4 and flare levels were back to the preoperative values about one
      year after cataract surgery. 5, 6 Influencing factors are surgical technique 7, perioperative
      treatment 8, IOL biomaterial and design 9 and host reaction to the IOL.

      In this study the otherwise same IOL concerning material and design, but one with a new
      surface modification will be compared to assess the influence on aqueous flare and cell
      intensity in the anterior chamber. The Polylens (Polytech, Rossdorf, Germany) is a
      hydrophobic acrylic single-piece open-loop IOL and is available with the standard surface and
      a novel modified surface.

      To assess the efficacy of the newly modified surface of the Polylens IOL compared to the same
      IOL without a modified surface concerning flare and cell intensity in the anterior chamber as
      well as cellular components on the IOL surface and lens epithelial out-growth from the rhexis
      after cataract surgery in eyes of patients with diabetes mellitus and pseudoexfoliation
      syndrome, which typically have a higher incidence of post-operative intra-ocular
      inflammation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Amount of aqueous flare measured with a Laser flare meter</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour - 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of aqueous flare was measured with a Laser flare meter (Kowa FM-600, Kowa Optimed, USA).The unit of measurement is photon counts per millisecond (pc/ms). The higher flare values, the higher the intracameral amount of protein and, therefore, the higher the intraocular inflammatory response.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anterior capsule opacification (measured as brightness of anterior capsular reflect on slitlamp photographs)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour to 3 months postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Objective ACO evaluation was obtained after taking 2 slit lamp images in a standardised way of each eye: the area of the anterior capsule in contact with the IOL was defined as the area of interest. Part of the dark area not directly illuminated by the slit beam within the capsulorhexis served as the control area. The difference in brightness between the area of interest and the control area defined the grade of fibrosis in per cent, with 0% representing a clear anterior capsule and 100%, a completely white anterior capsule.</description>
