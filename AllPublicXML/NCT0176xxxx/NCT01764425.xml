      -  A phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalating study of P7435
           to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, food effect and
           pharmacodynamics of single and multiple ascending doses of P7435.

        -  Subjects participating will be either healthy subjects or healthy overweight and/or
           obese subjects. In this study, overweight/obese are defined as subjects having a BMI of
           23 kg/m2 and above.

        -  The study will be conducted in 3 parts as follows: Part A will consist of the Single
           Ascending Dose (SAD) study, Part B will consist of the Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD)
           study and Part C will consist of the Food Effect study.
