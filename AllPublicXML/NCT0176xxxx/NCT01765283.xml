      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and to appraise the efficacy of one cycle
      of Hepastem (Heterologous Human Adult Liver-derived Progenitor Cells, HHALPC) infusions in
      paediatric patients suffering from CN or UCD.

      The study duration: 12 months starting from the day of treatment: 6 months active
      surveillance and 6 months observation post-infusion.

        GENERAL:

          1. Subject shows patency of the portal vein and branches, with normal flow velocity in
             the main portal vein as confirmed by Doppler ultrasound and accessibility of the
             portal vein, or respectively, accessibility of the umbilical vein.

          2. Subject (if capable of signing) and parents or legal representative have provided a
             written informed assent/consent.

          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential need to have a negative pregnancy test and
             must agree to use an acceptable method of contraception throughout the study.

        MAIN INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Crigler-Najjar Syndrome specific:

          -  Patient presents with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1.

          -  Patient presents with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 2, poorly controlled under
             phenobarbital treatment, or experiencing serious impairment in quality of life.

        Diagnosis must be confirmed by genetic mutation analysis if not available.

        Urea Cycle Disorders specific:

          -  The subject has a thrombosis of the portal vein or persisting impairment of
             anterograde portal blood flow.

          -  The subject has a porto systemic shunt or fistula assessed by Doppler US.

          -  Patients with disease of such severity that liver transplantation is an absolute
             indication.
