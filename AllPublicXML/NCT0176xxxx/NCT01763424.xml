      This study will determine if combination of topical calcipotriol and nicotinamide is more
      effective than calcipotriol alone in treatment of psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current treatment strategies of psoriasis are not completely satisfactorily. By inhibiting
      inflammatory cytokines, nicotinamide may enhance the effects of current topical treatments.
      Preliminary studies have shown that nicotinamide, which is a vitamin B derivative, is
      effective in the treatment of psoriasis. According to lack of data, we will investigate the
      beneficial effects of adding nicotinamide to calcipotriol for patients with mild to moderate
      psoriasis.
