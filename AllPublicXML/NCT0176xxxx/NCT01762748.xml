      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in patients in
      the waiting list for liver transplant.

    <textblock>
      Increased intestinal permeability are related to the major complications of liver cirrhosis.
      The administration of probiotics has been suggested to improve the barrier function of the
      mucosa and consequently avoid the complications of the disease. The objective of this study
      was to evaluate the effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in patients in the waiting list for
      liver transplant.

      Eighteen patients were treated with Saccharomyces boulardii. Intestinal permeability
      (lactulose/mannitol ratio) and laboratory parameters were evaluated immediately before the
      beginning of treatment, after a thirty-day period of treatment with probiotic and at the end
      of the second study month (after a thirty-day period without treatment with probiotic).
      Twenty healthy volunteers were also submitted for the intestinal permeability test.
