      The goal is to assess for myocardial edema on cardiac MRI during SLE flare to assess for
      myocardial inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The over-arching goal of this work is to further the understanding of myocardial damage in
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) using state of the art CV imaging to investigate a novel
      potential mechanism of CV injury in SLE, subclinical myocardial inflammation.

      Aim 1: Investigate an alternative pathway for CV morbidity in SLE by measuring myocardial
      edema at time of moderate to severe flare and compare values to post-flare studies and
      historical healthy controls.

      Hypothesis 1: Myocardial edema, measured quantitatively with T2 CMR mapping during moderate
      to severe SLE flare will be significantly increased compared to 1) historical controls and 2)
      in SLE patients after resolution of flare.

      Aim 2: Perform exploratory analyses investigating relationships between myocardial edema on
      CMR and markers of SLE disease activity and CV risk factors.

      Hypothesis 2: Markers of disease activity including inflammatory makers (ESR and high
      sensitivity c-reactive protein), complement and autoantibody levels will predict the presence
      of T2 CMR detected myocardial edema during flare.

               -  Active SLE Flare defined by Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index
                  (SLEDAI)[22] &gt; 6 or British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) Index A or
                  B.[23]
