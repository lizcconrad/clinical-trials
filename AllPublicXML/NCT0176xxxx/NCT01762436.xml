  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      β-blockers (BBs) with different pharmacological properties may have heterogeneous effects on
      sympathetic nervous activity (SNA) and central aortic pressure (CAP), which are independent
      cardiovascular factors for hypertension. Hence, we analyzed the effects of bisoprolol and
      atenolol on SNA and CAP in hypertensive patients.

    <description>initially received 5 mg of bisoprolol (Concor®, Merck Serono, Darmstadt, Germany) once daily. The heart rate was assessed every two weeks. If the RHR was ≤65 bpm, a 2-week maintenance treatment was added during the final visit. If the target RHR was not achieved, the dose was changed as recommended in the study protocol. The maximal dose was 10 mg Qd for bisoprolol. The longest treatment period was 8 weeks. If the patient's RHR did not reach below 65 bpm at week 6, the treatment was ended at week 8.</description>

    <description>initially received 50 mg atenolol (Beijing Double-Crane Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Beijing, China) once daily. The heart rate was assessed every two weeks. If the RHR was ≤65 bpm, a 2-week maintenance treatment was added during the final visit. If the target RHR was not achieved, the dose was changed as recommended in the study protocol. The maximal dose was 100 mg Qd for atenolol. The longest treatment period was 8 weeks. If the patient's RHR did not reach below 65 bpm at week 6, the treatment was ended at week 8.</description>
