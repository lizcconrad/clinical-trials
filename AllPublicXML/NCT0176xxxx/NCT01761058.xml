  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand the basis of airway remodeling in
      severe asthma and how remodeling changes overtime. The investigators propose to study a well
      characterized cohort of individuals with severe asthma using a multidisciplinary
      state-of-the-art-approach.

    <textblock>
      Through innovative metabolomics and redox biochemistry, methodologies that are a strength and
      unique to our collaborative efforts, the investigators identified clinically relevant
      phenotypes of asthma. The phenotypes are defined by biomarkers specific to underlying
      biochemical mechanistic abnormalities, including eosinophil-mediated oxidation, depletion of
      antioxidants and protective airway S-nitrosothiols, and airway acidification. Here,the
      investigators propose to study a new component that is informative for longitudinal
      assessment of severe asthma phenotypes: gender effects. The investigators reason that
      identification of the metabolic mechanism(s) underlying onset of severe asthma in young women
      during adolescence, and resolution of severe asthma in boys, will reveal fundamental
      pathophysiology of severe asthma. Importantly, we aim to develop clinical testing procedures
      to accurately assign metabolic asthma phenotypes; and to follow patients in each phenotype to
      uncover clinical longitudinal outcomes. At the conclusion of the project, we anticipate that
      we will have 1) developed clinically relevant tests to identify severe asthma phenotypes; 2)
      determined the longitudinal outcome of the phenotypes; and 3) identified the mechanisms
      underlying the preponderance of women in the severe asthma population. This application will
      focus on the development or clinically relevant metabolic tests to identify subphenotypes of
      adults and children with severe asthma and will lead to new targeted innovative treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Physician diagnosis of asthma

        • Age 6 years to 17 years old Evidence of historical reversibility, including either;

          1. FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility greater than or equal to 12%, or

          2. Airway hyperresponsivesness reflected by a methacholine PC20 less than or equal to 16
             mg/ml.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include any of the following:

               1. Pregnancy during the characterization phase*,

               2. Current smoking,

               3. Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack
                  years if &lt;30 years of age (Note: if a subject has a smoking history, no smoking
                  within the past year),

               4. Other chronic pulmonary disorders associated with asthma-like symptoms, including
                  (but not limited to) cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
                  chronic bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction (that is the sole cause of respiratory
                  symptoms and at the PI's discretion), severe scoliosis or chest wall deformities
                  that affect lung function, or congenital disorders of the lungs or airways,

               5. History of premature birth before 35 weeks gestation,

               6. Unwillingness to receive an intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide injection.

               7. Evidence that the participant or family may be unreliable or poorly adherent to
                  their asthma treatment or study procedures,

               8. Planning to relocate from the clinical center area before study completion,

               9. Any other criteria that place the subject at unnecessary risk according to the
                  judgment of the Principal Investigator and/or attending physician(s) of record,
                  or

              10. Currently participating in an investigational drug trial.
