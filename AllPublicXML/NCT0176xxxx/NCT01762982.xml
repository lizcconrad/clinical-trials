  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the irritation potential of benzalkonium chloride
      disinfectant spray when placed in contact with normal human skin.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benzalkonium chloride is recognized as safe and effective for short term use as first aid
      antiseptic drug products. In this study, benzalkonium chloride disinfectant spray will be
      compared to a positive control, and two negative control for irritancy potential on normal
      skin according to Chinese Patch Test Guideline (China Health Authority 2002). The skin
      irritation assessment will characterize the test products individually in terms of
      symptomatology using a 5-point categorical scale ranging from 0 (no visible reaction) to 4
      (Erythema,edemaË› extreme blistering).

          <description>This was a 4-way split-plot clinical study. Four Finn chambers which contained the test product (Benzalkonium chloride solution; 0.03 milliliters (mL) of 0.13% Benazalkonium chloride solution), one positive control [Sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS); 0.03 mL of 0.3% weight by weight (w/w) SLS solution] and 2 negative controls including one chamber for normal saline (0.03 mL of 0.9% weight by volume (w/v) normal saline) and an empty Finn chamber were applied on the left upper back of each subject for 24 hours under occlusive dressing. The sequence of the patch assembly (Finn chambers) was randomized. During this 24 hour patch applications, subjects had direct and ongoing skin contact with the investigational products and the positive and negative controls.</description>

        <title>Proportion of Participants With Skin Irritation Scores at 24 Hours</title>
        <description>Irritation potential of the treatments was assessed by proportion of the irritation scores by a trained dermatologist. Skin Irritation reaction was categorized as: 0=No visible reaction; 1= Weak Erythema (Redness); 2=Erythema, Infiltration, Papule; 3= Erythema, Edema, Papule, Blister; 4=Erythema, Edema, Extreme Blistering. For the product to be deemed as non-irritant to skin, requirements were proportion of score of 2 should not be more than 1 out of 15 participants and no cases of score of 3 or 4.</description>

          <title>Overall Study</title>
          <description>This was a 4-way split-plot study. Four Finn chambers which contained the test product (Benzalkonium chloride solution; 0.03 mL of 0.13% Benazalkonium chloride solution), one positive control [SLS; 0.03 mL of 0.3% w/w SLS solution] and 2 negative controls including one chamber for normal saline (0.03 mL of 0.9% w/v normal saline) and an empty Finn chamber were applied on the left upper back of each subject for 24 hours under occlusive dressing. The sequence of the patch assembly (Finn chambers) was randomized. During this 24 hour patch applications, subjects had direct and ongoing skin contact with the investigational products and the positive and negative controls.
All randomized participants exposed to at least one of the study treatments were evaluated for safety.</description>
