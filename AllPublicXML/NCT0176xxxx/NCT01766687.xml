  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a randomized controlled trial to test whether increased water
      intake slows renal decline in patients with Stage-III Chronic Kidney Disease. Participants
      randomized to the hydration-intervention group will be asked to drink 1.0 to 1.5 L of water
      per day (depending on sex and weight), in addition to usual fluid intake, for one year. The
      investigators will calculate the change in kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration
      rate, measured every three months for 12 months), and compare renal decline between the
      intervention and control groups. The investigators hypothesize that increased water intake
      will slow renal decline.
