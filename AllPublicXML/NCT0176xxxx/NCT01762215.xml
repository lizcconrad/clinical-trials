  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the use of an online social media platform (PatientsLikeMe) to assist
      Veterans with epilepsy. The hypothesis is that the online social media platform,
      PatientsLikeMe, will improve selected patient-reported outcomes on perceived self-management
      skills for patients who engage in the website functions.

    <description>The Epilepsy Self-Management Scale (ESMS) is a 38 item scale that assesses &quot;frequency of use of epilepsy self-management practices.&quot; A 5-point Likert scale asks participants to respond from never to always. The scale includes 5 subscales that measure medication management, Information management, Safety management, Seizure management, and Lifestyle Management. Higher scores indicate more frequent use of self-management strategies. The scale and its subscale have been previously validated and used in similar studies.</description>

    <description>The Epilepsy Self-Efficacy Scale is a 33-item scale that measures &quot;aspects of efficacy in the self-management of epilepsy&quot;. An 11-point Likert rating scale asks participants to choose from 0, I cannot do at all to 10, sure I can do. The scale contains three dimensions: 1) self-efficacy for medication management, 2) self-efficacy for seizure management and 3) self-efficacy for general management issues. Higher scores correspond to higher levels of self-efficacy. The scale has been validated and used in similar studies of website interventions for epilepsy patients.</description>

    <description>Upon consenting to the study, participants will be asked to register an account on PatientsLikeMe; no personal identifiers will be required. As part of registration patients create a user name and password for the website and share their email with PatientsLikeMe. Participants will be asked to provide a set of demographic variables and to complete a survey assessing elements of self-management, disease knowledge, social support, and quality of life. Paticipants will then use the PatientsLikeMe website for 6 weeks as much as they wish. After 6 weeks the participants are asked to complete a second survey.</description>

    <description>PatientsLikeMe (PLM, www.patientslikeme.com) is an established medical social networking website that encourages patients with chronic medical conditions to voluntarily share their story and seek support from a common community. Additionally, PatientsLikeMe is actively exploring opportunities to allow patients to report and track important medical data points with the hope that this will improve their longitudinal care. PatientsLikeMe has developed custom functionality for the epilepsy population including seizure tracking, peer support, and printable doctor visit support sheets.</description>
