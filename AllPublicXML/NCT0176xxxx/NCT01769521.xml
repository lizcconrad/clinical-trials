  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interplay between the increasing IOP and decreasing blood pressure (BP) during the 24-hour
      period, especially in the nocturnal period, may lead to insufficient perfusion pressure of
      the optic nerve and contribute to the glaucomatous damage in adjunct to the antero-posterior
      vectorial mechanical impact on the lamina cribrosa, the translaminar pressure. Patients with
      progressive VF loss showed greater nocturnal BP dips than patients with stable VF. Reduced
      mean intraocular perfusion pressure (IOPP) was significantly associated with the extent of
      glaucomatous damage. How the nycthemeral IOP fluctuation influences glaucoma progression has
      not been studied in a prospective manner and remains to be elucidated.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between the 24-hour IOP fluctuation
      pattern and the 24-hour BP pattern in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). IOP
      fluctuations will be monitored with SENSIMED Triggerfish®, a portable investigational device
      using a contact lens sensor that monitors the IOP fluctuation continuously over 24-hours.
