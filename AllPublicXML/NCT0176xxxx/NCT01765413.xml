  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that vaccines trigger innate inflammatory responses to induce antigenspecific
      adaptive immunity (the desired effect), but excessive inflammation may lead to serious
      inflammatory complications or unwanted side effects. Currently there is a lack of reliable
      biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) able to predict severe
      inflammation and this has resulted in the development of several vaccines being terminated
      and the withdrawal of some licensed vaccines which were associated with inflammatory
      complications.

      This study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is a 5year €30M project funded by the
      Innovative Medicine Initiative. The project involves a series of clinical studies using
      licensed vaccines as benchmarks to generate clinical data on inflammation and identify
      biomarkers that can be used to predict acceptable reactogenicity. The target is to identify
      biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of beneficial and detrimental effects in response
      to a vaccine. Such biomarkers could be used in future vaccine development programs to
      optimize selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be unlikely to generate
      worrisome safety signals once they are in generalized use.

      This study is one in a series of &quot;training&quot; studies which will each use different licensed
      vaccines that are prototypical representatives of a class of vaccine used in a particular
      target population. Forty eight subjects will be randomised into three groups to receive: A)
      Varicella zoster vaccine (n = 20), B) Yellow Fever vaccine (n = 20), C) Saline placebo (n =
      8). Following a screening visit, participants will undergo a seven day residential visit
      which will include immunization and intensive monitoring of physiological (e.g. heart rate,
      oral temperature, blood pressure) metabolic and immune (innate and adaptive) parameters. This
      visit will be followed up by four outpatient visits with further monitoring and blood
      samples.
