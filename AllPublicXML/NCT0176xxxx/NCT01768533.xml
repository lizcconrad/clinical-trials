  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to do formative research which will lead ultimately to the
      development of a computer-based system called Tailored Information for Diet and Exercise or
      TIDE for short. TIDE will target energy balance behaviors to prevent the onset of obesity in
      children. The system will be used by physicians and parents/primary care givers in pediatric
      primary care practices with the aim of improving parent-pediatrician interactions related to
      counseling and anticipatory guidance on energy balance behaviors. The aim of this study is to
      develop a one-two page, paper-pencil proxy questionnaire that is used to query the parent of
      the child in the waiting room and assesses topic areas related to energy balance behaviors
      (EBB). The questionnaire will be referred to as the energy balance behaviors questionnaire
      (EBB-Q). This will require focus groups, cognitive testing of the questionnaire, and survey
      administration.

        General population of parents with children ages 4-10 years who reside in the Greater
        Boston area. Parents are defined as primary care givers or legal guardians who take primary
        responsibility for the child's health which includes attending the child's well-care
        visits.
