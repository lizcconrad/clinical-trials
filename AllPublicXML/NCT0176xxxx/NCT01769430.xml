    <textblock>
      The recent swine origin influenza pandemic (2009), new emergence of swine origin H3N2v, and
      delayed availability of vaccine for these agents highlight the need to test and optimize
      public health intervention strategies to reduce transmission of influenza. We will use a new
      technology for biological particle collection (U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.
      61/162,395, McDevitt et al., Aerosol Sci Technol 2013) to make fundamental observations on
      infectious respiratory droplets in a study of up to 200 naturally occurring seasonal
      influenza cases. We will collect respiratory droplets shed by participants while breathing
      normally, talking, and spontaneously coughing. We will characterize the size distribution of
      droplets containing infectious virus. We will use these basic data to examine the roles of
      large and small respiratory droplets and examine how the interaction of host factors and
      virus type impact the shedding of infectious respiratory droplets. Subjects will be recruited
      through a web based respiratory illness surveillance system, health clinics and advertisement
      in the campus community. Sitting in the collection booth will not create additional
      discomfort or risk for volunteers already suffering from influenza infection. We will recruit
      up to 1000 persons with symptoms of acute respiratory illness for screening with collection
      of nasopharyngeal swabs and questionnaire. From among those screened, we will recruit 250 to
      give exhaled breath samples, and ask 50 people with influenza to return for follow up exhaled
      breath samples on up to two subsequent days. We hypothesize that (1) fine aerosols (&lt;5
      microns in aerodynamic diameter) will contain more viral copies than coarse aerosol particles
      (&gt;= 5 microns) (2) fine aerosols will contain culturable virus indicating that the fine
      aerosols are infectious, (3) aerosol shedding will correlate with virus load measured by
      swabs, (4) presence of active cough during sampling will be associated with increased aerosol
      shedding, (5) clinical symptoms and signs, including fever can be used to predict viral
      aerosol shedding.

      This study is a follow-on to earlier projects funded by the US Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)
      that developed the sampler and studied the impact of surgical masks on reducing viral aerosol
      release by persons infected with influenza virus. The funding organizations have no direct
      control over the study design, execution, or reporting and no access to identifiable human
      data. The CDC IRB has determined that the CDC is not engaged in human subjects research in
      this cooperative agreement.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Fine particle aerosols will contain greater numbers of viral copies than will coarse
           aerosol particles.

        -  Clinical symptoms and signs, including fever can be used to predict viral aerosol
           shedding

        -  Fine aerosols will contain culturable virus indicating that the fine aerosols are
           infectious

        -  Aerosol shedding will correlate with virus load measured by nasopharyngeal and throat
           swabs

        -  Presence of active cough during sampling will be associated with increased aerosol
           shedding with a stronger correlation to be found with coarse than fine particle virus
           aerosols

    <description>Participants will sit for 30 minutes with their face inside the cone/funnel of the Gesundheit-II (G-II)human bioaerosol collector (McDevitt JJ et al. Aerosol Sci Technol 2013, in press). Subjects are free to tidal breathe, cough, and talking. A conventional slit impactor collects particles &gt; 5.0 μm. Condensation of water vapor is used to grow remaining particles for efficient collection by a 1.0 μm slit impactor and be deposited into a buffer-containing collector. Samples are assayed by RT-PCR and viral culture. The method was previously used to assess effectiveness of surgical masks for containing influenza virus aerosols (Milton DK, et al. PLoS Pathogens 2013, in press).</description>

    <measure>Correlation of exhaled virus in community acquired and experimental infection</measure>

    <description>These data will be used to compare subjects with community acquired influenza with donor subjects artificially infected with influenza in EMIT-Work Package 3 and with recipient subjects exposed the the donors. We will test the hypothesis that the donor subjects in EMIT-WP3 produce similar amounts of viral aerosol as do community acquired infection cases. We will also examine whether recipients exposed only to aerosols differ from those exposed by contact and large droplet as well as aerosol routes with respect to exhaled aerosol virus.</description>
