    <textblock>
      This is a 20-week study consisting of a 12-week multicenter, randomized,double-blind adaptive
      study to compare efficacy and safety of Qizhitongluo Capsule,Naoxintong Capsule and placebo
      in the recovery phase of ischemic stroke with qi deficiency and blood stasis syndrome, and a
      8-week post-treatment safety follow-up.After 312 patients complete 12 weeks of treatment
      there will be an interim analysis.
