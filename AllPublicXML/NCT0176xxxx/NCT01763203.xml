  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a newly-developed outpatient clinic and community-based
      care intervention called SUCCEED (Secondary stroke prevention by Uniting Community and
      Chronic care model teams Early to End Disparities) for improving control of stroke risk
      factors among stroke patients in the Los Angeles County &quot;safety net&quot;, and to measure the
      costs of running such an intervention, relative to usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals randomized to the intervention arm will receive care from a team that consists of
      a care manager(CM) who is either a nurse practitioner (NP) or physician assistant (PA),
      supervised by the site PI, and a community health worker (CHW). The CM will follow care
      protocols developed by the research team. The CHW will serve as a liaison between the patient
      and the health care system, and mobilize resources and system support to reduce social
      isolation and improve stroke risk factor control self-management, through a series of
      workshops and home visits. Intervention participants will receive home blood pressure
      monitors. Subjects in either arm are eligible to receive their usual source of care. Five
      hundred participants who have had a stroke or TIA will be enrolled, randomized to the
      intervention or to usual care in a 1:1 ratio, and followed for 12 months. The impact of the
      intervention on systolic blood pressure is the primary study outcome; secondary outcomes are
      other stroke risk factors. Enrollment will occur at four sites in Los Angeles County, and the
      study sample is projected to include over 90% socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals
      from minority groups.
