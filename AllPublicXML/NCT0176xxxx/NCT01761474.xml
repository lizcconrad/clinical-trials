  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography(ERCP) and related procedures can cause
      abdominal pain and discomfort. Some clinical trials have indicated, using the visual analogue
      scale (VAS) score, that CO2 insufflation during ERCP ameliorates the suffering of patients
      without complications, compared with air insufflation. However, differences in patient
      suffering between CO2 and air insufflation after ERCP depending on sedation protocols have
      not been reported. We therefore planned prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled
      study with CO2 and air insufflation during ERCP depending on sedation protocol.

    <arm_group_label>1. Carbon dioxide insufflation with BPS</arm_group_label>
    <description>Both midazolam (0.05 mg/kg body weight; 1 mg if age[70 or ASA class III-IV) and fentanyl (50 lg; 25 lg if age[70 or ASA class III-IV) were given intravenously at the initiation of sedation. Thereafter, repeated doses of 10-20 mg propofol were administered to achieve a moderate level of sedation. Maintenance of sedation was also performed with repeated doses of 10-20 mg propofol.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>2. Carbon dioxide insufflation with Propofol</arm_group_label>
    <description>Sedation was induced by intravenous bolus injection of propofol (0.5 mg/kg body weight; 10 mg if age[70 or ASA class III-IV), followed by repeated doses of 10-20 mg propofol to induce sedation. Repeated doses of 10-20 mg propofol were then administered to maintain adequate sedation, according to the desired sedation depth and patient risk profile.</description>

        The study had an 80% power to detect a 20% difference in PAIN score any two groups,
        assuming 2-sided tests at a 5% significance level.Assuming a 10 % dropout rate, 220
        patients were needed.
