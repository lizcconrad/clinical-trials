    <textblock>
      This is an open label, 3 + 3 dose escalation study, to determine the MTD, safety, efficacy
      and PK profiles for subjects with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies when using CC-292
      and lenalidomide combination therapy. Subjects will be followed for disease progression and
      collection of second primary malignancy (SPM) events. This dose escalation will be followed
      by an exploratory expansion phase in 3 cohorts of 12 patients each.
