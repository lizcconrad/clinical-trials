  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumescent local anesthesia is a procedure which is frequently performed for plastic cosmetic
      surgical procedures such as liposuction. The subcutaneous adipose tissue is infiltrated with
      large volumes of a solution which also contain local anesthetics. However local anesthetics,
      can also lead to a marked production of methemoglobin. New generation pulse oximeters are
      able to measure SpMetHb non-invasivly.

      The aim of this study is:

        1. to investigate multi-wavelength pulse oximetry as a monitoring method for patients at
           increased risk for methemoglobinemia.

        2. to illustrate MetHb concentrations over a course of 24 hours after a liposuction
           employing tumescent anesthesia has been carried out.
