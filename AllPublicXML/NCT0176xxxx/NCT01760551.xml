    <textblock>
      The American Medical Association's (AMA) Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment is
      used to rate loss of function and determine compensation and ability to work after injury or
      illness. The AMA Guides are used by many different systems to determine compensable levels of
      impairment. However, there are few studies that evaluate reliability or construct validity.
      (1) In the professional community there exists considerable controversy regarding the
      accuracy and usefulness of the AMA Guides. (2,3) Commentaries have noted that the AMA Guides
      do not provide a valid, reliable, evidence-based system for the rating of impairments. (4)
      Some have argued that the impairment ratings do not reflect an individual's actual loss of
      function and quality of life (QOL). The AMA guides 5th edition was based on loss of range of
      motion (ROM). The new 6th edition of the AMA guides is based on diagnosis and inclusion of
      functional outcomes assessments in the determination of impairment ratings. (5) In the
      orthopaedic literature the use of patient-derived, objective outcome measures has
      substantially expanded QOL instruments are categorized as general health or as
      condition-specific questionnaires. The Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) is a
      general health-based survey of quality of life. It has been validated and is used widely
      across medical disciplines. (6) The SF-36 was constructed to survey health status in the
      Medical Outcomes Study. It was designed for use in clinical practice and research, health
      policy evaluations, and general population surveys. The SF-36 was constructed for
      self-administration by persons 14 years of age and older, and for administration by a trained
      interviewer in person or by telephone. (7) The SF-36 is perhaps the most widely used
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) survey instrument in the world today. It is comprised
      of 36 items that assess eight health concepts: physical functioning, role limitations caused
      by physical health problems, role limitations caused by emotional problems, social
      functioning, emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, pain, and general health perceptions.
      Physical and mental health summary scores are also derived from the eight RAND-36 scales. (8)
      The aim of this study is to determine the amount of correlation between the by orthopaedic
      surgeon objectively calculated percentage of impairment scored by the American Medical
      Association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment and the by patient subjectively
      indicated health-related quality of life scored by the SF-36.

      Hypotheses: Because of and inclusion of functional outcomes assessments in the determination
      of impairment ratings the AMA guide 6th edition will have a better correlation with the
      SF-36. The 6th edition of the AMA guide is based on diagnosis en yield lower impairment
      percentages than the AMA guide 5th edition that is based on loss of ROM. The SF-36 will have
      better correlation with the impairment ratings for lower extremities injuries than for upper
      extremities because it is less valid for the upper extremities.
