    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis is characterized by decreased bone strength and it is prevalent among
      postmenopausal women but also occurs in men and women with underlying conditions or major
      risk factors associated with bone demineralization. Its chief clinical manifestations are
      vertebral and hip fractures, although fractures can occur at any skeletal site.The World
      Health Organization (WHO) operationally defines osteoporosis as a bone density that falls 2.5
      standard deviations (SD) below the mean for young healthy adults of the same gender—also
      referred to as T-score of -2.5. Postmenopausal women who fall at the lower end of the young
      normal range (a T-score of &gt;1 SD below the mean) are defined as having low bone density
      (osteopenia) and are also at increased risk of osteoporosis. More than 50% of the fractures,
      including hip fractures, among postmenopausal women occur in this group.

      Teriparatide is one of the most effective treatment options for osteoporosis. But the cost of
      teriparatide is prohibitively expensive and in countries like India with limited personal
      resources of the individuals, its not a feasible option in the majority of the patients with
      severe osteoporosis. The investigators aim to compare weekly versus daily teriparatide
      therapy in an open label non inferiority trial and if successful, the investigators
      anticipate, the cost of treatment could be reduced considerably so that treatment becomes
      more affordable to a larger number of patients. Also with weekly therapy, number of multiple
      injections could be brought down.
