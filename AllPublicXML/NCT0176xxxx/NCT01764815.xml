    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide proof-of-concept that directional stimulation, in an
      intraoperative setting, is perceivable in a subject and is different from omnidirectional
      stimulation. The tests will be performed using a dedicated DBS lead connected to external
      neurostimulator.

               -  Functional disability due to tremor was not adequately controlled by medication
                  for at least 3 months prior to implant.

          -  Person has given his/her written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:
