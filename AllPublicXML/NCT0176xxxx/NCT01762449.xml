  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary intent of this study is to add to the body of knowledge on scleroderma patients
      with interstitial lung disease. While lung disease is recognized as the leading cause of
      death amongst patients with scleroderma, there is not a large body of literature describing
      the long-term morbidity and mortality rate of these scleroderma patients. For this reason,
      the investigators are following participants of the Scleroderma Lung Study (NCT00004563)
      after their participation in that study was concluded. In addition, the investigators will
      assess if the subjects who received one year of oral cyclophosphamide in the Scleroderma Lung
      Study experienced progression of their scleroderma-related lung disease following the end of
      the study.

      Retrospective and prospective data will be collected about patients who participated in the
      Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS). An attempt will be made to include all of the participants of
      the Scleroderma Lung Study, who were reported as alive at the end of that study.

      A total of 158 subjects (79 per treatment arm) were randomized on the original Scleroderma
      Lung Study. Of those, 109 subjects completed the study. A single telephone interview with the
      participants to assess the occurrence of severe events and a review of the participant's
      medical records may be conducted. The outcome information will be combined with information
      collected about all participants in the SLS study. The data being collected includes
      information on mortality, development of cancers, development of organ failure, and
      performance status.
