        <title>Adjusted Geometric Mean Maximum Drug Concentration (Cmax) of Midazolam With and Without the Coadministration of Belatacept - Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population</title>
        <description>Samples for the assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) and their metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Adjusted geometric mean for midazolam with and without belatacept, along with adjusted geometric mean ratios for Days 4, 7, and 11 versus Day 1, respectively, are presented. Cmax measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).

        <description>Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail component metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. The poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 was excluded from summary of Dextrorphan parameters. Inje cocktail component metabolites were each measured using HPLC with MS/MS detection.

Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. The poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 was excluded from summary of Dextrorphan parameters. Inje cocktail components were each measured using HPLC with MS/MS detection.</description>

          <description>Plasma half-life (T-HALF) was measured in hours (h). Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. The poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 was excluded from summary of Dextrorphan parameters. Inje cocktail components were each measured using HPLC with MS/MS detection.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Geometric Mean Area Under the Concentration Time Curve (AUC) From Zero to Last Concentration (0-T) and AUC Extrapolated to Infinity (INF) of Midazolam With and Without the Coadministration of Belatacept - Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>AUC(0-T): area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to the last time of the last quantifiable concentration and AUC (INF): AUC from time zero extrapolated to infinite time were measured in ng*h/mL. Samples for the assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) and their metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Adjusted geometric mean for midazolam with and without belatacept, along with adjusted geometric mean ratios for Days 4, 7, and 11 versus Day 1, respectively, are presented. Midazolam measured using HPLC with MS/MS Detection.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Geometric Mean AUC (0-T) and AUC (INF) of Losartan With and Without the Coadministration of Belatacept - Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>AUC (0-T): area under the concentration curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration and AUC (INF) extrapolated to infinity were measured in ng*h/mL. Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) and their metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Adjusted geometric mean for losartan with and without belatacept, along with adjusted geometric mean ratios for Days 4, 7, and 11 versus Day 1, respectively, are presented. Inje cocktail components (losartan) measured using HPLC with MS/MS Detection.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Geometric Mean AUC (0-T) and AUC (INF) of Omeprazole With and Without the Coadministration of Belatacept - Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>AUC(0-T): Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration and AUC (INF): AUC extrapolated to infinity were measured in ng*h/mL. Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) and their metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Adjusted geometric mean for omeprazole with and without belatacept, along with adjusted geometric mean ratios for Days 4, 7, and 11 versus Day 1, respectively, are presented. Inje cocktail components (omeprazole) measured using HPLC with MS/MS Detection.</description>

          <title>Adjusted Geometric Mean AUC (0-T) and AUC (INF) of Dextromethorphan With and Without the Coadministration of Belatacept - PK Evaluable Population</title>
          <description>AUC(0-T): area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the time of the last quantifiable concentration and AUC (INF): AUC extrapolated to infinity, were measured as ng*h/mL. Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) and their metabolites (1'-hydroxy-midazolam, E-3174, 5-hydroxyomeprazole, dextrorphan, and paraxanthine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Adjusted geometric mean for dextromethorphan with and without belatacept, along with adjusted geometric mean ratios for Days 4, 7, and 11 versus Day 1, respectively, are presented. The poor metabolizer of CYP2D6 was excluded from the statistical analysis. Inje cocktail components (dextromethorphan) measured using HPLC with MS/MS Detection.</description>

          <description>Samples for assessment of plasma concentrations of Inje cocktail components (midazolam, losartan, omeprazole, dextromethorphan and caffeine) were collected at time = 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours relative to the dosing of belatacept on Day 4 and Inje cocktail dosing on Days 1, 4, 7, and 11, respectively. Inje cocktail components were each measured using HPLC with MS/MS detection. AUC (0-T) and AUC (INF) were measured as ng*h/mL.</description>

AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Events captured from Day 1 (pre-dose) to last day prior to discharge (Day 46 ±2).
