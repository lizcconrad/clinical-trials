    <textblock>
      Health education is being used as a key preventive tool in the prevention of chronic diseases
      such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, mental illness, neurological disturbances as well as
      dental diseases.

      Amongst the dental diseases, dental caries is a high prevalence chronic childhood disease
      having long term growth and developmental implications . A number of educational programs
      have been utilized to decrease its prevalence especially in disadvantaged communities.

      Dental caries is a complex interplay of a number of risk factors such as demographic
      (socioeconomic status, race, etc.) behavioral, dietary and cultural factors. Among the
      dietary intake, the most significant risk factor has been a high frequency intake of sugary
      foods and drinks.Patterns of sugar intake are established early in life and sugar intake
      increases in the first two years of life.

      Early feeding practices and lack of oral hygiene maintenance have been identified as risk
      factors for caries in subsequent years. Maternal education can prove to be protective against
      dental caries by way of child's dietary practices.

      Research has also indicated a reduction in prevalence of caries in children whose parents
      were previously participants of an oral health educational program.

      Educating mothers about oral hygiene and feeding practices before the child transitions from
      exclusive milk diet to a variety of foods in an important time to exert a positive influence
      on dietary intake of child and overall oral health.
