  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine whether the burden of comorbidities measured by CIRS-G
      (Cumulative Illness Rate Scale) is associated with a non-amelioration of the health related
      quality of life measured by questionnaire called &quot;SF-36&quot;, six months after a transcatheter
      aortic valve replacement in older patients. During the comprehensive geriatric assessment
      realized before the valve implantation, the following data are recorded and their impact of
      the health related quality of life will also be analysed: comorbidity, age, depression,
      functional status, the cognitive impairment and malnutrition.
