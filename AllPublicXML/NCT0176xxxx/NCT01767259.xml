  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to compare the rate and extent of absorption of valsartan and
      hydrochlorothiazide following oral administration as a fixed dose combination tablet and
      concomitant administration of the individual drugs under fasting conditions in healthy
      Egyptian subjects. The study was extended to investigate any potential reaction between VAL
      and HCT.

    <textblock>
      This study comprised 2 separate parts, I and II; each was a single-dose, open-label,
      4-crossover periods separated by a 2 weeks washout, and 4-Treatments. Part I consisted of
      Treatments A (VAL 160 mg alone), B (HCT 12.5 mg alone), C (VAL 160 mg + HCT 12.5 mg) and D
      (VAL / HCT 160 mg/12.5mg) and Part II consisted of Treatments E (VAL 320 mg alone), F (HCT 25
      mg alone), G (VAL 320 mg + HCT 25 mg) and H (VAL / HCT 320 mg/25 mg). Blood samples were
      collected up to 48 hours postdose and plasma was analyzed for VAL and HCT concentrations
      using HPLC. The pharmacokinetic properties of each drug after co-administration of VAL and
      HCT were compared with those of each drug administered alone.

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for the duration of study, an expected average of 6 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Tolerability was assessed based on changes in vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and heart rate), measured before dosing in each period and approximately every 4 hours thereafter, and laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, liver function, and urinalysis), and performed at baseline and at the end of the study. In addition, a physician questioned volunteers about any adverse events occurring during the study, addressed them as necessary, and recorded them on the appropriate form. This physician was not blinded to treatment, but had no involvement in the study.</description>
