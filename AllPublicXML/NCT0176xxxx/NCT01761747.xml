      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness of
      an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.
      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not
      yet approved ponatinib for use in patients, including people with your type of cancer.

      In order to participate on this study, it must first be determined whether or not a patient's
      lung or head and neck squamous cell cancer (SCC) has an alteration in FGFR kinase is made
      from an experimental test on your squamous cell cancer tissue sample. This experimental test
      is a &quot;genetic test&quot; or &quot;genotyping test&quot;, which is a method used to study a tumor's genes.
      The results are for research purposes only and are not considered &quot;genetic testing&quot; for the
      purpose of diagnosing medical conditions. Cancers develop as a result of changes that occur
      in human genetic material (DNA); these changes are called mutations or alterations. This
      experimental test gives no information about any of the genes in the normal cells of the
      patient's body, but it helps identify abnormal genes (like FGFR kinase mutations or
      alterations) usually found only in cancer cells. We will use this experimental test to
      determine whether or not a tumor contains a required alteration/mutation and thus may respond
      to ponatinib.

      Ponatinib is an investigational, oral anti-cancer drug designed to inhibit abnormal proteins
      found in cancer cells and may cause those cancer cells to die. In laboratory testing,
      ponatinib has been shown to inhibit a family of proteins called FGFR kinases, and this
      genetic alteration/mutation has been found in some squamous cell lung cancers. There is
      laboratory evidence that alterations/mutations in FGFR kinases in squamous cell lung cancers
      may be driving the growth of these tumors and that inhibiting these FGFR kinases with
      ponatinib may decrease or stop the growth of lung SCC.

      In this research study, we are looking to see if the study drug, ponatinib, can keep cancer
      from growing.

      Patients will be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can
      be in the research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular
      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that an individual does not take part in the
      research study. If a patient has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or
      may not have to be repeated. These screening tests include: medical history, physical
      examination, vital signs, performance status, assessment of tumor(s), CT scan or MRI scan of
      brain, routine blood tests, urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and
      electrocardiogram. Additionally at the time of screening patients will undergo collection of
      an archival tumor tissue sample for tumor mutation testing.

      If a patient takes part in this research study, he or she will be given a study drug-dosing
      calendar for each treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 4 weeks during which time the
      patient will be taking the study drug by mouth daily. The number of cycles the patient will
      receive will depend on how the patient is tolerating the ponatinib and if your cancer has
      worsened.

      There is a possibility that the following tests or procedures may need to be done at times
      other than those listed below. These may be done if the research doctors determine they are
      medically necessary to monitor illness or any side effects a patient may be experiencing. It
      is important that patients call their research doctor if at any time they are experiencing
      side effects they cannot tolerate.

      During all cycles patients will have a physical exam and be asked questions about their
      general health and specific questions about any problems that they might be having and any
      medications they might be taking.

      If the patient's disease progresses while you are on this study, they will be given the
      option of consenting to a new biopsy for research purposes at no financial cost to the
      patient.

      The investigators would like to keep track of your medical condition for the rest of each
      patient's life. The investigators would like to do this by calling every six months to see
      how the patients are doing. Keeping in touch with checking their condition helps the
      investigators look at the long-term effects of the research study.
