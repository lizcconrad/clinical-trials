  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the
      GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals candidate pneumococcal vaccine containing PhtD in healthy
      elderly population aged 18-45 years of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety profile of the PhtD vaccine will be assessed in comparison to a comparator vaccine
      (Pneumovax 23TM). In order to further increase the immune response to vaccination, a novel
      adjuvant system will also be examined.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes will comply with the requirements of the
             protocol should be enrolled in the study.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 18 and 45 years at the time of the first
             vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Free of obvious health problems as established by medical history and clinical
             examination before entering into the study.

          -  If the subject is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., either
             surgically sterilized or one year post-menopausal; or, if of childbearing potential,
             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions for 30 days
             prior to vaccination, have a negative pregnancy test and must agree to continue such
             precautions for two months after completion of the vaccination series.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine.

          -  Current serious neurologic or mental disorders.

          -  Inflammatory processes such as known chronic active infections.

          -  All malignancies (excluding non-melanic skin cancer) and lymphoproliferative disorders
             diagnosed or treated actively during the past 5 years.

          -  History of administration of an experimental vaccine containing 3-deacylated
             Monophosphoryl Lipid A (MPL) or Quillaja saponaria 21 (QS21).

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrolment. All vaccines can be administered to persons
             with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with or
             without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., Oral temperature &lt;37.5°C or Axillary
             temperature &lt;37.5°C.

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality, as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening
             tests, at the discretion of the investigator.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  History of chronic alcohol consumption and/or intravenous drug abuse.
