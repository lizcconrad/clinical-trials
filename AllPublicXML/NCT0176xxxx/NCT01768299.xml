  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind randomized controlled trial to compare a shorter interval between the
      administration of mifepristone and misoprostol (simultaneous administration compared to
      24hours from administration of mifepristone to receipt of the first dose of misoprostol) for
      termination of pregnancy up to 13-22 weeks of gestation. The investigators hypothesize that a
      shortened interval may achieve comparable efficacy in terminating pregnancy, whilst reducing
      the duration of the procedure and in turn, the duration of hospitalization.

    <description>All women will receive study packet one containing mifepristone to swallow at home on study day 1. They will be told to return to the hospital for induction and will be scheduled to return to the hospital 24 hours later. Upon their return, they will be hospitalized and receive another study packet containing a placebo. Simultaneously, they will receive one dose of 400 mcg buccal misoprostol. Women will remain hospitalized and receive repeated doses of 400 mcg buccal misoprostol every three hours.
Participants will receive up to eight doses of misoprostol (e.g. 3200 mcg misoprostol) over 24 hours. Misoprostol dosing will stop when both the fetus and placenta are expelled.</description>
