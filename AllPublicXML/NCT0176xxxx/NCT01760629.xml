  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole body cooling improves survival with normal neurological outcome after neonatal
      encephalopathy in high-income countries. However, cooling equipments used in the high-income
      countries are expensive and unsuitable for wider use in low and middle-income countries
      (LMIC). We had previously conducted a randomised controlled trial of whole body cooling using
      phase changing material in south India. Although cooling was provided, there were wide
      temperature fluctuations.

      Aim: To examine efficacy of the low technology cooling equipment (Tecotherm-HELIX) in
      administering effective and stable whole body cooling in encephalopathic infants.

      Methods: After informed parental consent (and ethical approvals), we will administer 72 hours
      of whole body cooling (rectal temperature 33 to 34C) to a total 50 encephalopathic infants
      (aged &lt;6 hours) admitted to the neonatal units at Calicut Medical College and Madras Medical
      College, over a six month period. To induce cooling, the infants will be kept on the cooling
      mattress. Temperature will be continuously measured for 80 hours using a rectal probe
      connected to a digital data logger.

      The primary outcome will be the effective cooling time i.e. percentage of time (95% CI) for
      which the temperature remains between 33 to 340C during the intended cooling period.
