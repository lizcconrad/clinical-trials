  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD) and
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) study of orally administered lomitapide in healthy male
      Japanese and Caucasian subjects with elevated LDL-C. The purpose for this study is to
      evaluate the PK and PD of lomitapide in Japanese subjects as compared to Caucasian subjects.

          -  1. Subject is a healthy male Caucasian or Japanese, aged 20 - 45 years, inclusive, at
             screening.

             2. Subject has a BMI of 18.5 - 30 kg/m2 inclusive at screening.

             3. Subjects must have a screening LDL-C measurement and the mean of Day 5 and Day 6
             measurements greater than or equal to 120mg/dL.

             4. Subjects must agree to use acceptable methods of contraception (details provided in
             the protocol)

             5. Subjects must be capable of understanding and complying with the requirements of

             hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, haematological, endocrinological, metabolic,
             neurological, psychiatric or other disease.

             prior to admission (Day -1) or within less than 10 times the elimination half-life of
             the respective drug, or anticipated concomitant medication during the treatment
             periods.

         11. Use of any substance inhibiting CYP3A4 enzymes within 2 weeks prior to admission (Day
             -1).

         12. Donation of more than 500 mL of blood within 90 days prior to drug administration.

         13. Subjects who smoke more than 10 cigarettes or equivalent amount of tobacco per day
             and/or who cannot stop smoking for the duration of the study whilst in the CPU.

         14. Treatment with herbal supplements during the 7 days prior to dosing, or use of
             vitamins during 48 hours prior to admission (Day -1).

         15. Any circumstances or conditions, which, in the opinion of the PI, may affect full
             participation in the trial or compliance with the protocol.
