  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic Organ prolapse (a feeling of bulge in the vagina) may cause some distressing symptoms
      such as loss of control of the bowel or bladder, and may also cause problems with patient's
      sex life. The primary treatment is surgery. Sacral Colpopexy is the gold standard procedure.
      Now it could be done laparoscopically. Modified total pelvic floor reconstructive surgery
      with mesh is developed in China for Asian Women.

      This study is designed to determine the effectiveness and safety of Modified total pelvic
      floor reconstructive surgery with mesh compared with laparoscopic Sacral Colpopexy for the
      treatment of uterine or vault prolapse Stage III-IV.

      Patients enrolled into the study will be followed up for up to 3 years after surgery.
      Evaluation will take place during surgery and postoperative visit. Stage of prolapse before
      and after surgery, patient satisfaction through quality of life and sexual function
      questionnaires before and after surgery, and peri-operative complication rates will be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem. The high rate of failure has led to an increasing
      use of synthetic grafts to augment vaginal repair procedures to obtain more durable results.
      In 2005, the investigators began to perform modified pelvic floor reconstruction surgery with
      mesh. The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data showed that it was safe,
      efficient and cost-effective. No severe intraoperative complications were recorded and the
      recurrence rate after 1 year follow-up was 8.1%. Quality of life improved significantly from
      the baseline, while the sexual function did not change.

      Sacral colpopexy has long been regarded as the gold standard. Laparoscopic sacral colpopexy
      could offer durable result and low morbidity compared with open procedure.

      In clinical practice, many women have symptomatic POP-Q Stage III-IV uterine or vault
      prolapse, which requires surgical correction. The aim of this multicenter, prospective and
      randomized study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these two procedures in the
      treatment of symptomatic apical prolapse Stage III-IV in China.
