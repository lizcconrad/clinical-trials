  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have shown that adding an internet behavioral weight loss program to a
      statewide campaign improves weight loss outcomes. However, our follow-up data suggest that
      once the intervention is stopped, participants begin to experience weight regain. Thus, the
      purpose of this project is extend this line of work and pilot test health coaches and
      monetary incentives for weight loss maintenance. The investigators hypothesize that coaching
      and incentives will improve longer-term weight outcomes.
