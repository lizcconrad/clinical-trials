  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to control the current national outbreak of Carbapenem-resistent
      Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP). In Israel, the death rate among CRKP carriers is 3.5 times
      higher than in Carbapenem-sensitive Klebsiella pneumonia carriers (44% vs. 12.5%,
      respectively).

      In the investigators' previous study: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of
      Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) Using Oral Gentamicin and Oral Polymyxin E for
      Eradication of CRKP Carriage (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2012;33:14-19) the investigators
      have shown that the investigators' SDD regimen is effective for decolonization patients
      colonized with CRKP.

      The investigators' assumption is that a higher dose of polymyxin E together with gentamicin
      (SDD drugs) for a prolonged period is needed to overcome the likelihood of a high rate of
      drug inactivation in the gut, thereby reaching CRKP carriage eradication.
