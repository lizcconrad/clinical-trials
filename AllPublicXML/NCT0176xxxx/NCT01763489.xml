      Background: The ASSIST tool is a graphical tool to represent and evaluate the applicability
      of a surgery trial to improve the translation of research to practice.

      Objective: To evaluate the impact of the ASSIST tool on the interpretation of the
      applicability of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the field of digestive cancer
      surgery.

      Design: This study is a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants:
      Surgeons who contribute to the assessment of manuscripts as experts (peer-reviewer) for
      international scientific journals of surgery (Annals of Surgery, Archives of Surgery,
      Gastrointestinal Surgery World Journal of International Journal of Surgical Oncology).

      Intervention: Surgeons will be randomized into 2 groups. A group that will evaluate a case
      vignette (synopsis) of a randomized trial in surgery, and the other group that will evaluate
      the same case vignette with the representation of the external validity of the trial with
      ASSIST tool.

      Outcome measures: Participants will indicate on a numeric scale range from 1 to 10 if they
      feel able to judge the applicability of the trial for 1) patients, 2) centers, 3) surgeons
      and 4) intervention.

      Sample Size: 28 case vignettes with randomized trials and their ASSIST tool have been
      developed and evaluated. The inclusion of 130 participants (65 per arm) is required.

      The study will be conducted in 2 steps:

      In a first step, investigators will develop cases vignettes of published RCTs evaluating
      surgical interventions in the field of digestive cancer with its representations of external
      validity according to ASSIST.

      In a second step, investigators will invite a panel of peer reviewers to appraise the
      external validity (applicability) of selected RCTs without and with the graphical tool
      (ASSIST), on a security web site.
