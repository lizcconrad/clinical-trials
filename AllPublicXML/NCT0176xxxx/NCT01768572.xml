      Primary Objective:

      To assess, in the same study, the safety of sarilumab and tocilizumab in participants with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were inadequate responders to or intolerant of tumor necrosis
      factor (TNF) antagonists.

      Total study duration was up to 34 weeks: Screening up to 28 days, treatment phase of 24
      weeks, and post-treatment follow-up of 6 weeks.

      After completion of the treatment phase of this study, participants were eligible to enter a
      long term safety study (LTS11210) for active treatment with SAR153191 (REGN88).

    <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug and does not necessary have to have a causal relationship with treatment. All adverse events that occurred from the first dose of the study drug administration up to 60 days after the end of treatment visit were considered as TEAEs. Serious AE (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly or a medically important event. A summary of SAEs, all other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, are reported in AE section.</description>

Screen failures were mainly due to failure to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization of participants were stratified by region and screening value of absolute neutrophil count. Assignment to treatment arms was done centrally using an Interactive Voice/Web Response System in 1:1:2 (sarilumab 150 mg q2w: sarilumab 200 mg q2w: tocilizumab q4w). 202 participants were randomized.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: HAQ-DI is consisted of 20 questions in 8 domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip; activities are rated on a 4-point scale where 0=best and 3=worst. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered, ranging from 0 to 3, where 0 = no disability and 3 = very severe, high-dependency disability.</description>

It ranges from 0-10 with a lower score indicating less disease activity. A DAS28-CRP above 5.1 indicates high disease activity, whereas a below 3.2 indicates low disease activity and below 2.6 as disease remission.</description>
