    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to confirm if two formulations of cephalexin tablets are
      bioequivalent.

      Test product was Ceporex® (1 g Cephalexin; GlaxoSmithKline) and reference product Keflex® (1
      g Cephalexin; Eli Lilly). The single dosage was one tablet.

      The study was prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02
      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods, under fasting conditions.

      The population was composed of 26 healthy volunteers, both genders, adults between 18-40
      years.

      The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical
      comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations
      in blood.
