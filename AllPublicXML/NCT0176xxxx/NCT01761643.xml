  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CCTG 595 is a controlled, open-label, two-arm, randomized (1:1) clinical demonstration
      project to determine if the use of a text-message based adherence intervention (iTAB)
      improves retention and adherence to PrEP compared to standard of care (SoC) PrEP delivery.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 400 HIV-uninfected men who have sex with men (MSM)and male to female (M to F)
      transgender individuals with recent high-risk transmission behavior will be enrolled into the
      study. Each subject will be followed for up to 48 weeks after enrollment of the last subject.
      The primary endpoint will be measured at 48 weeks.

      All subjects will start PrEP with TDF + FTC fixed dose combination given once daily. Subjects
      will be randomized (1:1) to either the iTAB text messaging adherence reminder intervention
      with SoC or the SoC alone arm. Subjects placed into the iTAB intervention arm will receive a
      personalized, automated texting system to maintain adherence and retention. Both groups will
      receive access to PrEP in accordance with standardized comprehensive methods of prescribing,
      risk reduction counseling, adherence counseling, and clinical assessments that include safety
      monitoring, as well as HIV and STD screening.

      TDF 300 mg + FTC 200 mg fixed dose combination will be given orally once daily starting at
      the baseline visit (month 0) and continued throughout the study.

    <description>CCTG 595 will compare adherence to fixed dose TDF/FTC, between subjects randomized to receive SoC plus text message reminders versus SoC, when used for pre-exposure prophylaxis among MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition.
The primary adherence endpoint will be a binary endpoint (Yes/No) based on DBS samples from two visits (week 12 visit and the last on-drug visit over the 48 weeks). Both visits should have a detectable TFV-DP level &gt; 719 fmol/punch (consistent with taking four or more doses per week) to be considered adherent. If the last on-drug visit was at week 12 (i.e. the subject had only one DBS sample), adherence will only be determined by that sample. If a subject discontinued study before week 12 (i.e. had no DBS samples at all), the subject will be considered non-adherent.</description>

    <measure>Factors associated with poor adherence</measure>

    <description>Determine factors associated with poor adherence/lost to PrEP in study participants (outcomes of &lt; 90% adherent on drug at 48 weeks by ACTG 4 day recall or discontinuation of drug). Factors associated with poor adherence to TDF/FTC will include demographics, ongoing substance use, untreated mental illness, socioeconomic status, low health/HIV and system literacy, fear of disclosure and non-English language.</description>

    <description>This proposal will perform a study of potential methods to improve adherence and retention by evaluating standard procedures versus the use of the iTAB platform.
All subjects will receive SoC that will include health education, clinical assessments, laboratory safety monitoring, STI and HIV screening, HIV risk reduction counseling, assessment of psycho-social barriers, adherence counseling, and completion of a computer based survey.</description>

    <description>Subjects assigned to the iTAB intervention will receive daily dosing reminders that will be sent for the first 6 weeks and then continue with reminders for the duration of the study.
Subjects will have visits with the study coordinator to introduce the iTAB texting system.
Once the time is identified, the text reminder system is automated. Patients will confirm medication taking via text responses to the personalized reminders. If a participant does not respond on three consecutive occasions, a high alert message (chosen by the participant) will be sent. If the subject does not respond to this message, the study coordinator would initiate phone calls to contact the subject and explore barriers.</description>
