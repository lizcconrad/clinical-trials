  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to refine the cantharidin-induced blister assay in healthy
      volunteers as a model of inflammatory disease. The study is an experimental trial in healthy
      volunteers in two parts; Part 1 to optimise the model and Part 2 to validate using two
      anti-inflammatory treatments with different modes of action.

      The purpose of this study is to refine the cantharidin-induced blister assay. The
      cantharidin-induced skin blister assay may be a valuable tool for evaluation of the
      pharmacodynamic effects of novel anti-inflammatory drugs in healthy volunteers, particularly
      for novel concepts targeting neutrophilic or monocytic inflammation. The study is an
      experimental trial in healthy volunteers for the purpose of evaluating the variability
      (between subjects and within subject) of the size and contents (cellular and fluid) of
      blisters induced on the forearm by direct application of cantharidin. Specifically, the aim
      is to assess whether variability is reduced in the current study, in which cantharidin will
      be applied directly to the skin in order to minimise the variation in total skin exposure.
      Once experimental design has been optimised then Part 2 of the study will examine the effects
      of a course of anti-inflammatory treatment prior to induction of blisters on the size and/or
      contents of blisters in a single blind crossover protocol.

             excluded

          -  For prednisolone only: if a subject has not had chicken pox previously
