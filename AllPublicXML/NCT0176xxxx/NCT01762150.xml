  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the effectiveness of sorafenib combined
      with gemcitabine plus cisplatin in the treatment of patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic collecting duct carcinoma(CDC) of the kidney. The safety of each treatment will
      also be studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collecting duct carcinoma(CDC) of the kidney is a rare and aggressive neoplasm of the distal
      collecting tubules for which there is no established treatment. Since the histology of
      collecting duct carcinoma is similar to that of urothelial carcinoma, a prospective phase II
      trial in France(2007) studied gemcitabine plus cisplatin as the first-line treatment of
      advanced CDC, resulting an effective rate of 26%. The targeted drugs can produce definite
      efficacy on renal clear cell carcinoma, but the data on targeted drugs for the treatment of
      renal advanced collecting duct carcinoma is limited. We sponsored this study based on the
      assumption that targeted drugs combined with chemotherapy can produce additive, positive
      effects in CDC.
