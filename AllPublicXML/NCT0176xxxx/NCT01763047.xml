    <description>Near time controlled LogMAR Visual Acuity was carried out binocularly using High lumiance and High Contrast, at 40cm under 250 cd/m^2. The test was presented under the condition High Luminance (250cd/m^2) High Contrast (90%).</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Corneal Staining Grade 3 or Higher</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was evaluated in 5 corneal regions (Central, Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior) using Sodium Fluorescein strips. The Fluorescien strip was lightly placed on the subject's inferior palpebral conjunctiva. The corneal Staining was graded using the scale Grade 0: No Staining, Grade 1: Trace(Minimal superficial staining or stippling), Grade 2: Mild (Regional or diffuse punctate staining), Grade 3:Moderate(Significant dense coalesced staining, corneal abrasion or foreign body tracks.), Grade 4 Severe(Severe abrasions greater than 2 mm in diameter, ulcerations, epithelial loss, or full thickness abrasion.). The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher and those subjects with less than Grade 3 for the maximum grade of corneal staining across all 5 regions.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Limbal Conjunctival Redness Grade 3 or Higher</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>The Limbus refers to the 1 to 2mm wide zone of conjunctiva and underlying tissue adjacent to where the cornea joins the sclera. Limbal Conjuctival Redness was graded in 4 regions (Nasal, Temporal, Inferior and Superior) using the Efron Grading Scale in 1 unit increments. Grade 0: Normal, Grade 1: Trace, Grade 2: Mild, Grade 3: Moderate, Grade 4: Severe. The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher Limbal Conjuctival Redness, and those subjects with less than Grade 3 for the maximum grade of all 4 regions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Eyes With Bulbar Conjunctival Redness Grade 3 or Higher</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>Bulbar Conjunctival Injection was assessed in 4 regions (Nasal, Temporal, Inferior and Superior) using an Efron Grading scale by 1 unit increments. Grade 0: Normal, Grade 1: Trace, Grade 2: Mild, Grade 3: Moderate, Grade 4:Severe. The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher Conjunctival injection, and those subjects with less than Grade 3 for the maximum grade of all 4 regions.</description>

    <measure>CLUE Overall Quality of Vision Using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>8-12 days post wear</time_frame>
    <description>CLUE Overall Quality of Vision is assessed using the Contact Lens User Experience (CLUE)TM questionnaire. CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD).</description>

        <description>Corneal staining was evaluated in 5 corneal regions (Central, Inferior, Nasal, Temporal and Superior) using Sodium Fluorescein strips. The Fluorescien strip was lightly placed on the subject’s inferior palpebral conjunctiva. The corneal Staining was graded using the scale Grade 0: No Staining, Grade 1: Trace(Minimal superficial staining or stippling), Grade 2: Mild (Regional or diffuse punctate staining), Grade 3:Moderate(Significant dense coalesced staining, corneal abrasion or foreign body tracks.), Grade 4 Severe(Severe abrasions greater than 2 mm in diameter, ulcerations, epithelial loss, or full thickness abrasion.). The data was dichotomized into two group subjects with grade 3 or higher and those subjects with less than Grade 3 for the maximum grade of corneal staining across all 5 regions.</description>

CLUE is a validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaire to assess patient experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicate a more favorable/positive response. 97% of the scores fall within 0 and 120 (mean +/-3XSD).</description>
