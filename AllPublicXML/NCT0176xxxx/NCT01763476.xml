  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is both a poor life expectancy and a poor prognosis of limb salvage in those patience
      with stenoses or occlusions of the lower limb (TASC Consensus). To date only a small number
      of these patients could be helped through medication or surgery. In fact within the first
      year following diagnosis of a critical limb ischemia 25% of patients lose their leg and 90%
      have to undergo a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) or bypass surgery. Using PTA
      for treatment of long infrapopliteal artery lesions, stenosis reoccurs in 70% to 80% of cases
      3 months after index procedure. Even the use of drug-eluting balloons leads only to 1-year
      primary patency rates up to 30%.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the performance of atherectomy followed by
      a drug-coated balloon angioplasty over drug-coated balloon angioplasty alone in long de-novo
      infrapopliteal lesions in a prospective, single-center, randomized clinical trial.

      This is a single-centre, prospective, randomized study to be conducted in Bad Krozingen
      (Germany). A total of 80 subjects will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a
      1:1 basis to either drug-coated balloon angioplasty or atherectomy and drug-coated balloon
      angioplasty for infrapopliteal use in subjects with long de-novo stenosis (≥6cm) and
      symptomatic peripheral artery disease (Rutherford 3, 4, or 5). IVUS of the target lesion
      prior and after intervention will be performed in 15 patients of each group during index
      procedure. All subjects will undergo a repeat angiography at 3 months to assess the primary
      endpoint of In-Segment Binary Restenosis. Follow-up visits are scheduled at 3, 6, 12 months.
