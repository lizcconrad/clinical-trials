      The objective of this study is to compare the relative efficacy and safety of the test
      formulation Clindamycin 1%/Benzoyl Peroxide 5% Topical Gel (Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to the
      marketed formulation Duac® Topical Gel (Clindamycin 1%/Benzoyl Peroxide 5%) (Stiefel) in the
      treatment of the inflamed lesions of acne vulgaris. Both the test and reference formulations
      will also be compared to a placebo formulation to test for superiority.
