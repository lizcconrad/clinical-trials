      The purpose of this study is to examine the drug-drug interaction effects of ciprofloxacin,
      itraconazole, and rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of lumacaftor in combination with
      ivacaftor as well as to evaluate the potential effects of lumacaftor in combination with
      ivacaftor on lung function.

          -  Abnormal renal function as defined at screening

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days before study drug
             administration

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days or 5 half-lives (or as
             determined by the local requirements, whichever is longer) preceding the first dose of
             study drug

          -  Known hypersensitivity or prior adverse reaction to ciprofloxacin, or any member of
             the quinolone class of antimicrobial agents (Cohort 1 only); itraconazole, or to any
             of the other azoles (Cohort 2 only); rifampin, or to any of the rifamycins (Cohort 3
