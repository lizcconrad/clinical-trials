    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether raltegravir is effective in preventing
      progression of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis as determined by gadolinium- enhanced
      MRI.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is accumulating research evidence that Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) and herpes
      viruses (in particular Epstein-Barr Virus) are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple
      sclerosis. People with active MS have higher levels of HERVs than people either without MS or
      who have other neurological conditions. It has been shown that HERVs may produce neurotoxic
      proteins/antigens associated with MS activity and disease progression. This is the first
      clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that the antiretroviral drug raltegravir may
      suppress HERV activity and ameliorate progression of relapsing remitting MS. Raltegravir is
      an integrase inhibitor which blocks retroviral replication. A recent experimental study
      suggests that raltegravir may also be active against herpes viruses.

      Eligible participants (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be observed for 3 months having
      monthly brain Gadolinium enhanced MRIs and blood/urine/saliva sampling (baseline). Then they
      will be treated with raltegravir (one 400mg pill taken twice a day) for 3 months. During
      treatment period participants will continue to have monthly MRIs and blood/saliva/urine
      sampling. Participants will have monthly clinical and neurological examinations and they will
      complete questionnaires assessing response to treatment. Participants will have screening and
      study visits at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel. Monthly MRIs will be performed at the
      Institute of Neurology at Queens Square, London.

    <measure>Change in Score on Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). This a Composite Score Based on the Measurement of Time in Seconds for the Three Separate Measurements.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and monthly until month 6.</time_frame>
    <description>Explore preliminary clinical responses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis subjects treated with Raltegravir, compared with baseline as measured by Patient Reported Outcomes (Questionnaires). The MSFC is a composite score consisting of the standardly derived composite score from 9-hole peg test (9HPT), timed walk and PASAT scores. 9HPT is measured as timed speed to complete the task; higher scores indicate less disability. The 25-foot walk is measured as timed speed; higher scores indicate less disability. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. It is a timed speed test measured in seconds. In the PASAT a lower score indicates less disability.</description>

    <measure>Changes in Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and monthly to month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis. The scale has been developed by John F. Kurtzke. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. 0 = Normal 1-1.5 = No disability, but some abnormal neurological signs 2-2.5 = Minimal disability 3-4.5 = Moderate disability, affecting daily activities, but you can still walk. A lower score indicates less disability.
5-8 = More severe disability, impairing your daily activities and requiring assistance with walking 8.5-9.5 = Very severe disability, restricting you to bed 10 = Death EDSS scores were measured monthly over 6 months and the mean of the measurements for the first three months (baseline) was recorded to use calculate the change from baseline compared with the mean of measurements taken monthly during the second three months (treatment).</description>

    <measure>Percent of Subjects With Scans Free From Enhancing Lesions in Raltegravir Treated Subjects vs. Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This measure is the cumulative percentage of subjects who had scans free from Gd enhancing lesions during the first three months (baseline) compared with the second three months (treatment). These percentages are expressed as a total percentage for the baseline and for the treatment periods.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Number of Adverse Events Per Patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening to six months</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be assessed by blood and urine sampling; collection of patient reported symptoms and neurological and physical exams.
This measure is the total number of adverse events recorded for each type of event during the study period. The number of participants is 31 which is the number screened and enrolled in the study. Eleven participants did not meet the criterion for baseline i.e. having a gadolinium enhancing lesion on MRI at the baseline visit and therefore did not continue to the baseline observation period. The adverse events for the 11 participants who did not begin the study observation period were recorded during the screening period and added to the 20 participants who were studied during the 6 months of the study. Adverse events are recorded as total number during the study period. Each patient may have had more than one adverse event.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Effect of Raltegravir Therapy on Specific Inflammatory Marker of MS Activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured by Human C-Reactive Protein (HCRP) which is a measure of general inflammation. The higher the value the more inflammatory response is present. The HCRP was measured monthly for six months. The mean value for the baseline three months was compared with the mean value taken for the second (treatment) three months.</description>

        <description>Explore preliminary clinical responses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis subjects treated with Raltegravir, compared with baseline as measured by Patient Reported Outcomes (Questionnaires). The MSFC is a composite score consisting of the standardly derived composite score from 9-hole peg test (9HPT), timed walk and PASAT scores. 9HPT is measured as timed speed to complete the task; higher scores indicate less disability. The 25-foot walk is measured as timed speed; higher scores indicate less disability. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. It is a timed speed test measured in seconds. In the PASAT a lower score indicates less disability.</description>

        <title>Changes in Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score</title>
        <description>The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis. The scale has been developed by John F. Kurtzke. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. 0 = Normal 1-1.5 = No disability, but some abnormal neurological signs 2-2.5 = Minimal disability 3-4.5 = Moderate disability, affecting daily activities, but you can still walk. A lower score indicates less disability.
5-8 = More severe disability, impairing your daily activities and requiring assistance with walking 8.5-9.5 = Very severe disability, restricting you to bed 10 = Death EDSS scores were measured monthly over 6 months and the mean of the measurements for the first three months (baseline) was recorded to use calculate the change from baseline compared with the mean of measurements taken monthly during the second three months (treatment).</description>

        <title>Mean Number of Adverse Events Per Patient</title>
        <description>This outcome will be assessed by blood and urine sampling; collection of patient reported symptoms and neurological and physical exams.
This measure is the total number of adverse events recorded for each type of event during the study period. The number of participants is 31 which is the number screened and enrolled in the study. Eleven participants did not meet the criterion for baseline i.e. having a gadolinium enhancing lesion on MRI at the baseline visit and therefore did not continue to the baseline observation period. The adverse events for the 11 participants who did not begin the study observation period were recorded during the screening period and added to the 20 participants who were studied during the 6 months of the study. Adverse events are recorded as total number during the study period. Each patient may have had more than one adverse event.</description>

          <description>This outcome will be assessed by blood and urine sampling; collection of patient reported symptoms and neurological and physical exams.
This measure is the total number of adverse events recorded for each type of event during the study period. The number of participants is 31 which is the number screened and enrolled in the study. Eleven participants did not meet the criterion for baseline i.e. having a gadolinium enhancing lesion on MRI at the baseline visit and therefore did not continue to the baseline observation period. The adverse events for the 11 participants who did not begin the study observation period were recorded during the screening period and added to the 20 participants who were studied during the 6 months of the study.
