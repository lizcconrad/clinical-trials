      The Bio-enteric Intra-gastric balloon (BIB) has been shown to be an effective treatment for
      weight reduction in obese patients. This study will determine the feasibility of using BIB in
      the treatment of patients with Non alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). It will evaluate the
      efficacy of the BIB in improving histology of NASH in obese patients.
