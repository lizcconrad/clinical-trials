  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are clusters of abnormal blood vessels in the brain
      and spine. CCMs can bleed and cause strokes, seizures, and headaches. In some patients, CCMs
      affect the blood brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is the body's separation of blood and its
      contents in the brain from the brain tissue itself. Abnormal leakiness or permeability of
      this barrier can cause disease. We will measure the permeability (leakiness) of the BBB using
      a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique called dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCEMRI).
      The purpose of this study is to look at whether statin medications change the permeability
      (leakiness) of the blood brain barrier in CCM patients. Statin medications are used to lower
      cholesterol levels and prevent heart attack and stroke. In addition, this medication may
      decrease the risk of brain hemorrhage or bleeding in patients with CCM. This study will
      examine whether the permeability of the BBB changes following the administration of
      simvastatin for three months.
