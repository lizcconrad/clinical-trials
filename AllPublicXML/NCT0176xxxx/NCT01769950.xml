  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nodal involvement among patients with prostate cancer is known to be a poor prognostic
      factor. Traditionally, the presence or absence of nodal disease in patients with prostate
      cancer is ascertained with the use of anatomical imaging methods such as computed tomography
      (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

      However, the sensitivities of CT and MRI for the detection of pelvic nodal disease is rather
      low, with reports placing the value to lie between 50-80%.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) with the use of carbon-11 or fluorine-18 tagged choline
      (Choline-PET) is an approach which is known to deliver a high sensitivity for the imaging of
      prostate cancer disease burden in the primary, nodal and the metastatic areas.

      The investigators in this prospective trial intend to utilize Choline-PET among all newly
      diagnosed patients of prostate cancer who are presumed to be non-N1 (absence of nodal disease
      on conventional imaging) and non-M1 (absence of metastatic disease on conventional imaging).
