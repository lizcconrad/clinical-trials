  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3b study is to assess the effects of combination therapy with
      naltrexone SR/bupropion SR (NB) used in conjunction with a comprehensive lifestyle
      intervention (CLI) and in a manner consistent with its intended use after marketing approval,
      on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors compared to the effects of Usual Care in
      subjects who are overweight with dyslipidemia and/or controlled hypertension or obese.
      Subjects in the NB and CLI group are required to undergo an evaluation to continue treatment
      at Week 16. Subjects are to be discontinued from full participation if they do not lose at
      least 5% of their body weight relative to baseline and/or are experiencing sustained
      increases in blood pressure (systolic or diastolic) of ≥10 mmHg above baseline. At Week 26,
      subjects originally assigned to Usual Care switch to treatment with NB and CLI, and subjects
      assigned to NB and CLI continue treatment for the duration of the study (78-weeks treatment
      period).

    <description>Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Questionnaire (IWQOL-Lite) is a self-reported assessment of perceived effect of weight on quality of life. It consists of 31 items organized in 5 domains (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress and work). IWQOL-Lite total score is based on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the poorest and 100 the best quality of life and where a score of 71-79 indicates moderate impairment.</description>

BES scores were categorized as follows: None = Scores ≤17 indicated no significant binge eating, Moderate = scores from 18 to 26 (inclusive), Severe = scores ≥27 indicated severe levels of binge eating.</description>
          <population>The Week 26 Per Protocol (PP) population comprised subjects from the mITT population (i.e., ITT subjects with their Week 2 study visit, with baseline [BL] and at least 1 post-BL body weight measured) who had completed the study through Week 26 in compliance with the protocol. Subjects in the NB + CLI group had to be on study medication at Week 26.</population>

        <description>Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite Questionnaire (IWQOL-Lite) is a self-reported assessment of perceived effect of weight on quality of life. It consists of 31 items organized in 5 domains (physical function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress and work). IWQOL-Lite total score is based on a scale from 0 to 100, with 0 representing the poorest and 100 the best quality of life and where a score of 71-79 indicates moderate impairment.</description>
