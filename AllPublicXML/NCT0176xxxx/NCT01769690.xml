  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a within-subject randomized cross-over design to evaluate the effects of
      DBS on sleep architecture, as measured by polysomnography, and on wake-time vigilance, as
      measured by a virtual reality street-crossing simulator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, we will use a within-subject randomized clinical trial to measure
      objective changes in sleep architecture with DBS &quot;on&quot; and to compare effects of different DBS
      stimulation parameters on sleep architecture as measured by sleep studies. The study design
      will allow us to address our hypothesis that low frequency deep brain stimulation parameters
      are more effective than the conventional settings at improving sleep architecture and
      wake-time vigilance. If our hypothesis is correct, low frequency settings could be used
      during sleep and this would prolong stimulator battery life, therefore decreasing the
      frequency of required surgical battery changes for DBS. These data will be valuable in
      considering clinical treatment strategies and provide insight into the basic mechanisms of
      sleep dysfunction in PD. The study may also contribute to understanding how to achieve
      maximum clinical benefit from DBS while minimizing morbidity and cost.

    <description>2 sleep study options Phase I: Participants will undergo 2 sleep studies, one with the stimulator &quot;on&quot; at the subject's stable, clinically effective settings and one with the stimulator &quot;off.&quot; the order of the &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; nights will be randomized. Although blinding will be attempted, because of the significant motor effects produced with the &quot;on&quot; setting, participants may be able to tell when the DBS is &quot;OFF.&quot; In the second phase, the first sleep study night will be with the stimulator &quot;OFF&quot;. The order of the &quot;HIGH&quot;, and &quot;LOW&quot; frequency nights will be randomized 1:1 and balanced across subjects and will occur on the 2nd and 3rd PSG nights.
Phase II Sleep study evaluation will include three nights of recording: 1) OFF with the stimulator off, 2) HIGH with the stimulator on at the participant's stable and clinically effective settings, and 3) LOW with the stimulator set at a low frequency that uses less energy</description>

    <description>This virtual pedestrian environment is a measure of &quot;real-world&quot; street-crossing behavior. This simulation is composed of an elevated platform that simulates a curb at a street-side and 3 monitors (arranged in a semi-circle) on which the subject, while wearing headtracker equipment, views the virtual environment of bidirectional traffic. When the subject deems it is safe to cross the virtual street, he/she steps off the platform/curb, which activates crossing of the street by a cartoon representation of the participant. The speed of street crossing by the cartoon is determined by each individual subject's walking speed, which is measured prior to the test.</description>

             treatment of PD.

          2. Stable DBS stimulator settings and medication regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to
             the sleep studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known narcolepsy

          2. Other previous surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease(with the exception of
             unilateral STN DBS) including pallidotomy, thalamotomy, or gene therapy procedures.

          4. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea. If obstructive sleep apnea is discovered during the
             first sleep study, the subject will be removed from the study. After they have been
             treated for at least 6 weeks with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), they can
             re-start the study.

          5. Inability to walk without assistance, including a cane, wheelchair, or walker

          6. Cognitive dysfunction that would prevent subject's ability to participate in the
