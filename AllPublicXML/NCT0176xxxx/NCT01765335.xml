    <textblock>
      HF represents a major burden in the developed world. Mortality and rehospitalization rates
      post-discharge in patients admitted with HF may be as high as 15%-30% within 60-90 days,
      respectively. Given that rehospitalization drives much of the cost associated with HF, there
      has been increased interest in predicting risk of rehospitalization as a means to control
      health care costs. These risk stratification models can serve as important clinical tools by
      helping to identify those patients who are at very high risk may be observed more closely or
      treated more intensively. The most important predictors for the combined endpoint of death or
      rehospitalization were admission serum creatinine concentration, systolic blood
      pressure,admission hemoglobin level, discharge use of ACE-Ior ARBS, and Pulmonary disease.
      Other independent predictors during hospitalization of readmission and mortality included low
      admission Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score, high BNP, hyponatremia,
      tachycardia, hypotension, absence of b-blocker therapy, and history of diabetes and
      arrhythmias. Nevertheless, both models fail to provide the treating physician a simple
      decision making tool for predicting which patient is stable enough to be discharged from the
      hospital without a high risk of readmission. The Non Invasive Cardiac System (NICaS, Israel),
      calculates the cardiac output by measuring impedance cardiography in a tetra-polar mode,
      derived from electrodes placed on both wrists or one wrist and the contra-lateral ankle. This
      simple to operate, non-invasive technique was validated in a few studies to be reliable in
      estimation of CO compared to traditional, invasive techniques in different settings including
      HF patients. A previous study demonstrated that parameters derived from this system showed a
      highly significant correlation to echo estimated EF and serum BNP in chronic HF patients and
      were equally able to predict complications in this population. Aim:To assess whether the
      NICaS system can identify high risk HF patient for readmission prior to their discharge
      compared to serum BNP measurement.

      Heart failure represents a major burden in the developed world. Mortality and

      population. Aim:To assess whether the NICaS system can identify high risk HF patient for
      readmission prior to their discharge compared to serum BNP measurement.Methods and
      population:Known HF patients, admitted due to HF exacerbation, will be tested with NICaS
      system in concordance with serum BNP measurement prior to their discharge from the hospital.
      The decision for discharge will be made on clinical ground by the treating physician alone.
      The patients will be tested by NICaS system in the following manner-patches will be attached
      to both patient's wrists, or one wrist and contra-lateral ankle for a period of approximately
      30 seconds. During that time the patient will be seated or supine.3cc of blood will be drawn
      from peripheral vein for BNP level measurement.NICaS parameters and serum BNP levels will be
      processed in an excel sheet. The patients will be followed by a telephone questionnaire after
      3 months from discharge in order to document events of readmission or death.
