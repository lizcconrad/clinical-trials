    <textblock>
      Cesarean deliveries are prevalent. Unlike other operations, quick recovery is required for
      the mother to nurture the newborn child and establishing an appropriate mother-child bonding.
      Therefore, effective pain management is crucial. In this study we would like to compare
      between two pain relievers' administration protocols: (1) pain relievers' administration in
      fix protocol (type of medications, dose and intervals) or (2) pain relievers' administration
      following demand (the same type and doses, however, medications will be given only following
      patient's request).

      The primary outcome will be patient satisfaction, pain control and the necessity of
      additional medications (rescue doses).

      The protocols will be used for the first 48 hours following surgery.
