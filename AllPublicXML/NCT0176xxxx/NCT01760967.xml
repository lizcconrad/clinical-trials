      Background:

      Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective arfa2-adrenergic agonist, is known to be a unique
      sedative agent which causes less acute tolerance, drug addiction and withdrawal compared with
      gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) agonists. Dexmedetomidine was approved for short-term ICU sedation
      in 2004 in Japan, and it has been used particularly for surgical ICU patients. In August 2010
      dexmedetomidine was approved in Japan for sedation lasting more than 24 hours.

      Recent evidence demonstrated that dexmedetomidine has organ protective effects including
      neuroprotection, cardioprotection, renal protection, gastrointestinal tract action, and
      anti-inflammatory action. Dexmedetomidine was shown to significantly decrease the infarct
      size in isolated rat hearts. Additionally, dexmedetomidine exhibited a preconditioning effect
      against ischemic injury in hippocampal slices, and this result was considered an apoptosis
      suppression effect of dexmedetomidine. Aydin C et al reported that dexmedetomidine enhanced
      the spontaneous contractions of the ileum in peritonitis rats compared with propofol and
      midazolam. Taniguchi and colleagues demonstrated that dexmedetomidine reduced high mortality
      rates and the plasma cytokine concentrations, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha
      in endotoxemic rats.

      A meta-analysis has shown that perioperative alfa2-adrenergic agonists, including
      dexmedetomidine infusion, decreased cardiovascular events on patients undergoing cardiac
      surgery. Dexmedetomidine treated patients undergoing thoracotomy indicated increase in urine
      output, reduction in serum creatinine, and the suppression of diuretics in a randomized
      placebo-controlled double-blind study. Septic patients receiving dexmedetomidine had improved
      28-day mortality rates compared with septic patients receiving lorazepam in a sub-group
      analysis of MENDS randomized controlled trial.

      These positive effects of dexmedetomidine on the cardiovascular system, neurons, kidneys,
      gastrointestinal tract action, and an anti-inflammatory action, are expected to improve
      mortality in septic patients. However, large clinical research studies have not been
      conducted yet. We designed and conducted the DESIRE trial (DExmedetomidine for Sepsis in ICU
      Randomized Evaluation trial) to test a hypothesis that dexmedetomidine may improve clinical
      outcome and has these organ protective effects on septic patients.

      Objective:

      To determine whether dexmedetomidine improves clinical outcome and has organ protective
      effects on septic patients.
