  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the possibility of using the drug thioridazine (also called
      Mellaril) to increase the number of certain types of cells moving from the bone marrow to the
      circulation in a group of healthy humans. The types of cells we hope to collect are called
      CD34+ progenitor, or stem cells. These cells can be used in the laboratory to better
      understand a number of diseases and suggest new strategies for therapy. Perhaps the most
      important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues
      that could be used for cell-based therapies, as a renewable source of replacement cells and
      tissues to treat diseases including Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns,
      heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, feasibility study to test whether a single dose of Mellaril
      (thioridazine HCL) is able to effectively mobilize CD34+ cells in a set of health human
      subjects. This study does not involve the use of placebos, and subjects will serve as their
      own controls for CD34+ cell mobilization. We hypothesize that a single dose of Mellaril
      (thioridazine HCL) will mobilize CD34+ progenitor cells into human peripheral blood by a
      factor of at least 10 fold, from 4 to 40 cells/microliter.

    <description>To measure CD34+ cells, a peripheral blood draw is taken from the enrolled subject at hour zero on day one of the study before treatment with oral thioridazine. Following treatment, blood draws are taken at 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours. These blood samples are analyzed using Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-approved flow cytometry for CD34+ cell content. CD34+ cell levels will be reported as a percentage of total white blood cells (WBC) in the blood specimens and the difference between baseline and 8 hours will be reported</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, non-smoking subjects (male or female)

          -  Age: 18 to 55 years

          -  All subjects must agree to refrain from consuming alcohol during for 48 hours after
             taking thioridazine.

          -  Performance status Karnofsky score of 100%.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having not undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

          -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in
