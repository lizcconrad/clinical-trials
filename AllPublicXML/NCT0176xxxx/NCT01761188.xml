    <textblock>
      -  Background:the ablation outcomes for the treatment of persistent atrial fibrillation are
           not as satisfactory as paroxsymal AF. The successful rate ranges from 30%-55%. We found
           a new novel strategy for the modification of LA substrate during sinus rhythm based on
           our pilot study.

        -  Hypothesis: our new method may be more effective than conventional strategy.

        -  Objectives:The primary objective of this investigation is to compare the efficacy of two
           different AF ablation strategies in patients with persistent AF:Study Group: CPVI plus
           electrophysiologic substrate ablation in the left atrium during sinus rhythm (
           STABLE-SR);Control Group: conventional stepwise approach for persistent AF(CPVI + Lines
           +CFE) .The secondary objectives of this investigation are to evaluate and compare the
           safety and procedural characteristics of both groups.

      what's is STABLE-SR approach? In our center, the LA substrate mapping was performed in
      patients with paroxysmal AF and persistent AF during sinus rhythm, particularly 20 normal
      subjects as control group as well. Our study showed that along with the duration of AF the
      average voltage of LA deceased and the area of low voltage zone increased. The whole
      activation time of entire LA would be longer. More complex fractionated electrograms was
      found in LA. Importantly, we identified the low voltage zone (voltage range: 0.1-0.4mV) and
      the transitional zone (voltage range: 0.4-1.3mV) in which most of complex fractionated
      electrograms located. Based on our findings a new novel ablation strategy has emerged, which
      is modification of LA substrate during sinus rhythm (CPVI+STABLE-SR). Our sequential protocol
      included 5 steps. First CPVI should be completed followed by CTI ablation to be blocked. Then
      if AF rhythm maintained cardioversion would be taken. High density mapping of LA substrate
      would be done during sinus rhythm to identify the low voltage zone and transitional zone.
      Linear ablation or/and spot ablation should be designed according to the mapping results.
      Finally bidirectional conduction block should be demonstrated for all the linear lesion and
      all pulmonary veins would be checked for isolation.
