      The investigators performed this study to investigate pain prevention of preoperative topical
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in photorefractive keratectomy(PRK) using time

    <description>Through these postoperative pain score which rated time serially, the effect of pre-treated topical NSAIDs(ketorolac and diclofenac) could be investigated on relieving postoperative pain after PRK.</description>

    <description>On operation day, the patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: group KO,preoperative application of topical ketorolac 0.5% (Acular®, Allergan Inc, Irvine, CA) in one eye and topical ofloxacin 0.3% (Ocuflox®, SamilInc, Seoul, Korea)in the other eye; group DO, topical diclofenac 0.1% (Voltaren®, Novartis, Bern, Switzerland) in one eye and ofloxacin 0.3% in the other eye. Neither the surgeon nor the participants knew which ophthalmic would go to which eye. A randomly assigned ophthalmic was instilled into right eye first three times by 1 minute interval 30 minutes prior to operation and the other ophthalmic was instilled into left eye with the same manner 10 minute later.</description>
