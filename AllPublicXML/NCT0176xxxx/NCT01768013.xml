    <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is based on the investigator's assessment of the disease.
The extent and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis are recorded for three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these are used to calculate PASI. The PASI can range between 0 (best) to 64.8 (worst). m-PASI indicate that the scale is modified.</description>

    <description>Subjects with 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease by investigator's globala ssessment at day 28.
Investigator global assessment (IGA) is based on the investigator's assessment of the disease severity (Plaque thickening, Scaling and Erythema) using a 6-point scale (Clear,Almost clear, Mild,Moderate, Severe, and Very severe). The assessment represents the average lesion severity on the trunk and limbs. IGA can range between 1 (best) and 6 (worst). The assessment is based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation, and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Japanese subjects having understood and signed a written informed consent form prior
             to any study related procedures being carried out (including activities related to the
             wash out period)

          -  20 years of age or above.

          -  Either sex.

          -  Clinical diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris amenable to topical treatment involving arms
             and/or trunk and/or legs.

          -  Psoriasis vulgaris on the trunk/limbs (excluding psoriasis on the genitals/skin folds)
             of not more than 30% body surface area (BSA)

          -  An Investigator's global assessment of disease severity (IGA) on area(s) to be treated
             of moderate, severe or very severe and a m-PASI score of ≥12.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative result for a urine pregnancy
             test at Day 1 (Visit 1) and must agree to use an adequate method of birth control, as
             judged by the (sub)investigator, during the study. The contraceptive method should
             have started an adequate amount of time before the pregnancy test, which is dependent
             on the particular method used and as judged by the (sub)investigator, and must
             continue for at least 1 week after the last application of study medication. A female
             is defined as not of child-bearing potential if she is postmenopausal (12 months with
             no menses without an alter-native medical cause) or surgically sterile (tubal ligation
             /section, hysterectomy or bilateral ovariectomy).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Systemic use of biological treatments with a potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris
             within the following time periods prior to Visit 1:

          -  etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab -3 months.

          -  other products - within 3 months/5 half-lives (whichever is longer).

          -  Systemic treatments with all therapies other than biological treatments with a
             potential effect on psoriasis vulgaris (e.g., corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues,
             retinoids, immu-nosuppressants such as ciclosporin and methotrexate) within 4 weeks
             prior to Visit 1 (use of inhaled and nasal corticosteroids is allowed, use of systemic
             antihistamines is allowed).

          -  Topical treatment of scalp psoriasis with vitamin D analogues (e.g. calcipotriol,
             tacalcitol, maxacalcitol), or very potent WHO group IV corticosteroids within 2 weeks
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  PUVA therapy, UVB therapy or UVA therapy within 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Topical treatment of psoriasis on the face, genitals or skin folds with vitamin D
             analogues (e.g. calcipotriol, tacalcitol, maxacalcitol), or potent or very potent WHO
             group III or IV corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Topical treatment of conditions other than psoriasis with vitamin D analogues (e.g.
             calcipotriol, tacalcitol, maxacalcitol), or potent or very potent WHO group III or IV
             corti-costeroids within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative, guttate or pustular psoriasis.

          -  Clinical signs or symptoms of Cushing's disease or Addison's disease

             cutaneous mycosis) that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis vulgaris.

          -  Planned excessive exposure of treated areas(s) to either natural or artificial
             sunlight (including tanning boths, sun lamps, etc) during the study.

          -  Known or suspected disorders of calcium metabolism associated with hypercalcaemia
             (subjects with results for albumin-corrected serum calcium above the reference range
             from the sample taken at the Washout/Screening Visit.

          -  Severe renal insufficiency, severe hepatic disorders or severe heart disease.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to components of the investigational products.

          -  Current participation in any other interventional clinical study

             agent which has not yet been made available for clinical use following registration)
             within the 4-week period prior to Visit 1 or longer, if the class of substance

             breast-feeding

          -  Patients suspected of being unable to comply with the study protocol, e.g. due to
             alcoholism, drug dependence or psychotic state.

        <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is based on the investigator's assessment of the disease.
The extent and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis are recorded for three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these are used to calculate PASI. The PASI can range between 0 (best) to 64.8 (worst). m-PASI indicate that the scale is modified.</description>

          <title>Efficacy: Percentage Change in m-PASI From Baseline to Day 28</title>
          <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) is based on the investigator's assessment of the disease.
The extent and severity of redness, thickness and scaliness of psoriasis are recorded for three regions (arms, trunk and legs) and these are used to calculate PASI. The PASI can range between 0 (best) to 64.8 (worst). m-PASI indicate that the scale is modified.</description>

        <title>Efficacy: Subjects With 'Clear' or 'Almost Clear' Disease by Investigator's Global Assessment at Day 28.</title>
        <description>Subjects with 'clear' or 'almost clear' disease by investigator's globala ssessment at day 28.
Investigator global assessment (IGA) is based on the investigator’s assessment of the disease severity (Plaque thickening, Scaling and Erythema) using a 6-point scale (Clear,Almost clear, Mild,Moderate, Severe, and Very severe). The assessment represents the average lesion severity on the trunk and limbs. IGA can range between 1 (best) and 6 (worst). The assessment is based on the condition of the disease at the time of evaluation, and not in relation to the condition at a previous visit.</description>
