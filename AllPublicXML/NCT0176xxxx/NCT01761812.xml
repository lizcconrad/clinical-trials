  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the ability of several new MRI techniques (MR
      elastography, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadofosveset, and oscillating gradient
      diffusion) to determine the location, size, and grade of prostate carcinoma. Thirty patients
      with biopsy proven carcinoma awaiting prostatectomy will be included in the study. Ex-vivo
      MRI will also be conducted on the prostate specimen to obtain high resolution imaging
      correlates to both in-vivo MRI and whole mount prostatectomy specimens. The investigators
      hypothesize that the addition of these three techniques will increase the accuracy,
      sensitivity, and specificity of MRI for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer.
