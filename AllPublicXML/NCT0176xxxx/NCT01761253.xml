      This study will involve the evaluation of the cost profile of about approximately 241,000
      patients (15,000 who are members of the Generations Plus/ Northern Manhattan Health Network
      AND 226,000 members of a large self insured union trust fund). We will test the hypothesis
      that as comorbidity scores exceed three-four, patients will have an exponential increase in
      average yearly cost with a parallel exponential increase in cost variability.

      We will examine the relationship between comorbidity and health insurance costs and
      variability in costs among patients enrolled in health plans.
