      The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy and safety of H-Coil rTMS in comparison
      to a sham H-Coil rTMS in older patients with treatment-resistant major depressive
      disorder.Subjects will be randomized to receive H1-Coil rTMS or sham H1-Coil rTMS. The acute
      treatment phase will last four weeks. Treatment is administered daily, 5 days per week (i.e.,
      20 treatments). Depressive symptoms will be assessed using the HDRS-24. If subjects achieve
      the pre-defined primary outcome criteria of remission (HDRS-24 score &lt; 10 and 60% reduction
      in symptoms) they will continue with twice weekly treatment for two more weeks to ensure the
      durability of the remission. Subjects who do not achieve remission will exit the study after
      the acute treatment phase of four weeks. The blind will not be broken to subjects until the
      completion of the study
