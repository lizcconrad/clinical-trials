  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cells damaged by hyperglycemia are unable to downregulate glucose entrance in presence of
      high extracellular glucose resulting in intracellular activation of deleterious biochemical
      pathways. Expression of GLUT-1, the major glucose transporter in mesangial cells, is
      increased and participates in the induction of diabetic nephropathy. Variants in the gene
      encoding GLUT-1 (SLC2A1) have been associated to this diabetic complication. The aim of this
      study was to test whether polymorphisms in SLC2A1 confer susceptibility to diabetic
      nephropathy in Brazilian type 1 diabetes patients.

      In this study, 449 patients, included between October 2004 and October 2012, were sorted into
      three groups according to diabetic nephropathy stages: without (persistent normoalbuminuria,
      n=248), incipient (microalbuminuria, n=82) and overt diabetic nephropathy (macroalbuminuria
      or proteinuria or renal replacement therapy, n=119). Measurements of urinary
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or urinary albumin excretion rate (UAER) were used to
      define DN: patients with persistent normoalbuminuria (&lt;30 mg/g creatinine or &lt;20 μg/min) were
      classified as without DN (n=248); patients presenting persistent microalbuminuria (30-300
      mg/g creatinine or 20-200 μg/min) were classified as having incipient DN (n=82); and patients
      presenting persistent macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/g creatinine or &gt;200 µg/min), proteinuria
      (&gt;500 mg/24 h) or renal replacement therapy were classified as having overt DN (n=119).
      Genotyping of polymorphisms was performed by Real Time PCR using fluorescent -labelled
      probes.

        449 patients with type 1 diabetes (56.4% female, mean age 36.0±11.0 years) were included
        between October 2004 and October 2012. Inclusion criterion was type 1 diabetes duration ≥10
        years. The patients presented a mixed ethnic background (European Caucasian, African,
        Amerindian and Asian of several different countries of origin), which reflects the
        Brazilian population.
