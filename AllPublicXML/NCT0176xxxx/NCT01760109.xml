  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators plan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Piperacillin Sodium and Sulbactam Sodium for Injection(2:1) for the treatment of respiratory
      and urinary tract acute bacterial infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Piperacillin sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection (2:1)plays a therapeutic role by the
      former inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis，the latter making irreversible competitive
      inhibition of β-lactamase.The antimicrobial effect of Piperacillin can be enhanced by the two
      combined. The compound specifically aims to the mechanism of bacterial resistance, extending
      the life of Piperacillin in the treatment-resistant pathogen infections.
