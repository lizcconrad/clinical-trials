    <textblock>
      A breast biopsy in the operating room may be needed in up to 15% of patients with an
      abnormality on mammogram. When an abnormality is present but there is no palpable mass, the
      abnormality must be localized with a wire before going to the operating room. This technique
      is also used when a breast cancer is present but there is no mass, in order to perform a
      targeted lumpectomy. Once the abnormality is surgically removed, the specimen with the wire
      is taken to the breast imaging department for a specimen x-ray to ensure that the targeted
      abnormality is present within the specimen. If the abnormality is close to the edge of the
      specimen, additional tissue is often removed.

      A newer method for evaluating the specimen is to perform imaging in the operating room.
      Portable digital mammography units are available for this purpose. The Biovision digital
      specimen mammography system is FDA-approved and currently in use in over 200 centers in the
      United States. Several studies have shown that intra-operative digital mammography is as
      accurate as standard specimen mammography and takes less time to perform. It may also
      decrease the chance of having to go back to the operating room to take more breast tissue
      after lumpectomy because of cancer cells near teh margin(s) of the specimen on final
      pathology. Having to go back to the operating room to take more tissue is called a
      re-excision.

      The purpose of this study is to compare standard specimen mammography to intra-operative
      specimen mammography to quantify potential operating room time savings and to determine if
      the use of intra-operative specimen mammography decreases re-excision rates. We aim to see if
      intra-operative specimen mammography is more efficient and if it decreases re-excision rates.

      Before the research starts patients will undergo some screening procedures to determine if
      patients are eligible to participate. This includes a medical history and an assessment of
      the patient's breast abnormality by mammogram and/or ultrasound and/or breast MRI. Patients
      will not need to undergo any extra procedures apart from those needed by the patient's
      surgeon to plan the patient's breast surgery. If the screening process shows that a patient
      is eligible to participate in this research study, the patient will be enrolled and the study
      will proceed on the day of surgery. If a patient does not meet the eligibility criteria the
      patient will not be able to participate in this research study.

      Patients will be assigned to one of two arms of this study on the day of your surgery.
      Because no one knows which of the breast specimen imaging options is best, patients will be
      &quot;randomized&quot; into one of the study groups: the Standard Specimen Mammography arm or, the
      Intra-operative Specimen Mammography arm. Randomization means that the patient is put into a
      group by chance. It is like flipping a coin. Neither the patient nor the surgeon will choose
      what group the patient will be in.

      If the patient is in the Standard Specimen Mammography arm, the patient's breast specimen
      (biopsy or lumpectomy) will be taken to the Breast Imaging department for a mammogram, which
      is the way breast specimens are typically imaged. If the patient is in the Intra-Operative
      Specimen Mammography arm, the patient's breast specimen will be imaged right in the operating
      room at the time of the surgery. The patient's images will also be linked to the Breast
      Imaging department, so the radiologist can confirm the surgeon's findings.

    <description>Assessment of radiographic findings and pathologic findings to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of intra-operative digital specimen mammography (ISM) and standard specimen mammography for determining margin status.
A true positive (TP) was defined as a positive margin by imaging (ISM or SSM) and pathology
A false positive (FP) was defined as a positive margin by imaging but negative by pathology
A true negative (TN) was defined as a negative margin by both imaging and pathology.
A false negative (FN) was defined as a negative margin by imaging but positive by pathology
The sensitivity [TP/(TP + FN)], specificity [TN/(TN + FP)], positive predictive value [TP/ (TP + FP)], and negative predictive value [TN/(TN + FN)] for identification of positive margins were calculated for ISM and SSM.</description>

          <description>The indication for the excision:
An Excisional biopsy is a procedure where the entire abnormality or area of interest is removed.
Atypical Hyperplasia is a precancerous condition that is defined by an atypical accumulation of abnormal cells in the breast.
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast. DCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer.
Invasive Carcinoma is a cancer that began growing in a duct in the breast and has since invaded the fatty tissue of the breast outside of the duct.</description>

          <title>Wire-localization Target</title>
          <description>A thin wire is inserted down to the target area of breast so that during surgery the surgeon can follow the guide wire down to the target area and remove the wire and the tissue around it. A clip is a marker that is placed in the breast during a biopsy that can be used a target for wire insertion. Mass means a solid mass in the breast. Calculated means that the target location was either manually or computer calculated. Architectural distortion (arch distort) is when a mammogram shows tethering or indentation of breast tissue but without an apparent associated mass.</description>

        <description>Assessment of radiographic findings and pathologic findings to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of intra-operative digital specimen mammography (ISM) and standard specimen mammography for determining margin status.
A true positive (TP) was defined as a positive margin by imaging (ISM or SSM) and pathology
A false positive (FP) was defined as a positive margin by imaging but negative by pathology
A true negative (TN) was defined as a negative margin by both imaging and pathology.
A false negative (FN) was defined as a negative margin by imaging but positive by pathology
The sensitivity [TP/(TP + FN)], specificity [TN/(TN + FP)], positive predictive value [TP/ (TP + FP)], and negative predictive value [TN/(TN + FN)] for identification of positive margins were calculated for ISM and SSM.</description>
