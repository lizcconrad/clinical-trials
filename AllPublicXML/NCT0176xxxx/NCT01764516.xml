      This study was carried out with the purpose of evaluating zinc and selenium levels in serum
      of epileptic patients and compare with normal individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients aged 18 to 50 years visiting Vali-Asr hospital in Arak, I.R. Iran, who were
      diagnosed with generalized form of epilepsy by a neurologist for the first time were
      recruited as cases. The control group (n=40) was selected from healthy individuals, in whom
      no disease was diagnosed until this study, and were matched to the case group by age, sex,
      and economical status.
