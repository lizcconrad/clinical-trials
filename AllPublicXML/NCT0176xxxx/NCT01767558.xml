    <textblock>
      PRECISION GOLD is a prospective, multi-center, single arm, unblinded interventional post
      market clinical study conducted in Europe. The purpose of the study is to evaluate
      asymptomatic cerebral embolic (ACE) lesions in subjects with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation undergoing ablation with the Pulmonary Vein Ablation Catheter (PVAC) GOLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      10-12 centers in Europe will enroll up to 56 subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and provide consent to participate in the study. Subjects will undergo an ablation
      for paroxysmal AF with the Medtronic PVAC GOLD (CE-Mark). To assess for ACE lesions, pre- and
      post-ablation procedure cerebral MRIs will be done along with a neurological exam (Mini
      Mental State Exam). Subjects will be followed for 1 month post-procedure when a repeat MRI
      and neurological exam will be conducted if the subject had a positive MRI at pre-hospital
      discharge.

    <description>Pre- and post-ablation MRIs will be evaluated for ACE lesions. If the post-ablation MRI (within 16-72 hours) is positive for ACE, a repeat MRI will be completed at the 1 month visit.</description>

    <description>Acute procedural success is defined as:
Only PVAC GOLD catheters used to achieve pulmonary vein (PV) isolation
All accessible PVs were isolated (entrance block)
Sinus rhythm is restored at the end of the ablation procedure (with or without cardioversion)</description>
