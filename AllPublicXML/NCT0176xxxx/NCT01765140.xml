  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuing project to provide 3,4 diaminopyridine (DAP) under a treatment-use IND
      to patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenia (LEM) and congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of LEM or CMS will have been made based on clinical and electromyographic
      findings, and all patients will have been referred to the PI for DAP treatment. This study
      will enroll minors and adults.

      CMS patients under age 18 years will be included if their parent or guardian gives written
      permission. Minors who turn 18 while in the program will be re-consented as adults.

      The dose of DAP will be determined individually for each patient. Adults will start with a
      dose of 10 mg 3-4 times daily, increasing over several weeks to the dose that produces the
      maximum symptomatic response, not to exceed 100 mg daily. Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) may be
      added at low doses, increasing to the dose that produces the best response, not to exceed 360
      mg daily. In children, equivalent doses of these medications will be given calculated on a
      surface area basis. The doses of DAP and PB will be periodically adjusted to assure that the
      smallest effective doses are used.

      Patients who achieve significant clinical benefit from DAP, as judged by the study PI and the
      patient, may continue taking DAP as long as the drug is available from the sponsor, and as
      long as they return for regular follow-up evaluations at the Duke MG Clinic. Patients who are
      unable to return for regular follow-up will be required to have their local physician obtain
      DAP for them from the sponsor.
