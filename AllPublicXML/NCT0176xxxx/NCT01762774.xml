  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the First Time in Human Study for GSK2256294 and will evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and repeat oral doses
      of GSK2256294 administered to healthy male volunteers (Cohort 1) and otherwise healthy adult
      male moderately obese smokers (Cohorts 2 to 4). Cohorts 1 and 2 will enrol 12 subjects each
      and each subject will take part in four study periods. All subjects will receive placebo
      regimen and three dosing regimens of GSK2256294 in a specified sequence (planned doses 2 mg,
      6 mg and 18 mg in Cohort 1 and 15 mg, 40 mg and 100 mg in Cohort 2). Each study period will
      be followed by a Wash-out period of 7 to 14 days in Cohort 1 and up to 4 weeks in Cohort 2.
      During each study period subjects will be in-house from Day -1 until the 48 hours post dose
      assessments have been completed. Subjects will return to the unit as out-patients for
      remaining post-dose assessments. Subjects will then be followed for 7 to 14 days in Cohort 1
      and up to 3 to 4 weeks in Cohort 2. Total duration of the study for Cohort 1 will be 98 days
      and for Cohort 2 it will be up to 144 days. Cohort 3 and 4 will each recruit 15 subjects. For
      Cohorts 3 and 4, each subject will take part in one treatment period of 18 days (Day-1 to Day
      17) with dosing from Day 1 to Day 14. Subjects will then be followed for 7 to 14 days. Total
      duration of the study for Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 will be 67 days. Dose selection for Cohorts 3
      and 4 will be based on the safety, PK profile and enzyme inhibition obtained in Cohorts 1 and
      2. This study will also evaluate the evidence for a functional effect of soluble Epoxide
      Hydrolase (sEH) in a forearm blood flow (FBF) model.
