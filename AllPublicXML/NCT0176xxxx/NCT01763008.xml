  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of doripenem treatment
      among Filipino patients with nosocomial pneumonia, complicated intra-abdominal infections,
      and complicated urinary tract infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study (all people know the identity of the treatment assigned),
      multi-center (conducted at multiple sites), and observational (study in which the
      investigators/physicians observe the patients and measure their outcomes) study to evaluate
      the safety and effectiveness of doripenem for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia,
      complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infection among Filipino
      patients. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical
      examination, and concomitant medications will be monitored throughout the study. The total
      duration of study for each patient will be approximately for 3 years.

    <description>This is an observational study. Doripenem will be administered as per the recommended dose, ie, 500 mg, intravenously (ie, in the vein), for every 8 hours. Duration of treatment with doripenem: for nosocomial pneumonia including ventilator-associated pneumonia patients: 7 to 14 days; for complicated intra-abdominal infection patients: 5 to 14 days; for complicated urinary tract infection, including pyelonephritis (bacterial infection of the kidneys) patients: 10 days.</description>
