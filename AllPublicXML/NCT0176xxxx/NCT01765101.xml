  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using double blind, randomized controlled design to study the immediate, short-term and
      intermediate-term therapeutic effects of ready-made full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles
      and customized full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles to patients with knee osteoarthritis,
      under the basis of International Classification Functioning, Disability and Health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 90 patients will be collected. The participants will be randomized into two
      groups, including ready-made full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles group and customized
      full-length lateral wedged shoe insoles group. The psychological function (Hospital anxiety
      and depression scale, Graded chronic pain scale, Multidimensional fatigue inventory,
      Fear-avoidance belief questionnaire), physical activity (CHAMPS physical activity
      questionnaire), functional performance (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities
      Osteoarthritis index、Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) and quality of life (World
      Health Organization-Quality of life-Brief Vision、Osteoarthritis Quality of
      Life、Osteoarthritis- Knee and Hip Quality of Life) will be evaluated. Physical functional
      ability (10 meter normal and fast walk, up and down stairs, and 5 repeated chair-rising
      time), pain (Visual analog scale, pain pressure threshold ) and balance performance (static
      postural stability and dynamic stability by Biodex Stability System, including postural
      stability, dynamic limits of stability and fall risk) will be evaluated before and
      immediately after the ready-made full-length shoe insoles and customized full-length shoe
      insoles are prescribed. All the evaluations, including physical functional ability, pain,
      balance, psychological, physical activity, functional performance, and quality of life, will
      be re-evaluated at one month after and three months after modified shoe insoles wearing.
      Subjects and evaluator were both blinded to the group's classification during the whole
      course of study.
