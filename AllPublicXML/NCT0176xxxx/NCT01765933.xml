  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA) has become increasingly popular as a component of dietary
      supplements. It is also used within &quot;party pills,&quot; often in conjunction with alcohol and
      other drugs, and has been associated with untoward effects when abused at high dosages. To
      our knowledge, no studies have been conducted to determine the combined pharmacokinetic
      profile and physiologic responses of DMAA. To conclude on the safety profile of DMAA based
      solely on case reports would be problematic, in particular when accepting testimony from
      patients in uncontrolled environment, potentially under the influence of alcohol and other
      drugs. This is especially true in light of the fact that no prospective studies have shown
      these effects. Hence, the intent of the present study was to determine the pharmacokinetic
      profile of a single 25mg oral dosage of DMAA alone through 24 hours post-ingestion. This
      represents a typical dosage within one serving of many popular dietary supplements containing
      DMAA.

    <description>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity was calculated using the trapezoidal rule extrapolated to time infinity. The terminal half-life (t 1/2) was calculated using 0.693/Lambda z, with Lambda z as the terminal rate elimination constant. Peak concentration (Cmax), lag time (tlag), time of maximum concentration (tmax), apparent volume of distribution during the terminal elimination phase (Vz/F), and oral clearance (CL/F) were also calculated.</description>
