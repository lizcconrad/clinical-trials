  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple finger defects are common in hand trauma and result in functional disability. These
      injuries are often complex and severe, and thus reconstructive alternatives are limited. In
      this study, we use the dorsal homodigital island flaps, based on the dorsal branch of the
      digital artery, for reconstruction of multiple finger defects. At the final follow-up, we
      would evaluate the efficacy of this technique.

      At final follow-up, sensation of the flap and the donor site would be assessed using static
      two-point discrimination and Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing. The range of motion of
      the proximal interphalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joint of the injured finger
      is measured by a goniometer. The cold intolerance of the injured finger is measured using the
      self-administered Cold Intolerance Severity Score questionnaire that is rated into mild,
      moderate, severe, and extreme. The pain of the injured finger and the donor site is given
      subjectively by the patient using the visual analogue scale, which ranges from 0 to 10 cm and
      groupes into mild (0-3 cm), moderate (4-6 cm) and severe (7-10 cm).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. a patient who had separate soft tissue defects in different fingers in same hand;

          2. the defect ≥ 1.5 cm and ≤ 3.5 cm in length;

          3. local tissue near the defect is uninjured; and

          4. a patient between 15 and 60 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. concomitant injuries to local tissue around the defect that precluded its use as donor
             site;

          2. a defect &lt; 1.5 cm and ≥ 3.5 cm in length;

          3. a finger degloving injury;

          4. the defect of the thumb.
