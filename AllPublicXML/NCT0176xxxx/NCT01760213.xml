  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to overcome some of the common barriers to treatment amongst
      recent survivors of traumatic events, by combining the world of evidence-based intervention
      with that of modern Internet technology. Specifically, it aims to test the feasibility and
      effectiveness of an Internet delivery of early-intervention trauma-focused cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Over the
      course of the study the following objectives will be achieved:

        1. The development of an Internet-based Virtual Reality intervention for preventing PTSD
           among patients who have recently experienced a traumatic event.

        2. The evaluation of the feasibility of administering this intervention, and

        3. The evaluation of the efficacy of this Internet based intervention in the prevention of
           PTSD in recent trauma survivors.
