  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the Patient INformation about Options for Treatment (PINOT) Follow-up
      Study are to determine the proportions of patients, identified in the 2009 PINOT cohort that:

      (i)Made the transition to home dialysis, after an initial start on center-based dialysis.

      (ii)Commenced dialysis, or a time-limited trial of dialysis within 3 years, after confirmed
      plans for conservative care.

      The hypotheses to be tested in the PINOT follow-up study are:

        1. 50% of stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients who plan for home dialysis do not
           commence home dialysis within 3 years, and instead remain on centre-based haemodialysis;
           and,

        2. less than 15% of stage 5 chronic kidney disease patients who plan for conservative care
           commence dialysis within 3 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The secondary aims of the follow-up study include:

      (i) To assess the primary reasons patients did not transition to home dialysis, in the
      planned home dialysis group.

      (ii)To compare 3 and 5 year survival rates among patients who commenced conservative care and
      patients who commenced renal replacement therapy.

      (iii) To assess the types of dialysis utilisation over a 5 year time period among the total
      cohort of patients.

      (iv)To determine how renal palliative care services were engaged for conservative care
      patients, and document the patient's place of death (i.e. hospital, hospice, home with
      community palliative care).
