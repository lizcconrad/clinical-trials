    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is condition, sometimes thought of as a group of disorders that can
      involve brain and nervous system functions such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and
      thinking.Cerebral palsy is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these
      problems occur as the baby grows in the womb, but they can happen at any time during the
      first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.Bone marrow derived stem
      cells are known as a effective therapy.

      In this study the investigators evaluate the side effect of multiple intrathecal injection of
      bone marrow stem cell in patients with cerebral palsy.

      In this study,we evaluate the safety of multiple transplantation of bone marrow derived stem
      cells.the children(4-12years)with definite diagnose of cerebral palsy enroll to the
      study.first of all all the physical exam,laboratory test,EEG and MRI is done.after hospital
      admission,the patient underwent bone marrow transplantation.In laboratory,the cells are
      separated and prepared for injection.after 24hours the neurosurgeon inject the
      cells(intrathecal).the patient would be under observed for 48hours.If no allergic reaction or
      abnormal neurological symptoms accrued,patients can be discharged and would be followed up
      1,3 and 6months after injection.at the end of the 6months,the patients would receive second
      injection as same as the previous process.then they are followed at 1,3 immediate local and
      systemic side effect(fever,respiratory distress,erythema,rash,increase of heart rate or blood
      pressure)and neurological symptoms:motor dysfunction,sensory dysfunction,sphincter
      dysfunction,nausea,vomiting,head ache.EEG,MRI,GMFM66
