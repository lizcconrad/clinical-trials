  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about how advanced glycation end-products can
      affect insulin resistance, inflammation and blood vessel health in people with kidney
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are compounds that form when sugars abnormally attach
      to proteins or lipids. High levels of AGEs in the blood may cause inflammation, problems with
      controlling blood sugar, and problems with the health of blood vessels. Many of the foods we
      commonly eat have high amounts of AGEs, which may increase AGEs in the blood of people with
      kidney disease. The amount of AGEs in foods can be lowered when prepared using special
      cooking techniques such as using moist heat or longer cooking times at lower temperatures.
      New research has shown that preparing food in this way can lower inflammation and improve
      blood vessel health in people with normal kidney function.

      In this study, the investigators would like to examine the effect of lowering the AGE content
      of foods on inflammation, blood sugar control, and blood vessel health in individuals with
      mild to moderate chronic kidney disease.

    <description>Participants will be provided specially prepared meals to eat at home for three weeks. During the first week, participants will eat foods that have standard amounts of AGEs in them (this is called the control diet). During the second and third weeks, participants will eat the same foods, only they will be prepared in our kitchen in a way that limits the amount of AGEs in them (called the intervention diet).</description>
