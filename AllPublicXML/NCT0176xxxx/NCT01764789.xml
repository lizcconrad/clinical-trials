      This pilot clinical trial studies stress reduction in improving quality of life in patients
      with recurrent gynecologic or breast cancer. Participating in a stress reduction program may
      help improve quality of life in patients with gynecologic or breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To refine the intervention. II. Test the acceptability, feasibility, and clinical
      appropriateness of the intervention.

      III. To provide a preliminary test of its efficacy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in a multi-component intervention based on cognitive and behavioral
      principles comprising mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an intervention to promote
      hopefulness, and a problem solving approach which navigates around obstacles or generates
      alternatives when goals become blocked. Additional topics may be covered as indicated by
      clinical need and patients goals. Biobehavioral components include addressing social and
      disease-specific quality of life, and pain education. Intensive treatment sessions continue
      weekly for 16 weeks followed by 2 biweekly and 2 monthly maintenance sessions.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 weeks.
