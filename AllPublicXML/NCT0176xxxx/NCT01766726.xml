  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study are to determine whether: a) ART-naïve HIV+ subjects have
      increased artherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability, b) newly-initiated
      QUAD/Stribild therapy will decrease plaque inflammation/vulnerability in these subjects, and
      c) QUAD/Stribild therapy will improve indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction
      as a mechanism of improved plaque inflammation/vulnerability. Parameters of lipid and immune
      function will also be assessed in healthy control subjects, for comparison.

      Patients with HIV are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease
      than healthy subjects. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased the lifespan of
      HIV+ patients, but their risk of CVD remains higher than normal. Previously, it has been
      shown that compared to healthy control subjects, ART-treated HIV+ patients have more
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in the aorta. This study is intended to determine whether
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability is increased in ART-naïve HIV+ patients and
      whether these parameters can be improved through 6 months of newly-initiated QUAD/Stribild
      therapy. Additionally, the study will determine whether indices of immune dysregulation and
      lipid dysfunction are increased in ART-naive HIV+ patients and whether these parameters can
      also be improved through 6 months of newly initiated QUAD/Stribild therapy.

        Subjects with HIV infection being cared for in the Eastern Massachusetts area may be
        appprised of the study by their treating infectious disease doctors. Additionally, subjects
        with HIV infection from the community will be recruited via posters, advertisements,
        e-postings. Healthy control subjects from the community will be recruited via posters,
        advertisements, and e-postings.
