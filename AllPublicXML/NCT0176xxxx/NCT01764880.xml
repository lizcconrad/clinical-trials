  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heparanase cleaves heparan sulfate (HS) chains, a natural substrate for heparanase, and
      participates in degradation and remodelling of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) facilitating,
      among other activities, cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, angiogenesis, and
      inflammation. The heparanase enzyme is a promising target for development of new anticancer
      drugs. HS and the structurally related heparin are present in most animal species. As an
      analogue of the natural substrate of heparanase HS, heparin is considered to be a potent
      inhibitor of heparanase. SST0001 is a polymer with a heparin-like structure. It is a reduced
      oxidized N-acetyl heparin, these modifications cause the reduction of anticoagulant activity
      and are strictly related to the anti-heparanase activity. In preclinical murine models
      SST0001 showed a significant anti myeloma effect in multiple myeloma mice xenograft models,
      with a significant reduction of subcutaneous growth of different multiple myeloma cell lines,
      when SST0001 was administered either alone or in combination with dexamethasone. The purpose
      of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of SST0001 in
      the treatment of advanced refractory multiple myeloma.

      Multicenter, open label, uncontrolled Phase I First In Man trial in advanced refractory
      multiple myeloma, to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of SST0001 given
      subcutaneously (sc) once daily for 5 or 10 days, in a cycle of 28 days. A starting dose of 25
      mg (flat dose) is given once daily for 5 days (from Day 1 to Day 5). In the subsequent cohort
      25 mg are administered once daily for 10 days (from Day 1 to 5 and from Day 8 to 12). Dose
      escalation with SST0001 administered for 10 days is performed in subsequent cohorts,
      depending on toxicities observed.

      Indirect pharmacokinetics based on Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) modifications
      in all patients (minimum of 3 patients in each cohort) during the first cycle of treatment
      and direct SST0001 concentrations measurements.

      Pharmacodynamics in all patients during the first cycle of treatment, based on modifications
      of coagulation parameters.

      During the study any hints of anti-tumor activity will also be evaluated based on use of
      surrogate parameters (monoclonal serum and urine protein modifications).
