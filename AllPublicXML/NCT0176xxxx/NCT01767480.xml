  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robot-assisted training (RT) devices developed to date have a significant impact on stroke
      rehabilitation. Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined their
      efficacy on improving upper limb function after stroke. All these robotic devices have been
      applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific
      evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the optimal treatment intensity, and the
      impact on physiological responses is still lacking.

      This trial is to examine (1) the immediate effects of treatment intensity in RT on
      sensorimotor impairments and functional performance in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the
      long-term benefits of treatment intensity in RT by conducting a 6-month follow up evaluation;
      and (3) the effects of RT on cortical/movement reorganization as well as on the physiological
      markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and erythrocyte deformability. These overall
      findings will help better understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional outcomes, brain
      and movement reorganization, and physiological markers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subacute stroke participants will be recruited from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and then
      were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: RT with higher-intensity group, RT with
      lower-intensity group, and conventional intervention group. Assessments on sensorimotor
      impairments (Fugl Mayer Assessment, Motor Status Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Myoton,
      Muscle Metabolism, Box and Block Test, and Revised Nottingham Sensory assessment) and
      functional performance (Functional Independence Measure, Motor Activity Log, ABILHAND
      Questionnaire, Adelaide Activities Profile, EQ-5D-5L, and accelerometer) take about 40
      minutes to complete. Evaluation of brain reorganization using functional magnetic resonance
      image and movement patterns by kinematic analysis take about 1 hour for each examination.
      Blood samples of the patients (12 ml.) will be collected to examine the physiological markers
      (ie, inflammation-related markers, oxidative stress markers, and erythrocyte deformability)
      before and after intervention. Total 24 ml blood will be collected in this study. Except for
      the blood taking, all the examinations are non-invasive.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The upper limb part of FMA will be used to evaluate sensorimotor impairment. The motor part consists of 33 items for the reflexes and movement of shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, hand, and coordination/speed. The non-motor part consists of 30 items for sensation, passive joint motion, and joint pain of the upper limb. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-2 with a maximum of 66 for motor part and 60 for non-motor (sensory) part. Higher score indicates better sensorimotor function of upper limb.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motor Status Scale (MSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MSS will be used to identify and quantify change of motor function of upper limb after stroke. This scale isolates and grades movement of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist using a 6-point scale (0, -1, 1, +1, -2, 2), ranging from no volitional movement to faultless movement. Scoring for the hand is based on a 3-point scale (0-2). It consists of 2 subscales including shoulder/elbow scale and wrist/finger scale. The subscale of shoulder/elbow scale consists of the sum of measures of 12 shoulder movements and 5 elbow/forearm movements (maximum score = 40). The subscale of wrist/finger consists of the sum for 3 wrist and 15 hand movements and 3 hand-based functional tasks (maximal score = 42).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The MAS is the most frequently used clinical rating scale to measure muscle spasticity. This measure involves manually moving a limb through the range of motion (ROM) to passively stretch specific muscle groups. The grades of spasticity in MAS are as follows: 0=No increase in muscle tone; 1=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release or by minimal resistance at the end of the range of motion when the affected part(s) is(are) moved in flexion or extension; 1+=Slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch, followed by minimal resistance throughout the remainder (less than half) of the ROM; 2=More marked increase in muscle tone through most of the ROM, but affected part(s) easily moved; 3=Considerable increase in muscle tone, passive movement difficult; 4=Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MyotonPRO</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Myoton is a hand-held device measure of three mechanical properties of muscle: tone, stiffness and elasticity. Three measurement parameters in the Myoton: F - Frequency, Hz, characterizes muscle tone; D - Decrement, characterizes muscle elasticity; S - Stiffness, N/m, characterizes muscle stiffness. There have been several prototypes of Myoton. Present study will use MyotonPRO; the basic principle is the same in all prototypes but the MyotonPRO has several updates such as a triaxial accelerometer. Comparing with the single axis accelerometer in the earlier prototypes, MyotonPRO makes it more feasible for application.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle metabolism (NIRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle metabolic dysfunction will be measured by the near-infrared ray spectroscopy (NIRS). The NIRS will be applied to both the affected and the unaffected arms. The NIRS sensor will be fixed on the targeted muscle of one of the forearms and a cuff is placed on the upper arm of the same side. The artery occlusion will be applied by inflating the cuff to a pressure of at least 60 to 80 above systolic pressure to block both venous outflow and artery inflow. The artery occlusion will last approximate 30 seconds then the cuff pressure is released. The decrease rate of oxyhemoglobin and the increase rate of deoxyhemoglobin during artery occlusion can reflect muscle's anaerobic metabolism during vasoconstriction. The hyperaemic response of the muscle during recovery phase can be characterized by reoxygenation rate and recovery time.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Block Test (BBT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The BBT will be used as a test of manual dexterity. There are 150 blocks in a test box. When testing begins, the subject should grasp one block at a time with dominant hand, transport the block over the partition, and release it into the opposite compartment. Instruction of this test is &quot;I want to see how quickly you can pick up one block at a time with your right (or left) hand [point to the hand]. Carry it to the other side of the box and drop it. Make sure your fingertips cross the partition.&quot; The testing time is one minute. Then, the procedure will be repeated with the nondominant hand. After testing, the examiner should count the blocks. The score is the number of blocks carried from one compartment to the other in one minute. Score for each hand will be separately calculated.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Revised Nottingham Sensory Assessment (RNSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The changes on somatosensory function will be determined by the RNSA. This is a standardized tool with good reliability to measure sensory function in the stroke population.The RNSA includes 3 major types of sensation: tactile sensation, proprioception, and stereognostic sense. For the purpose of this study, the regions of upper limb will be selected to be assessed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Independence Measure (FIM)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The FIM consists of 18 items grouped into 6 subscales measuring self-care, sphincter control, transfer, locomotion, communication, and social cognition ability. Each item is rated from 1 to 7 (maximum score 126) based on the required level of assistance to perform the tasks (e.g., 1-complete assistance and 7-complete independence). A low score on any subscale indicates a more severe disability.</description>

    <measure>ABILHAND Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, immediately after the completion of intervention, at a 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The ABILHAND Questionnaire will be used to evaluate the ability of upper limb in bimanual activities. There are 23 bimanual activities to measure subjectively perceived difficulty of patients in performing some common activities in daily living, such as buttoning, cutting nails, and opening a bottle. It scores on a scale of 0-3 (0-cannot perform, 1-performs partially or with great difficulty, 2-performs with some difficulty, 3-performs fully). Its reliability and construct validity has been confirmed.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, immediately after the completion of intervention, at a 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The AAP will be applied to indicate the level of participation in household and community activities. This profile includes 21 activities in the four areas: domestic chores, household maintenance, service to others, and social activities. It scores on a scale of 0-3, with higher score indicating more frequent participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and immediately after the completion of intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument for measuring health status. It consists of the descriptive system and the EQ visual Analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises the same 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). There are 5 levels for each dimension: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labeled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometers</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, immediately after the completion of intervention, at a 6-month follow-up.</time_frame>
    <description>The activity monitors (i.e. accelerometers) will be used to provide a direct and objective measure of the amount of the impaired arm movement outside the laboratory. This measure, quantitatively recording the amount of activity in free-living conditions, will be used to reflect increase in the amount of affected arm use over time. The participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer on each arm for 3 consecutive days to measure what they actually do. The accelerometers to be used will be wireless plastic units about the size and weight of a large wristwatch that will be worn proximal to the wrist on terrycloth bands.</description>

    <description>The CR group will be designed to control for the duration of therapeutic activities. CR will focus on neurodevelopmental techniques with emphasis on functional tasks when possible. The functional training will be designed based on patients' motor capacity and include gross motor and fine motor dexterity training, and transitive and intransitive training. Stretching of the more affected limb, passive and active range of movements, and normalizing muscle tone by applying reflex inhibition patterns, inhibiting abnormal patterns, weight bearing with the affected limb will be applied to assist in functional task practice.</description>

    <description>The Bi-Manu-Track enables the symmetrical practice of 2 movement patterns in conjunction with computer games: forearm pronation-supination and wrist flexion-extension. Each movement has three computer-controlled modes: (1) passive-passive, with both arms being moved by the machine with speed and range of motion individually adjustable; (2) active-passive, with the nonaffected arm driving the affected arm in a mirror-like fashion; and (3) active-active, with both arms actively moving against resistance. The speed of movement, the amount of resistance, and the range of movement can be adjusted individually. The device has a mechanical breaking of the movement when the torques exceeded 4 Nm, emergency breaks in the reach of the patients, skin friendly materials, and minimal risk for contusions.</description>
