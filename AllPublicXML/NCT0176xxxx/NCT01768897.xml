    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CPI-613 when given together with
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone hydrochloride in treating patients with relapsed or refractory
      acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as CPI-613, cytarabine and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. CPI-613 may help cytarabine and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride work better by making cancer cells more sensitive to the drugs

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CPI-613 when administered with
      high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of CPI-613 following intravenous (IV)
      administration in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      II. To observe the response rate (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete
      platelet recovery [CRi] and partial response [PR]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose
      cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      III. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with
      high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CPI-613.

      Patients receive CPI-613 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3
      hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 3, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over
      15 minutes after the 1st, 3rd, and 5th doses of cytarabine. . Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for up to 2 courses* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *Patients undergoing a second course of therapy receive CPI-613 IV over 2 hours on days
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours for 5 doses beginning on day 2, and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the 1st and 3rd doses of cytarabine.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.

             urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior to treatment initiation; (Note: Pregnant
             patients are excluded because the effects of CPI-613 on a fetus are unknown)

             past 6 months, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, pericardial disease or New York Heart
             Association class III or IV), or severe debilitating pulmonary disease, that would
             potentially increase patients' risk for toxicity

          -  Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) or epidural tumor

          -  Any active uncontrolled bleeding, and any patients with a bleeding diathesis (e.g.,

             increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, and
             because there may be unknown or dangerous drug interactions between CPI-613 and
             anti-retroviral agents used to treat HIV infections)

          -  Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their cancer,
             or any other investigational agent for any indication within the past 2 weeks prior to
