        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy male subjects, 18 to 55 years of age and postmenopausal female subjects, 18

          3. Body mass not less than 50 kg.

          4. Medical history, vital signs, physical examination, standard 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG) and laboratory investigations must be clinically acceptable or within laboratory
             reference ranges for the relevant laboratory tests, unless the investigator considers
             the deviation to be irrelevant for the purpose of the study.

          5. Non-smoker or mild to moderate smoker (≤ 10 cigarettes daily).

          6. Females, if:

               -  Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≥ 25.8 mIU/mL AND a serum estradiol
                  level of ≤ 54.7 pg/mL at screening.

               -  Not of childbearing potential, e.g., has been surgically sterilized, undergone a
                  hysterectomy, amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months and considered post-menopausal.

             Note: In postmenopausal women, the value of the serum pregnancy test may be slightly
             increased, but if not increasing upon repeat, the female will be included in the
             study.

             • Not on thyroid hormone replacement therapy or on stable thyroid hormone replacement
             therapy for at least 3 months before the first administration of IMP.

             Not on statin therapy or on stable statin therapy for at least 3 months before the
             first administration of IMP.

             • Blood pressure measurements are within the acceptable ranges; or, if diagnosed with
             hypertension, are on stable therapy for at least 3 months before the first
             administration of IMP.

             Note: Treatment with calcium channel blockers is NOT allowed.

          7. Written consent given for participation in the study. -

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Evidence of psychiatric disorder, antagonistic personality, poor motivation, emotional
             or intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to participate in the
             study or limit the ability to comply with protocol requirements.

          2. Current alcohol use &gt; 21 units of alcohol per week for males and &gt; 14 units of alcohol
             per week for females.

             past year.

          4. Use of any medication, prescribed or over-the-counter or herbal remedies, within 2
             weeks prior to the first administration of IMP, except for medication allowed per
             inclusion criteria (Section 7.3.1) or if the medication will not affect the outcome of
             the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          5. Female hormone replacement therapy (or other medicine containing estrogen, including
             health food products for menopausal symptoms, as these may contain natural estrogens),

          6. Participation in another study with an experimental drug, where the last
             administration of the previous IMP was within 8 weeks before the first administration
             of IMP in this study.

          7. Donation or loss of blood equal to or exceeding 500 mL during the 8 weeks before the
             first administration of IMP.

          8. Treatment within the previous 3 months before the first administration of IMP with any
             drug with a well-defined potential for adversely affecting a major organ or system.
