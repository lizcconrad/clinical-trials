    <textblock>
      This clinical study (non AMG/non MPG) is a contralateral, comparative, randomized,
      prospective, single-center, multi-surgeon, investigator masked study to investigate whether
      the femtolaser cataract surgery causes any significant differences in the resulting Intra
      Ocular Lens overlap (ΔROverlap) as compared to the conventional, manual continuous
      curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). The Intra Ocular Lens overlap (ΔROverlap) is defined as the
      difference between the Intra Ocular Lens center of mass to the capsulotomy aperture center of
      mass.

      A detailed pre-operative examination will ensure that every interested and willing patient
      fulfills the inclusion criteria of this study. For the proposed contralateral eye study
      between 30 and 35 patients will be enrolled whereas one eye will randomized undergo a manual
      cataract surgery and the other one a laser assisted cataract surgery. In total between 60 and
      70 eyes will be included in the study. Pre-operative examinations are included to confirm to
      the clinical practice. Examinations on the day of surgery and any occurrence during the
      procedure are also listed. Post-operative examinations, which should document any occurrence,
      the outcome of and possible differences between the treatment techniques, are to be carried
      out after 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. After 6 month a final report
      including the study results will be produced.

      The study is carried out in compliance with MEDDEV 2.7.1 Evaluation of Clinical Data: A Guide
      for Manufacturers and Notified Bodies, ICH E6 (R1) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Declaration
      of Helsinki as well as the applicable local regulations such as notification requirements and
      current order of profession of the primary investigators.
