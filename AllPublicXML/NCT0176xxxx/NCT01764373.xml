      This is an amendment to study posting NCT00970060. Based on preliminary results from that
      study is was determined there needs to be a follow-up exercise intervention study. This study
      has two additional aims than the original study. The objectives are to determine is a
      prolonged exercise routine, 16-weeks, paired with refined measures of effectiveness
      positively impact people with diabetic neuropathy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change nerve function</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change in nerve function will be quantified using the Total Neuropathy Score (TNS). The TNS is a composite measure of peripheral nerve function that includes grading of signs/symptoms, nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sensory testing. We will not include proprioceptive testing in this project.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in aerobic fitness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Aerobic fitness will be assessed with a graded maximal exercise test as in the previous protocol with a metabolic cart and integrated ECG.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cutaneous innervation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change will be measured after exercise intervention to see what effects exercise has on dermal and epidermal innervation. Change measured via skin biopsy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in maximal workload</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Measured as part of the aerobic fitness assessment. Use of standardized protocol with total body recumbent stepped to be used to obtain the maximal workload.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain experienced</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Pain will be measured using the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. This scale has been specifically validated in this population and consists of 3 pain severity items and a 7-item pain interference scale.</description>
