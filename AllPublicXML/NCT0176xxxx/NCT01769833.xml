      This study proposes to compare the effect of 48 weeks exposure to pegylated interferon alpha
      vs. nucleoside analogue (NA) on hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion and HBsAg levels
      in nucleoside analogue controlled HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who have
      an undetectable hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load at least 1 years.

    <textblock>
      Pegylated interferon after long term NA therapy will potentiate the antiviral efficacy
      directly via its effect on broad antiviral activities and indirectly via activation of innate
      and adaptive immune responses leading to HBeAg seroconversion and eventually HBsAg loss
      and/or seroconversion.
