    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to compare hip adductor strength and obturator nerve
      palsy between acetabular fracture patients whose fracture was reduced and fixated using the
      modified Stoppa approach (subjects) and pelvic fracture patients (controls) using physical
      strength testing, radiographs, clinical assessment, and a validated functional outcome
      questionnaire. The investigators' research hypothesis is that there will be less strength and
      higher incidence of obturator nerve palsy in patients treated with the modified Stoppa
      approach (intervention) than in patients treated without the modified Stoppa approach
      (controls).

        Pelvic fracture patients and patients treated for acetabular fractures with the modified
        Stoppa approach will be asked to consent to a voluntary study investigating physical

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for the subject patient population under study consists of male and
             female adults, at least 18 years old, who had an acetabular fracture that was treated
             with the modified Stoppa approach.

          -  Inclusion criteria for the control patient population under study consists of male and
             female adults, at least 18 years old, who had acetabular fractures with similar
             fracture patterns as the study group that were treated with any other approach than
             the Stoppa approach.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for the subject and control patient population consist of:
