  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind and open-label phase III study is aimed to determine the
      efficacy, tolerance and safety of eltrombopag in Chinese chronic primary immune
      thrombocytopenia (ITP) adult subjects. This study will be conducted in Chinese adult chronic
      ITP subjects who have not responded to or have relapsed after previous treatment for ITP,
      including first line therapy and /or splenectomy.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of oral eltrombopag as a
      thrombopoietic agent treating previously treated chronic Chinese ITP patients comparing with
      placebo. The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when
      administered for 6 weeks to previously treated adult chronic ITP patients comparing with the
      placebo. In addition, the long-term efficacy and safety of eltrombopag treatment will be also
      evaluated in the 24-week extension open-label phase after the double-blind phase as one of
      other study objectives. If the subject benefits from the eltrombopag treatment based on
      investigator's discretion, the subject can continue eltrombopag treatment until the
      commercial launch of eltrombopag in China. Furthermore, to understand the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) profile of eltrombopag and to explore the relationship between the PK and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) (platelet response), a PK/PD analysis will be embedded in this phase
      III study and conducted in the same patient population participated this phase III study.

      investigator's discretion, the subject can continue eltrombopag treatment until the
      commercial launch of eltrombopag in China. Furthermore, to understand the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) profile of eltrombopag and to explore the relationship between the PK and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) (platelet response), a PK/PD analysis will be embedded in this phase
      III study and conducted in the same patient population participated this phase III study.

      Approximately 150 eligible subjects will be randomized to either eltrombopag or matching
      placebo treatment in 2:1 ratio in stage 1(the 8-week double blind stage). Randomization for
      stage 1 will be stratified by splenectomy status (Yes/No), use of concomitant maintenance ITP
      therapy (Yes/No) and, baseline platelet count ( no more than 15×109/L, or &gt;15×109/L). This
      study includes 3 stages. The stage 1 will be an 8-week double-blind, randomized,
      placebo-controlled treatment period. Following completion of Stage 1 and after completing the
      data clean for the initial 6 weeks, the investigator will be un-blinded to treatment
      assignment on an individual subject basis to enable appropriate starting dose selection for
      stage 2, a 24-week open-label treatment period. PK sampling and assessments will occur at the
      Week 2 visit during stage 2 of the study, when all subjects are receiving eltrombopag. After
      the completion of stage 2, subjects may continue the eltrombopag treatment in stage 3, if
      he/she can benefit from the continuous eltrombopag treatment based on investigator's
      judgement.

      The initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 8 weeks
      double-blind treatment, dose of investigational product will be adjusted according to the
      weekly subject platelet count.

      The eligible subjects who have completed stage 1 (8 weeks of double-blind treatment period:
      the first 6 weeks data will be used for primary endpoint analysis and the last 2 weeks will
      be data clean period during which period the blinded treatment is continued as to the first 6
      weeks) would enter a voluntary open-label stage 2 (24-week open-label extension phase) in
      which subjects from both eltrombopag group and placebo group will have the opportunity to
      receive eltrombopag treatment. Subjects unwilling or unqualified (such as the subjects who
      meet the stopping criteria) to participate in extension treatment will attend follow-up
      visits for 4 weeks after the completion of double-blind phase. During open-label stage 2
      during which period all eligible subjects will receive open label eltrombopag treatment. The
      dose of eltrombopag will be continuously adjusted according to the subject's platelet count.

      Following completion of Stage 2, if the subject benefits from the eltrombopag treatment based
      on investigator's discretion, the subject can voluntarily enter stage 3, during which the
      subject will continue eltrombopag treatment until the commercial launch of eltrombopag in
      China.

        <description>The number of participants (responders) with platelet count &gt;=50x10^9/L after 6 weeks of Stage 1 were compared between treatments using a logistic regression model adjusted for use of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) medication at Baseline (yes/no), splenectomy (yes/no), Baseline platelet count &lt;=15×10^9/L (yes/no) and treatment. Complete blood count including platelet count was done at Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5 and Week 6. Primary Analysis Data Set: a participant who withdrawals from Stage 1 or is emergently unblinded was classified as a negative response from the time of withdrawal or unblinding date and for all subsequent visits. In the event of a participant dying, information for all subsequent assessments would be considered missing. All intermittent missing data (apart from withdrawals) will be treated as missing.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Bleeding as Assessed Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Bleeding Scale</title>
        <description>The WHO Bleeding Scale is a measure of bleeding severity with the following grades: grade 0 = no bleeding, grade 1= petechiae, grade 2= mild blood loss, grade 3 = gross blood loss, and grade 4 = debilitating blood loss. The WHO Bleeding Scale were dichotomized to indicate no bleeding vs bleeding, i.e. 0=grade 0 and 1=grades 1, 2, 3 or 4. Generalized linear mixed model was applied with a Logit canonical link function for repeated binary data, allowing for Baseline dichotomized WHO bleeding grade, use of ITP medication at Baseline (yes/no), splenectomy (yes/no), Baseline platelet count &lt;=15×10^9/L (yes/no) and treatment as fixed effects, and the participant was treated as a random effect. Bleeding incidences were recorded at Screening, Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 5 and Week 6. All Bleeding incidences at each visit are presented.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Change From Baseline in Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Visual acuity is a measure of the spatial resolution of the visual processing system. Acuity is a measure of visual performance and is unrelated to the eyeglass prescription required to correct vision. Normal visual acuity is commonly referred to as 20/20 vision. Evaluation was done for oculus sinister (OS) for the left eye, oculus dexter (OD) for the right eye. Change from Baseline was calculated as the value at post-Baseline time point minus the value at Baseline.</description>

        <description>Vc/F is apparent volume of distribution of plasma (VDP) in central compartment and Vp/F is apparent VDP in peripheral compartment. PK assessments were made with one group of serial sampling [Samples collected at pre-dose and 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 24 hr post-dose] and one group of sparse assessment [Samples collected at pre-dose, between 2 to 4 hr and 5 to 8 hr post-dose]. Pre-dose samples were collected within 2 hr prior to dosing, all other samples were collected within 10 minutes(min) for samples collected between 1 and 6 hrs and within 30 mins for samples collected at 8 and 24 hr. PK analysis was conducted using a population approach with non-linear mixed effects modeling methods. Point estimates of population PK parameters are presented.</description>

Dose of eltrombopag was adjusted to maintain platelet counts between 50×10^9/L and 250×10^9/L for period of 8 weeks based on weekly platelet counts. In Stage 2, participants who received eltrombopag in Stage 1 continued with the same dose of eltrombopag unless the platelet count warranted an adjustment. Participants who received placebo in Stage 1 started 25 mg eltrombopag once daily as the initial dose and was adjusted to maintain platelet counts between 50×10^9/L and 250×10^9/L for period of 8 weeks on based on weekly platelet counts.</description>
