    <textblock>
      GoldenCare is a copper intravaginal device that may be useful for the treatment of
      symptomatic bacterial Vaginosis (BV). Standard treatment for BV is metronidazole. Although
      the reported cure rate is as high as 90%, the recurrence rate is 58% after 12 months. The
      study hypothesis is that GoldenCare will cure BV. This is a proof of concept study to collect
      preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of GoldenCare.
