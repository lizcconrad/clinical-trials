  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the combination of oral cyclosporine, an immune
      therapy and oral omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, are effective in rendering insulin
      independence among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients. This two-arm study is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy for insulin independence of two FDA and EMA-approved
      therapies among recent onset type 1 diabetes patients.

      One of the greatest new insights of today in the field of type 1 diabetes, is the
      understanding that in man, unlike the success seen in type 1 diabetes mouse models, there is
      no beta cell regeneration with immune therapy alone. In man, type 1 diabetes is now
      considered to be a disease of both autoimmunity and lack of beta cell regeneration (Levetan
      2103).

      More than 500 patients with new onset type 1 diabetes have been given cyclosporine and some
      studies have demonstrated as high as a 57% insulin-free remission rate that was not sustained
      due to the lack of beta cell regeneration (Feutren 1986, Bougneres 1988, Eisenbarth 1989,
      Sobel 2010). Studies among diabetes patients with proton pump inhibitors have shown the
      potential to increase beta cell mass by 40%, but among type 1 patients without immune
      protection, such outcomes cannot be not achieved (Singh 2012, Griffin 2014).

      The usage of a beta cell regeneration agent such as omeprazole, in combination with an immune
      tolerance, like cyclosporine, provides both the potential ability to maintain and regenerate
      beta cells. This is a new paradigm for the treatment of new onset type 1 diabetes.

      More than 60 human trials have been conducted among type 1 diabetes with a variety of
      different therapies aimed at preventing autoimmune attack on insulin-producing beta cells.
      None have been as effective as cyclosporine in both slowing the decline in beta cell mass and
      resulting in the potential for insulin-free remissions. (Canadian-European Randomized Control
      Trial 1988, Eisenbarth 1989, Skyler 1992, Sobel 2010).

      Because cyclosporine is known for its potential side-effects, most notably in the kidney, all
      previous studies among type 1 patients have carefully monitored kidney function. Follow-up
      studies for up to 13 years among 285 type 1 patients utilizing cyclosporine for 20 months did
      not demonstrate renal or other side effects at the dosages that will be used in this trial
      (Assan 2002).

      The most effective initiating dosage for insulin independence in the cyclosporine trials was
      7.5 mg/kg/day, but for safety, this study will begin at a lower dosage of 5 mg/kg/day and
      will monitor kidney function and cyclosporine levels initially on a weekly basis. This study
      will use only those dosages of cyclosporine that have not demonstrated toxicity to the kidney
      or resulted in non-reversible side effects among more than 500 patients with recent onset
      type 1 diabetes treated with cyclosporine.

      Omeprazole has been shown to significantly increase gastrin levels which is associated with
      increased beta cells. Lansoprazole has also been shown to be safe among patients with new
      onset type 1 diabetes for one year with a trend toward increased beta cell mass among
      patients with higher gastrin levels.

      In a randomized trial for 12 weeks among 56 patients undergoing pancreatectomy, those
      randomized to receive a proton pump inhibitor had significantly increased gastrin levels,
      higher insulin levels and improved endocrine function by glucose tolerance testing and less
      pancreatic atrophy as measured by CT scans (Jang 2003).

      The recently completed REPAIR T1D trial among newly diagnosed type 1 patients used a proton
      pump inhibitor and GLP-1 therapies for 1 year for beta regeneration failed to meet its
      endpoint of increased stimulated C-peptide. Lack of maintenance or regeneration of beta cells
      was specifically noted to have likely been due to lack of usage of immune therapy to protect
      beta cells (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014).

      Those patients in REPAIR T1D, who did achieve gastrin and GLP-1 levels above those in the
      control group had a trend towards improved preservation of C-peptide with a suggestion of a
      decreased rate of fall of C-peptide through 12 months (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental
      data). Glucose levels also trended lower than controls in the intervention arm with gastrin
      levels above the control arm (Griffin 2014 Appendix Supplemental data). In humans, the newly
      forming beta cells are under the greatest immune attack among type 1 patients (Meier 2006).
      REPAIR T1D underscores the importance for both immune therapy with a regeneration therapy
      among type 1 patients (Griffin 2014, Rigby 2014).

      The combination of cyclosporine with a proton pump inhibitor has the potential to demonstrate
      maintenance and expansion of residual beta cells. This combination therapy provides the
      unique ability for patients to become insulin independent.
