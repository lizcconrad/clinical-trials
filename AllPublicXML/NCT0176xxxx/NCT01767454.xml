  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi-center, dose-finding Phase 1 study that will enroll subjects at
      least 18 years old with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and BRAF V600 mutations. The
      primary objective of the study is to describe the safety for the doublet therapy (dabrafenib
      and ipilimumab) and the triplet therapy (dabrafenib/trametinib and ipilimumab). Preliminary
      efficacy data will also be collected. Subjects will be assigned to receive either the doublet
      combination (dabrafenib and ipilimumab) or the triplet combination (dabrafenib, trametinib,
      and ipilimumab). Subjects will be enrolled to dose-finding cohorts in the doublet combination
      (dabrafenib + ipilimumab) in a sequential 3+3 fashion. Following establishment of a dose for
      the doublet combination, an expansion cohort will be opened. At the same time, enrollment to
      dose finding cohorts for the triplet combination (dabrafenib + trametinib + ipilimumab) will
      begin in a sequential 6+6 fashion. Enrollment into triplet cohorts will take priority when
      both the doublet expansion arm and the triplet dose-finding arm are open for enrollment at
      the same time. Approximately 9-24 subjects will be enrolled to the dose finding portion of
      the study. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to doublet expansion cohort and 30
      subjects will be enrolled in the triplet expansion cohort. A two-week run-in period without
      ipilimumab will be followed by 4 intravenous doses of ipilimumab at the recommended dose and
      schedule. Oral daily dosing of dabrafenib or dabrafenib + trametinib will continue from the
      two-week run-in, through combination with ipilimumab, and post-ipilimumab until no longer of
      clinical benefit, in the opinion of the treating physician, or until unacceptable AE or death
