    <textblock>
      In patients scheduled for thoracic surgery or upper abdominal surgery, investigators will
      determine the accuracy of the epidural catheter placement by using fluoroscopic imaging.

      Previous studies have drawn contradictory conclusions based the potential flaw assumption of
      100% success rate for correct epidural catheter placement in the thoracic region.

      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is a key tool in management of pain after thoracic or upper
      abdominal surgery. TEA optimizes pain relief while minimizing the use of systemic opioids,
      thus reducing the duration of postoperative ileus. TEA also attenuates surgical stress
      response and allows for early mobilization. Despite all the touted benefits of TEA, much
      controversy limits its use for post surgical pain due to fear of exceedingly rare, if not
      entirely theoretical complication of epidural hematoma.

      Beneficial effects of TEA require that catheter placement and infusate be targeted at the
      thoracic segments innervating injured skin, muscle, and bone from which pain input
      originates. The purpose of this study is to determine the accuracy of thoracic epidural
      continuous catheter insertion by using fluoroscopic imaging.
