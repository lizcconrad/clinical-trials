      Main objective: to observationally assess the efficacy of different antimicrobials in
      Bloodstream Infection (BSI) due to Enterobacteriaceae producing ESBLs or carbapenemases.

      Specific objectives:

      Bacteraemic infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae:

        -  To demonstrate that β-lactam/β-lactam inhibitors are not associated with worse cure rate
           and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders, both as empirical and
           definitive therapy.

        -  To demonstrate that fluoroquinolones as definitive therapy are not associated with worse
           cure rate and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders.

        -  To demonstrate that empirical cephalosporins in monotherapy are associated with worse
           cure rate and mortality than carbapenems after controlling for confounders in infections
           others than urinary tract infections.

        -  To demonstrate that the association of active aminoglycosides with cephalosporins or
           fluoroquinolines is not associated with worse cure rate and mortality than carbapenems
           after controlling for confounders.

        -  To demonstrate that combination empirical and definitive therapy is not associated with
           better cure rate than monotherapy after controlling for confounders.

        -  For tigecycline, colistin, and fosfomycin, no hypothesis. The objective is to provide
           adjusted estimations of their association with outcome variables in comparison with
           carbapenem monotherapy according to clinical situation and infection.

      Bacteraemic infections due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae:

        -  To demonstrate that combination therapy is associated with worse cure rate and mortality
           than monotherapy after controlling for confounders.

        -  To show that carbapenems are associated with worse cure rate and mortality when used in
           infections other than urinary tract caused by isolates showing MIC &lt;2 µg/mL for imipenem
           or meropenem in comparison to those caused by isolates with higher MIC, after
           controlling for confounders.

        -  To show that colistin used at a dose &gt;6 million IU per day is associated with improved
           outcomes in comparison with lower dose, after controlling for confounders.

      METHODS

      Study design: multicentre, international retrospective cohort study.

      Sites: multiple expert investigators from different countries are invited.

      Conditions to fulfil to participate include availability of a database with the required data
      or ability to retrospectively collect the data in a timely manner.

      Procedure

      The participant centres are asked to include:

        -  Previously published cases: all these cases should be included if possible. The fact
           that the case had been previously published should be specified in the database.

        -  Additionally, participants are asked to include consecutive episodes detected by
           reviewing their databases (clinical, infection control or microbiological records) from
           January 2004 to June 2012, according to the following criteria:

             -  For ESBL producers:

      A minimum of 20 and a maximum of 50 cases should be included from each centre (the more
      recent ones should be selected).

        -  Cases for which the enzyme is characterised at least to group level by polymerase chain
           reaction, PCR, (it is, CTX-M, SHV, TEM) should be prioritised despite the date of
           diagnosis.

        -  If not enough number of cases with PCR-characterized enzymes are available, or
           PCR-characterisation has not been performed, the total number of cases should be
           completed by including cases in which ESBL-production was identified using a standard
           phenotypic method.

             -  For carbapenemase-producers: only cases in which the carbapenemase was
                characterised by PCR should be included. All episodes up to a limit of 50 cases per
                centre may be included.

      Overall, to avoid selection biases, consecutive cases according to previous criteria should
      be included.

      Variables

      A common online database has been designed. Individual access to the database will be
      provided.

      Main outcome variable: Cure rate at day 14

      Secondary outcome variables: Mortality at 72 hours, 7, 14 and 30 days, clinical improvement
      at 72 hours, clinical cure at day 28.

      Explanatory variables:

        -  Demographics

        -  Severity of chronic underlying conditions: McCabe and Charlson index

        -  Acute severity of underlying disease: Pitt score during the the day before BSI.

        -  Type of acquisition

        -  Source of BSI

        -  Severity of SIRS at presentation

        -  Microorganism, betalactamase, MICs

        -  Empirical therapy

        -  Definitive therapy

      Quality of data. Data will be approved and signed by the responsible investigator in each
      center. All data will be centrally reviewed; queries will be sent for lacking data and those
      showing inconsistencies or discrepancies. Data will be analysed per center; those with data
      showing significant differences with the average will be requested for review.

      Statistical Analysis Plan

        -  Subcohorts with patients treated with the treatment to be compared will be selected.

        -  A propensity score to receive the 2 treatment types to compare will be calculated by
           obtaining a non-parsimonious multivariate model by logistic regression in which the
           outcome variable will be the treatment type. The explanatory variables will include age,
           gender, center, type of ward, acquisition, Charlson index, Pitt score, severity of SIRS
           and source.

        -  After univariate analysis, multivariate analysis to investigate the adjusted association
           of treatment type with the main and secondary outcome variables will be performed by
           using logistic regression (for clinical response at day 14) and by Cox regression for
           mortality. If time until death is unavailable, logistic regression will be used for
           30-day mortality. Logistic regression will also be used for 72-hour and 30-day clinical
           response. The propensity score will be added in all cases; also, Charlson score, Pitt
           score, severity of SIRS and source will be added. Finally, interaction between treatment
           type and source classified as urinary tract and others will be included.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Episode of clinically-significant monomicrobial BSI due to ESBL or
             carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, including community and nosocomial ones.

               -  For ESBL-producers, detection by standard phenotypic method as recommended by
                  CLSI is enough (although PCR-based characterisation is preferred, see below).

               -  For carbapenemase-producers, characterisation by at least PCR is necessary
                  (isolates in which carbapenemase production is suspected based on antimicrobial
                  susceptibility profile plus phenotypic tests alone is not acceptable, see below).

          -  Subsequent episodes in a patient caused by the same microorganism may be included if
             the interval between them is &gt;3 months.

          -  No age limits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Polymicrobial or non-clinically significant episodes. Episodes in which a potential
             contaminant (e.g., coagulase-negative staphylococci) is isolated only in one set of
             blood cultures and there is not a typical source of infection for that kind of
             organism (e.g. catheter-related) may be included.

          -  Unavailability of key data (such cases should be counted to analyse a potential
             selection bias)

          -  Episode occurring before January 2004.
