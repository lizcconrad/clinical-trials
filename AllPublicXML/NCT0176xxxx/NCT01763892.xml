    <textblock>
      The aims of this study explore the relationships between cerebral vasospasm, apolipoprotein-E
      (apo-E) genotype, physiologic symptoms, and neurocognitive outcomes that may either intensify
      or ameliorate secondary injury, for children with a traumatic brain injury. Exploring the
      apo-E genotype will help us know if injury response is altered in certain children and will
      aid in developing interventional approaches.

      The purpose of this study is to advance knowledge of neurocognitive outcomes in pediatric
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients by exploring the relationships between physiologic
      factors of cerebral vasospasm, apolipoprotein E (apo-E) allele, biomarkers, and
      neurocognitive outcomes. This study is a funded project within Duke University School of
      Nursing National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research (NIH/NINR) P30
      Center of Excellence Grant. This study will continue on with some of the work of a small
      intramural grant study determining the feasibility of conducting pediatric TBI research at
      DUHS. It will advance the measurement of vasospasm by translating the use of the Transcranial
      Doppler (TCD) ultrasound to neuromonitoring in children. To date, this will be the first
      pediatric study examining the relationship of cerebral vasospasm, apo-E, and biomarkers with
      neurocognitive outcomes. Unlike adult TBI patients, cerebral vasospasm, apo-E, and biomarker
      collections have yet to be examined in pediatric neurotrauma patients in the Duke University
      Health System. Although neurocognitive outcomes are a standard of care for TBI patients at
      Duke University Health System (DUHS), the data has yet to be examined within the realm of
      pediatric neurodiagnostic physiologic measures. By obtaining preliminary data in 35 patients,
      it will allow for the evaluation of multi-diagnostic measures in pediatric TBI patients, as
      well as provide data for future funding for a larger regionally-scale study.
