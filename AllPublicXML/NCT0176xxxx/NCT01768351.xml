  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current activated Vitamin D therapies are approved for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism
      in chronic kidney disease (CKD), and a large body of experimental data in animals confirms
      the effects of Vitamin D that extend beyond mineral metabolism. Several studies show that the
      benefits are greater with the newer vitamin D analog paricalcitol when compared with
      calcitriol. A large gap exists in our knowledge between epidemiological studies in human that
      demonstrate improved outcomes with vitamin D use and observations in preclinical studies
      demonstrating the pleiotropic effects of Vitamin D. To explore the provenance of
      epidemiological outcomes in CKD, we conducted a pilot randomized trial to determine whether
      the use of paricalcitol, compared to calcitriol, leads to improvement in anemia, a marker
      associated with worse outcomes in chronic kidney disease, and whether this effect not only
      reflects the hyperparathyroidism correction, but is also dependent on the direct effects of
      paricalcitol on erythroid progenitor cells.

      To better understand the direct effects of paricalcitol on anemia in patients with chronic
      kidney disease (stage 3-5), we conducted a pilot trial in 60 patients who were randomly
      allocated equally to 2 groups to receive or not paricalcitol orally for 6 months.

    <description>Patients receiving treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism with calcitriol. The calcitriol dosage schedule provided for an initial dose of 0.5 mch every other day and titration was performed on the basis of the serum levels of intact PTH (iPTH) (target 150-300 pg/mL), Ca, P and Ca x P product as suggested by the US National Kidney Foundation Dialysis outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) and Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines.</description>
