      This study investigates safety and pharmacokinetic comparison of Seoul Pharma's orally
      disintegrating film (ODF) formulation of sildenafil (test formulation) and Pfizer's &quot;ViagraÂ®
      (sildenafil)&quot; Film Coated Tablet (FCT) formulation (reference formulation) in healthy
      volunteers.

      -  Background: An orally disintegrating film (ODF) formulation of sildenafil was recently
           developed in Korea. This formulation is expected to enhance the dosing convenience and
           increase patient compliance while yielding pharmacokinetic profiles comparable to the
           conventional film coated tablet (FCT) formulation.

        -  Objective: The goal of present study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of
           a newly developed ODF formulation with a FCT formulation of sildenafil in healthy Korean
           male volunteers.

        -  Methods: This is a randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over, single-dose study
           conducted in 2 parts. Eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers between the ages of
           20 and 50 years and within 20% of their ideal body weight, and are equally divided into
           parts 1 and 2. Each subject will be received a single -dose of ODF and FCT formulations
           of sildenafil orally in a fasted state (part 1, 50mg; part 2, 100mg), with a 7-day
           washout period between the formulations. Blood samples are collected up to 24 hours.
           Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined for sildenafil and its active metabolite
           (N-desmethyl sildenafil). Adverse events will be also evaluated based on subject
           interviews and physical examinations.
