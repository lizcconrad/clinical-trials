    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I, first in human, dose-escalation study of MORAb-066, an
      investigational humanized immunoglobulin G (IgG) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets
      TF-expressing malignancies that include breast, pancreatic, colorectal, and non-small-cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC) (adenocarcinoma). This open-label study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MORAb-066 administered weekly. This study will identify
      the MTD when MORAb-066 is administered IV once weekly on a 28-day cycle.

      Primary Objective

      -To evaluate the safety and tolerability of weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of MORAb-066.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To identify the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) and to determine the maximum tolerated
           dose (MTD) of MORAb-066.

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of MORAb-066.

        -  To identify, on the basis of safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PDx) data, a recommended
           Phase II dose and schedule for MORAb-066.

        -  To make a preliminary assessment of the antitumor activity of MORAb-066.

        -  T

        -  To detect any antibody response (i.e., human antihuman antibodies [HAHA]) to multiple IV
           infusions to MORAb-066.

      Exploratory Objectives

        -  To evaluate the presence of tissue factor (TF) substrates such as protease activated
           receptor 2 when applicable.

        -  To evaluate the archived tumor tissue for TF overexpression by immunohistochemistry.

        -  To evaluate whether there are potential biomarkers that correlate responses to
           MORAb-066.
