      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether stereotactic indigo carmine injection can
      safely increase the extent of tumor resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low grade gliomas are brain tumors with usually poorly defined borders between tumor and
      normal brain. This characteristic of low grade gliomas makes the gross total resection of the
      tumor extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that the risk of
      recurrence and progression into a more malignant tumor can be decreased with a more
      aggressive surgical resection. An aggressive attempt to achieve a gross total resection may
      result in the resection of normal brain and therefore neurological injury. For this reason,
      the more common error is to subtotally resect the tumor leaving significant volumes of tumor
      behind. Many techniques have been introduced to safely increase the extent of resection,
      since the extent of resection is associated with a higher survival rate. Each one of these
      techniques has several shortcomings. The current study will assess whether the intraoperative
      stereotactic injection of the indigo carmine at the tumor margins helps to safely increase of
      extent of tumor resection. In the first step of the study the safety and the correlation
      between resection of stained tissue/extend of tumor resection will be assessed. If the
      results are satisfactory, then the second step will ensue. In the second step we will assess
      the utility of indigo carmine as an additional adjunct to guide tumor resection.

    <description>During resection, a small quantity of a special dye called indigo carmine will be infused at the margins of the tumor using computer-guided stereotactic navigation equipment. This dye will be visible during the tumor resection and it can potentially serve as an additional marker of the tumor margins. A post-operative MRI scan -which is part of the standard care- will accurately measure the extent of tumor resection.</description>
