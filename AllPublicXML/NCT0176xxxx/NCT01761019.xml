  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral therapies for psoriasis, including methotrexate and acitretin, are often less effective
      when used as monotherapy (without other oral medicines or creams) than are newer biologic
      injected drugs. However, these oral medications are also less expensive than biologic agents
      and may be safer for use in some patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      adding a topical psoriasis medicine, calcipotriene/betamethasone topical suspension (Taclonex
      topical suspension), will improve the severity of psoriasis in patients already on
      methotrexate or acitretin and to determine if adding this topical suspension will reduce the
      desire of such patients to switch to a biologic agent to treat their psoriasis.

      Many patients with mild psoriasis are able to control disease symptoms with topical
      medications alone. There are a variety of topical options available, including
      corticosteroids, synthetic vitamin D3, vitamin A, coal tar, salicylic acid and a number of
      other products of varying efficacy. The combination topical suspension of calcipotriene
      0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% is a first-line treatment for moderate to severe
      psoriasis vulgaris and is FDA approved for use on the skin and scalp in adults 18 years and
      older. This treatment combines the pharmacological effects of calcipotriene hydrate as a
      synthetic vitamin D3 analog and betamethasone dipropionate as a synthetic corticosteroid. It
      is well tolerated and has a low rate of adverse events according to pooled safety data from
      2700 patients who have used a calcipotriene/betamethasone combination in clinical trials.
      Calcipotriene/betamethasone topical suspension has also been shown to have a positive impact
      on patient quality of life, as seen in clinical trials utilizing patient reported outcomes
      such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and Psoriasis Disability Index.

      Calcipotriene/betamethasone topical suspension is a therapy commonly used to treat patients
      with mild to moderate psoriasis. Currently, there have been no formal trials studying the
      efficacy of calcipotriene/betamethasone topical suspension used in conjunction with
      methotrexate or acitretin. In order to better understand the effectiveness of this treatment
      combination, we conducted a preliminary, open label, single arm prospective study to
      determine the benefit of adding betamethasone-calcipotriene topical suspension to ongoing
      systemic psoriasis therapy in subjects who do not have complete clearance of psoriasis on a
      single systemic agent alone.
