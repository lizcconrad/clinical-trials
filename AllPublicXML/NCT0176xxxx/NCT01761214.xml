  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease arises from progressive airway inflammation and
      infection. It has been postulated that bacterial infection triggers intense airway
      inflammation leading to acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis. Antibiotics have been the most
      potent medications for the treatment of bronchiectasis, however, the sputum bacterial load
      and inflammatory indices at steady-state and exacerbation remain largely unknown. The
      investigation might shed light on the roles that antibiotics play in acute exacerbation of
      bronchiectasis and uncover the mechanisms on why a subgroup of individuals do not respond
      satisfactorily.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease arises from progressive airway inflammation and
      infection. Pro-inflammatory mediators, the products of activated neutrophils recruited to the
      inflamed sites, are released in bronchiectatic airways and mediate cascades of neutrophil
      infiltration. This suggests that bacterial infection plays a pivotal role in the
      neutrophil-derived inflammation leading to the vicious cycle that perpetuates the development
      of airway destruction and might result in acute exacerbation. Treatments targeting at
      bacterial infection is therefore necessary, particularly for those with acute exacerbation of
      bronchiectasis.

      Although short- and long-term administration of antibiotics have been evidenced to markedly
      suppress bacterial colonization and inflammatory indices, the roles that potent antibiotics
      play in patients with exacerbation of bronchiectasis are unclear. The assessment of bacterial
      infection and sputum and systemic inflammation during steady-state, acute exacerbation and
      recovery from exacerbation of bronchiectasis may clinically shed light on and indicate the
      efficacy of antibiotic treatments.

      Furthermore, a subgroup of patients may experience the acute exacerbation that may stem from
      non-bacterial pathogens. There has been a dire need to compare the changes in sputum
      bacterial load and inflammatory indices based on sputum bacteriology. This may help uncover
      the mechanism of different responses to antibiotic treatment in patients who had varying
      bacteriologic profiles.

      Unlike assessment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, few clinical indices for
      appraisal of onset of exacerbation and efficacy of treatments are available. Of these, the
      24-hour sputum volume, microbial clearance, C-reactive protein (CRP) and St George's
      Respiratory Questionnaire have been validated. In the present study, we employed sputum
      bacteriology and inflammatory indices, including the aforementioned parameters, for
      assessment.

    <measure>24-hour sputum volume</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Eligible patients with bronchiectasis, following recruitment, will be instructed to record the condition of expectoration in the patient diary card. This includes recording of 24-hour sputum volume, sputum purulence and changes in the symptoms per day. A minimum of 3 daily records between two neighboring visits are required. The 24-hour sputum volume will be recorded as the mean of 3 records.
The volume of 24-hour sputum was recorded as the mean of the nearest 3 consecutive days. Sputum volume was scored for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 points corresponding to 0-10ml, 10-20ml, 20-30ml, 30-40ml, 40-50ml and &gt;50ml, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometric indices in the present study is referred to as FEV1, FVC, FEV1/FVC and MMEF.
Spirometry tests are carried out using a spirometer (COSMED, QUARK PFT, Italy). All operation procedures meet the joint recommendation by ATS and ERS. A total of at least 3 (not more than 8) spirometric maneuvers are performed, with the variation between the best two maneuvers of &lt;5% or 200ml in FVC and FEV1. The maximal values of FVC and FEV1 are reported. MMEF is chosen from the maneuver with the highest sum of FVC and FEV1. The predicted values are selected based on the reference regression model established by Zheng JP and Zhong NS.</description>

    <measure>Sputum purulence</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Patients receive chest physical therapy 15 minutes upon arrival at the hospital till expectoration complete. Patients are instructed to be seated and remove contents in the oral cavity followed by sputum collection using a sterile container between 10:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m., an hour after physical therapy.
Sputum purulence is scored for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 points corresponding to complete absence, almost translucent, half translucent, translucent but colorless, opaque and white, grey and green, moderately green and dark green, respectively. The specimen with highest score is selected for reports.</description>

    <description>The symptoms of bronchiectasis include cough, expectoration (referred to as 24-hour sputum volume, purulence and viscosity), chest pain, chest distress, wheezing, febrile, malaise, fatigue, tachypnea and hemoptysis. A significant amelioration (&gt;20%) in the respective symptom during antibiotic treatment when compared with that of acute exacerbation is deemed as recovery. The time of recovery is mainly determined by patient self-reporting.</description>
