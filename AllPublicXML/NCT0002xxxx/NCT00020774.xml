      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of SCH 66336 with or without
      gemcitabine followed by surgery with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have
      primary liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the biologic activity and toxicity of neoadjuvant SCH 66336 with or
      without gemcitabine followed by surgical resection vs surgical resection alone in patients
      with resectable primary liver cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study. Patients are randomized to one of three
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 14 days
      followed by surgical resection. Arm II: Patients receive neoadjuvant oral SCH 66336 twice
      daily for 14 days and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 2 weeks followed by
      surgical resection. Arm III: Patients undergo surgical resection. Patients receive no
      neoadjuvant therapy prior to resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
