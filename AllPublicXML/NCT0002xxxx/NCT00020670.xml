  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for children and adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved
      significantly over the years. Nevertheless, patients who experience disease relapse or
      induction failure along with patients having unfavorable genetics [t(4;11) or t(9;22)] have
      dismal prognosis. For these patients, novel therapeutic approaches such as immunotherapy are
      needed. In this clinical trial, investigators evaluate whether it is feasible to make a
      vaccine from leukemia cells and whether this vaccine enables direct immunity against cancer
      cells in patients.

    <description>Patients will undergo tumor cell collection followed by vaccine preparation and then vaccination. Autologous acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells are harvested, cultured with CD40 ligand, pulsed with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), and then irradiated to produce the vaccine. Patients receive either 1 x 10^7 or 1 x 10^8 CD40 cells/vaccination depending on the number of tumor cells obtained. Vaccinations are administered every two weeks as outpatient therapy. Evaluable patients receive the course of at least 4 vaccinations at weeks 0, 2, 4, 6. Patients may continue receiving vaccinations every 2 weeks if chemotherapy is not required for symptomatic disease.</description>

        ********************************************NOTE*******************************************
        ********

        It is anticipated that there will be a number of patients at first relapse who are eligible
        for tumor cell collection and vaccine preparation but who are not eligible to receive the
        vaccination course. These patients will be evaluable for Objective 3.1.1 (feasibility of
        vaccine preparation). Patients at first relapse who are eligible for vaccine preparation
        but not administration should instead be treated with standard salvage regimens which may
        include allogeneic bone marrow transplantation according to the judgement of their primary
        oncologist. However, these patients represent a population at extremely high risk for
        progression of their disease following salvage therapy. Many of these patients will
        therefore be likely to fulfill eligibility criteria for vaccination in the future (i.e.

        should they relapse again, or fail to enter 2nd complete remission). The majority of those
        patients who relapse for a second time will do so within 1 year. Those patients who become
        eligible for vaccination because of 2nd relapse within 1 year of tumor cell collection will
        receive the original vaccine and will not have further vaccine made from tumor cells
        collected at the time of 2nd relapse. Given the proliferative thrust of the disease in many
        patients, it will be advantageous to have vaccines already prepared for these patients to
        reduce the amount of time from 2nd relapse to vaccination.***
