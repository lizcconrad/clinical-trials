  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the efficacy of muromonab-CD3 and cyclosporine as treatment in
      patients with giant cell myocarditis (GCM). T lymphocytes appear to be involved in GCM.
      Muromonab-CD3 has been shown to reduce the number of lymphocytes and cyclosporine inhibits
      lymphocyte activation. This treatment may prolong patient survival until transplantation or
      ventricular assist device placement is possible.

      Each patient will be randomized to receive either standard care and immunosuppression therapy
      (treatment group) or standard care alone (control group). To prevent bias, randomization will
      be stratified by recency of symptom onset to ensure that both the treatment and control
      groups are balanced with respect to it. Within each of these 2 strata, permuted-block
      randomization will be done to keep the number of treatment and control patients balanced. Due
      to the necessary monitoring of the patients randomized to receive immunosuppression therapy,
      treatment cannot be blinded. Approximately 1 year after the last patient has been randomized,
      the observed times from randomization to the composite endpoint (death, transplantation, or
      LVD placement) will be compared in the treatment and control groups.
