  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the most effective approach for managing pain and providing
      palliative care (lessening of pain or symptoms).

      Patients with advanced cancer who are enrolled in a National Cancer Institute (NCI) protocol
      and will undergo major surgery as part of their treatment may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to pain management provided by either 1) their
      attending physician or 2) the Clinical Center's Pain and Palliative Care Service. Patients in
      the first group may be reassigned to the Pain and Palliative Care Service at any time during
      the study.

      Participants will be interviewed every 3 months for as long as 1 year about their pain, its
      effect on several areas of their lives, changes in their needs, and how well they think their
      pain is being managed.. As the patients progress through the NCI study, they will meet
      regularly and as often as needed with either their attending physician or the Pain and
      Palliative Care team. Each interview will last about 20 to 30 minutes. With the patient's
      permission, the interviews will be tape recorded.

    <textblock>
      Pain is multidimensional. It is more than simply a physiologic or sensory response. Pain
      management programs are best developed by selecting interventions based on the individual's
      pain experience. Strategies with several mechanisms of action that complement each other
      might be selected to work together, thereby maximizing pain relief. The goal of palliative
      care is to achieve the highest possible quality of life for patients and their families
      through symptom control and attention to the whole patient, where physical, psychosocial,
      emotional, and spiritual dimensions are addressed. Provision of relief from pain and
      distressing symptoms is best served by a specialized interdisciplinary team with a
      comprehensive approach. The continuity of care for the patient and family is supported by
      communication and a strong partnership with the primary biomedical research team and the
      palliative care team.

      Despite a number of descriptive studies exploring the effectiveness of specialized pain and
      palliative care teams, the paucity of good evaluations, with any comparative design, urgently
      needs to be addressed. This is a randomized, repeated measures, evaluation study to explore
      the effectiveness of the inpatient Pain and Palliative Care Service intervention. The data
      collected during this study will not only include outcomes of the intervention, but also
      patient and family perceptions of the care delivery process including issues surrounding
      communication with health care providers. Patients with advanced malignancies who are
      currently participating in NCI Surgery Branch protocols will be asked to participate in a
      pain and symptoms management evaluation study. Each patient and a designated family member
      will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires over time exploring physical,
      psychosocial and emotional correlates of pain and symptom management. Data will be analyzed
      using multivariate statistics.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with advanced malignancies who are currently undergoing major surgical procedures
        in NCI Surgery Branch will be recruited to participate in a pain and symptoms management
        evaluation study.

        Inclusion criteria are stated in the parent protocols.

        Although each patient will be asked to identify a family member/significant other to
        participate in the study, patients will be eligible for inclusion regardless of whether
        they identify a family member for participation in the family questionnaires.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        All exclusions are stated in the NCI Surgery Branch parent protocols.
