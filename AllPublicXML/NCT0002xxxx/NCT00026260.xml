      RATIONALE: Biological therapy with drugs such as SU5416 may stop the growth of cervical
      cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 in treating patients who have
      persistent or recurrent cervical cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of SU5416, in terms of 6-month
           progression-free survival and time to progression, in patients with persistent or
           recurrent cervical squamous cell carcinoma.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate surrogate endpoint molecular and imaging markers with clinical outcome in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive SU5416 IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats weekly in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-23
      months.
