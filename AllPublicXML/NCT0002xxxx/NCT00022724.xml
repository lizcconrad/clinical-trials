      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have
      malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of CCI-779 in patients with malignant glioma.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of survival and objective response, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients in phase II are stratified according to
      use of enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type
      (glioblastoma multiforme with stable neuro-imaging after radiotherapy vs recurrent malignant
      glioma). Patients in phase I must be currently receiving EIAEDs.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes once weekly. Treatment repeats
           every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of CCI-779 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive CCI-779 as in Phase I. Patients who are candidates for
           surgical resection of recurrent disease receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes 2 hours prior
           to surgery and then once weekly, as above, once recovered from surgery.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study within 12
      months. A total of 87 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study within 12 months.
