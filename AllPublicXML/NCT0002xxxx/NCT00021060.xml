  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they
      stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer
      cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Combining chemotherapy
      with a monoclonal antibody may kill more tumor cells. This randomized phase II/III trial is
      to see if combination chemotherapy works better with or without bevacizumab in treating
      patients who have advanced, metastatic, or recurrent non-small cell lung cance

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess toxicity and survival in patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB
      pleural effusion/IV), nonsquamous histology non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with
      carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab. (Phase II) II. To assess response rates and time
      to progression in patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB-pleural effusion/IV),
      nonsquamous histology NSCLC treated with carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab. (Phase
      II) III. To assess overall survival in patients with advanced or metastatic (stage
      IIIB-pleural effusion/IV), nonsquamous histology NSCLC treated with carboplatin plus
      paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab. (Phase III) IV. To assess response rates, time to progression,
      and toxicity in patients with advanced or metastatic (stage IIIB-pleural effusion/IV),
      non-squamous histology NSCLC treated with carboplatin plus paclitaxel +/- bevacizumab. (Phase
      III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if pre-treatment levels of plasma VEGF predict response to chemotherapy with
      carboplatin-Taxol with or without anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody (MAb).

      II. To determine if pre-treatment plasma VEGF is of prognostic value in advanced NSCLC.

      III. To determine whether elevated plasma levels of endothelial cell-specific proteins (VCAM,
      E-selectin), reflective of chemotherapy or anti-VEGF induced endothelial damage, are useful
      markers in assessing response to carboplatin/Taxol +/- anti-VEGF therapy.

      IV. To determine whether pre- and post-treatment plasma levels of basic fibroblast growth
      factor (bFGF) is of prognostic value or predictive of response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to measurable disease
      (yes vs no), prior radiotherapy (yes vs no), weight loss (less than 5% vs 5% or more), and
      disease stage (IIIB vs IV vs recurrent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 15-30
      minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in arm I followed by bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 1.

      Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of 6 courses, patients in arm II with stable or responding disease continue
      to receive bevacizumab only. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 842 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Analyses will be based on repeated confidence intervals for the hazard ratio, using O'Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries corresponding to a one-sided, 2.5% overall type I error. The confidence interval will be calculated on the log hazard ratio scale based on the log hazard ratio and variance estimates from the Cox partial likelihood, using the large sample normal approximation, and then the interval will be transformed to the hazard ratio scale.</description>
