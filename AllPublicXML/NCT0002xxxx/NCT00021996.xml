      RATIONALE: Valdecoxib may be effective in relieving chronic pain in cancer patients. It is
      not yet known if valdecoxib is effective in treating chronic pain.

      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to study the effectiveness of valdecoxib in relieving
      chronic pain in cancer patients.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the analgesic efficacy of valdecoxib administered in addition to opioid
      medication in patients with chronic pain due to cancer or prior cancer therapy. II. Assess
      the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to baseline average pain intensity score (2-4 vs 5-11). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients undergo a pretreatment period of 3-14 days to
      determine daily dose of sustained release and immediate release opioid medications required
      to adequately control pain with tolerable side effects. Arm I: Patients receive oral
      valdecoxib twice daily in addition to opioid medications. Arm II: Patients receive oral
      placebo twice daily in addition to opioid medications. Treatment continues for a maximum of
      12 weeks in the absence of inadequate pain control or unacceptable toxicity. Patients record
      daily pain assessments and total daily opioid consumption. Patients also are contacted by
      telephone weekly for assessment of pain, opioid use, and adverse effects.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 260 patients will be accrued for this study.
