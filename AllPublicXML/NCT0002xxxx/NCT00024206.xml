      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU6668 in treating patients who have advanced
      solid tumors. SU6668 may stop the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood flow to the tumor

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the optimal biologically effective dose of SU6668 in patients with advanced
      solid tumors.

      II. Assess the safety and tolerability of this therapy in these patients. III. Determine the
      pharmacokinetic profile and interpatient pharmacologic variability of this therapy in these
      patients.

      IV. Determine the extent, frequency, and duration of any tumor responses in patients treated
      with this therapy.

      V. Determine a recommended phase II dose of SU6668 for future clinical studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral SU6668 twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression of 100% or more.

      Cohorts of at least 6 patients receive escalating doses of SU6668 until the optimal
      biologically effective dose (OBD) is determined. Once the OBD is reached, dose escalation
      continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined (if possible). The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
