  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing bone mass during puberty can ultimately decrease the risk of developing
      osteoporosis, which causes bones to weaken and break more easily later in life. The purpose
      of this study is to compare calcium absorption and bone growth in boys and girls on diets
      including either a nondigestible oligosaccharide (NDO) or simple sugar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid increases in bone mass occur during calcium absorption and bone calcium deposition
      during puberty, and these increases can enhance peak bone mass and ultimately decrease the
      lifetime risk of osteoporosis. However, dietary, hormonal, and genetic factors likely affect
      increased bone mass. This study will examine if adding NDO to a pubertal diet allows more
      absorption of calcium by the body, producing stronger bones. The study will also assess how
      the hormones produced by the body during puberty affect bone growth and whether genetic
      factors affect calcium absorption or bone growth.

      This study will last 2 years. At study entry, baseline pubertal hormone levels and bone mass
      will be assessed. Both a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and a calcium stable
      kinetic study measuring calcium absorption will be performed. Participants will then be
      randomly assigned to receive calcium fortified food with or without added NDO for 1 year.
      Calcium absorption will be measured again at 2 months. After the first year, calcium kinetic,
      hormonal, and DEXA studies will be performed and compared to baseline results. A final DEXA
      scan will be performed at the end of 2 years.
