    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to set up a system for doing research on HIV prevention in
      various parts of the world.

      In order to plan large, long-term studies on the prevention of HIV in different areas of the
      world, it is necessary to get certain information first. It is important to know about the
      rate of HIV infection and how to get people to enroll for any future studies. This study will
      be done at 4 study locations.

      In order to realistically plan for future Phase III studies on HIV prevention, information
      must be obtained to characterize study population parameters at HTPN sites. Very different
      study designs may be required depending on these parameters, such as the ability of HPTN
      research centers to recruit study participants and the rate of HIV incidence observed in
      study populations. This study will be conducted at 4 HPTN sites to establish the necessary
      research knowledge and infrastructure.

      This study enrolls participants from St. Petersburg, Russia; Xinjiang and Guangxi, China; and
      Chennai, India who are at high risk for HIV infection due to sexual and/or drug use
      behaviors. Participants who meet the screening criteria then complete an HIV risk assessment
      interview, receive HIV pre-test and risk reduction counseling, and undergo phlebotomy for HIV
      antibody testing. Participants who test positive are referred to available services and
      studies. Those who test HIV-negative and meet eligibility criteria are enrolled and
      maintained in follow-up over the next 12 months. Participants complete &quot;locator contacts&quot; at
      Months 3 and 9 and have follow-up visits at Months 6 and 12 for similar tests as performed at
      entry. In a substudy of this trial in China, participants will be interviewed about their
      drug use, social networks, needs, and perceptions about HIV/AIDS. These results will be used
      by HPTN to design more culturally sensitive and appropriate trials in the future.
