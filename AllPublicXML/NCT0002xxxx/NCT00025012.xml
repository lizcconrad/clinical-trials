      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. Isotretinoin may be effective in preventing the
      development or recurrence of skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of isotretinoin in preventing or slowing
      the growth of skin cancer in patients who have xeroderma pigmentosum or basal cell carcinoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the lowest effective dose of oral isotretinoin for long-term therapy
      that is capable of reducing the rate of formation of new skin cancers in patients with
      xeroderma pigmentosum or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. II. Determine the possible
      side effects associated with long-term use of isotretinoin in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (xeroderma pigmentosum vs nevoid
      basal cell carcinoma syndrome). Patients not previously treated with isotretinoin receive
      oral isotretinoin daily for 2 years and then are followed without receiving isotretinoin for
      1 year. After the follow-up period, treatment may be resumed if the rate of new skin tumor
      formation reaches 2 per year provided original eligibility criteria are met. Treatment may be
      resumed during the follow-up period if the rate of new skin tumor formation increases to the
      rate observed before study. Patients previously treated with oral isotretinoin continue
      treatment and are followed to evaluate any long-term effects of treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Diagnosis of autosomal recessive disorder xeroderma pigmentosum
        Diagnosis must be documented by the clinical signs and symptoms listed in standard text
        books, e.g.: Sun sensitivity Increased number of freckles and other pigmentary lesions
        Cutaneous atrophy and telangiectasia Actinic keratoses Skin cancers Ocular abnormalities
        (e.g., photophobia, conjunctivitis, keratitis, or premalignant or malignant tumors of the
        eye or lid) allowed Neurologic abnormalities (e.g., progressive hearing loss, diminished
        reflexes, or progressive mental deterioration) allowed OR Diagnosis of autosomal dominant
        nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome Diagnosis must be documented by the clinical signs and
        symptoms listed in standard text books, e.g.: Basal cell carcinomas Palmar pits Skeletal
        abnormalities Falx calcification History of at least 2 documented skin cancers a year
        during the 2 years before study, but currently clear of all skin cancer Patients not
        previously treated with isotretinoin must agree to undergo a 1 year follow-up period
        without isotretinoin (to facilitate observation of any chronic toxicity and observe for new
        tumors) Must undergo appropriate treatment for any skin cancers that arise during study No
        evidence of metastatic cancer

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 2 Hematopoietic: Complete blood cell counts normal
        Hepatic: SGOT or SGPT less than 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) Triglycerides less than
        200 mg/dL Renal: Creatinine less than 3 times ULN Cardiovascular: No New York Heart
        Association class III or IV heart disease Other: No hypersensitivity to parabens (used in
        drug formulation) No proven active malignancy except skin cancer Not pregnant Negative
        pregnancy test Fertile patients must use effective contraception during and for 1 month
        after study therapy

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: See Disease Characteristics No recent, chronic, high-dose vitamin
        A use (greater than 30,000 IU/day) No concurrent supplemental vitamin A No other concurrent
        therapy for the skin (except sunscreens) unless approved by the investigators
