    <textblock>
      Liposome entrapped mitoxantrone (LEM) is a mixture of commercially available mitoxantrone HCL
      (Novantrone) and a combination of lyophilized lipids. Mitoxantrone, the active agent in the
      investigational formulation, is a currently marketed chemotherapeutic agent. The rationale
      for development of liposomal formulations is primarily that of improving the safety profile
      of the drug, which may permit dose intensification and/or an increase in the cumulative dose
      that may be administered, resulting in enhanced efficacy.

      LEM will be given to patients with advanced solid tumors to determine the dose of drug these
      patients can tolerate. Patients will receive intravenous LEM every 21 days until the disease
      progresses or toxicity occurs requiring treatment discontinuation. Anti-tumor effects of LEM
      will be assessed and patients will be evaluated for safety and tolerability.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of
      LEM.

      II. Measure the blood pharmacokinetics of LEM following IV administration.

      III. Observe any anti-tumor effects of LEM.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is an open-label study for patients with advanced and/or metastatic,
      histologically-documented solid tumors considered to be unresponsive to available
      conventional treatment.

      LEM will be administered IV over 45 minutes. At least three patients will be studied at each
      dose level and at least three patients will complete one 21-day course before any patient is
      enrolled at the next dose level. Study drug administration will continue on an every 3-week
      schedule in the absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. A subsequent course
      of treatment may be administered at least 21 days after a prior LEM dose has been
      administered when study criteria are met.

      Cohorts of 3 patients per dose level will be studied. This will be expanded to 6 if a DLT
      occurs, followed by a total of 6 patients at a possible MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is expected that 21 to 30 patients will be entered into the study to
      determine the MTD: 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if DLT occurs, followed by a total of 6
      patients at a possible MTD. The dose level identified as the MTD may then be expanded up to
      12 patients to permit additional safety assessment.
