      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of tumor
      cells and slow the growth of CNS tumors.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have
      recurrent or progressive CNS tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib in patients with recurrent or
           progressive supratentorial malignant gliomas or brain or spinal meningiomas receiving
           enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs). (Phase I of the study closed to accrual as
           of 09/19/2003).

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in patients receiving EIAEDs.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug in terms of 6-month progression-free survival of
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of the phase II dose of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to
      concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) (yes vs no) and disease type (for
      phase II only) (benign meningioma vs malignant meningioma vs hemangiopericytoma vs
      glioblastoma vs other anaplastic glioma). (Phase I closed to accrual as of 09/19/2003).

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (who are receiving EIAEDs) receive escalating doses of gefitinib
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study within 10 months . (Phase I closed to accrual as of 09/19/2003). A total of 48 patients
      will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study within 6-8 months.
