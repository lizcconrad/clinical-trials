  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is to see if combining bevacizumab with idarubicin and cytarabine works
      better in treating patients who have blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or
      deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin and
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment
      for blast phase chronic myelogenous leukemia

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the anti-leukemic activity of bevacizumab, idarubicin, and cytarabine in
      patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      effect of bevacizumab on angiogenesis in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes once on day -13. Patients then receive
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes and idarubicin IV on days 1 and 15 and cytarabine
      subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a
      maximum of 3 courses. Patients with responding disease receive maintenance therapy comprising
      bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 15, idarubicin IV on day 1, and cytarabine SC
      once daily beginning on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 2 years in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
