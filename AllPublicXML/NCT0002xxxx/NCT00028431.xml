  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the efficacy of a melanoma vaccine chemotherapy cocktail
      composed of CTLA-4 antibody; tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 peptides; and incomplete Freund's
      adjuvant (IFA) with or without interleukin-12 in patients with resected stage III or IV
      melanoma.

    <textblock>
      In the Phase I/II trial, patients with resected stages III and IV melanoma who have been
      rendered free of disease, but are at high risk of relapse, are treated with peptides/IFA at a
      dose of 0.5 mg each peptide plus CTLA-4 antibody given intravenously, 3 mg/kg, after each
      vaccination. In the Phase II randomized study, patients are treated with the melanoma peptide
      vaccine alone, with CTLA-4 antibody, or with CTLA-4 antibody combined with IL-12 at 30 ng/kg
      with alum. The peptides are tyrosinase 368-376 (370D); gp100 209-217 (210M); and MART-1 26-35
      (27L) which are emulsified with IFA. The dosing schedule for both trials are at 1, 2, 3, 4,
      5, and 6 months; then at 9 and 12 for a total of 8 vaccinations.
