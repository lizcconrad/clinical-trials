      This study will compare the health and well being of children treated with a modified stem
      cell transplantation procedure for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) with that of children
      receiving standard of care treatment. CGD is an inherited disorder of neutrophils-a type of
      infection-fighting white blood cell-that leaves patients vulnerable to life-threatening
      infections. Standard treatment with antibiotics, and sometimes surgery, is not always
      successful, and patients with persisting infections have a poor long-term prognosis.

      Transplantation of donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into
      white and red blood cells and platelets) can improve immune function in patients with CGD and
      possibly cure the disease. However, this procedure carries a significant risk of death,
      because it requires complete suppression of the immune system with high-dose chemotherapy. In
      addition, lymphocytes-another type of infection-fighting white blood cell-from the donor may
      cause what is called graft versus host disease (GvHD), in which the donor cells 'see'
      patient's cells as foreign and mount an immune response to reject them. To try to reduce
      these risks, patients in this study will be given low-dose chemotherapy that is easier for
      the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression. Also, the
      donor's lymphocytes will be removed from the rest of the stem cells to be transplanted,
      reducing the risk of GvHD.

      Patients with CGD between 2 and 17 years of age who 1) are currently free of active
      infection, and 2) have a history of at least one life-threatening infection or a family
      member with CGD and a history of at least one life-threatening infection, and 3) a family
      member that is a suitable donor may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a
      medical history, physical examination and blood tests, lung and heart function tests, x-rays
      or CT scans of the body, and dental and eye examinations. They will fill out questionnaires
      that measure emotional well being, quality of life, and intelligence (ability to learn and
      understand).

      Stem cells will be collected from both the patient and donor. To do this, the hormone G-CSF
      will be injected under the skin for several days to move stem cells from the bone marrow to
      the bloodstream. Then, the stem cells will be collected by apheresis. In this procedure the
      blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the
      required cells are separated out and removed. Then, the rest of the blood is returned through
      a needle in the other arm.

      Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will start a 'conditioning regimen' of
      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and Campath 1H. When the conditioning therapy
      is completed, the donor's stem cells will be infused. To help prevent rejection of donor
      cells, cyclosporine will be given by mouth or by vein starting 1 month after the transplant
      procedure.

      The average hospital stay for stem cell transplantation is 21 days. After discharge, patients
      will return to the NIH clinic for follow-up clinic visits weekly or twice weekly for 2 to 3
      months. These visits will include a symptom check, physical examination and blood tests.
      Subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled 1 to 3 times a year for at least 5 years.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is one of several inherited disorders of leukocyte
      function. Patients are profoundly immunocompromised and plagued early in life with recurrent
      and often life threatening infections. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation significantly
      improves immune function in patients with CGD. The primary objective of this study is to
      investigate efficacy of a novel approach to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, which is
      designed to promote partial or complete donor stem cell engraftment (hematopoietic chimerism)
      with reduced transplant related morbidity and mortality. In an attempt to reduce toxicity
      from pre-transplant bone marrow conditioning, a highly immunosuppressive, low intensity bone
      marrow conditioning regimen will be used. Patients will be transplanted with peripheral blood
      stem cells from an HLA identical family member. The graft will be enriched for hematopoietic
      stem cells in an attempt to decrease the risk of graft versus host disease. Donor T-cells
      will be infused at various time points following the transplant to augment donor
      hematopoietic chimerism and aid in immune reconstitution. Patients treated with this approach
      will be compared to patients who are considered transplant-eligible but lack an HLA identical
      family member. These patients will be treated using the current standard of care. The primary
      end points of this study are to demonstrate reduced incidence of CGD-like infections in the
      transplanted patients compared to the controls (efficacy) with acceptable incidence of acute
      and chronic graft versus host disease and transplant related mortality (safety). Long term
      follow up data from transplanted patients and concurrent controls will be analyzed to confirm
      the association between establishment of hematopoietic chimerism and clinical benefit.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        The following conditions must be met before a patient may be enrolled in the study:

        Patients ages 2 to 17 years; minimum weight of 12 kg.

        DHR proven chronic granulomatous disease with gp91 phox or p22 phox deficiency.

        History of at least one life-threatening infection (defined as any infection requiring
        treatment with intravenous antibiotic therapy) or a family member with CGD and a history of
        life-threatening infection.

        Free of active infection.

        Patients with consenting HLA-matched related donors that meet donor selection criteria
        (test patients), or patients without an eligible HLA-matched related donor (control
        patients). Patients with eligible donors who choose not to undergo stem cell
        transplantation or patients with eligible but non-consenting donors may be enrolled in the
        control arm of the study. Patients enrolled in the control arm who complete a 24 month
        follow-up period may enroll in the transplant arm should an eligible, consenting donor
        become available.

        Patients with adequate organ function as measured by:

        Cardiac: Asymptomatic or, if symptomatic, then left ventricular ejection fraction at rest
        must be greater than 35%.

        Hepatic: SGOT within 4 times normal range and total bilirubin less than 2mg/dL.

        Renal: Creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 50 mL/min/ 1.73m(2). A maximum age
        adjusted serum creatinine will be used for patients who are unable to provide an accurate
        24 hour urine collection. For children less than or equal to 5 years of age, the maximum
        serum creatinine (mg/dl) is 0.8; for children whose age is greater than 5 to less than or
        equal to 10, the maximum serum creatinine (mg/dl) is 1.0; for children whose age is greater
        than 10 to less than or equal to age 15, the maximum serum creatinine (mg/dl) is 1.2; and
        for children whose age is greater than 15, the maximum serum creatinine (mg/dl) is 1.5.

        Pulmonary: DLCO (diffusion capacity) and FEV1 greater than 45 percent of predicted
        (corrected for hemoglobin). Minors in whom pulmonary function tests are not possible will
        be evaluated for significant pulmonary dysfunction by a pulmonary consultant.

        Written informed consent/assent conforming to institutional guidelines obtained from
        patient and parent.

        Absence of co-existing medical problems that would significantly increase the risk of a
        transplant procedure in the judgment of the principal investigator.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Any one of the following conditions eliminates a patient from participating in this
        protocol:

        Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

        ECOG performance status of 2 or more or less than 50 percent on the Lansky scale for ages
        0-10.

        Seropositivity for HIV due to excessive risk of infection and neurotoxicity of
        antiretroviral medications.

        Evidence of rapid deterioration due to progressive infection and/or organ damage.

        Malignant diseases liable to relapse or progress within 5 years.

        DONOR SELECTION:

        Donors must be fit to receive G-CSF and give peripheral blood stem cells (normal blood
        count, normotensive, no history of stroke, no history of severe heart disease, greater than
        12kg).

        Related to the patient and HLA-phenotypically identical with the patient for HLA-A, B and
        DRB1 alleles. Matching assessed minimally by serology for Class I and DNA typing for Class
        II antigens.

        Female x-linked CGD carriers must have greater than 30 percent normal neutrophils.

        If donor is a sibling who is a minor, he/ she is the oldest eligible sibling and no adult
        siblings are eligible donors.

        Written informed consent from donor. Donors who are minors will be evaluated by a social
        worker, psychologist or psychiatrist prior to the assent process to determine willingness
        to participate. If willingness to participate has been confirmed, informed consent will be
        obtained from adult parent or legal guardian. Informed assent will be obtained from minor
        donor in the presence of a third party who will assess comprehension and voluntary
        participation.
