    <textblock>
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that follows exposure to an
      extremely traumatic stressors. PTSD is associated with serious symptoms. While numerous
      approaches have been used to treat PTSD, these treatments have several limiting factors. This
      study will evaluate a combination of the drugs clonazepam and paroxetine for the treatment of
      PTSD symptoms.

      The main goal of treatment in patients with PTSD is to significantly reduce symptom severity
      and improve functioning. While numerous approaches have been used to treat PTSD, these
      treatments are limited by variable response rates, up to a 6-week lag period before clinical
      response, and sub-optimal side effect profile, including possible worsening of anxiety and
      insomnia prior to clinical response. The proposed study will examine whether combined
      treatment with a benzodiazepine (clonazepam) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (paroxetine) in patients with PTSD will accelerate the onset of clinical response. A second
      goal is to evaluate whether the rapid and clinically meaningful benefits are sustained until
      the end of the study, despite tapering off the benzodiazepine at the midpoint of the study.
      The safety and tolerability of a combination of paroxetine and clonazepam will be compared to
      paroxetine and placebo (an inactive pill) in the treatment of PTSD.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either paroxetine plus
      clonazepam or paroxetine plus a placebo for 12 weeks. Participants will have weekly clinic
      visits for the first 4 weeks of the study and every other week for the last 8 weeks. Symptoms
      of PTSD, anxiety, and depression will be evaluated and drug side effects will be noted during
      the follow-up visits.

    <textblock>
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder (DSM IV) (American Psychiatric
      Association) that follows exposure to an extremely traumatic stressor in which an individual
      experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with actual or threatened death or serious injury
      to self or others. The main goal of treatment in patients with PTSD is to significantly
      reduce symptom severity across reexperiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms along with
      improvement in function. While numerous approaches have been used to treat PTSD, these
      treatments are limited by variable response rates, up to a 6-week lag period prior to the
      onset of clinical response, and sub-optimal side effect profile, including possible worsening
      of anxiety and insomnia prior to clinical response.

      The proposed double blind study will examine whether combined treatment with a benzodiazepine
      (clonazepam) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (paroxetine) in patients with
      PTSD will accelerate the onset of clinical response. A second goal is to evaluate whether the
      rapid and clinically meaningful benefits are sustained until the end of the study, despite
      tapering off the benzodiazepine at the midpoint of the study. The safety and tolerability of
      a combination of paroxetine and clonazepam will be compared to paroxetine and placebo in the
      treatment of PTSD.

      We hypothesize that treatment with a combination of clonazepam and paroxetine will result in
      a rapid reduction of PTSD symptoms compared to treatment with placebo and paroxetine. We also
      propose that this accelerated reduction of symptoms will be sustained until the end-point of
      the study, despite tapering off the benzodiazepine at the midpoint of the study.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients with a primary diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder according to DSM-IV

        secondary to combat related trauma in Vietnam, Korea, or the Gulf will not be included.

        Subjects will be at least 18 years old. Those above age 65 years must be able to tolerate
        paroxetine starting dose of at least 20 mg daily and be without hepatic or renal
        impairment.

        Male and female subjects will be included.

        Patient must score greater than or equal to 50 on Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
        (CAPS-2) at baseline as a measure of PTSD symptom severity.

        study.

        Patients who are not currently on medications for PTSD or major depression.
