    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will study the safety and effectiveness of an engineered herpes virus,
      G207, administered directly into the brain of patients with recurrent brain cancer. G207 has
      been modified from the herpes virus that causes cold sores (called herpes simplex virus type
      1 or HSV-1). G207 has been designed so that it should kill tumor cells, but not harm normal
      brain cells. G207 has been shown to be safe in animal testing completed to date and in
      previous studies in patients with brain tumors.

      This is a phase Ib/II study. In the phase Ib portion of the study, patients will receive G207
      at a dose that is higher than tested in previous human studies. Patients will initially
      receive 15% of the assigned dose injected directly into the brain tumor. Approximately two
      days later, as much of the tumor as possible will be surgically removed, and more G207 will
      be injected into the brain tumor bed. Patients will be monitored, and medical tests will be
      done at specific study timepoints.

      The phase II portion will begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion.
      The goals of the phase II portion of the study are to determine the safety of G207 and to
      study patient survival at six months after G207 dosing. In the phase II portion of the study,
      patients will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose determined to be safe in the
      phase Ib portion of the study. The tumor will be removed, and G207 will be injected into any
      remaining tumor tissue in the brain tumor bed. Patients will be closely monitored, medical
      tests will be performed at specific study visits, and survival will be evaluated.

      Protocol NG1-003 is an open-label, phase Ib/II study of the safety and efficacy of G207, a
      genetically engineered herpes simplex type-1 virus. Up to 21 patients will be enrolled in the
      phase Ib portion and will receive doses of G207 that are higher than tested in the previous
      trials. The highest G207 dose tested in a previous phase I trial (NG1-001) was 3E9 plaque
      forming units (pfu). G207 was generally well tolerated and safe in NG1-001, and there was no
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients' deaths were due to progressive cancer disease except for
      one (due to radiation necrosis), and two patients remain alive today.

      Patients in the phase Ib portion of NG1-003 will receive G207 in divided doses. Initially,
      15% of the assigned dose will be injected into the tumor. Two days later, the tumor will be
      removed, and the assigned dose of G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of
      resection. The assigned doses are as follows: 1E9, 3E9, and 1E10 pfu. Patient status will be
      followed by MRI, Karnofsky performance, neurologic examination and the presence of G207 virus
      in the body, in addition to other medical tests done at specific study visits.

      The phase II portion of protocol NG1-003 is a two-stage study. The phase II portion will
      begin only if there are no safety concerns in the phase Ib portion. The goals are to
      determine the safety of G207 and survival at six months. Enrollment of up to 14 patients is
      planned for stage one. Additional patients will be enrolled (up to 30 additional patients and
      44 overall) in stage II if at least 6 of the 14 patients in stage 1 survive 6 months or
      longer. Participants in phase II will receive a single dose of G207 at the highest dose
      determined to be safe from phase Ib. G207 will be injected into the tumor bed at the time of
      resection. Again, patient status will be followed as previously described and survival will
      be evaluated.
