    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of CCI-779 in treating patients who have
      metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the anti-tumor activity of CCI-779, in terms of progression-free survival, in
           patients with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 7 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12
      months.
