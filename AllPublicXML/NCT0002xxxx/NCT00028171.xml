    <textblock>
      Tacrolimus is a medication given to transplant patients to help prevent rejection. The
      purpose of this study is to see if tacrolimus can be taken once a day instead of twice a day
      in kidney transplant patients.

      Transplant patients are required to take several medications to prevent rejection and to
      treat complications after their transplantation. Because of the complicated dosing schedule,
      it can be difficult for patients to follow their medication schedule. Taking fewer
      medications less frequently may help transplant patients to better manage their drug therapy.

      Tacrolimus is better absorbed in the body if it is taken in the morning than if it is taken
      in the evening. This suggests that tacrolimus can be taken once every morning instead of
      twice daily in order to produce appropriate drug exposure to prevent organ rejection without
      increased side effects.
