  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is to see if combining gemcitabine with bevacizumab works in treating
      patients who have advanced pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies,
      such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver
      cancer-killing substances to them. Combining chemotherapy with a monoclonal antibody may kill
      more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      are treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      II. To determine the toxicity experienced by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who are
      treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      III. To determine median and overall survival of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who
      are treated with gemcitabine plus bevacizumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure plasma VEGF and serum VCAM-1 levels before, during, and after therapy as a
      predictor of outcome.

      II. To collect and store serum samples for possible future assessment of other antiangiogenic
      inhibition markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
