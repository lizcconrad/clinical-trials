  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus imposes a major burden on the public health of the United States, leading
      annually to over 300,000 deaths and over $130 billion in costs. This burden falls
      disproportionately upon ethnic minority groups, particularly African Americans, who are at
      excess risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and for a variety of its most serious
      complications. Suboptimal health care - in terms of access, quality, and adherence -appears
      to be an important contributing factor. Prior work suggests two possible approaches aimed at
      prevention to enhance risk factor control in outpatients with type 2 diabetes. One approach
      uses Nurse Case Managers (NCMs) to coordinate care plans with the provider team following
      protocols/clinical guidelines and algorithms designed to guide treatment including initiating
      and adjusting drug therapy, enhancing continuity of care, promoting interventions and
      self-management which include educational and behavioral strategies incorporating feedback
      and self-regulation. Another approach uses Community Health Workers (CHWs) to enhance
      culturally sensitive outreach, linkage, and monitoring service; to provide important patient
      and family education; and to improve access to and continuity of care. Results indicate that
      this intensive team approach, compared to usual care alone, produces substantial improvements
      in metabolic control. However, the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is unknown in the
      ''real-world''.

      This has led to our current study, a randomized controlled trial within a managed care
      organization to determine the effects of a NCM/CHW team on metabolic control, on the
      occurrence of diabetes-related health events, health care utilization, and on direct health
      care costs. The participants will be African American adults with type 2 diabetes who receive
      primary care within a managed care organization in inner-city Baltimore.
