  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate how recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is utilized
      in patients with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). rt-PA is a drug that has been shown to
      dissolve blood, and may allow intraventricular catheters to be more effective for a longer
      period of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IVH occurs in about 40 percent of intracerebral hemorrhage cases and 15 percent of aneurysmal
      subarachnoid hemorrhage cases. Evidence supports a strong contribution of IVH to morbidity
      and mortality after cerebral hemorrhage. External ventricular drainage (EVD) is required
      clinical management; however, EVD via intraventricular catheter alone fails to prevent much
      of the morbidity and mortality of IVH. This study seeks to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy of intraventricular thrombolysis, using rt-PA, as a method of removing this blood
      and altering morbidity and mortality. Patients will receive intraventricular injections of
      rt-PA or placebo every 12 hours. They will be followed prospectively with daily head CT scans
      during the acute-treatment phase and again between Days 28 and 32.
