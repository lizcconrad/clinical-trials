  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis (a narrowing of spaces in the backbone that results in pressure on the
      spinal cord and/or nerve roots) is a condition that occurs frequently, particularly in the
      elderly. This condition can lead to significant pain and limit a person's ability to
      function. Moreover, doctors disagree about the best way to treat people with lumbar spinal
      stenosis.

      In this study we will compare surgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with nonsurgical
      treatment using physical therapy. The results of this study should help clarify which
      treatment strategies are the most effective for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lumbar spinal stenosis is a frequently encountered condition, particularly in the elderly,
      which can lead to significant pain and functional limitations. The prevalence of this
      condition is growing as the population continues to age. Substantial controversy exists
      regarding the management of lumbar spinal stenosis. Surgery has traditionally been the
      treatment of choice, although physicians typically recommend a trial of nonsurgical care
      prior to surgery. The most effective means of nonsurgical treatment has not been identified,
      although a &quot;standard&quot; regimen has been developed.

      There is presently no evidence in the literature regarding the relative effectiveness of
      surgical versus nonsurgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis, or the efficacy of the
      standard nonsurgical treatment approach. This randomized clinical trial will compare surgical
      decompression versus nonsurgical treatment (i.e., physical therapy) of lumbar spinal
      stenosis. The results of this study should help clarify which treatment strategies are the
      most effective for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.
