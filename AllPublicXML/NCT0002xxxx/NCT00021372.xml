      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel and estramustine
      in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
      of patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with paclitaxel and
      estramustine. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral estramustine 2-3 times daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV
      over 1 hour on day 2 on weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for at least 1 course in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete or
      partial response continue therapy for at least 3 courses or for 1 course after achieving
      maximum response. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed relapsed or refractory intermediate,
        high-grade, or transformed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Received 1-3 prior treatment regimens
        (cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by high-dose therapy with stem cell support considered
        1 regimen) Measurable disease A new classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
        has been adopted by PDQ. The terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will
        replace the terminology of &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this
        protocol uses the former terminology.

        PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Age: Over 18 Performance status: ECOG 0-2 Life expectancy: At
        least 12 weeks Hematopoietic: Granulocyte count greater than 1,500/mm3* Platelet count
        greater than 75,000/mm3* * Unless due to lymphomatous marrow involvement Hepatic: Bilirubin
        less than 1.5 mg/dL* SGOT/SGPT less than 2 times normal* * Unless due to lymphomatous
        involvement Renal: Creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL* OR Creatinine clearance greater than 50
        mL/min* * Unless due to lymphomatous involvement Cardiovascular: No active uncontrolled
        angina pectoris No New York Heart Association class II-IV heart disease No myocardial
        infarction within the past 6 months No history of recurrent deep venous thrombosis not
        associated with catheter placement Other: No other prior malignancy within the past 5 years
        except curatively treated cervical cancer or basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer No
        serious concurrent medical illness that would preclude study No active infection

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY: Biologic therapy: See Disease Characteristics Chemotherapy: See
        Disease Characteristics At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy and recovered No prior
        paclitaxel, docetaxel, or estramustine Endocrine therapy: Not specified Radiotherapy: At
        least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy and recovered Surgery: Not specified
