      RATIONALE: A videotape support program may help families improve communication and coping

      PURPOSE: Randomized trial to study the effectiveness of a video support program for families
      who have a parent who has been newly diagnosed with cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine if families who participate in a video support program function
      better as a family in the areas of communication, togetherness, and overall increased ability
      to cope when a parent is newly diagnosed with cancer. II. Determine if participation in this
      program decreases stress-related illness in the well members of the family. III. Determine
      the safety of this program. IV. Determine patient/family and medical provider satisfaction
      with this program.

      OUTLINE: This a randomized study. Adult parent participants and spouses undergo a baseline
      assessment over approximately 1 hour comprising completion of a self-assessment form followed
      by an interview. Families are then randomized to one of two arms. Arm I: Adult parent
      participants receive a video support program comprising 3 videotapes (parent tape, adolescent
      tape, and child tape) and a parent guidebook. The parents are encouraged to screen the
      videotapes and decide whether to have their child and/or adolescent view the program. Arm II:
      Adult parent participants receive no video support material. Families may view the video
      program after study completion. Adult parent participants in both arms complete follow-up
      assessments at 6 and 12 weeks. This clinical trial is being conducted at the locations listed
      below. If you are interested in this clinical trial but unable to visit these locations,
      please call #1-800-848-3895 ext. 226 and ask for more information about the We Can Cope
      study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 230 families will be accrued for this study.
