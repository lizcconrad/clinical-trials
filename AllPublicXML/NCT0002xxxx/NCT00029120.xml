      The purpose of this study is to examine how a part of the brain called the hippocampus
      contributes to memory changes that occur with aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      Memory problems are the most important early symptoms of AD. The hippocampal region of the
      brain may be responsible for many age- and AD-related memory disorders. This study will use
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to examine the structure, chemical composition, and
      function of the hippocampus in participants with AD, participants with mild memory problems,
      participants who are healthy but are at risk for AD, and healthy volunteers.

      Participants in this study will undergo MRI scans of the brain. During the MRI, participants
      will perform memory tests to demonstrate hippocampal functioning.

      The major focus of the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch (GPB) is the study of individuals with
      memory disorders as a result of age or neurodegeneration. In particular, memory is the most
      important earliest clinical symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the hippocampus may
      not be a biological determinant of all memories, there is a growing body of evidence
      suggesting that dysfunction of the hippocampus plays an important role in the most common
      forms of memory disorders. This proposal will allow for the application of an array of newly
      developed magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy methods to the study of hippocampal
      function in these patients. Most importantly, for the first time, structure, perfusion and
      neurochemical composition of the hippocampus in living individuals can be evaluated at high
      resolution without known risk. The study of longitudinal changes in hippocampal function
      should allow us to understand the contributions that various genotypes, e.g., ApoE4, and
      abnormalities in cerebrospinal fluid, e.g., A-beta42 and tau, play in the development of
      abnormal hippocampal structure and function.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients will be referred through the GPB screening protocol 95-M-0096:

        Subjects will include:

          1. AD patients, diagnosis based on DSM-IV (APA Press, 1994) criteria,

          2. Individuals over the age of 50 who are &quot;at-risk&quot; for AD on the basis of having
             first-degree relatives with AD and who tested within the normal range on a battery of
             cognitive tests at the time of initial inclusion,

          3. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment (memory problems significant enough to
             concern the individual or members of the individual's family who do not meet the
             criteria for AD),

          4. Control subjects, individuals without a positive family history of dementia in their
             first degree relatives and who test within the normal range on the battery of
             cognitive tests. As part of this screening process subjects who medical histories
             significant for any medical condition that would make it unsafe to perform MRI scans
             will be excluded.

        EXLCUSION CRITERIA:

        The same exclusion criteria used in those protocols for structural MRI and delineated under
        Hazards and Precautions would again be used.

        All subjects participating in functional MRI scans will be required to be off prescription
        medications which could effect these scans, such as medications with anticholinergic
        effects, for two weeks-to one month prior to PET scan, and off psychotropic medication for
        one month. Withdrawal from psychotropic medications for purposes of participation in this
        protocol would only be considered for individuals already involved in the Longitudinal
        Study Protocol 95-M-0096.

        Subjects will be cautioned not to consume alcohol, marijuana, or psychotropic drugs while
        on the study, nor to smoke, use caffeinated beverages, or take over-the counter medications
        such as cold medications (i.e.: benadryl, sudafed) for at least 12 hours prior to the
        functional MRI scans.

        Pregnancy test will be conducted prior to MRI scans on women of childbearing age.
