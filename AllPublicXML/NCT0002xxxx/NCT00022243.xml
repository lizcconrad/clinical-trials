      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of T138067 in treating patients who have
      locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has not responded to previous
      chemotherapy.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with locally advanced
      or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have failed first-line therapy with a taxane
      when treated with T138067 sodium. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic
      effects of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the number of patients who progress
      when treated with this drug. IV. Determine the duration of response, time to disease
      progression, and median survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Correlate the toxic
      effects of this drug with peak plasma levels in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive T138067 sodium IV over 3 hours on days
      1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months after study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
        Locally advanced or metastatic disease Received a prior first-line taxane (as a single
        agent or component of a combination regimen) as the only chemotherapy for locally advanced
        or metastatic disease Any amount of prior adjuvant chemotherapy allowed Bidimensionally
        measurable disease outside the field of prior radiotherapy Amenable to radiologic imaging
        techniques No clinically apparent CNS metastases or carcinomatous meningitis

        Platelet count at least 100,000/mm3 Hepatic: Bilirubin no greater than 1.5 times upper
        limit of normal (ULN) AST and ALT no greater than 3 times ULN Albumin greater than 2.5 g/dL
        No history of Gilbert's syndrome Renal: Creatinine no greater than 1.5 times ULN Other: No
        other malignancy within the past 5 years except adequately treated basal cell or squamous
        cell skin cancer or carcinoma in situ of the cervix No other severe disease, infection, or
        comorbidity that would preclude study participation No known defect of glutathione
        metabolism Not pregnant or nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patients must use
        effective contraception during and for 3 months after study

        biologic response modifiers No concurrent routine or prophylactic filgrastim (G-CSF) or
        sargramostim No concurrent epoetin alfa Chemotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least
        4 weeks since prior chemotherapy (6 weeks for mitomycin or nitrosoureas) and recovered No
        other concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy Endocrine therapy: No concurrent hormonal therapy
        for NSCLC Radiotherapy: See Disease Characteristics At least 2 weeks since prior
        limited-field radiotherapy not involving the hematopoietic bone marrow and recovered At
        least 4 weeks since prior radiotherapy to no more than 25% of the hematopoietic bone marrow
        and recovered No prior wide-field radiotherapy to the pelvis No concurrent radiotherapy
        (including palliative radiotherapy) Surgery: At least 4 weeks since prior major surgery
        Other: At least 4 weeks since prior investigational agents No concurrent anticonvulsants
        unless required for study drug-related toxicity No concurrent high-dose acetaminophen
        (i.e., at least 4 g/day) No other concurrent investigational agents
