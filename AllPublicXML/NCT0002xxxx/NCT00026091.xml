    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of fenretinide in treating patients who have
      recurrent or metastatic ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as fenretinide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of fenretinide (4-HPR) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
      or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity of this agent in this patient population. III. To evaluate
      molecular changes in normal and tumor cells induced by 4-HPR by studying: (a) the analysis of
      ceramide and glucosyleceramide levels before and after therapy, (b) intracellular levels of
      4-HPR and 4-MPR, and (c) determinants of apoptosis (p53, p21, bcl-2, bax and terminal
      deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT] assay) in baseline tumor specimens, serial serum and tumor
      biopsy specimens where available, and surrogate in-vitro studies.

      IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of fenretinide. V. To further investigate the
      antiangiogenesis effects of fenretinide in in-vitro assays using ovarian cancer cell lines
      and in vascular growth factor (VEGF, TGFb) plasma levels in patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
