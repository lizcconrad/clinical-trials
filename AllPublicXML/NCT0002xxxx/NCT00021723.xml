  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient, safety, tolerability, and pilot
      efficacy study of intramuscular AN-1792 in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll approximately 375 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease at
      investigational sites in the United States and Europe. Patients will receive either AN-1792
      or placebo, and they will be evaluated using standard clinical assessments of cognition and
      memory as well as experimental surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease pathology. The goal
      of the study is to evaluate the clinical impact of eliciting an immune response (formation of
      antibodies) to the A-beta peptide in patients with Alzheimer's disease.
