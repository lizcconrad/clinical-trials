      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine given as a continuous
      infusion in treating patients who have advanced metastatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of continuous infusion gemcitabine in patients with
           metastatic malignancies.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients on dose levels 1-5 receive gemcitabine IV continuously over 72 hours on week 1.
      Patients on dose levels 6 and 7 receive gemcitabine IV continuously over 72 hours on weeks
      1-3. Courses repeat every 2 weeks (for patients on dose levels 1-5) and every 4 weeks (for
      patients on dose levels 6 and 7) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
