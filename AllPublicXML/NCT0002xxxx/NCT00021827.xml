  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTH-related protein, or ''PTHrP'', is a hormone which was discovered in 1987. As its name
      implies, it is closely related to another hormone discovered in the 1920's named parathyroid
      hormone or ''PTH''. PTH has been shown to be effective in treating osteoporosis in both
      animals and humans. PTHrP has been shown to be effective in treating osteoporosis in
      laboratory animals, and there are strong scientific reasons to think that it may be effective
      in humans as well. However, no human trials with PTHrP in the treatment of osteoporosis have
      been performed. The studies in this trial are focussed on determining whether PTHrP can
      indeed increase bone mass in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, when administered daily
      by subcutaneous injection for three months.
