  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and
      radiation therapy with or without tipifarnib in treating patients who have locally advanced
      pancreatic cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumor cells. Tipifarnib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary
      for tumor cell growth. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with tipifarnib may be an
      effective treatment for pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the 1-year survival rate in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer
      treated with paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and radiotherapy with or without tipifarnib.

      II. Determine the toxicity and loco-regional activity of this chemoradiotherapy regimen in
      these patients.

      III. Determine the feasibility and toxicity of prolonged administration of tipifarnib after
      chemoradiotherapy in these patients.

      IV. Determine whether tipifarnib administered after chemoradiotherapy can increase
      progression-free and overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to weight
      loss in the preceding 6 months (more than 10% vs 10% or less) and tumor dimension (at least 5
      cm vs less than 5 cm). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 5.5 weeks, beginning on
      day 1. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36.

      Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy as in arm I. Within 3-8 weeks after completion of
      chemoradiotherapy, patients without disease progression receive oral tipifarnib twice daily
      for 21 days.

      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
