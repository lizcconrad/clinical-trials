  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test 2 different dosing regimens of GW433908/ritonavir (RTV)
      versus lopinavir (LPV)/RTV when each is given with 2 active reverse transcriptase inhibitors
      (RTIs), in patients who have taken anti-HIV drugs without success.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive 2 dosing regimens of GW433908/RTV or LPV/RTV, in combination with 2
      active RTIs, after failing their first or second protease inhibitor-containing regimen.
      Patients are required to be on therapy at time of screening and must remain on this therapy
      until Day 1.
