  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is to see if bevacizumab works in treating patients who have persistent
      or recurrent cancer of the cervix. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block
      cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread.
      Others find cancer cells and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the cytostatic antitumor activity of bevacizumab, in terms of 6-month
      progression-free survival (PFS), in patients with persistent or recurrent squamous cell
      carcinoma of the cervix.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Estimate
      the distribution of PFS and overall survival for patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the frequency of clinical response (partial and complete) in patients treated
      with this drug.

      V. Determine the role of age and initial performance status as prognostic factors in patients
      treated with this drug.

      VI. Determine whether biological and imaging markers are associated with clinical efficacy of
      this drug, such as 6-month PFS, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-38
      months.

    <description>RECIST 1.0 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

    <time_frame>Every other cycle during treatment, then every 3 months for the first 2 years, then every six months for the next three years and then annually for the next 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Progression is defined according to RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since study entry, the appearance of one or more new lesions, death due to disease without prior objective documentation of progression, global deterioration in health status attributable to the disease requiring a change in therapy without objective evidence of progression, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

        <description>RECIST 1.0 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>
