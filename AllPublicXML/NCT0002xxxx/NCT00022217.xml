      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Giving more than one drug and giving the drugs in different ways
      may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin-epinephrine injectable gel
      plus paclitaxel and carboplatin in treating patients who have recurrent head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the antitumor activity of intratumoral cisplatin-epinephrine
      injectable gel and systemic paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with recurrent squamous
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II. Determine the safety of this regimen in this patient
      population. III. Determine the time to progression, pattern of progression, and rate of
      relapse of patients treated with this regimen. VI. Determine the time to response and
      duration of response of patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the overall survival
      of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cisplatin-epinephrine gel
      intratumorally on days -15, -8, 1, 8, 15, and 22 for course 1 and days 1, 8, 15, and 22 for
      all subsequent courses. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over at least 3 hours followed by
      carboplatin IV over at least 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve local complete
      response (CR) and no metastatic disease progression continue treatment with carboplatin and
      paclitaxel only. Patients who achieve total CR may receive 2 additional courses of
      carboplatin and paclitaxel. Patients are followed at 1-4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
