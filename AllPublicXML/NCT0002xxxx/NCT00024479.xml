  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the causes of rheumatic diseases and why many of them affect certain
      minority communities more severely. Rheumatic diseases may cause joint pain, stiffness or
      swelling. Some can involve bones, muscles, tendons or ligaments. Some cause abnormalities of
      the immune system the body s defense against disease. Some rheumatic diseases are painful or
      deforming and some can be life threatening. Information obtained from this study will be used
      to learn about the disparities in rheumatic disease in the minority community and to design
      further, more targeted, research studies to address this issue.

      Patients with known or suspected rheumatic disease 18 years of age or older may be eligible
      for this study. Candidates will undergo a medical history and physical examination to confirm
      the diagnosis of rheumatic disease and determine what is needed for evaluation and treatment.

      Participants will receive standard medical care for rheumatic disease and arthritis. No
      experimental treatments, medications or procedures will be included in this study. Procedures
      may include routine blood tests for blood chemistries, cell counts, and antibodies commonly
      found in patients with rheumatic disease; a urine test for proteins and cells; and X-rays and
      other imaging tests to check for abnormalities in the lungs or other organs. All medical
      information will be kept confidential.

      Patients who are found to be eligible for other current NIH research studies will be offered
      an opportunity to participate in these studies.

      This protocol will permit the evaluation and treatment of subjects who are members of the

      minority community, for the purpose to facilitate understanding the pathogenesis and natural
      history of rheumatic diseases in this community. Patients will be evaluated with a history
      and physical examination and routine laboratory studies will be obtained as needed to assess
      diagnosis, disease activity, disease complications and to monitor for treatment related
      responses and toxicities. Patients eligible for other research protocols will be offered an
      opportunity to participate in these studies by signed informed consent. Any medical care
      recommended or provided to the patient will be consistent with routine standards of practice
      and will be provided in consultation with the patient s referring physician. All patients
      referred to this study must have a primary care provider provide a referral. The
      establishment of this protocol will provide a means to evaluate and treat patients from the
      minority community, and to generate hypotheses and protocols based on this clinical
      experience that will address questions of health disparities in the rheumatic diseases.
