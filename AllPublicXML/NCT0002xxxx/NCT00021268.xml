      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of tocladesine in treating patients who
      have recurrent or progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of tocladesine in patients with recurrent or
           progressive metastatic colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Assess any therapeutic activity in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive tocladesine IV continuously on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tocladesine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 14 additional
      patients are treated at this dose level.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-38 patients will be accrued for this study.
