      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. Celecoxib may be effective in preventing lung cancer in tobacco
      smokers.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing non-small cell
      lung cancer in tobacco smokers.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy and feasibility of celecoxib for chemoprevention of primary
           non-small cell lung cancer in high-risk tobacco smokers.

        -  Determine the safety and long-term side effects of this drug in this population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 6 months.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months.
