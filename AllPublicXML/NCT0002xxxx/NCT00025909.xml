      This study will evaluate the effects of intermittent short cycles of HAART (highly active
      antiretroviral therapy) for treating HIV infection. HAART is a multi-drug regimen that is
      very effective in suppressing HIV and perhaps slowing or halting progression to AIDS.
      However, the treatment has significant drawbacks: it cannot completely rid the body of virus;
      long-term therapy carries a risk of toxicity (harmful side effects); and the regimen is
      difficult to comply with because many pills and capsules must be taken daily. When patients
      stop taking HAART, their HIV levels climb again. This study will see if giving HAART in short
      cycles of 7 days on, 7 days off, can keep viral levels low while maintaining CD4+ T cell
      counts.

      HIV-infected people age 18 or older who are receiving HAART and have a viral load of less
      than 50 copies/ml and a CD4+ T cell count of at least 175 cells/mm3 may be eligible for this
      study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and
      urine tests, and possibly a chest X-ray and electrocardiogram. Women of childbearing
      potential will have a pregnancy test.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either continue their current medication regimen or
      to take HAART in intermittent cycles of 7 days off, 7 days on. Patients will continue
      treatment for 72 weeks or until viral levels increase or CD4+ T cell counts decline to a
      level of concern.

      Upon entering the study, patients will have blood tests to monitor the amount of virus in the
      blood, CD4+ T cell count, viral resistance to HAART medications, side effects of the drug,
      and immune response to HIV in the test tube. They will have clinic visits for a history,
      physical examination and blood draws every month for 12 months. At that time, depending on T
      cell counts and viral load, the number of visits may be reduced, but never less frequently
      than every other month.

      Patients will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure for collecting quantities of white blood
      cells-every 3 to 4 months while on the study. For this procedure, whole blood is collected
      through a needle in an arm vein (similar to donating blood). The blood is circulated through
      a cell separator where the white cells are removed, and the rest of the blood (plasma, red
      cells and platelets) is returned through the same needle or through a second one in the other
      arm. The collected white cells are used for special studies on the level and function of T
      cells and to detect hidden virus.

    <textblock>
      Although highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been successful in suppressing
      plasma HIV RNA levels in infected patients, it has not resulted in eradication of virus. It
      is now clear that virus replication persists despite undetectable plasma viremia in
      individuals receiving HAART. In this regard, withdrawing HAART, even after prolonged periods
      of virus suppression, leads to an almost universal rapid rebound of plasma viremia. It is
      also now clear that prolonged, continuous HAART carries a risk of significant toxicity and
      side effects. In addition, the monetary cost of HAART is prohibitive for many individuals and
      countries. These recent observations may argue for a different approach to HAART with the
      goals of : 1) durable suppression of virus replication, without an attempt at eradication, 2)
      minimization of toxicity and side effects and improvement in patient life-style, and 3) a
      reduction in cost. Therefore, we propose to study the virologic and immunologic effects of
      short cycle intermittent versus continuous HAART in HIV-infected individuals as a possible
      means to achieve these goals. In a pilot study of patients successfully treated with HAART,
      we have demonstrated that cycles of 7 days on HAART followed by 7 days off HAART can maintain
      suppression of plasma, lymph node, and resting CD4+ T cell HIV while maintaining CD4+ T cell
      counts for up to 1 year. It is the purpose of this study to further evaluate these
      observations with a randomized, controlled, intent-to-treat trial.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Documentation of HIV-1 infection by licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by a second
        method (e.g. Western Blot).

        Absolute CD4+ T-cell count of greater than or equal to 175/mm(3) within 30 days before
        randomization (For patients who are status post-splenectomy, also CD4+ T-cell greater than
        20%).

        If the CD4+ T cell count is less than or equal to 200 cells/mm(3), the patient must be
        receiving PCP prophylaxis.
