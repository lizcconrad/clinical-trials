  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of a critical enzyme in the body called acid alpha
      glucosidase (GAA). Normally, GAA is used by the body's cells to break down glycogen (a stored
      form of sugar) within specialized structures called lysosomes. In infants with severe cases
      of Pompe disease (called Classical Infantile Pompe disease), an excessive amount of glycogen
      accumulates and is stored in various tissues, especially heart, skeletal muscle, and liver,
      which prevents their normal function. This study being conducted to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of recombinant human acid alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) as a potential enzyme
      replacement therapy for Pompe disease. Patients diagnosed with Classical Infantile Pompe
      disease who have a small, but inactive, amount of natural GAA enzyme present in their bodies
      (called Cross-Reacting Immunologic Material-Positive or &quot;CRIM (+)&quot; patients), will be
      studied.
