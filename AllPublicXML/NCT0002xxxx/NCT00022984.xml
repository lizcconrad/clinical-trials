    <textblock>
      This study will explore how people with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) feel
      that dependence on this life-saving technology affects their health-related quality of life.
      ICD therapy is an important treatment option for patients with serious recurrent abnormal
      heart rhythms. Overall survival is significantly improved in high risk patients who receive
      this therapy. This study will explore patients' perceptions of the impact of this device on
      their health status and well being, and their physical, psychological and social functioning.

      Patients 18 years of age or older who have an implanted cardioverter defibrillator may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants will fill out a questionnaire booklet containing 170 questions about how they
      feel about their health, including their concerns and stresses, feelings about dependency on
      life-saving technology, and illness perception. There are also questions on demography, such
      as age, marital status, employment, etc. The booklet may take up to 30 minutes to complete.

      Information obtained from this study may lead to a better understanding of how people feel
      about their health after receiving an ICD and help patients and families adapt to living with
      the device.

    <textblock>
      With the efficacy of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD ) therapy well established,
      the survival time of recipients of this technology must be interpreted more broadly. It is
      important to better understand how ICD recipients perceive their dependence on this life
      saving technology and how these perceptions influence their Health Related Quality of Life
      (HRQL). The purpose of this cross sectional, predictive study is to test a causal model that
      may explain the link between attitudes towards dependency on technology and HRQL in a sample
      of adult ICD recipients. The hypothesized model consists of seven variables: attitudes
      towards technology dependency; age; gender; illness history; illness representation; symptom
      distress; and HRQL. Adult subjects (greater than 18 years) who have received an ICD will be
      asked to participate. Subjects will complete a self-administered, mailed questionnaire that
      includes five instruments: 1) The Medical Outcomes Short Form 36 Survey Version 1.0; 2) The
      Important Concerns and Distress Questionnaire; 3) The Illness Perception Questionnaire; 4)
      The Dependency on Technology Scales; 5) Demographic Questionnaire. The model will be tested
      statistically by use of Structural Equation Modeling techniques. The definitive goal of this
      study is to develop a theoretically meaningful and statistically well-fitting model that
      specifies how dependence on technology influences HRQL. The hypothesis for this study is that
      the full structural equation model fits data from the sample of adult ICD recipients.
