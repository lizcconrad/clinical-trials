  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can locate cancer cells and either kill them or
      deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Interleukin-12 may
      kill cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the tumor and by stimulating a person's white
      blood cells to kill cancer cells. Combining rituximab with interleukin-12 may kill more
      cancer cells. This randomized phase II trial is comparing how well giving rituximab together
      with two different schedules of interleukin-12 works in treating patients with B-cell
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the objective response in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with
      rituximab and 2 different schedules of interleukin-12*.

      II. Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients. III. Determine the
      objective response rate in patients with mantle cell lymphoma treated with these regimens.

      IV. Determine the overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with these
      regimens.

      V, Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. NOTE: *Interleukin-12
      will no longer be available after 6/30/05.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      histology (mantle cell lymphoma vs other [closed to accrual as of 3/10/04]) and International
      Prognostic Factor Index (low and low-intermediate risk [closed to accrual as of 3/10/04] vs
      high-intermediate and high risk). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients receive
      interleukin-12* subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly beginning on day 2 and continuing until
      disease progression.

      ARM II (closed to accrual as of 11/14/03): Patients receive rituximab as in arm I. Patients
      are evaluated at week 12. Patients with stable or progressive disease receive interleukin-12*
      SC twice weekly until disease progression or for 24 weeks. Patients with a complete or
      partial response after rituximab are monitored until disease progression and then begin
      interleukin-12 SC twice weekly until further disease progression.

      NOTE: *Interleukin-12 will no longer be available after 06/30/05. Patients proceed to
      follow-up as outlined below.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 4 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (45 per treatment arm [arm II closed to accrual as
      of 11/14/03]) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
