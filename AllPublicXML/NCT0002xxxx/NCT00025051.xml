      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be effective in preventing skin cancer by decreasing redness caused
      by exposure to ultraviolet light and changing potential skin cancer biomarkers. It is not yet
      known whether celecoxib is more effective than a placebo in preventing skin cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing skin
      cancer in participants exposed to ultraviolet light.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether celecoxib decreases ultraviolet(UV)-induced erythema and affects
           surrogate biomarkers of potential neoplastic change in participants with Fitzpatrick
           type I-IV skin exposed to UV light.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Participants are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral celecoxib twice daily for approximately 120 days.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily for approximately 120 days.

      Skin biopsies of UV-exposed sites are evaluated.

      Participants are followed for up to 5 weeks post-treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 participants (18 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 8 months.
