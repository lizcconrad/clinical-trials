  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether the anti-VEGF drug is effective at
      stabilizing and/or improving vision in patients with the wet form of AMD

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-masked, controlled, dose-ranging, multi-center comparative
      trial, in parallel groups. Patients will be stratified by clinical center, by percentage of
      classic CNV vessels: [predominantly classic (&gt;50%) vs. minimally classic (1-49%) vs. purely
      occult (0%)], and according to whether, or not, they have received prior PDT with Visudyne
      (no more than once). All patients will be re-randomized after 54 weeks of treatment to
      either, continue or discontinue therapy for further 48 weeks.

        Patients of either gender, aged 50 years or above, diagnosed with subfoveal CNV secondary
        to AMD and with best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 to 20/320 in the absence of subfoveal
        atrophy or scarring in the study eye, and better or equal to 20/800 in the fellow eye, may
        be enrolled. Clinically significant concomitant diseases will be excluded.
