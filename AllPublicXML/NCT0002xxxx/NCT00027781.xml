      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of MEN-10755 in treating patients who have
      progressive prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Assess the activity of MEN-10755 in patients with progressive hormone-refractory
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the rate and duration of objective PSA response in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients with measurable disease treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Beginning within 2 weeks after the last PSA measurement, patients receive MEN-10755 IV over
      30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete or partial
      response continue to receive additional courses. Patients who achieve stable disease may
      receive more than 4 courses at the discretion of the investigator.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression or initiation of a new therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically confirmed hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Disease progression while on prior luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)
             analogues or after orchiectomy and antiandrogens, given concurrently or consecutively

          -  Disease progression is defined as PSA progression documented by increases in PSA
             recorded at 2 consecutive measurements over a prior reference value

               -  Interval of at least 1 week between the reference value and the first of these
                  two PSA increases

          -  Continued elevation of PSA for at least 6 weeks after discontinuation of antiandrogens

          -  Last PSA value at least 5 ng/mL (Hybritech equivalent)

          -  Must have serum testosterone less than 50 ng/mL and must continue on LHRH agonist
