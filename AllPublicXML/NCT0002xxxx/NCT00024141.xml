      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan followed by fluorouracil in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the optimal dose of irinotecan when administered before fluorouracil in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan with its biologic effects in these
           patients.

        -  Assess, in a preliminary manner, the antitumor activity of this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of irinotecan.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and fluorouracil IV
      over 5 minutes on days 2, 9, 16, and 23. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive decreasing doses of irinotecan until the optimal dose is
      determined. The optimal dose is defined as the dose at which at least 3 of 6 patients show
      evidence of recruitment of cells into the S phase at 24 hours after irinotecan
      administration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
