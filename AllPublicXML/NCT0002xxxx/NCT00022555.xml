      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bryostatin 1 plus vincristine in treating
      patients who have recurrent or refractory lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different
      ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bryostatin 1 may help
      vincristine kill more cancer cells by making them more sensitive to the drug

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bryostatin 1 when administered with vincristine in
      patients with recurrent or refractory HIV-related B-cell lymphoma.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      objective response and survival of these patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this regimen on interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-2
      receptor, and IL-6 cytokine levels in these patients.

      V. Determine the effect of this regimen on CD4+ lymphocyte count and HIV load in these
      patients.

      VI. Determine the effect of this regimen on the human herpes virus-8 load in these patients
      with body cavity-based lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bryostatin 1.

      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously on days 1 and 15 and vincristine IV over 5
      minutes on days 2 and 16. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bryostatin 1 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.
