      RATIONALE: Herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine may decrease the side effects of
      chemotherapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of herbs used in traditional
      Chinese medicine in decreasing the side effects of chemotherapy after surgery in women who
      have stage I, stage II, or early stage III breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxic effects and safety of chinese herbal therapy (CHT) when administered
           for toxicity attenuation in combination with adjuvant doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide
           in women with stage I, II, or early stage III breast cancer.

        -  Determine patient compliance and the feasibility of using CHT by daily treatment
           calendars, weekly symptom inventories, and quality of life and mood state questionnaires
           completed by these patients.

        -  Determine patient preferences and concerns about CHT.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of CHT in ameliorating the toxic effects/side
           effects of adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in terms of the
           incidence and severity of adverse events, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive adjuvant doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
           days 0, 21, 42, and 63. Patients also receive oral chinese herbal therapy three times
           daily on days -10 to 105.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy as in arm I and oral placebo three times
           daily on days -10 to 105.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and on days 3, 24, 45, 66, 84, and 105.

      Patients are followed at day 105.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
