      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of carbendazim in treating patients who
      have advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of carbendazim in patients with advanced
      solid tumors or lymphoma. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of
      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these
      patients. IV. Determine the recommended phase II dose of this drug. V. Determine any
      antitumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral carbendazim 2-3
      times daily 5 days a week for 3-4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of carbendazim until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
