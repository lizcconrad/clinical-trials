  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if testosterone gel affects how the body handles
      insulin and glucose.

      Specific anti-HIV treatments may increase a patient's risk of certain diseases by causing
      metabolic problems such as reduced sensitivity to insulin. This substudy will examine how
      testosterone affects insulin sensitivity. If testosterone increases insulin sensitivity in
      the patients, then giving testosterone to HIV-infected patients may allow the continuation of
      anti-HIV treatments without increasing the patients' risk of disease. The test used to
      determine insulin sensitivity will be a modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose
      tolerance test (FSIVGTT), which can accurately measure insulin sensitivity.

      Assessment of insulin sensitivity is an important objective of this substudy. Extrapolation
      from earlier studies suggests that insulin resistance will be associated with low
      testosterone levels at baseline in HIV-infected men with visceral obesity and that
      physiologic testosterone replacement in these individuals is likely to increase insulin
      sensitivity. However, direct assessment of insulin sensitivity under carefully controlled
      conditions is crucial to understanding the full metabolic impact of physiologic testosterone
      replacement in the context of A5079. The FSIVGTT, using the Bergman minimal model, has become
      a widely used method for the assessment of insulin sensitivity in epidemiological and
      intervention studies. Based on these considerations, the modified FSIVGTT was chosen as the
      optimal modality to assess insulin sensitivity in A5112s.

      This study is a substudy of A5079. Patients enrolled in A5079 are eligible for this substudy
      but receive no study treatment other than that which they receive on A5079. Insulin
      sensitivity is measured by FSIVGTT performed at entry and at Weeks 24 and 48. In the modified
      FSIVGTT, 15 serial blood specimens for glucose are drawn over a 245-minute interval. The
      FSIVGTT assesses whether patients given testosterone supplements have more sensitivity to
      insulin than patients given a placebo.
