      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of cetuximab in treating patients who have
      stage IV colorectal cancer that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate of patients with irinotecan-refractory, stage IV
      colorectal cancer when treated with cetuximab. II. Determine the safety and toxic effects of
      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the time to progression of patients treated with
      this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours weekly for
      6 weeks. Treatment repeats in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months.
