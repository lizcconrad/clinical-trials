      RATIONALE: Celecoxib may be an effective treatment for early stage prostate cancer. It is not
      yet known if celecoxib is more effective than no treatment before surgery for prostate
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to determine the effectiveness of celecoxib given before
      surgery to remove the prostate in treating patients who have localized prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare biomarker modulation (prostaglandin levels) in tissue samples of patients with
           localized prostate cancer treated with neoadjuvant celecoxib vs placebo followed by
           prostatectomy.

        -  Compare the effect of these regimens on angiogenic factors within the prostate in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of celecoxib in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the compliance of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral neoadjuvant placebo twice daily. Treatment in both arms
           continues for at least 4 weeks followed by prostatectomy.

      Patients are followed within 1 month and then at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60-70 patients (at least 30 per arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
