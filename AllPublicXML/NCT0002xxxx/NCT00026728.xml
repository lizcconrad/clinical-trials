  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate patterns of Kaposi's sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) in the United
      States and its potential impact on the U.S. population. KSHV is a newly discovered virus that
      is strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. The high
      prevalence of KS and KSHV among HIV-infected homosexual men suggests sexual contact as a
      primary mode of transmission. Reports of non-sexual transmission in parts of Africa and the
      Mediterranean where Kaposi's sarcoma is endemic, and the identification of viral DNA in
      saliva and other bodily fluids, however, indicate the virus is also transmitted non-sexually.
      This study will:

        -  Compare the prevalence of KSHV among different demographic groups in the United States

        -  Examine the association between KSHV and high risk behaviors such as drug use (marijuana
           and cocaine), sexual behavior (age at first sexual intercourse and number of sexual
           partners), and medical risk factors (herpes simplex virus II, hepatitis B and hepatitis
           C)

        -  Estimate the prevalence of KSHV in the United States.

      Data and blood samples for the study will be taken from the NHANES III survey. NHANES is a
      program of periodic surveys conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
      National Center for Health Statistics. The survey is designed to provide national estimates
      of health status for the United States non-institutionalized civilian population by means of
      household interviews, standardized physical examinations, and blood sample collection and
      testing. NHANES III-the seventh in a series of national examination studies-was conducted
      from 1988 to 1994.

      This study will use the HANES data to identify risks associated with a KSHV-positive blood
      test in the survey population. The study plans to include all 19,754 participants (67% of the
      29,314 participants originally examined) for whom blood samples were collected and remain
      available.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is the viral cause of Kaposi sarcoma. Although infection
      with this virus appears to be uncommon in the United States, the prevalence in the general
      population in uncertain, and routes for transmission are poorly characterized. This study
      makes use of questionnaire data and serum specimens obtained in the third National Health and
      Nutrition Survey (NHAnes III). Sera from 18,168 individuals in this study were tested for
      antibodies to the KSHV proteins K8.1 and LANA. We will use these measurements to estimate
      KSHV seroprevalence for the overall U.S. general population and for demographic subgroups. To
      characterize potential transmission routes, we will also examine whether KSHV seroprevalence
      is related to sexual activity and exposures to blood, as indicated by responses to
      questionnaire items and previous NHANES III measurements of markers of relevant viral
      infections.
