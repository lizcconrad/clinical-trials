      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have stage
      IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may
      interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of non-small cell lung
      cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the one-years survival rate in both previously-untreated and previously-treated
      patients with advanced bronchioalveolar carcinoma receiving chronic oral ZD1839.

      II. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival in these groups of patients.

      III. To evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this treatment
      regimen.

      IV. To evaluate the response rate using both the standard RECIST criteria and by
      computer-assisted image analysis in patients with measurable disease.

      V. To measure EGFR and EGFR variant III overexpression in tumor tissue samples and explore
      their relationship with aforementioned clinical outcomes.

      VI. To measure EGFR expression and activation status in slides of buccal brushings submitted
      on S9925 before and after initiation of treatment with ZD1839 and explore their association
      with response and survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior systemic
      treatment for bronchioalveolar carcinoma (yes vs no). (The previously untreated stratum
      closed to accrual as of 2/15/2003.)

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a biopsy-proven, incompletely resected or unresectable
             bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, with pathology tissue available for central review and
             staining for EGFR and other molecular variables; fine needle aspirates, bronchial
             brushings or washings are not permitted for diagnosis; patients must have either
             selected stage IIIB due to cytology-confirmed malignant pleural effusion, or stage IV
             disease; tumors may be multi-focal or diffuse

          -  Patients must have evidence of disease by CT scan of the chest; the pre-study CT scan
             of the chest must include the liver and adrenal glands or be accompanied by an
             abdominal CT scan in which they are visualized; all x-rays/scans to assess measurable
             disease must have performed within 28 days prior to registration; all other required
             tests to assess non-measurable disease must have been performed within 42 days prior
             to registration

          -  The institution must plan to submit all pathology materials (i.e., H&amp;E stained slide
             from each block, plus 10 unstained slide from one block) within 30 days after
             registration

          -  All patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0-2

          -  Patients must not have received prior treatment with biologic therapies that target

               -  Prior biologic therapy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are allowed, provided that
                  at least four weeks have elapsed since last treatment with these modalities and
                  the patient's disease has been assessed since completing previous treatment;
                  disease must be present outside of areas of previous radiation therapy

               -  Prior surgery is allowed, provided that the patient has had sufficient recovery
                  time from surgery, as determined by the enrolling physician

          -  Patients must not have gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to
             take oral medication or a requirement for IV alimentation; patients must not have had

          -  SGOT or SGPT =&lt; 2.5 x the institutional upper limit of normal (IULN) (if liver
             metastases are present; SGOT/SGPT =&lt; 5 IULN allowed)

          -  Alkaline phosphatase =&lt; 2.5 x IULN (if bone metastases are present, alkaline
             phosphatase =&lt; 5 x IULN is allowed); abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase levels
             should be appropriately followed to document the possibility of bone or hepatic
             metastases

          -  ANC &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  WBC &gt;= 3,000/uL

          -  Institution must have receive IRB approval for S9925; patients must be offered
             participating in S9925 (the Lung Cancer Specimen Repository); optional submissions of
             buccal brushings for EGFR determination will be done via the Lung Cancer Specimen
             Repository; patients must be registered separately to S9925 to receive credit for
             buccal brushing submission

          -  Patient with known brain metastases are ineligible for this clinical trial; if there
             are any abnormal findings on neurological examination suspicious for brain metastases,
             a CT or MRI should be performed within 42 days prior to registration

          -  NOTE: a baseline slit lamp examination is NOT required; however, patients with eye
             symptoms (eye pain, tearing, redness, vision problems) should be evaluated by an
             ophthalmologist/optometrist prior to registration and the results documented on the
             S0126 Toxicity and Dosage Form

          -  Patient must not have corneal inflammation or infection

          -  Patients requiring agents that induce CYP3A4 are excluded from the study, due to the
             ability of these agents to significantly reduce plasma concentrations of ZD1839
             potentially below the range likely to be biologically active if taken concurrently
             with ZD1839 at the dose employed in the study; at the present time, agents known to
             induce CYP3A4 include the antibiotics nafcillin and rifampin, the anticonvulsants

             compliance with study requirements

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except to the following: adequately treated basal
             cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I
             or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any other
             cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for five years

             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
