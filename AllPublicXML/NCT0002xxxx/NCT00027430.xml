  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether testosterone replacement with TheraDerm can improve bone
      density, mood, sex drive, thinking, and distribution of body fat and muscle mass in women
      with hypopituitarism.

      Patients will be randomized into 2 groups to receive testosterone replacement therapy or
      placebo. Group 1 will receive 2 testosterone patches and estrogen pills for 12 months. Group
      2 will receive 2 placebo patches and estrogen pills for 12 months. Changes in bone density,
      bone metabolism markers, body composition, libido, and quality of life will be compared in
      the women receiving testosterone replacement therapy with that of the women receiving
      placebo.
