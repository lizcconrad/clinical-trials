      RATIONALE: Analyzing genes that are present in cancer cells may be useful in developing
      better methods to detect, predict, and treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study genes that are present in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Identify gene expression patterns in malignant T cells that can be used to diagnose
           cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the patterns of gene expression that distinguish normal skin-homing T cells
           from malignant T cells.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease (Sezary syndrome vs mycosis fungoides) and prior
      treatment (yes vs no).

      All patients receive a physical examination, and a medical history is taken. Patients with
      Sezary syndrome undergo leukapheresis. Patients with plaque/tumor stage mycosis fungoides
      undergo skin biopsy of involved skin. Malignant T cells from blood or skin are then isolated
      and patterns of gene expression in the malignant T cells are compared to those in normal
      skin-homing T cells from healthy donors using a &quot;gene chip&quot; (Lymphochip).

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per disease stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
