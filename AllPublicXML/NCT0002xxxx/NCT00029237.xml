  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether three short-term stress
      management interventions along with booster strategies will improve and sustain improvements
      in psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and somatic health among persons with varying
      stages of HIV disease. The 10-week group interventions are designed to reduce perceived
      stress and increase coping effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management
      focused on positively living (+LIVE), focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training, and spiritual growth
      groups (SPRT). Effects of the interventions will be evaluated immediately upon completion of
      the group training and at 6 months and 12 months following stress management training.

      The overall purpose of the proposed study is to determine whether three short-term stress
      management interventions along with booster strategies will improve and sustain improvements
      in the domains of psychosocial functioning, quality of life, and somatic health among persons
      with varying stages of HIV disease. These three outcome domains, along with neuroendocrine
      mediation, will be measured by multiple indicators derived from the psychoneuroimmunology
      (PNI)paradigm. The interventions are designed to reduce perceived stress and increase coping
      effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management focused on positively living
      (+LIVE), focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training, and spiritual growth groups (SPRT). The primary aim
      of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the +LIVE, TCHI, and SPRT interventions to
      each other and to standard care received by a control group of wait-listed participants
      (WAIT) for effects on psychosocial functioning (perceived stress, coping patterns, social
      support, psychological distress), quality of life (including spiritual well-being),
      neuroendocrine mediation (cortisol, DHEA levels), and somatic health (disease progression,
      HIV-specific health status, immune status).
