      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. Photosensitizing drugs such as HPPH are absorbed by tumor cells
      and, when exposed to light, become active and kill the tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in
      treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the systemic and normal tissue toxicity of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in
           patients with early stage or centrally obstructing non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HPPH.

      Patients receive HPPH IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients undergo laser light therapy via
      bronchoscopy on day 3.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of HPPH until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for at least 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-17 patients will be accrued for this study within 2
      years.
