      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining temozolomide and
      O6-benzylguanine in treating children who have solid tumors that have not responded to
      previous therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temozolomide administered with a biologically
           active dose of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) in children with refractory solid tumors.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and the toxicity profile of this combination in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of O6-BG and its active metabolite, 8-oxo-O6-BG, in
           these patients.

        -  Assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of this combination in these patients.

        -  Correlate levels of alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase in peripheral blood mononuclear
           cells with the degree of hematologic toxicity of this combination in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG) IV over 1 hour followed 30 minutes later by oral
      temozolomide daily for 5 days. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Sequential dose escalation of O6-BG is followed by sequential dose escalation of
      temozolomide. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of O6-BG and temozolomide
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to courses 1, 3, 6, 8, and 12.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years.
