      RATIONALE: Morphine that is inhaled may be more rapidly absorbed than morphine that is given
      by mouth. It is not yet known if inhaled morphine is more effective than morphine given by
      mouth in relieving breakthrough pain.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of inhaled morphine with that
      of morphine given by mouth in treating cancer patients who have breakthrough pain.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the change in pain intensity during the 15 minutes immediately
      following aerosolized vs oral morphine sulfate in cancer patients with opioid-sensitive
      breakthrough pain. II. Compare preference for continued use of these regimens in these
      patients. III. Compare the pain relief in patients treated with these regimens. IV. Evaluate
      satisfaction of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, crossover, multicenter study. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients undergo titration of aerosolized morphine
      sulfate over days 1-7 to determine the optimal baseline and breakthrough dosage. Arm I:
      Patients receive aerosolized morphine sulfate as needed for breakthrough pain, up to 4
      inhalations every 15 minutes, on days 8-14. Patients crossover to oral morphine sulfate as
      needed for breakthrough pain on days 15-21. Arm II: Patients receive oral morphine sulfate as
      needed for breakthrough pain on days 8-14. Patients crossover to aerosolized morphine sulfate
      as needed for breakthrough pain, up to 4 inhalations every 15 minutes, on days 15-21.
      Patients may continue treatment with either oral or aerosolized morphine sulfate for an
      additional 60 days beginning on day 22. Quality of life is assessed weekly for 3 weeks.
      Patients complete a pain management satisfaction survey at the end of each therapy crossover
      week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
