  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to do cross species comparisons of the metabolism and toxicity
      of a number of toxicants which require metabolism for toxicity. All of the toxicants in
      question are encountered by humans in the workplace, through lifestyle choices (cigarette
      smoking) and as a result of environmental contamination. The high incidence of pulmonary
      diseases in the human population means that it will be difficult if not impossible to
      determine whether humans are at risk from exposure to these chemicals without solid
      mechanistic data. Recent rodent bioassays suggest that these compounds have oncogenic
      potential further supporting the need to test the potential for injury in primates. As part
      of this testing, we intend to establish in vitro methods for assessing critical steps in the
      metabolism of these agents and their interaction with cellular macromolecules. Once this is
      done, similar studies can be conducted in Rhesus or in human lung tissue that is available
      because it cannot be used for transplant purposes.
