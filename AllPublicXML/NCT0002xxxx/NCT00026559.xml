  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has several parts. One part will examine the influence of factors such as
      personality and past experience on reactions to unpleasant stimuli. Others will examine the
      effect of personality and emotional and attentional states on learning and memory.

      When confronted with fearful or unpleasant events, people can develop fear of specific cues
      that were associated with these events as well as to the environmental context in which the
      events occurred via a process called classical conditioning. Classical conditioning has been
      used to model anxiety disorders, but the relationship between stress and anxiety and
      conditioned responses remains unclear. This study will examine the relationship between cued
      conditioning and context conditioning . This study will also explore the acquisition and
      retention of different types of motor, emotional, and cognitive associative processes during
      various tasks that range from mildly arousing to stressful.

      Objective: Fear and anxiety are adaptive responses to different types of threats. Fear is a
      short-duration response evoked by explicit threat cues. Fear can best be studied using
      Pavlovian fear conditioning. Studies 1 and 2 examine learning processes underlying fear
      conditioning as well as the influence of cognitive and affective processes on these learning
      processes. Anxiety is a more sustained state of apprehension evoked by unpredictable threat.
      Study 2 examines the interactions between anxiety induced experimentally and cognitive
      processes. Specifically, we seek to 1) characterize the effect of anxiety on key cognitive
      processes including working memory, attention control, conflict, and learning and memory. 2)
      examine the extent to which performance of cognitive tasks distract from anxiety, and 3) how
      physical exertion influences anxiety and its effects on cognition. Study 3 examines the
      effects of memory

      retrieval on extinction.

      Study population: This more-than-minimal-risk protocol will test medically and
      psychiatrically healthy volunteers aged 18-50. Pregnant or nursing women will be excluded.

      Method: Fear and anxiety will be measured using the startle reflex to brief and loud sounds.
      Fear conditioning will be assessed using shock as unconditioned stimulus. Cognitive
      performance will be examined during periods of unpredictable shock anticipation or prior to
      giving a speech.

      Outcome measures: The study will include cognitive performance and measure of aversive
      states, primarily the startle reflex.
