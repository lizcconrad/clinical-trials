      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining
      vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus
      interleukin-2 to that of vaccine therapy alone in treating patients who have metastatic
      melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the clinical responses in patients with HLA-A0201-positive refractory
           metastatic melanoma treated with tyrosinase-related protein-2:180-188 peptide vaccine
           alone.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate of patients who have an immediate need to receive
           interleukin-2 (IL-2) in addition to this vaccine.

        -  Compare the immunologic response, in terms of changes in T-cell precursors before and
           after treatment, in patients treated with this vaccine with or without IL-2.

        -  Compare the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label study.

      Patients who need immediate interleukin-2 (IL-2) receive tyrosinase-related protein-2
      (TRP-2):180-188 peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51 on day 1 and high-dose IL-2
      IV over 15 minutes once every 8 hours on days 2-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to
      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who do not need immediate IL-2 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51
           subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51
           SC once weekly on weeks 1-4. Treatment repeats every 7 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who have a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course after achieving CR.
      Patients who have progressive disease while receiving vaccine alone may cross over to receive
      peptide vaccine with IL-2 for at least 2 courses.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 83 patients (19-33 who need immediate interleukin-2 (IL-2);
      15-25 per treatment arm who do not need immediate IL-2) will be accrued for this study within
      1 year.
