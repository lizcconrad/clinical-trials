      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as BCG use different ways to stimulate the immune system
      and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop
      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with biological
      therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if BCG is more effective with or
      without mitomycin.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of BCG plus mitomycin with
      that of BCG alone in treating patients who have bladder cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the complete response rate of patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder
           treated with adjuvant intravesical BCG with or without intravesical mitomycin following
           transurethral resection.

        -  Compare the disease-free interval and type of recurrence after complete response in
           patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one
      of two treatment arms.

      Arm I:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive intravesical mitomycin over 1 hour once weekly on
           weeks 1-6 and intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 7-12. Patients with visible lesions
           or disease recurrence or progression undergo transurethral resection (TUR) during weeks
           16-18 and receive one additional course of intravesical therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy:Patients with a complete response after either course of induction
           therapy proceed to maintenance therapy comprising intravesical mitomycin once on week 1
           and intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 2 and 3. Maintenance therapy repeats every 6
           months through year 3.

      Arm II:

        -  Induction therapy:Patients receive intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks 1-6 and 10-12.
           Patients with visible lesions or disease recurrence or progression undergo transurethral
           resection (TUR) during weeks 16-18 and receive one additional course of intravesical
           therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients with a complete response after either course of induction
           therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising intravesical BCG once weekly on weeks
           1-3. Maintenance therapy repeats every 6 months through year 3.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84-126 patients (42-63 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 3.5 years.
