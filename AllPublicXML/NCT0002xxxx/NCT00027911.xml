      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.
      Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in
      bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may be effective
      in treating soft tissue sarcoma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with
      sargramostim in treating patients who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV soft tissue
      sarcoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) in patients with stage II, III, or IV soft tissue sarcoma expressing NY-ESO-1
           or LAGE antigen.

        -  Determine the immunologic profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine tumor responses in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine intradermally once every 2 weeks for a
      total of 6 vaccinations. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once
      daily beginning 2 days before every vaccination and continuing for 5 days. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
