      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune
      cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by donor
      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or unresectable
      kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the overall response rate and overall and disease-free survival of patients
           with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with fludarabine and
           cyclophosphamide followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the toxicity and treatment-related mortality of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of donor chimerism in patients treated with this regimen.

    <description>Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -7 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2 hours on days -4 and -3. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.
Patients receive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising oral tacrolimus twice daily on days -1 to 90 and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and 6.
After day 120, patients with persistent disease and no signs of active GVHD may receive donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI may be repeated every 8 weeks for a total of 2 infusions.
Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years OR every 2 months for 6 months and then every 6 months for 4.5 years if patient receives DLI.</description>
