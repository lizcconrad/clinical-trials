      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have advanced colorectal cancer that has not responded to irinotecan.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin in
           patients with irinotecan-refractory advanced colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerance of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine any antitumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective response rate, response duration, and time to progression in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin IV over 30 minutes once weekly on
      weeks 1-52 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with
      responding disease may continue therapy.

      Cohort of 4-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody anti-anb3 integrin
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 4 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD
      is determined, additional patients are treated at that dose in the phase II portion of the
      study.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study and a
      total of 40 patients will be accrued for phase II of this study.
