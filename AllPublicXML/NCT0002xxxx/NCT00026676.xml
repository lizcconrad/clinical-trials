  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that patients receiving state-of-the-art treatment for HIV
      infection (highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART) show discordant responses to
      therapy-that is, they improve both clinically and immunologically (increased CD4 immune cell
      counts), but their levels of HIV in the blood do not drop. This study will examine blood
      samples taken from HIV-infected children treated with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (didanosine, or
      ddI) in an earlier NCI study to determine if these patients had similar discordant responses
      to therapy. If so, the study will also examine how these factors may be predictive of disease
      progression and survival.

      Investigators will measure HIV levels in blood specimens from children previously enrolled in
      NCI protocol 88-C-0129. The measurements will be done in specimens drawn before initiation of
      treatment with ddI and at various times during the course of treatment. The viral responses
      to therapy will then be correlated with short- and long-term clinical and immunologic
      outcomes.

      In addition, researchers will examine these patients' blood samples for additional factors
      recently discovered to potentially influence disease progression. They include selenium
      levels and certain genetic factors.

      A better understanding of discordant responses to therapy will help physicians determine the
      best treatment option in situations where therapy results do not show uniform benefit.

      This protocol involves the scientific examination of laboratory specimens only and is not a
      clinical study open to patient enrollment.

      This study will examine clinical and immunologic data and HIV-1 RNA levels in banked serum
      specimens from HIV-infected pediatric patients previously enrolled on NCI protocol 88-C-0219,
      a phase I/II study of 2', 3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI). In the original study serum p24 antigen
      was used as the direct measurement of viral quantitation. Advances in understanding of HIV
      pathophysiology have demonstrated that HIV-1 RNA level as measured by quantitative RNA PCR is
      a far superior molecular tool for assessing viral replication and burden in vivo. Analysis of
      clinical, HIV-1 RNA and CD4 responses will be performed to identify patients with discordant
      surrogate marker responses to therapy, defined as: improvement in immunologic parameters in
      the setting of virologic non-response or failure. Correlation will then be made with short
      and long term clinical outcomes.

      Following the initial analysis to identify patients with discordant responses, selenium
      levels, viral genotypic and phenotypic profiles of resistance to ddI, and in vitro viral
      fitness will be examined. These biologic parameters have recently been determined to
      potentially play an important role in clinical, immunologic and virologic HIV-related
      outcomes. Parameters will be examined in subsets of patients with the following surrogate
      marker response profiles: a.) immunologic and virologic responders; b.) immunologic and
      virologic non-responders; and c.) discordant immunologic and virologic responders. Specimens
      from the ddI monotherapy study were chosen for this analysis because a substantial body of
      clinical and immunologic data is available on patients up to 7 years.
