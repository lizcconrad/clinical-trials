      RATIONALE: Pirfenidone may prevent or lessen fibrosis caused by radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Pilot trial to study the effectiveness of pirfenidone in preventing or lessening
      fibrosis in patients who have undergone radiation therapy for cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and therapeutic efficacy of pirfenidone in cancer patients with
           radiation-induced fibrosis.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral pirfenidone 3 times daily. Treatment continues for up to 2
      years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Principal functional abilities are assessed at baseline, every 3 months, and at termination
      of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
