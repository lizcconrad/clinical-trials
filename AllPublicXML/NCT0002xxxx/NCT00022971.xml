      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two antibodies,
      apolizumab and rituximab (Rituxan ), in treating B-cell lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia. Rituximab attaches to a molecule called CD20 on B-cell lymphomas and can cause
      significant shrinkage of these tumors in up to half of patients. However, it does not cure
      the lymphoma, which usually returns. Also, it is not as effective against leukemia.
      Apolizumab attaches to a protein called 1D10 on B-cell cancers and has also been able to
      shrink tumors in some patients. There is little experience apolizumab in patients with
      leukemia. This study will test whether the two antibodies together are more effective against
      these tumors than either one alone.

      Patients 18 years and older with B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be
      eligible for this study. Patients' leukemia or lymphoma cells must have both the CD20 and
      1D10 antigen receptors and must have had at least one systemic treatment for their disease.
      Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical examination, blood and urine
      tests, electrocardiogram, x-rays and other imaging studies, and possibly a bone marrow
      aspirate (withdrawal of a small marrow sample through a needle inserted into the hip bone)
      and lumbar puncture (withdrawal of a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid-fluid that bathes
      the brain and spinal cord-through a needle placed between the bones in the lower back).

      Participants receive infusions of rituximab and apolizumab once a week for 4 weeks. The first
      patients in the study receive lower doses of apolizumab with standard doses of rituximab. If
      the apolizumab is well tolerated, subsequent patients are given higher doses. Patients are
      also given dexamethasone or another similar steroid, diphenhydramine (Benadryl ), and
      acetominophen (Tylenol ) to reduce reactions to the antibodies. After 4 weeks of treatment,
      patients are followed frequently to examine the response to treatment and evaluate drug side
      effects. Patients whose tumors do not grow during the 4 weeks of therapy may be offered
      another course of treatment at a later time. Participants are followed periodically after
      treatment ends until their disease worsens or the study ends.

    <textblock>
      While recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are often
      responsive to therapy, they are rarely curable and disease control is the primary therapeutic
      goal. Rituximab, a chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown single agent activity in
      these diseases and is currently approved for the therapy of recurrent indolent lymphoma.
      However, rituximab induces objective remission in at most 60% of cases with inevitable
      relapse. The 1D10 antigen, a subclass of the HLA-DR molecule, is expressed in a majority of
      cases of B-cell malignancy. Apolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets this
      antigen. In a phase I dose escalation trial this antibody has shown clinical activity against
      B-cell NHL that express the 1D10 antigen. Acute infusional toxicity has been tolerable, and a
      maximum of 5 mg/kg has been given in each of 4 weekly doses. Preclinical in vitro data from
      Dr. George Weiner's laboratory suggests at least additive anti-tumor efficacy when cells are
      exposed to both antibodies simultaneously. This trial will pilot the use of combination
      therapy with rituximab and apolizumab in patients with tumors that express both antigens.
      Feasibility and tolerability of the regimen will be determined. Experimental endpoints will
      include pharmacokinetics of apolizumab, assessment of apoptosis in circulating CLL cells by
      FACS analysis with Annexin 5, assessment of T-and B-cell dynamics, and effects of rituximab
      and apolizumab on CLL mRNA as measured by cDNA microarray. Following the first 21 patients on
      trial, the administration sequence of rituximab and apolizumab was changed from rituximab
      first to apolizumab first to potentially reduce sensitization of apolizumab toxicity by
      rituximab.
