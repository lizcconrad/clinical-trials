      RATIONALE: Donor peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells
      that were destroyed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Sometimes the transplanted cells
      are rejected by the body's normal tissues. Treatment with donor white blood cells may prevent
      this from happening.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of donor peripheral stem cell
      transplantation followed by infusions of donor white blood cells in treating patients who
      have AIDS-related lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma treated with
           allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation followed by delayed donor
           leukocyte infusion.

        -  Determine the complication rate of these patients treated with PBSC transplantation.

        -  Determine the immune dysfunction and recovery of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 to -3. Patients who have not
      received prior mediastinal radiotherapy receive thymic radiotherapy on day -1. Allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients also receive anti-thymocyte
      globulin IV over 10-12 hours on days -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclosporine IV beginning on day -1,
      switching to oral when possible, and tapering until day 35.

      In the absence of active acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and at least 2 weeks after
      completion of cyclosporine, patients receive an infusion of donor leukocytes on or before day
      49. Patients may receive a second donor leukocyte infusion if there is evidence of persistent
      malignancy and no GVHD.

      Patients are followed through day 100, on days 120, 180, 270, and 365, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
