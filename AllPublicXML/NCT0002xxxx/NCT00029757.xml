      Background: The use of estrogen in postmenopausal (or surgically menopausal) women is a
      common practice. Compliance is problematic in that estimates show only 1/3 of women use
      hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and only 30% are compliant. Estrogen has many documented
      benefits including symptomatic relief of hot flashes, improvement of the dry vagina and
      dyspareunia. Estrogen has been found to improve bone mineral density and increase the high-
      density lipoprotein portion of a cholesterol panel. To improve compliance and to provide an
      alternate method of delivery, we propose the use of estrogen which is admixed in toothpaste
      and propose to study the absorption, rate of build-up and rate of decline.

      Hypothesis: Estrogen can potentially be absorbed systemically when toothpaste is admixed with
      estradiol and is applied in a timed, consistent fashion to postmenopausal or surgically
      postmenopausal women, not on HRT. Absorption takes place across the buccal mucosa.

      Specific Aims:1) To estimate the systemic absorption of estrogen from daily use of estrogen
      containing toothpaste.

      2) To estimate the rate of build-up of serum estrogen levels based upon daily use of
      toothpaste containing estrogen for eight days.

      3) To estimate the rate of decline in serum estrogen levels when the use of estrogen
      containing toothpaste is discontinued for a week.

      Methods: Fifteen women ages 35-75 who are menopausal or surgically menopausal will be
      identified, with exclusion based on estrogen contraindications. Subjects will have blood
      samples taken before, during and after an eight-day course of once-daily toothpaste that is
      admixed with 0.5 mg estradiol. Toothpaste shall meet strict quality control standards and
      instructions for uniform tooth brushing shall be provided. Serum estradiol will be determined
      from the samples obtained. Statistical analysis shall address absorption by comparing
      baseline estradiol measurements with those a few hours after use. The rate of build-up will
      be assessed by comparing the post-use levels of estradiol at the start of a week and at the
      end of the week. After a week off the estrogen, the rate of decline in serum estradiol will
      be calculated.
