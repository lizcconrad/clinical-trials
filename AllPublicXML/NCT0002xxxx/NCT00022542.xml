    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have
      advanced soft tissue sarcoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor
      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the confirmed response rate of patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma
      treated with BMS-247550.

      II. Determine the overall survival and progression-free survival of patients treated with
      this drug.

      III. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response
      receive 2 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma with evidence of
             metastatic or unresectable disease

          -  Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in
             at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt;= 2.0 cm with
             conventional techniques

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 12 weeks

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Prior chemotherapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma (neoadjuvant or adjuvant
                  chemotherapy allowed)

               -  Prior nitrosoureas or mitomycin C less than or equal to 6 weeks prior to study
                  entry

               -  Prior other neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy less than or equal to 4 weeks
                  prior to study entry

               -  Prior radiotherapy less than or equal to 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Failure to recover from adverse effects of prior therapy regardless of time frame
                  since receiving the therapy

               -  Concurrent other investigational therapy, unconventional therapies, or food
                  supplements

          -  Uncontrolled brain metastases; (Note: these patients are excluded because of the poor
             prognosis and because the propensity for progressive neurologic dysfunction that would
             confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events); however, if brain
             metastases are treated and controlled for &gt; 8 weeks, they would be eligible for this
             study

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Epothilone B analog, BMS-247550 or polyoxyethylated castor oil

          -  Known HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy; Note:
             patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy and because of possible pharmacokinetic
             interactions with Epothilone B analog, BMS-247550; appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy when indicated

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Prior malignancy, except for adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin
             cancer, adequately treated noninvasive carcinomas, treated localized prostate cancer,
             or other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for at least 5 years
