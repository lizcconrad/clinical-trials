  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The congenital absence of teeth, commonly referred to as hypodontia or tooth agenesis, is a
      common developmental anomaly of human dentition that affects approximately 20% of the
      population. Although new genetic and molecular approaches in humans and mice have increased
      our understanding of the molecules that control tooth patterning (number, position, shape and
      size), the precise nature of the genes involved in hypodontia in humans is poorly understood.
      Hence, understanding the molecular basis for missing teeth is an issue of paramount
      importance that is both timely and significant to the practice of dentistry. So far, only two
      genes have been associated with non-syndromic familial tooth agenesis: MSX1 and PAX9.
      Substitution mutations in the homeodomain region of MSX1 were linked to premolar agenesis
      while an insertion mutation in the paired box domain of PAX9 was shown to be responsible for
      molar oligodontia.

      The long-term goals of this research are to elucidate the molecular pathology of human tooth
      agenesis, in particular, to evaluate whether genes other than MSX1 and PAX9 (locus
      heterogeneity) are involved. Alternatively, as in the case of MSX1, it will be interesting to
      know whether allelic variations, different mutations in these genes, are associated with
      tooth agenesis. We propose to study a potentially large kindred that report the developmental
      absence of several posterior teeth. The fundamental hypothesis to be tested states that the
      gene responsible for the congenital absence of molar teeth in this kindred is a critical
      element in the genesis of molars. The specific goals are to perform linkage analysis followed
      by direct sequencing of PCR products to identify the gene and to characterize the nature of
      the underlying defect. Identifying the underlying gene defect in this family affected by
      tooth agenesis will add new knowledge to our understanding of the pathogenesis of this defect
      and will provide the basis for future studies.
