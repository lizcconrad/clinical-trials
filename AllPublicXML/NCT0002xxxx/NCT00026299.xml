      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the
      growth of the tumor cells and slow the growth of colorectal cancer. Combining chemotherapy
      with gefitinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or without
      gefitinib in treating patients who have metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of gefitinib when administered in combination
           with oxaliplatin in patients with metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal cancer.

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to progression, objective response rate, and median and overall
           survival in patients treated with oxaliplatin with or without gefitinib.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of gefitinib followed by a phase II
      randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance status
      (0 vs 1-2).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and oral gefitinib once
           daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive oxaliplatin as in arm I and oral gefitinib once daily at
                the MTD on days 1-21.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in arm II with stable or responding disease
      after 6 courses may continue to receive gefitinib alone until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 77 patients (9 for phase I and 68 for phase II) will be
      accrued for this study within 12-14 months.

Subjects can continue to receive the combination for 6 cycles (each cycle is 21 days). After 6 cycles of the combination, subjects can continue to take ZD1839 alone until their cancer worsens.</description>
