  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether tactile (touch) abilities at the lip are more acute in people
      with upper limb amputation compared with healthy normal volunteers. People with an amputated
      upper limb have an expanded brain representation of the lip that may correlate with
      heightened tactile spatial acuity.

      Normal volunteers will be recruited for this study. Candidates will be screened with physical
      and neurological examinations. (Amputee volunteers will be studied at the amputee clinic at
      the University of Tubingen, Germany.)

      Participants will sit comfortably in a chair, wearing a blindfold, during the following
      experiments:

        -  Plastic domes with grooves are placed on parts of the lower lip on either side for a few
           seconds. The volunteer is then asked to identify the direction of the grooves relative
           to the long axis of the lip.

        -  The participant's arm is placed in a cast and the index finger is immobilized. The same
           test done on the lip is repeated on the distal part of the index finger.

      Each part of the test lasts about 20 minutes, and the entire experiment takes about 2 hours.

    <textblock>
      Upper limb amputation leads to expansion of the cortical representation of the lip into the
      adjacent deafferented hand representation. It is conceivable that this enlargement of the lip
      representation may translate into a behavioral gain. The purpose of this protocol is to test
      the hypothesis that upper limb amputation in humans results in higher tactile spatial acuity
      at the lip. This would represent the first demonstration of chronic deafferentation-induced
      behavioral gains within the somatosensory system.
