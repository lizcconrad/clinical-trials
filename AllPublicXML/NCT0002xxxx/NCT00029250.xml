      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness and tolerability of garlic pills in
      lowering cholesterol and triglycerides in hyperlipidemic HIV-infected individuals who are
      being treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

      Clinical evaluation of garlic in HIV disease is warranted for several reasons. First, garlic
      is used as a botanical medicine and as an alternative therapy by many HIV-infected
      individuals. Baseline data from the Bastyr's Alternative Medicine Care Outcomes in AIDS
      (AMCOA) study [1] indicate that garlic is the most frequently used botanical medicine among
      HIV-infected men and women (52.9%) who utilize complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).
      In the same cohort, 50% of the subjects who use antiretroviral therapy are also taking garlic
      supplements. Second, there is a growing body of studies that indicate that garlic exhibits
      lipid and glucose lowering as well as hepato-protective activities. Third, several of the
      pharmacological activities of garlic and their reported clinical benefits in other
      conditions, especially in hyperlipidemia, may be relevant in the management of highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected subjects.

      Study Medication: We will utilize GarlicinTM, an allicin-standardized dried garlic supplement
      in two escalating doses in HIV-infected subjects who are receiving HAART.
