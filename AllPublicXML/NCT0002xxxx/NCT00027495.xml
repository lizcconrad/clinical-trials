      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. Curcumin may be effective in preventing the development of colon
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the dose amount of curcumin that can be tolerated to help
      in preventing colon cancer in healthy men and women.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of curcumin as a chemopreventive agent of
           colon cancer in healthy subjects.

        -  Determine if tolerable doses of this agent in uniformly milled formulation capsules are
           bioavailable in these subjects.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this agent and two metabolites at the MTD and next
           lower escalated dose in these subjects.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study followed by a pharmacokinetic study.

      Patients receive a single oral dose of curcumin followed by a standard fatty meal.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of curcumin until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to receive
      curcumin in the pharmacokinetic phase of the study.

      Patients are followed at 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for the dose escalation phase and
      then 12 additional patients will be accrued for the pharmacokinetic phase of this study
      within 3 months.
