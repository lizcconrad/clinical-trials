      The purpose of this study is to examine how certain brain chemicals work in patients with
      Panic Disorder (PD) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with and without major
      depressive disorder (MDD).

      Brain chemicals that regulate emotion, anxiety, sleep, stress hormones, and other body
      functions bind to serotonin (5-HT1A) and benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors. Evidence suggests
      that 5-HT1A and BZD receptor function is abnormal in patients with PD, PTSD, and depression.
      This study will use positron emission tomography (PET) scans to examine BZD and 5-HT1A
      receptor binding potential in patients with PD and patients with PTSD with and without
      co-morbid MDD, as well as in healthy volunteers. This study will also determine the effects
      of the stress hormone cortisol on 5-HT1A and BZD receptors.

      The current emotional state and psychiatric, medical, and family history of potential
      participants will be evaluated during an initial telephone interview. After entering the
      study, participants will be asked questions about general mood, degree of nervousness, and
      behavior. A physical examination, an electrocardiogram (EKG), and tests of intelligence and
      cognition will be given. Urine, blood, and saliva samples will be taken. Women will be given
      pregnancy tests and tests to determine menstrual phase and time of ovulation. All volunteers
      will undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET scans of the brain.

      Evidence suggests that serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor, serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and
      benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor function is abnormal in panic disorder (PD), postraumatic
      stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (MDD). The hypotheses for the role of 5-HT1A receptors
      have been obtained by assessing behavioral, neuroendocrine and temperature responses to the
      selective partial 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone in anxiety disorders subjects and healthy
      controls, and examining effects on 5-HT1A receptor function in rats following antidepressant
      drug (AD) administration. 5-HT1A receptors knockout mice show behaviors that have been used
      as a model for anxiety disorders in humans. Moreover, 5-HT1A receptor agonists have been
      shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. The serotonin
      transporter is implicated in these disorders by virtue of the efficacy of selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors in relieving symptoms in these subjects. Evidence arguing for a role of
      BZD/GABA receptor dysfunction in anxiety disorders comes from studies showing anxiolytic and
      anxiogenic properties of BZD agonists and antagonists, respectively. BZD receptor sensitivity
      has been shown to be reduced in patients with anxiety disorders. Brain imaging studies using
      positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)
      suggest decreased BZD receptor binding in PD and PTSD.

      Animal studies link together serotonin and GABA suggesting a pathological pathway originating
      from 5-HT1A receptor deficit leading towards dysfunctions within GABAergic systems, resulting
      in increased levels of anxiety. Yet, association between disturbed interactions between
      5-HT1A receptor binding and alterations in BZD receptor binding has not been explored in
      humans. The proposed study will advance knowledge regarding the neurobiology of PD and PTSD
      by employing PET and [11C]flumazenil, [18F]FC-WAY100635([18F]FCWAY) and [11C]DASB to compare
      BZD receptor, 5-HT1A receptors and the serotonin transporter binding potential, respectively,
      between PD, PTSD and MDD patients and healthy controls. Because central 5-HT1A receptor
      density is down-regulated in rodents by corticosterone administration and by stress-mediated
      corticosterone secretion, assessments of HPA-axis activity will be assessed to determine
      whether down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptors correlates with cortisol hypersecretion in PD,
      PTSD and MDD.

      The following hypotheses will be tested: 1) PD/PTSD/MDD patients have reduced GABA(A)-BZD
      receptor binding relative to healthy controls. 2) PD/PTSD/MDD patients have reduced 5-HT1A
      receptor binding potential relative to healthy controls. 3) 5-HT1A receptor binding will be
      more prominently reduced in PD and PTSD patients with comorbid MDD relative to anxiety
      disorders patients without comorbid MDD and healthy controls. 4) There will be a positive
      correlation between the reduction in 5-HT1A receptor binding and BZD binding in PD/PTSD/MDD
      patients. 5) There will be an inverse correlation between reduction in 5-HT1A receptor
      binding and BZD binding in PD/PTSD/MDD patients and cortisol secretion. 6) Serotonin
      transporter binding, measured using [11C]DASB, will be reduced in PD subjects relative to
      healthy controls.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        ANXIETY DISORDERS SAMPLES:

        Eighty four subjects (ages 18-50) with anxiety disorders (PD and PTSD) will be selected who
        additionally meet criteria for one of 4 subgroups:

        A) PD, Currently Depressed (n=27):

        As defined by DSM-IV criteria for PD, and still symptomatic as defined by at least 1 panic
        attack/week or a CGI score of at least 4, and current HDRS score in the
        mild-moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than 15).

        Patients are requested to meet the DSM-IV criteria for a single or recurrent episode of
        major depressive disorder.

        In case of comorbid depression it will be ensured that PD had an earlier onset than the
        depressive disorder.

        B) PD, Currently Not Depressed (n=27):

        Defined as having symptomatic PD with at least 1 panic attack/week or a CGI score of at
        least 4 and never having had experienced a depressive episode meeting DSM-IV criteria for
        major depressive disorder or dysthymia, OR a period of at least six months with no more
        than one clinically significant symptom, and during which time subjects were not taking an
        AD agent, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 25 item) scores in the non-depressed
        range (less than or equal to 7) will be selected.

        C) PTSD, Currently Depressed (n=15):

        As defined by DSM-IV with a duration of illness at least three months.

        Patients must score greater than or equal to 50 on Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
        (CAPS-2) as a measure of PTSD symptom severity.

        Patients are requested to meet the DSM-IV criteria for a single or recurrent episode of
        major depressive disorder.

        Current HDRS score is in the mild-moderately-to-severely depressed range (greater than or
        equal to 15).

        In case of comorbid depression it will be ensured that PTSD had an earlier onset than the
        depressive disorder.

        D) PTSD, Currently Not Depressed (n=15):

        Defined as having PTSD and never having had experienced a depressive episode meeting DSM-IV
        criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia OR a period of at least six months with
        no more than one clinically significant symptom, and during which time subjects were not
        taking an AD agent, with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; 25 item) scores in the
        non-depressed range (less than or equal to 7) will be selected.

        HEALTHY CONTROL SAMPLE:

        One hundred sixteen subjects (ages 18-50) who have not met criteria for any major
        psychiatric disorder.

        The control subjects will have no known first-degree relatives with PD or PTSD.

        PSYCHIATRIC CONTROL SAMPLE (n=30):

        Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), currently remitted, as defined by a period
        of at least three months during which the subject has not taken an antidepressant agent,
        with Hamilton Depression Rating Scales (HDRS; 21-item) scores in the non-depressed range
        (less than 8), and with no more than one clinically significant depressive symptom.

        These subjects must not have a history of PTSD and/or serious trauma.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects will be recruited who are drug-naive or who are not currently receiving
        psychotropic drugs for at least 3 weeks (8 weeks for fluoxetine). In case a patient is on
        psychotropic medications and this treatment is not successful (as defined by meeting the
        inclusion criteria as noted above), the medication will be tapered off to ensure that the
        subject is drug-free for at least 3 weeks prior to PET scanning.

        Subjects will be also be excluded if they have: a) serious suicidal ideation or behavior,
        b) psychosis to the extent that the ability to provide informed consent is in doubt, c)
        medical or neurological illnesses likely to affect physiology or anatomy, d) a history of
        drug (including BZDs) or alcohol abuse within 1 year or a lifetime history of alcohol or
        drug dependence (DSM IV criteria), e) current pregnancy (as documented by pregnancy testing
        prior to scanning), f) current breast feeding, g) general MRI exclusion criteria, h)
        patients who are currently taking fluoxetine.

        Patients and controls must exhibit no or only moderate alcohol use.

        Subjects with current or previous regular (greater than 4 weeks) of BZDs and excessive use
        of alcohol (greater than 8 ounce/day for men and greater than six ounces /day for women) in
        the past or present are ineligible to participate, as they may produce a down-regulation of
        the BZD receptor that may confound the results.

        Postmenopausal female subjects.

        Subjects beyond age 50 are excluded to reduce the biological heterogeneity encompassed by
        the MDD and anxiety disorders criteria.

        Subjects whose first anxiety disorder episode arose temporally after other major medical or
        psychiatric conditions will also be excluded.

        In addition to the above criteria, subjects undergoing the serotonin transporter scan will
        also be excluded if they have taken the recreational drug ecstasy within 3 weeks prior to
        scan or for regular use in the past.
