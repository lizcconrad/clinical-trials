  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -Research in NCI's Radiation Oncology Branch depends on the availability of blood and urine
      samples from patients receiving radiation therapy.

      Objectives:

      -To explore the effects of radiation therapy on gene expression in white blood cells, to
      measure radiation damage in red blood cells and to examine changes in hormone levels in the
      blood and urine after radiation therapy.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients 18 years of age and older who are receiving radiation therapy.

      Design:

        -  Blood and urine samples are collected when participants enter the study.

        -  Additional samples may be collected at different times during and after treatment.
           Ideally, samples are obtained before, at the completion of, and 1 month following
           radiation therapy. Blood samples usually will be collected during routine patient
           monitoring procedures and will not require an additional needle stick.

        -  A total of 300 patients will be studied at the NCI in Bethesda, MD, Johns Hopkins
           University in Baltimore and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

      BACKGROUND:

      Evolving research initiatives in the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) NCI, depend upon the
      availability of blood and urine samples from patients receiving radiotherapy.

      Examples of planned studies include an exploration of the effects of radiotherapy on
      peripheral leukocyte phenotype, peripheral blood protein and metabolism changes as well as
      measurements of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) in urine.

      OBJECTIVES:

      This protocol provides a means of acquiring blood and urine samples in patients receiving
      radiation therapy for a variety of conditions.

      ELIGIBILITY:

      Patients seen in the radiation oncology clinic will be asked to donate blood and/or urine
      before, during and after their treatment.

      DESIGN:

      This is a pilot, exploratory study to evaluate the effects of ionizing radiation in blood
      and/ or urine.

      On most occasions, the blood samples will be obtained as a component of routine patient
      monitoring and will not necessitate an additional venipuncture.

      Blood and urine samples will be processed and stored in the Radiation Oncology Branch and
      Basic Research Laboratory, CCR, NCI, for use in the research efforts of the branch.
