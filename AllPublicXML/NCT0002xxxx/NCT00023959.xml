  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill
      them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in
      different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy
      with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be an effective treatment for head and neck
      cancer. This phase I trial is to see if combining bevacizumab, fluorouracil, and hydroxyurea
      with radiation therapy works in treating patients who have advanced head and neck cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of bevacizumab when given
      in combination with fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and radiotherapy in patients with advanced
      head and neck cancer.

      II. Determine the time to progression, pattern of failure, local control, and distant failure
      rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the local toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bevacizumab.

      Patients receive oral hydroxyurea every 12 hours on days 1-6, fluorouracil IV continuously on
      days 1-5, and bevacizumab IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Patients also undergo radiotherapy
      once daily on days 1-5. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 6-12.
      Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bevacizumab until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at
      the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 5.4-19.5
      months.
