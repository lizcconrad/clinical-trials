      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of DHA-paclitaxel in treating patients who
      have locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable kidney cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the tumor response rate, duration of response, and time to disease
      progression in patients with locally advanced, metastatic, or unresectable renal cell cancer
      treated with DHA-paclitaxel. II. Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this
      drug. III. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the
      quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and at completion of
      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study.
