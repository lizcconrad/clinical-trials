    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of R(+)XK469 in treating
      patients with advanced neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to
      stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose, recommended phase II dose, and dose-limiting
      toxicity of R(+)XK469 in two different dosing schedules in patients with advanced
      neuroblastoma.

      II. Determine the safety of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the tolerance to this
      drug in these patients. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug
      and its metabolites in these patients.

      V. Determine, preliminarily, any antineoplastic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      SCHEDULE A: Patients receive R(+)XK469 intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and
      5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of R(+)XK469 until the recommended
      phase II dose or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients are accrued and treated at the recommended phase II dose (for
      a maximum of 20 patients treated at that dose).

      SCHEDULE B: Once the recommended phase II dose is determined on schedule A, additional
      patients are accrued and receive escalating doses of R(+)XK469 IV over 30-60 minutes on day
      1, beginning at a reduced dose. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose escalation continues as in Schedule A.

    <measure>Maximum tolerated dose of XK469 in pediatric patients with advanced neuroblastoma</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the highest dose studied for which the incidence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was less than 33%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>DLT</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the occurrence of any of the following: 1) grade 3 or higher nonhematologic toxicity except fatigue, alopecia, nausea, vomiting, 2) grade 4 thrombocytopenia or anemia, 3) any fever accompanied by granulocyte count &lt; 1000/mm^3 (grade 3 or 4 neutropenia), 4) failure to recover absolute neutrophil count 1500/μL</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Recommended phase II dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 29 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Generally defined as the MTD. For both schedules A and B and the pediatric dosing schedule, once the recommended phase II dose has been tentatively defined, a total of 12 evaluable patients will be studied to ensure the feasibility of this dose for phase II trials. If interindividual pharmacokinetic variability is high, additional patients will be enrolled (maximum of 20 at the phase II dose) to permit adequate pharmacological characterization of XK469 and the relationship of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability to toxicity.</description>

    <measure>Metabolism of XK469 in pediatric patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-3 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>Performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Plasma metabolic ratios between metabolite and XK469 concentrations will be used as an index of metabolic activity and phenotype for each patient. The modality of the frequency distribution of metabolic ratios will be also described.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics of XK469 in pediatric patients</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 1-3 of course 1</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum number of samples for pharmacokinetic studies will not exceed 20. Analyzed by non compartmental method using the WinNonlin software. Parameters include the elimination rate constant, the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC), terminal half-life, total (nonrenal + renal) clearance, and volume of distribution at steady state. Mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation will be determined for each parameter.</description>

    <time_frame>Continuously over the course of study treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Performed by correlating area under the curve (AUC) (and other parameters) of R(+)XK469 and metabolites with observed toxicities. Specifically, we will compare the AUC in those patients who experience grade &gt;= 2 toxicity to those who experience grade &lt; 2 toxicity using a Wilcoxon, nonparametric rank-sum test.</description>
