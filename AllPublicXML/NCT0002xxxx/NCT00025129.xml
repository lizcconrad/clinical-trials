      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of VNP40101M in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors or lymphomas.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of VNP40101M in patients with advanced solid tumors
           or lymphomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-tumor effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive VNP40101M IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for
      up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP40101M until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose at which no more than 1 of 6
      patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
