      Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy with or without gefitinib in treating unresectable stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Biological therapies such as gefitinib may interfere with the growth of the tumor cells and
      slow the growth of tumors. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus
      radiation therapy is more effective with or without gefitinib in treating non-small cell lung
      cancer

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether maintenance therapy with ZD1839 as compared to placebo following
      induction cisplatin/etoposide/radiotherapy plus consolidation docetaxel improves overall
      survival and progression-free survival in patients with unresectable Stage III non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. To describe the toxicity profile of long term administration of ZD1839. III. To obtain
      samples for correlative studies.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to performance status (0 vs 1), stage (stage IIIA vs IIIB), measurability of lesion
      (measurable vs nonmeasurable), and histologic subtype (squamous vs nonsquamous).

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 29, and
      36 and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33. Beginning within 24 hours after
      starting chemotherapy, patients receive concurrent induction radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5
      weeks and then boost radiotherapy 5 days a week for 1.5 weeks.

      Beginning approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients with stable
      or responding disease receive consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are randomized to one of two treatment arms for
      maintenance therapy. Patients begin maintenance therapy approximately 4-7 weeks after
      completion of consolidation therapy.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral gefitinib daily.

      Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, maintenance therapy continues for
      a maximum of 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years and then annually for 5 years.
