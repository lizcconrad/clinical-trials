      This study will examine the safety and effectiveness of the drug riluzole (RilutekÂ®
      (Registered Trademark)) for short-term treatment of depression symptoms, such as depressed
      mood, psychomotor retardation, and excessive sleeping. Despite the availability of a wide
      range of antidepressant drugs, studies indicate that 30 to 40 percent of patients with major
      depression do not respond to first-line antidepressant treatment with drugs such as
      fluoxetine, upropion, venlafaxine and others. Riluzole, which is approved by the Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), causes chemical changes in
      the brain that may also have antidepressant properties.

      Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with major depressive disorder without psychotic
      features may be eligible for this 2-stage 7-week study. Candidates will be screened with a
      medical history and physical examination, including an electrocardiogram (EKG), blood and
      urine tests, and a psychiatric evaluation. A

      blood or urine sample will be tested for illegal drugs.Women of childbearing potential will
      have a pregnancy test.

      Participants will complete stage 1 of the study, which lasts 1 week, and may then continue
      with stage 2 for an additional 6 weeks. At the start of the study, patients will be tapered
      off all psychiatric medicines and will begin treatment with a placebo (a sugar pill
      formulated to look like the active drug). At some point, they will be switched from placebo
      to riluzole. In addition, participants will undergo the following procedures:

        -  Physical examination and electrocardiograms (EKG) at the beginning and end of the study,
           with vital signs (temperature, blood pressure and heart rate) checked daily

        -  Weekly 1-hour interviews consisting of psychiatric and psychomotor rating scales to
           assess treatment response

        -  Weekly blood tests to measure blood levels of riluzole and evaluate drug side effects

      At the end of the study, participants' psychiatric status will be reassessed and appropriate
      long-term psychiatric treatment arranged.

      Patients, ages 18 to 70 with a diagnosis of major depression without psychotic features, will
      in this pilot study (single arm, single blind) receive riluzole (50-200 mg/day) for a period
      of 6 weeks. Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a greater response rate using
      specified criteria.

      Approximately 25 patients will enter the study to obtain 22 subjects who complete the 6 weeks
      of acute riluzole treatment. Therefore, if 7/22 patients or greater have greater than 50%
      improvement on the primary efficacy measure, then based on statistically guidelines from the
      Optimal Two Stage Design for Clinical Trials, a controlled trial would be indicated to
      scientifically confirm the signal observed in the single arm trial.

    <textblock>
      Major affective disorders are common, severe, chronic and often life-threatening illnesses.
      Major depression contributes to significant morbidity and mortality. Impairment in physical
      and social functioning resulting from depression can be just as severe as other chronic
      medical illnesses. Suicide is the cause of death in 10-20% of individuals with either bipolar
      or recurrent depressive disorders.

      Despite the availability of a wide range of antidepressant drugs, clinical trials indicate
      that 30% to 40% of patients with major depression fail to respond to first-line
      antidepressant treatment, despite adequate dosage, duration, and compliance. Thus, there is a
      clear need to develop novel and improved therapeutics for unipolar and bipolar depression.
      Recent preclinical studies suggest that antidepressants may exert delayed indirect effects on
      the glutamatergic system. Furthermore, a growing body of data suggests that mood disorders
      are associated with regional volumetric reductions, and cell loss and atrophy. It is thus
      noteworthy that lamotrigine, which, among other effects reduces glutamate release, has
      antidepressant effects, and a pilot study has suggested that NMDA antagonists may have
      antidepressant effects. Together, this data suggests that the glutamatergic system may play a
      role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, and that agents, which more directly
      reduce glutamatergic neurotransmission, may represent a novel class of antidepressants.

      Riluzole, an agent that is Food and Drug Administration-approved for Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis has significant antiglutamatergic and neuroprotective properties, may prove to have
      antidepressant properties in depressed patients. In this study, we propose to investigate the
      potential antidepressant efficacy of riluzole, an agent which reduces glutamatergic
      throughput via inhibition of its release, which also exerts robus neurotrophic effects.

      This is a 6-week single-arm, single-blind study that will examine the efficacy and safety of
      riluzole in patients with major depression without psychotic features.

      The study has two Study Periods. Study Period I is the washout phase that will last 7 days.
      Study Period II is a monotherapy 6-week acute treatment phase in which the efficacy and
      tolerability of riluzole is compared to baseline.

      Patients, ages 18 to 60 with a diagnosis of major depression without psychotic features, will
      in this pilot study (single arm, single-blind) receive riluzole (50-200 mg/day) for a period
      of 6 weeks. Acute efficacy will be determined by demonstrating a greater response rate using
      specified criteria.

      Approximately 25 patients will enter the study to obtain 22 subjects who complete the 6 weeks
      of acute riluzole treatment. Therefore if 7/22 patients or greater have greater than 50%
      improvement on the primary efficacy measure, then based on statistically guidelines from the
      Optimal Two Stage Design for Clinical Trials, a controlled trial would be indicated to
      scientifically confirm the signal observed in the single arm trial.
