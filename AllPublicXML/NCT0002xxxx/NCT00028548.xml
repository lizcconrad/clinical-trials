      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of XK469 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicity, and recommended phase II
           dose of XK469 in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, any anti-tumor activity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the drug metabolism, drug interaction potential, molecular and cellular
           predictors of efficacy and toxicity, and clinical confirmation of molecular responses in
           patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive XK469 IV over 20 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of XK469 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of the first 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Once the MTD is determined, up to 15 patients are treated at that dose. Patients in the
      expanded MTD cohort also receive oral NovaSoyÂ® soybean extract twice daily for the study
      duration.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15
      months.
