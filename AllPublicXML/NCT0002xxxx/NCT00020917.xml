  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells and either kill
      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining cetuximab with combination
      chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage IV colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety profile of cetuximab, irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and
      fluorouracil in patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. II. Determine the response rate and
      time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive cetuximab IV over 1-2 hours once
      weekly on weeks 1-6. Patients also receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium
      IV over 10-15 minutes, and fluorouracil IV over 3-5 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-4.
      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 months.
