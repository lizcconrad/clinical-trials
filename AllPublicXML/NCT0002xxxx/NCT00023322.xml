      This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a long-acting form of alpha
      interferon called pegylated interferon in treating hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection. HDV
      only infects people who already have hepatitis B infection. HDV is often severe and
      progressive. Alpha interferon is the standard treatment for HDV, given by injection once a
      day or three times a week for up to 12 months. However, this treatment does not work for
      everyone, and those who respond usually relapse when the drug is stopped. The
      sustained-release form of the drug, pegylated interferon, is given just once a week.
      Pegylated interferon is more effective than standard interferon in hepatitis C patients, with
      patients experiencing longer-term improvement. This study will evaluate the effects of
      pegylated interferon on hepatitis D and hepatitis B. It will determine whether long-term
      therapy with this drug improves inflammation and scarring of the liver, thereby delaying or
      reversing cirrhosis, and whether the improvement can be maintained.

      Patients with chronic hepatitis D over 6 years old may be eligible for this study.
      Participants will have a medical evaluation, including a history and physical examination,
      blood tests, routine urinalysis and 24-hour urine collection. Chest X-ray, electrocardiogram,
      abdominal ultrasound and liver biopsy will be done if these tests have not been done within
      the last year. In addition, depending on their age and individual health status, some
      patients may have exercise stress testing, an eye examination, hearing test, and psychiatric
      consultation. All patients will fill out a health-related quality of life questionnaire.

      Patients will receive pegylated interferon by injection once a week and have blood tests to
      measure the effects of treatment on the liver and on HBV and HDV levels. The medical
      examination and liver biopsy will be repeated at the end of 12 months. Patients who improved
      with treatment may continue therapy long-term. Medical evaluations and liver biopsies will be
      repeated at 3 years and at 5 years.

      We propose to treat between 10 and 20 patients with chronic delta hepatitis with pegylated
      alpha interferon for up to five years. Patients with chronic delta hepatitis with raised
      serum aminotransferases, HBsAg and HDV RNA in serum, and moderate-to-severe chronic hepatitis
      on liver biopsy with HDV antigen will be enrolled. Patients will be monitored for at least
      three months with regular testing for ALT levels and will undergo admission for a thorough
      medical evaluation, portal pressure measurement and percutaneous liver biopsy before
      treatment. Pegylated interferon will then be started in a dose of 180 mcg weekly. At each
      clinic visit, patients will be questioned about side effects and symptoms and have blood
      taken for complete blood counts and routine liver tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,
      direct and total bilirubin, and albumin). At 12-24 week intervals patients will undergo a
      physical examination and be tested for HBsAg, anti-HBs, HDV RNA, and prothrombin time. The
      dose of pegylated interferon will be adjusted based upon side effects and changes in ALT
      levels, aiming for optimal suppression of ALT elevations with acceptable tolerance. At 48
      weeks (one year) and every 96 weeks (two years) thereafter, patients will be readmitted to
      the NIH Clinical Center for repeat thorough medical evaluation, portal pressure measurement
      and liver biopsy. The primary endpoint of therapy will be improvements in hepatic histology
      on liver biopsy done after 3 years of pegylated alpha interferon therapy. Several secondary
      endpoints will be measured, including changes in HDV RNA, loss of HBsAg, HDV staining in the
      liver biopsy, ALT levels, changes in portal pressures, quality of life, all at 1.3 and 5
      years, and hepatic histology at 1 and 5 years. Patients will be maintained on pegylated
      interferon if it is adequately tolerated and there is an adequate &quot;histological response,&quot; as
      defined by at least 3 point improvement in inflammatory score or 1 point improvement in
      fibrosis score of the HAI at each liver biopsy. Therapy will be stopped for: (1) intolerance
      to alpha interferon (which will be carefully defined), (2) lack of improvement in hepatic
      histology after 1, 3, or 5 years of therapy (histological nonresponse), or (3) a &quot;complete
      response,&quot; i.e. loss of HDV RNA and HBsAg and development of anti-HBs.
