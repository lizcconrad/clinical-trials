      To assess the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of serum markers of left ventricular
      remodeling for predicting congestive heart failure.

      BACKGROUND:

      Recent studies have established that cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is a major
      determinant of pathologic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and progressive left ventricular
      dilatation, and as a result, contributes to the development of left ventricular dysfunction
      and overt congestive heart failure (CHF). The recent development of reliable serologic assays
      for procollagen peptides, metalloproteinases (MMP) and their tissue inhibitors (TIMP), and
      cytokines permits the in vivo assessment of LV ECM remodeling, and raises the possibility of
      expanding the utility of these markers 'from the bench to the bedside.' Prior studies of ECM
      biomarkers in congestive heart failure have been limited to cross-sectional investigations of
      small samples of highly selected patients with advanced disease. The fundamental question
      whether serum markers of ECM remodeling are important correlates of left ventricular
      dilatation or left ventricular hypertrophy, or are independent predictors of incident
      congestive heart failure in the community remains unanswered.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The aims of the study are to: determine the relationships between serum markers of ECM
      remodeling and traditional congestive heart failure risk factors; analyze the cross-sectional
      relations between markers of ECM remodeling and echocardiographic left ventricular
      hypertrophy and left ventricular dilatation, Doppler indices of left ventricular filling and
      serum natriuretic peptides; investigate prospectively the relationships between ECM
      remodeling markers and progressive left ventricular dilatation and left ventricular
      hypertrophy and congestive heart failure incidence, adjusting for standard risk factors.
      Stored samples from the Framingham Offspring and Omni cohorts will be used. Participants at
      the extremes of the joint distributions of left ventricular wall thickness and left
      ventricular internal dimension from echocardiograms performed at earlier Framingham exams
      will be sampled.
