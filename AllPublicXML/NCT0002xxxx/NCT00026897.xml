  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing immunotherapy for advanced cancer under IRB-approved protocols, who are
      to receive immune cells in adoptive transfer, will have less than or equal to 50% of those
      cells labeled with In-111-oxine and administered along with the remainder of their unlabeled
      cells. They will then undergo gamma-camera imaging over the next 0-7 days and blood samples
      and tumor sites which are accessible with minimal surgery (low-risk biopsy) may be sampled in
      some patients for enumeration of radiolabeled cells. End-points will be tumor and normal
      organ imaging and the amount of In-111 per gram of tissue in biopsies or per ml. of blood.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        All patients will be 18 years of age or older.

        All patients will be enrolled in NCI-approved intramural immunotherapy protocol in which
        immune cells are adoptively administered to treat advanced cancer.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients who are receiving less than 3x10(9) cells in transfer will be excluded.

        Impaired patients who are unable to give valid informed consent will also be excluded.

        Patients who are pregnant will be excluded.

        All other exclusion criteria stated in the parent immunotherapy protocol.

        Patients who are HIV-infected.
