      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or
      deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Peripheral stem cell
      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of monoclonal antibody therapy and
      kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody
      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed or
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody B3 followed by
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with relapsed or
           metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody B3 (Y90 MOAB
      B3).

      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 4 days prior to
      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection and continuing until the target number of cells
      is reached.

      After PBSC collection, patients receive indium In 111 monoclonal antibody B3 IV over 30-60
      minutes once within days -7 to -1 for tumor imaging and then Y90 MOAB B3 IV over 30-60
      minutes on day 0. After at least day 7, patients undergo autologous PBSC reinfusion. Patients
      receive G-CSF SC daily beginning 7 days after PBSC reinfusion and continuing until blood
      counts recover.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB B3 until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 24-36
      months.
