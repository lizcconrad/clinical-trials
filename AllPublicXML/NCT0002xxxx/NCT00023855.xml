      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining PS-341 and doxorubicin in
      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PS-341 in combination with doxorubicin in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PS-341.

      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and doxorubicin IV on
      over 3-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-31 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
