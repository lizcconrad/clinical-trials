      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total body irradiation before a donor bone marrow
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer and abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's
      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor
      are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red
      blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor
      can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin
      and removing the T cells from the donor cells before transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well total-body irradiation and chemotherapy
      followed by T-cell depleted donor bone marrow transplant works in treating young patients
      with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of hyperfractionated total body irradiation, thiotepa, and
           cyclophosphamide followed by T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in
           children with acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous
           leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or myelodysplastic syndromes.

        -  Correlate the progenitor cell dose and dose of clonable T cells with the incidence and
           quality of engraftment, extent of chimerism, incidence and severity of acute and chronic
           graft-versus-host disease, characteristics of hematopoietic and immunologic
           reconstitution, and overall and disease-free survival at 2 years in patients treated
           with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo total body irradiation three times daily on days -9 to -7 and twice
      on day -6. Patients receive thiotepa IV over 4 hours on days -5 and -4 and cyclophosphamide
      IV over 30 minutes on days -3 and -2. Patients who cannot receive cyclophosphamide, due to
      prior hemorrhagic cystitis or exposure to high-dose cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide, receive
      fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1. Patients planning to receive family member
      HLA-mismatched or unrelated bone marrow transplantation receive horse anti-thymocyte globulin
      IV once daily on days -5 and -4. Patients undergo allogeneic T-cell-depleted bone marrow
      transplantation on day 0. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV every 12 hours beginning on
      day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every 2-4 weeks for the first 100 days post-transplantation, every 6
      weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 3-6 months until 2 years
      post-transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients (25 with HLA 6/6 antigen-matched related donors and
      25 with HLA 5/6 antigen-matched related donors or HLA 5/6 or 6/6 antigen-matched unrelated
      donors) will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
