      This study will develop a national cord blood bank for siblings of patients with
      hemoglobinopathies and thalassemia.

      BACKGROUND:

      During the past decade, a number of advances have been made in the treatment of patients with
      sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. Among these advances is allogeneic bone marrow
      transplantation, which is the only current treatment that offers a potential for cure. In
      sickle cell anemia, transplantation has been performed in patients who have had advanced
      organ damage. In thalassemia, transplantation has been performed before having any evidence
      of iron-related tissue damage. Due to concerns over engraftment and graft versus host disease
      (GVHD), transplants for patients with hemoglobinopathies have been limited to situations in
      which a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatible donor existed. Unfortunately, an HLA-matched
      related donor is often not available. Umbilical cord blood (UCB), a recently recognized
      source of hematopoietic stem cells, has been used to successfully transplant bone marrow to
      over 500 patients. The potential advantage of cord blood over other donor sources of stem
      cells is the minimal risk of high-grade GVHD (even without complete HLA compatibility).

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This study will establish a national sibling donor cord blood (SDCB) program, evaluate its
      use in a multi-center pilot study of transplantation, and develop a Web-based data management
      system to support these two projects. A multi-center pilot study was conducted on cord blood
      transplantation in children with either sickle cell disease or thalassemia. The investigators
      tested the hypothesis that a novel immunosuppressive conditioning regimen (fludarabine,
      cyclophosphamide, and busulfan) and post transplant therapy (mycophenolate mofetil and
      cyclosporine) would improve engraftment rates and prevent disease recurrence. The effect of
      SDCB transplantation on hematologic parameters and GVHD was monitored. Enrollment in the
      study was suspended on December 29, 2003. The protocol was revised, replacing the previous
      conditioning regimen of fludarabine, busulfan, and cyclophosphamide with a more conventional
      regimen of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin (Sangstat), busulfan, and cyclophosphamide. The
      revised protocol is open for enrollment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suitable UCB collection from an HLA-identical sibling

          -  Sickle cell anemia (Hb SS or S beta thalassemia) with significant disease
             manifestations as defined by at least one of the following criteria:

               1. A history of painful events defined as three or more painful events in the 2
                  years prior to enrollment. Pain may occur in typical sites associated with
                  vaso-occlusive painful events and cannot be explained by causes other than sickle
                  cell disease. The pain must last at least 4 hours and require treatment with
                  either parenteral narcotics, an equianalgesic dose of oral narcotics (if pain is
                  treated in a local facility where parenteral narcotics are not routinely used to
                  treat painful events), or parenteral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
                  Painful events managed at home will be considered only if there is documentation
                  of the event in a clinical record that may be reviewed by an investigator.

               2. Acute chest syndrome (ACS) with two or more episodes of ACS with the development
                  of a new infiltrate on chest radiograph and/or having a perfusion defect
                  demonstrable on a lung radioisotope scan

               3. Any combination of painful events and episodes of ACS that total three events in
                  the 2 years before transplantation

               4. Any clinically significant neurologic event (stroke or hemorrhage) or any
                  neurologic defect lasting more than 24 hours

               5. Abnormal cerebral MRI and abnormal cerebral MRA

               6. An episode of dactylitis in the first year of life with significant anemia (Hbg
                  less than 7 g/dL), or leukocytosis in the second year of life such that the risk
                  of a severe adverse outcome before 18 years of age exceeds 54% (as defined by the
                  cooperative study of sickle cell disease (CSSCD) infant cohort study)

               7. History of positive trans-cranial Doppler studies (average greater than 200
                  cm/sec)

          -  Beta thalassemia major with significant disease manifestations as defined by the
             following criteria: Beta thalassemia genotype consistent with clinical diagnosis of
             beta thalassemia major (could include patients with E-beta thalassemia genotype) and
             requiring eight or more red blood cell (RBC) transfusions a year and iron chelation
             therapy. Younger patients who are at risk of transfusional iron overload but who have
             not yet initiated iron chelation therapy will be eligible.

          -  Adequate physical function as measured by the following criteria:

               1. Cardiac: Asymptomatic or, if symptomatic, then left ventricular ejection fraction
                  at rest must be greater than 40% and must improve with exercise, or shortening
                  fraction greater than 26%

               2. Hepatic: Less than 5 times the clinical baseline of AST and less than 2.5 times
                  the clinical baseline mg/dL of total serum bilirubin (clinical baseline is
                  determined from the mean of the four most recent test results)

               3. Renal: Serum creatinine within normal range for age or if serum creatinine is
                  outside normal range for age then renal function (creatinine clearance or GFR)
                  greater than 50% of the lower limit of normal (LLN) for age

               4. Pulmonary: Asymptomatic, or, if symptomatic, DLCO, FEV1, FEC (diffusion capacity)
                  greater than 45% of predicted (corrected for hemoglobin); if unable to obtain
                  PFT, oxygen saturation greater than 85% on room air
