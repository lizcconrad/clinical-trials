      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells.
      Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Giving
      chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of paclitaxel and carboplatin
      followed by cisplatin plus radiation therapy with or without amifostine in treating patients
      who have locally advanced cancer of the nasopharynx.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the overall incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis in patients with locally
           advanced undifferentiated nasopharyngeal cancer treated with paclitaxel and carboplatin
           followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy with or without amifostine.

        -  Compare the feasibility and activity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of paclitaxel and carboplatin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO
      performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), response to induction chemotherapy (complete vs partial vs
      stable disease vs not evaluable), and participating center.

      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin
      IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients with a complete or partial response after 2 courses of induction chemotherapy
      receive 2 additional courses before randomization. Patients with stable disease after 2
      courses of induction chemotherapy or who cannot be evaluated after 1 course proceed directly
      to randomization. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients also undergo
           radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive amifostine subcutaneously daily. Patients receive chemotherapy
           and radiotherapy as in arm I.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 41-93 patients will be accrued for this study.
