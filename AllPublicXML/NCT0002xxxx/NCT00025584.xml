      PS-341 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell
      growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating women who have
      metastatic breast cancer
    </textblock>

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of PS-341, in terms of response rate, in women with metastatic
      breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical activity of this drug, in terms of progression-free survival, in
      these women.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile and tolerability of this drug in these women.

      III. Determine the pharmacodynamics of this drug in these women.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks 1 and 2. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-12
      months.
