      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may make
      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      who have liver cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous
           dendritic cells in HLA-A*0201-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunological effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and clinical responses in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells intradermally on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 12
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Increasing doses of AFP will be given to groups of 3 intradermally. Subjects will receive 3 biweekly vaccinations. At least 2 patients at a given dose must have received their complete 3 vaccination schedule with a 30 day observation period after the last vaccination before a higher dose is initiated.</description>
