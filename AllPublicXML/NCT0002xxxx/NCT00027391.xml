  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine whether albuterol or oxandrolone, alone or in combination, are
      able to increase strength and muscle mass in patients with FSHD. It also will determine if
      albuterol given in &quot;pulsed&quot; fashion will have more effect than when given continuously.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: placebo, pulsed albuterol, oxandrolone, or both
      pulsed albuterol and oxandrolone. Treatment will continue for 52 weeks unless unacceptable
      side effects occur. Patients will undergo testing of muscle function. All patients will
      return for follow-up assessments at Weeks 4, 12, 26, and 52.
