    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy in
      treating patients who have recurrent or persistent metastatic colorectal cancer. Radiolabeled
      monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver tumor-killing substances to them
      without harming normal cells. Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody therapy may be effective
      treatment for colorectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2
      (deleted CH2 region) in patients with colorectal cancer.

      II. Determine the toxic effects, plasma pharmacokinetics, whole body biodistribution, and
      conjugate stability of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the ability of this drug to localize to tumor sites in these patients.

      IV. Determine the immune response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive a tracer dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody CC49-deltaCH2 IV on day 1
      and a therapy dose over 30 minutes on day 8.

      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody
      CC49-deltaCH2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose at which 3 of 5 patients experience grade 3 or greater toxicity while 0-2 of 5 patients
      experience reversible grade 4 hematologic toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for a minimum of 7 weeks and then every 6 weeks until disease
      progression.
