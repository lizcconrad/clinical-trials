      This study seeks to learn more about the symptoms of severe mood dysregulation in children
      and adolescents ages 7-17. Children and adolescents with severe mood dysregulation (SMD)
      display chronic anger, sadness, or irritability, as well as hyperarousal (such as insomnia,
      distractibility, hyperactivity) and extreme responses to frustration (such as frequent,
      severe temper tantrums). Researchers will describe the moods and behaviors of children with
      these symptoms and use specialized testing and brain imaging to learn about the brain changes
      associated with this disorder.

      Objective:

      Irritability is a common and impairing clinical presentation in youth (Collishaw et al 2010,
      Leibenluft 2011, Peterson et al 1996). Despite its significant public health impact, the
      clinical course and pathophysiology of irritability remains poorly understood. Chronic and
      severe irritability is the primary symptom of the new DSM-5 diagnosis, disruptive mood
      dysregulation disorder (DMDD) (APA 2013), is an associated symptom of other pediatric
      disorders (Ambrosini et al 2013, Burke et al 2014, Jensen et al 2007, Shaw et al 2014,
      Stoddard et al 2014), and can be a clinical precursor to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and
      anxiety disorders. In addition, irritability is a trait distributed continuously in youth
      (Stringaris &amp; Taylor 2015), thereby fitting well within the National Institute of Mental
      Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative (Insel et al 2010).

      Clinically impairing irritability in children and adolescents began to gain more attention as
      interest grew in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder (Baroni et al 2009, Biederman et
      al 1998, Carlson 1998, Leibenluft et al 2003, Nottelman 2001). Beginning in the 1990s, child
      psychiatry researchers suggested that while pediatric bipolar disorder can present with
      distinct episodes of mania or hypomania as in adults, the more typical pediatric presentation
      was chronic, severe irritability and hyperarousal symptoms. However, data collected under
      this protocol comprise a series of longitudinal (Deveney et al 2015, Stringaris et al 2010),
      family (Brotman et al 2007), behavioral (Dickstein et al 2007, Rich et al 2008b), and
      pathophysiological (Adleman et al 2012, Adleman et al 2011, Brotman et al 2010, Rich et al
      2007, Thomas et al 2014, Thomas et al 2012, Thomas et al 2013, Tseng et al 2016) studies that
      differentiated classically defined episodic pediatric bipolar disorder from chronic
      irritability without distinct manic or hypomanic episodes [see (Leibenluft 2011) for review].
      These findings are consistent with reports from other groups and meta-analyses (Althoff et al
      2014; Copeland et al 2014; Fristad et al 2016; Vidal-Ribas et al 2016).

      Among the several strands of research designed to differentiate pediatric bipolar disorder
      from chronic irritability, longitudinal studies provide the strongest evidence that these two
      phenotypes are distinct. Children with chronic irritability are at elevated risk for later
      depression, but not manic episodes (Althoff et al 2014, Brotman et al 2006, Leibenluft et al
      2006, Stringaris et al 2010, Stringaris et al 2009, Vidal-Ribas et al 2016). Thus, youth with
      MDD (with and without prior DMDD) are an important comparison group to explore, and we are
      examining the developmental trajectory, phenomenology, behavioral correlates, and underlying
      neural mechanisms of chronic irritability and MDD in youth.

      The current translational model of irritability emphasizes the role of abnormal threat and
      reward processing, but also underlines the relevance of environmental factors in the
      emergence and maintenance of irritability (Brotman et al., 2017). More precisely, it is
      assumed that irritable children experience environments, where rewards and punishments are
      inconsistently delivered leading to unintentional reinforcement of disruptive behavior
      through the parents. Reasons for this inconsistent parent behavior could be manifold spanning
      instrumental learning deficits and exaggerated responses to threat and frustrative non-reward
      in the parents themselves as well as lack of knowledge regarding learning principles (Soenens
      et al., 2006; Sanders et al., 1999) and increased levels of stress (Kiff et al., 2011). These
      factors might contribute to instrumental-learning deficits in the children increasing
      frequency and intensity of temper outbursts. Heightened levels of chronic irritability,
      another symptom of DMDD, might be more associated with features of the parent-child
      interaction. There is a rich literature within the framework of attachment theory (Ainsworth
      et al. 2015, Bolwby, 2008) showing that behavior of children with anxious-resistant insecure
      attachment is characterized by a general angry tone and is also associated with increased
      amygdala responses to negative social scenes (Vrticka et al., 2012). In addition, it was also
      shown that highly irritable infants are less sociable in terms of being less responsive and
      more fearful towards others and displaying an angry emotional tone in general as toddlers
      when they had been insecurely attached and more sociable when they had been securely attached
      (Stupica et al, 2011). Adding another layer of complexity, it is also conceivable that
      inconsistent parent behavior diminishes parent s perceived trust-worthiness. This could be of
      relevance as recent studies showed that persons are less willing to delay rewards an action
      bound to increase levels of frustration if their interaction partner is perceived as little
      reliable (Michaelson, 2013, Front Psychol; Michaelson &amp; Munakata, 2016 Dev Science).

      The overall goal is to gain a clearer understanding of the environmental factors contributing
      to irritability in order to inform treatment and improve the outcome for children. In order
      to advance this aim, we plan to investigate parents of youth with DMDD enrolled in this study
      and subthreshold DMDD enrolled in this study in order to determine clinical, behavioral,
      neuropsychological, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical features of the parents that
      contribute to the symptomatology in the children and adolescents. Further, we plan to examine
      parent-child interaction and its influence on irritability observed in the youth.

      Study population:

      There are 5 separate populations being studied in this protocol:

      Children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old who meet criteria for DMDD or
      subthreshold DMDD.

      Parents of children and adolescents, who meet criteria for DMDD or subthreshold DMDD and are
      enrolled in 02-M-0021, and are 25 59 years old will be studied.

      3. Healthy volunteer children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old.

      4. Healthy volunteer adults between the ages of 18-25 years old.

      5. Children and adolescents between the ages of 12-17 years old who meet criteria for major
      depressive disorder (MDD).

      Design:

      For children and adolescents with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, this study is an
      outpatient characterization and longitudinal follow-along design. Once determined to be
      eligible, individuals come for an initial assessment, and then return at varying intervals
      until age 25 for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.

      For healthy volunteer children, adults and parents of healthy volunteer children, this study
      is an outpatient cross-sectional study that includes clinical interviews, behavioral tasks,
      and structural and functional MRI.

      For all individuals, genetic material from saliva or blood is obtained under protocol
      01-M-0254.

      Outcome measures:

      There are two primary outcome measures. First, this study will examine associations between
      irritability and clinical, behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological
      variables in individuals with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, BD (see protocol
      00-M-0198) (Leibenluft et al 2003), anxiety (see protocol 00-M-0192), and healthy volunteers
      (see protocol 00-M-0198). Second, this study will examine between-group differences in
      clinical, behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological variables in
      individuals with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, BD (see protocol 00-M-0198)
      (Leibenluft et al 2003), anxiety (see protocol 00-M-0192), and healthy volunteers (see
      protocol 00-M-0198).

        -  1. Inclusion criteria for children with DMDD, subthreshold DMDD:

        1.1.1 Ages 7-17 at the time of recruitment; will be followed in the longitudinal component
        of the study until age 25.

        1.1.2 Abnormal mood (specifically, anger, sadness, and/or irritability), present at least
        half of the day most days (or at least half the day at least one day per week for
        subthreshold), and of sufficient severity to be noticeable by people in the child s
        environment (e.g. parents, teachers, peers).

        1.1.3 Compared to his/her peers, the child exhibits markedly increased reactivity to
        negative emotional stimuli that is manifest verbally or behaviorally. For example, the
        child responds to frustration with extended temper tantrums (inappropriate for age and/or
        precipitating event), verbal rages, and/or aggression toward people or property. Such
        events occur, on average, at least three times a week. For subthreshold DMDD such tantrums
        occur on average at least once per month.

        1.1.4 The symptoms in # 1.1.2, and 1.1.3 above are currently present and have been present
        for at least 12 months without any symptom-free periods exceeding three months.

        1.1.5 The onset of symptoms must be prior to age 10 years.

        1.1.6 For DMDD the symptoms are severe in at least in one setting (e.g. violent outbursts,
        assaultiveness at home, school, or with peers) and at least mild (distractibility,
        intrusiveness) in a second setting. For subthreshold DMDD, there must be evidence of
        impairment causing distress to the child or to those around him/her in at least one
        setting.

        1.2. Children with DMDD entering treatment. Those eligible for treatment must meet all
        criteria for DMDD; subthreshold DMDD is not eligible for treatment. In addition to criteria
        in VI.B.1.1 (above),

        1.2.1 Has no exclusionary criteria for MRI scanning

        1.2.2. The child is failing his/her treatment as defined as:

        1.2.2.1 The child s current CGAS score less than or equal to 60.

        1.2.2.2 The child s psychiatrist/treater agrees that the child s response to his/her
        current treatment makes it clinically appropriate to change the child s current treatment.

        1.2.2. 3 On the basis of record review and interviews with child and parent, the research
        team agrees that the child s response to his/her current treatment is no more than minimal
        (i.e. CGI-I&gt;2).

        (e.g., ruminating over minor past failings).

        5.1.2.1.8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day
        (e.g. appears easily distracted, complains of memory difficulties).

        5.1.2.1.9. Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideas
        without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide

        5.2.1. has no exclusionary criteria for MRI scanning

        5.2.2 is failing his/her treatment as defined as:

        5.2.2.1. The child s current CGAS score &lt;60.

        5.2.2.2. The child s psychiatrist/treater agrees that the child s response to his/her
        4.2.2.3. current treatment makes it clinically appropriate to change the child s current
        treatment.

        5.2.2.4. On the basis of record review and interviews with child and parent, the research
        team agrees that the child s response to his/her current treatment is no more than minimal
        (i.e. CGI-I&gt;2).
