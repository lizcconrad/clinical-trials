      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of lifestyle intervention on subclinical
      cardiovascular disease measures in women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

      BACKGROUND:

      Cardiovascular disease is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in older women. Better
      methods of prevention via health promotion are needed. Estrogen HRT may beneficially affect
      women's cardiovascular health, based on evidence from observational studies, but recent trial
      evidence suggests HRT may actually lead to increased risk of cardiovascular disease in new
      users. Understanding this untoward effect of HRT and how to prevent it is a significant aim.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This randomized trial of 500 women on HRT for at least two years, aged 52-60 years, and three
      or more years postmenopausal will test whether reduction in waist circumference,
      triglycerides, dense low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), number of LDL particles,
      C-reactive protein, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-I) by aggressive diet and
      exercise, versus a health education control, and will decrease progression or result in
      regression of measures of subclinical vascular disease. The intervention is designed to
      reduce total fat intake to 17 percent of calories, 1300 kilo calories, and increase moderate
      activity to 150-240 minutes per week to obtain a 10 percent reduction in weight. The primary
      endpoint will be a 20 percent or at least a 20 mg decrease in triglyceride levels, a 5 cm
      decrease in waist circumference, and a 10 percent decrease in LDLc. This will result in
      changes in subclinical measurements, including carotid ultrasound, electron beam computer
      tomography of the coronary artery and aorta, pulse wave velocity, endothelial function, and
      tonometry of the radial artery. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of lipoproteins,
      inflammatory markers, and estrogen metabolites will also be evaluated.
