      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel in treating patients who
      have refractory or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of paclitaxel in patients with refractory or
           recurrent endometrial papillary carcinoma.

        -  Determine the objective response and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the acute side effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study.
