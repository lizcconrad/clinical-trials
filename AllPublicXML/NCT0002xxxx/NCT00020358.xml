      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Vaccine
      therapy may be an effective treatment for melanoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of three vaccine therapy
      regimens in treating patients who have melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the immunologic activity of three different schedules of peptide immunization
           with gp100:209-217 (210M) or gp100:17-25 antigen and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D),
           tyrosinase:240-251 (244S), tyrosinase:206-214 (closed to accrual 11/05/01), or
           tyrosinase-related protein-1 (ORF3):1-9 peptide (closed to accrual 11/05/01) emulsified
           in Montanide ISA-51 in patients with melanoma at high risk for recurrence.

        -  Compare the response rate to treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2) after being immunized
           with this regimen with the usual response rate to IL-2 in this patient population.

        -  Determine whether an exploratory cohort of HLA-A2-positive patients demonstrate
           immunologic activity to immunization with 2 peptides emulsified together.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to HLA type (A0201 vs
      A1 vs A3 vs A24 vs A31). (HLA-A24 and HLA-A31 closed to accrual 11/05/01). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms and are given an assigned vaccine, which is emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51.

        -  HLA typing:

             -  HLA-A2: gp100:209-217 (210M) and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)

             -  HLA-A1: tyrosinase:240-251 (244S)

             -  HLA-A3: gp100:17-25

             -  HLA-A24: tyrosinase:206-214 (closed to accrual 11/05/01)

             -  HLA-A31: tyrosinase-related protein-1 (ORF3):1-9 (closed to accrual 11/05/01)

        -  Arm I: Patients receive assigned vaccine subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 10 weeks
           followed by 3 weeks of no treatment.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive assigned vaccine SC on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive assigned vaccine SC on days 1-4, 22-25, 43-46, and 64-67.

      Treatment in all arms repeats every 13 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After the completion of the randomized arms of HLA-A2 patients, additional HLA-A2 patients
      receive immunization with gp100:209-217 (210M) and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D) emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 SC once every 3 weeks for 4 courses.

      Patients with progressive disease may receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours
      for up to 4 days. Treatment repeats every 10-14 days for at least 4 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or mixed or
      partial response to treatment may receive additional courses every 2 months.

      Patients are followed at 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 324 patients (19-33 per arm for the HLA-A0201 stratum, 13-16
      per arm for the other 4 strata, and 33 per the additional HLA-A2 cohort) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years. (HLA-A24 and HLA-A31 closed to accrual 11/05/01).
