      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of clozapine as a
      treatment for the manic phase of bipolar disorder.

      A significant proportion of manic patients either do not respond adequately to conventional
      treatment or cannot tolerate the adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses of these
      agents. Clozapine may be a safe and effective treatment for mania. However, the efficacy of
      clozapine as an alternative therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder mania has not
      been extensively researched.

      The study will be conducted in three phases. Phase 1 is a screening phase that will take
      place for 2 to 7 days. Participants will undergo a baseline positron emission tomography
      (PET) scan of the brain at the end of this period. In Phase 2, participants will be randomly
      assigned to receive either clozapine or placebo (an inactive pill) for 3 weeks. They may also
      receive lorazepam for the first 10 days of Phase 2. After 3 weeks, patients treated with
      clozapine will undergo a second PET scan. During Phase 3, participants who received placebo
      and did not improve will be offered clozapine for 3 weeks. Those who received clozapine and
      did not improve will receive other treatment for 3 weeks. At the end of Phase 3, participants
      who were treated with clozapine will have another PET scan.

      A significant proportion of manic patients either do not respond adequately to conventional
      treatment (lithium, valproate or carbamazepine (with or without antipsychotic drugs), or
      cannot tolerate the adverse effects associated with therapeutic doses of these agents. Thus,
      a need exists for additional effective treatments. Preliminary studies by our group suggest
      that clozapine may have antimanic actions and be effective in treatment-resistant bipolar
      disorder. However, the efficacy of clozapine as an alternative therapy in treatment-resistant
      mania has never been subjected to definitive study with an adequate number of subjects. Thus,
      we propose to conduct the largest and only double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to date, of
      clozapine, in bipolar manic patients who were unresponsive or intolerant to six weeks of
      treatment with lithium, valproate, carbamazepine and at least one antipsychotic drug. The
      specific aims of this investigation are to 1) assess the acute treatment efficacy of
      clozapine in treatment-resistant mania, 2) to investigate the functional anatomical
      correlates of mania, and 3) to investigate the effects of clozapine treatment on cerebral
      glucose metabolism and metabolic correlates of effective antimanic, clozapine treatment.
      Forty-two subjects (two groups of 21 each) will be randomly assigned to treatment with
      clozapine or placebo for three weeks. We anticipate that a maximum of 33% of patients will be
      withdrawn from the acute phase of the study due to reasons such as intolerable adverse
      effects or withdrawal of consent. Thus, we expect the entered sample to yield 14 completed
      subjects per cell. This sample size will allow for adequate statistical power to test the
      hypotheses stated above. Patients, ages 18-65, with a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder manic
      or mixed (with or without psychotic features), will be randomized to double-blind treatment
      to receive either clozapine (200-550 mg/day) or placebo, for a period of 3 weeks. Following
      this acute period, the patients will receive either open-label clozapine or treatment as
      clinically indicated. If clozapine is found effective in treatment-resistant mania, it would
      be a significant step forward in the treatment of these patients and would have major health
      implications. In addition, it would establish a gold standard against which newer treatments
      can be compared to. Finally, glucose metabolism images will be obtained using PET and [F-18]
      FDG at baseline and following 3 weeks of clozapine treatment to investigate the functional
      anatomical correlates of mania and to compare drug-induced metabolic changes between
      responders and nonresponders.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Males or females 18 to 65 years of age;

        Diagnosis: DSM-IV Bipolar I Disorder, current episode manic or mixed with or without
        psychotic features as determined by SCID-P. This criteria includes the following diagnoses:
        296.4X, Bipolar I Disorder, Most Recent Episode Manic, and 296.6X, Bipolar I Disorder, Most
        Recent Episode Mixed;

        YMRS greater than or equal to 20 at Visits 1 and 2;

        No decrease in total score of YMRS of greater than or equal to 20% during washout (between
        Visits 1 and 2);

        Meet criteria for treatment resistance.

        Patients must have experienced at least two manic or mixed episodes within five years prior
        to study entry; DSM-IV rapid cyclers will be permitted to participate in this study;

        Each patient must have a level of understanding sufficient to agree to all the tests
        required by the protocol;

        Each patient must understand the nature of the study and must sign an informed consent
        document. Before participating in this study, we will advise all patients to complete a NIH
        Advance Directive Form. However, completing a NIH Advanced Directive form is not a
        requirement for participating in this study.

        Previous lack of response (during a manic episode) to any two of the following antimanic

        atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone, aripiprazole,
        quetiapine). If the subject has only taking one of these antimanic treatments, then the
        research physician may start one of them at NIH. Subjects not responding to a 3 week trial
        of an antimanic agent of their choice (at least a 50% decrease on the YMRS rating scale
        form baseline) will be eligible to be randomized if they continue to meet study criteria.
