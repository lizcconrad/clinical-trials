  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the frequency and severity of problems in women with breast cancer
      for 2 years following initial medical treatment, including:

        -  Physical impairments, such as loss of strength or flexibility, increased weight and
           swelling.

        -  Symptom distress, such as pain, fatigue and weakness.

        -  Functional limitations and disabilities, such as loss of independence in activities of
           daily living (e.g., grooming, bathing, dressing, driving a car), work and social and
           recreational activities.

      It will identify factors associated with these problems and try to determine their
      relationship to them.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with stage I, II, III or IV breast cancer may be eligible
      for this study. Women who have a breast biopsy negative for cancer will also be enrolled as
      control subjects. Participants will be drawn from patients referred to the National Naval
      Medical Center for diagnosis and treatment during 2001-2003.

      Participants will be evaluated over a 2-year period during an initial baseline visit (before
      medical treatment or biopsy) and follow-up visits at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months following
      procedures:

        -  Interview about past medical history and present illness, social and recreational
           activities, functional independence at work and during activities of daily living.

        -  Completion of questionnaires including health survey, upper limb disability
           questionnaire, and physical activity questionnaire. (Questionnaires are completed only
           at baseline and 12 and 24 months after medical treatment begins.) The questionnaires
           take about 30 to 40 minutes to complete.

        -  Upper body examination, including pain measurement using a 10-point scale, active and
           passive range of motion measures, manual muscle testing measures using a 10-point scale,
           timed upper limb lift test, and measures of upper limb volume and girth.

      Patients and healthy participants will undergo an interview at the beginning of the study and
      1,3,6,9, 12, 18 and 24 months and answer questions about their medical history; family
      history; current problem and treatment; pain history; and social, physical and recreational
      activities. At the visit, they will also undergo an upper body physical exam by a physical
      therapist. Patients and the healthy participants will also fill out questionnaires about arm
      disability, quality of life, and physical activity at the beginning of the study and at 12,
      18, and 24 months.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Population/Subjects: Individuals with breast cancer are identified among the patient
        population at National Naval Medical Center (NNMC). Patients referred to the NNMC Breast
        Care Center) NNMC-BCC for diagnosis and management (surgical treatment and radiation
        treatment or chemotherapy) of histologically established breast cancer (stage I, II, III,
        or IV) during 2001-2003, are eligible to participate in the study.

        Healthy female individuals will be controls.

        Subjects must be over 18 years of age and post-puberty as breast cancer does not occur
        prior to puberty; and been seen pre-surgical or medical intervention for baseline
        measurements and agree to participate in six follow-up visits of 30-45 minutes in duration
        during the next two-years.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subject chooses to not participate in the study.

        Subjects are unable to complete the clinical examination tests.

        Subjects are unable to complete the questionnaires/surveys.

        Subjects are under age 18.
