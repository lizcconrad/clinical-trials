      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      recurrence of cancer. The use of perillyl alcohol may be effective in preventing the
      recurrence of breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of perillyl alcohol in preventing the
      recurrence of breast cancer in women who have been treated with surgery with or without
      adjuvant therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of perillyl alcohol in women at risk for recurrent
           breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the single-dose and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral perillyl alcohol once daily on days 1-28. Treatment continues every 4
      weeks for 3 courses.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of perillyl alcohol until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 6 patients experience grade 1 toxicity or at least 1 of 6 patients experience
      grade 2 or greater toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
