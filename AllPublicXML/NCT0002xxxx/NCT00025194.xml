      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone and estramustine, use different
      ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. It is not yet known
      whether BMS-247550 is more effective with or without estramustine in treating prostate
      cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the best dose of ixabepilone when given
      together with estramustine and to see how well giving ixabepilone together with estramustine
      works compared to ixabepilone alone in treating patients with progressive prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ixabepilone combined with estramustine in
           patients with progressive androgen-independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate. (Phase I)

        -  Compare the safety and efficacy of ixabepilone with or without estramustine in this
           patient population. (Phase II)

        -  Correlate the clinical outcomes with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
           reaction-based assay for prostate-specific antigen mRNA in patients treated with these
           regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ixabepilone (phase I) followed by a randomized,
      multicenter study (phase II).

        -  Phase I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 2 and oral estramustine 3
           times daily on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ixabepilone until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours at the MTD on day 2 and
                estramustine as in phase I.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours at the MTD on day 1. Treatment
                in both arms repeats as in phase I.

      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study and a
      total of 44-92 patients (22-46 per treatment arm) will be accrued for phase II of this study
      within 12-18 months.
