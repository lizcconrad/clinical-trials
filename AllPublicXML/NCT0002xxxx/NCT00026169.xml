      Phase I trial to determine the dose of imatinib mesylate that is most effective with the
      least amount of toxic side effects in treating patients who have advanced cancer and kidney
      failure. Imatinib mesylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping the enzyme
      necessary for cancer cell growth. Kidney failure may delay the elimination of imatinib
      mesylate from the body, which may lead to longer drug exposure and increase toxic side
      effects

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of STI571 for cohorts of patients with
      varying degrees of renal dysfunction (normal, mild, moderate, and severe).

      II. To determine the effects of renal dysfunction on the plasma pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of STI571.

      III. To evaluate the safety of STI571 in patients with various degrees of renal dysfunction.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to creatinine
      clearance (at least 60 mL/min vs 40-59 mL/min vs 20-39 mL/min vs less than 20 mL/min vs any
      creatinine clearance and undergoing dialysis).

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once or twice daily on days 1 and 4-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients in each stratum receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 60-69 patients (about 12 per stratum) will be accrued for
      this study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignancy, which is
             metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures do
             not exist or are no longer effective; the following tumor types are eligible:

               -  (Note: All patients with normal renal function should be referred first to higher
                  priority national trials under cooperative group or Novartis sponsorship; these
                  studies include the Intergroup S0033 trial in GIST tumors and NABTC-9908 trial
                  for gliomas; Novartis is also sponsoring ongoing clinical trials in pediatric
                  patients with Philadelphia chromosome - positive acute lymphocytic leukemia and
                  chronic myelogenous leukemia; for complete listing of other trials and sites
                  collaborating investigators are encouraged to verify status of current national
                  trials on the NCI - Physician Data Query [PDQ] system)

               -  Patients with all hematological malignancies are eligible (such as myeloma,
                  leukemia and lymphoma patients) provided the patient(s) have exhausted curative
                  intent or life prolonging therapy and meet other eligibility in terms of blood
                  counts; patients with Philadelphia chromosome - positive leukemia should be
                  enrolled on other NCI or Novartis sponsored trials, if possible

               -  Any solid tumor patient with abnormal renal dysfunction and including 12 patients
                  with normal renal function (controls for pharmacokinetics) with an emphasis on
                  patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and including patients with
                  glioma; patients with glioma who require corticosteroids or anticonvulsants must
                  be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for one month prior to
                  enrollment

               -  (Note: Slots will be retained for patients with CML or other Philadelphia
                  chromosome-positive leukemia or GIST tumors beyond the initial dose level
                  cohorts, since these tumor types have greater potential to respond to therapy);
                  every effort should be made to enroll patients with glioma or GIST on available
                  cooperative group trials first

          -  Prior chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy and immunotherapy are allowed,
             including prior therapy with STI571; there is no ceiling on number of prior regimens

          -  ECOG performance status =&lt; 2, (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%) and a life expectancy of at least 3
             months

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/uL, OR

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/uL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits

          -  AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) =&lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Patients with abnormal kidney function will be allowed and will be grouped accordingly

          -  Patients with gliomas and brain metastases, who require corticosteroids or
             anticonvulsants must be on a stable dose of corticosteroids and seizure free for one
             month prior to enrollment; patients with brain metastasis should have had brain
             irradiation

          -  The effects of STI571 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because STI571 is known to be teratogenic, women
             of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
             or barrier method of birth control) prior to study entry and for the duration of study
             participation; since interaction with STI571 and oral contraceptives is possible, a
             barrier method should be used and oral contraceptives should not be the only method; a
             negative pregnancy test is required prior to starting therapy for women of child
             bearing age; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately

          -  Pregnancy: STI571 may be harmful to the developing fetus; therefore, for patients
             enrolled on the study, contraceptive methods are recommended, and since interactions
             with the metabolism of some oral contraceptives cannot be excluded at present, an
             additional or alternative effective method of contraception, (e.g., barrier method)
             should be used

          -  Breast feeding: STI571 may be harmful to nursing infants secondary to STI571 treatment
             of the mother' breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             STI571

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent form

          -  Patients must be capable of following instructions regarding study medication,
             completion of medication diaries, or have a caregiver who will be responsible for
             administering study medication and completing medication diaries

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to study enrollment (excluding hydroxyurea if
             hydroxyurea was administered to patients with leukemia to maintain a lower WBC count);
             in the case of leukemic patients on maintenance hydroxyurea, patients may not receive
             hydroxyurea within 24 hours prior to initiation of therapy

          -  Patients undergoing therapy with other investigational agents; patients on therapeutic
             doses of warfarin are excluded

          -  Patients who have had liver, kidney, lung transplants or taking FK-506, cyclosporine
             as an immunosuppressive agent; these agents may cause increased toxicity with STI571

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are excluded from this study because STI571 is an agent
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to
             treatment of the mother with STI571, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the
             mother is treated with STI571

          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections,
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible
             pharmacokinetic interactions with STI571

          -  Patients receiving renal dialysis treatments while on the study will be enrolled in
             two cohorts per the schema

          -  Patients must not have had a major surgery (e.g., thoracotomy, intra-abdominal
             surgery) within 14 days prior to registration

          -  Patients with unstable or untreated (irradiated) brain metastases should be excluded
