      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of thyroid cancer by stopping blood flow to the
      tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness thalidomide in treating patients who have
      thyroid cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of thalidomide, in terms of tumor response and duration
           of response, in patients with metastatic follicular, papillary, or medullary thyroid
           carcinoma that is unresponsive to systemic radioiodine.

        -  Compare the differences in antitumor activity of this drug in patients with medullary
           carcinomas vs those with papillary or follicular carcinomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects and duration of toxic effects of this drug in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily for 2 weeks and then twice daily.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.

             carcinoma

          -  Must meet criteria for 1 of the following:

               -  Unresectable, distantly metastatic tumor that does not concentrate radioactive
                  iodine

               -  Follicular or papillary thyroid carcinoma with a large distant tumor burden that
                  has not sufficiently responded to cumulative iodine I 131 doses exceeding 800 mCi

             contraception for male patients for more than 4 weeks prior to, during, and for at
             least 4 weeks after study participation

        PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY:
