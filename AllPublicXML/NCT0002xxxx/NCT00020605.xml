      RATIONALE: Naloxone may be effective in treating constipation that may be caused by opioid
      pain medications such as morphine.

      PURPOSE: Phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of naloxone in relieving constiption
      in patients who are receiving opioids for chronic pain.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Assess the long-term safety and efficacy of oral naloxone in treating
      opioid-induced constipation in patients with chronic malignant or non-malignant pain.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral naloxone twice daily. Each
      patient receives an escalating dose until the minimum effective dose or the maximum dose
      allowed is reached. The minimum effective dose is defined as the dose at which a patient has
      at least 4 bowel movements within 7 days. Patients receive the minimum effective dose for 7
      days and then continue long-term treatment for a maximum of 72 weeks. Patients receiving the
      maximum dose allowed with fewer than 4 bowel movements per week will discontinue study
      therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 600 patients will be accrued for this study.
