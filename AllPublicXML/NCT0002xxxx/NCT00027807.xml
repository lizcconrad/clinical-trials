      RATIONALE: Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop
      cancer cells from growing. Combining different types of biological therapies may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining different biological
      therapies in treating women who have stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of armed activated T cells given in combination
           with interleukin-2 and sargramostim (GM-CSF) in women with stage IV breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response and overall and progression-free survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of armed activated T cells.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) collection. The PBMCs are treated
      ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form armed activated T cells (ATC). The armed ATC
      are expanded for 14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).

      Patients receive armed ATC IV over 30 minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive
      IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) once daily and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC twice weekly beginning 3
      days before the first infusion of armed ATC and continuing until 7 days after the last
      infusion of armed ATC.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of armed ATC until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional
      patients are treated at that dose.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 5 months and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this
      study and a total of 18-33 patients will be accrued for the phase II portion of this study
      within 4-6 years.

      PLEASE NOTE: THIS STUDY WAS INTENDED TO BE A PHASE I/II STUDY, BUT NEVER MOVED FORWARD TO
      PHASE II. (4-22-09)

    <description>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for the generation of ATC will be collected using 1 or 2 phereses to obtain 8-20 × 109 PBMC for T cell expansion. The PBMC will be activated with OKT3 and expanded in IL-2 to generate from 20-320 ×109 ATC during a maximum of 14 days of culture. Three patients will be treated at each dose level. The dose levels for each infusion are: 5, 10, 20, and 40 billion. Each patient will receive a total of 8 doses of armed ATC given twice weekly for 4 weeks. If the patients encounter toxicities related to armed ATC, the dose and administration will be modified as delineated per the protocol. The patients will also receive subcutaneous injections of IL-2 (3.0 × 105 IU/m2/day) starting 3 days before the 1st armed ATC infusion and ending 7 days after the last armed ATC infusion. GM-CSF (250μg/m2 twice per week) will given subcutaneously to start 3 days before the 1st armed ATC infusion and ending 7 days after the last dose of armed ATC.</description>
