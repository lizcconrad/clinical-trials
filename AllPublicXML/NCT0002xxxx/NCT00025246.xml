  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well imatinib mesylate works in treating patients with
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor that was completely removed during surgery. Imatinib mesylate
      may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To ascertain whether patients with completely resected high-risk primary GIST who undergo
      adjuvant treatment with STI571 have prolonged survival compared to historical controls.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 2 and 5-year prevalence of recurrence in patients treated with adjuvant
      STI571 following complete resection of high-risk primary GIST.

      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and at the
      time of recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum specimens
      (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and at the time of
      recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.

      III. To assess the toxicity of oral STI571 therapy when used in the adjuvant setting.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate daily beginning within 84 days of surgical resection.
      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have an ECOG/Zubrod performance status of ≤ 2

          -  Patient must have a diagnosis of high-risk primary GIST; NOTE: High risk is defined as
             tumor size ≥ 10 cm in maximum dimension, or the presence of tumor rupture before or
             during surgery, intraperitoneal hemorrhage or multifocal (&lt; 5) intraperitoneal tumors

          -  Patient must have undergone complete gross resection (includes R0 [negative
             microscopic margins] and R1 [positive microscopic margins] resections) of a primary
             GIST within 70 days prior to registration

          -  Patient must have a histologic diagnosis of GIST that is confirmed by central
             pathology review

          -  Patient's tumor must stain positive for the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase on
             immunohistochemistry as determined by the central pathologist using the Dako (Dako
             Corp., Carpinteria, CA) anti-CD 117 antibody

          -  Patient must have a chest x-ray completed within 28 days prior to registration

          -  Patient must have a post-operative CT scan with IV and PO contrast or MRI with
             contrast (if allergic to CT contrast) of abdomen and pelvis within 28 days prior to
             registration

          -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 times the institution ULN

          -  WBC ≥ 2,000/mm^3

          -  Platelet ≥ 100,000/mm^3

          -  Patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative must provide a signed and
             dated written informed consent prior to registration and any study related procedures

          -  If patient is a cancer survivor, each of the following criteria must apply:

               -  Patient has undergone potentially curative therapy for all prior malignancies,

               -  No evidence of any prior malignancies for at least 5 years with no evidence of
                  recurrence (except for effectively treated basal cell or squamous carcinoma of
                  the skin, carcinoma in-situ of the cervix that has been effectively treated by
                  surgery alone, or lobular carcinoma in-situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral
                  breast treated by surgery alone)

               -  Patient is deemed by their treating physician to be at low risk for recurrence
                  from prior malignancies

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received post-operative chemotherapy

          -  Patient has received post-operative radiation therapy

          -  Patient has received post-operative investigational treatment

          -  Patient has objective evidence of residual disease on the post-operative CT scan or
             MRI of the abdomen or pelvis

          -  Patient, if female and breastfeeding; NOTE: It is not known whether STI571 or its
             metabolites are excreted in human milk; however, in lactating female rats administered
             100 mg/kg, a dose approximately equal to the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day based
             on body surface area, STI571 and/or its metabolites were extensively excreted in milk;
             it is estimated that approximately 1.5% of a maternal dose is excreted into milk,
             which is equivalent to a dose to the infant of 30% the maternal dose per unit body
             weight; because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for
             serious adverse reactions in nursing infants, women should be advised against
             breastfeeding while taking STI571

          -  Patient has New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 cardiac disease

          -  Patient is taking full dose warfarin; NOTE: The use of mini-dose warfarin (1 mg orally
             per day) for prevention of central line-associated deep venous thrombosis is permitted
