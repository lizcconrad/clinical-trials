    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies whether a new kind of blood stem cell (bone marrow) transplant,
      that may be less toxic, is able to treat underlying blood cancer. Stem cells are &quot;seed cells&quot;
      necessary to make blood cells. Researchers want to see if using less radiation and less
      chemotherapy with new immune suppressing drugs will enable a stem cell transplant to work.
      Researchers are hoping to see a mixture of recipient and donor stem cells after transplant.
      This mixture of donor and recipient stem cells is called &quot;mixed-chimerism&quot;. Researchers hope
      to see these donor cells eliminate tumor cells. This is called a &quot;graft-versus-leukemia&quot;
      response.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether stable unrelated peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) grafts can be
      safely established using nonmyeloablative pretransplant conditioning with intensified
      post-grafting immunosuppression and with every (q) 8 hours (hr) and possibly q 6 hr
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) dosing in patients with hematologic malignancies and renal cell
      carcinoma.

      II. To determine if the incidence and severity of acute grades II-IV graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) can be reduced in patients with sustained engraftment with the use of q 8 hr
      MMF dosing.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if engraftment can be maintained in patients with low chimerism and high risk
      of rejection with the use of a single dose of fludarabine (fludarabine phosphate) followed by
      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) on continued MMF/cyclosporine (CSP).

      II. To compare survival and disease free survival to those achieved under protocol 1463.

      OUTLINE:

      REDUCED-INTENSITY CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on
      days -4, -3, and -2 and undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) on day
      0.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclosporine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to
      100 with taper to day 177 and mycophenolate mofetil PO every 8 hours on days 0-40 with taper
      to day 96.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years,
      2 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <measure>Risk of grades II-IV acute GVHD in those patients with sustained engraftment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The goal is to reduce the incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD from 50% to less than 35% in patients with sustained engraftment by increasing the dosing of MMF to every 8 hours. The impact of the enhanced post-grafting immunosuppression on objective measures of GVHD will be described. These include doses and duration of immunosuppression (in particular corticosteroids) and number of GVHD treatment regimens used within the first year. These parameters will be compared to the results of protocol 1463.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of reversing impending graft rejection (less than 40% donor cluster of differentiation [CD]3+ T cell chimerism)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary objective of reversing pending graft rejection with fludarabine phosphate and DLI will be evaluated in the context of overall engraftment. The number of patients given DLI in this context is expected to be small. The response to DLI will be followed and reported in a descriptive manner. The effect of this intervention on adverse outcomes will be followed.</description>
