  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a specially designed head-neck cooling system
      for way lowering the body's central, or core, temperature and cooling the brain. Brain
      cooling has an effect on stopping seizure discharges in the brain as well as the seizures
      themselves. If this system works to cool the brain, a similar study may be tried in patients
      with epilepsy.

      Normal volunteers 21 years of age and older who have no medical or neurological condition and
      do not use any medications may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with
      an interview. Women will have a pregnancy test. Those enrolled will be hospitalized twice for
      overnight stays, with the admissions 2 to 3 days apart.

      Participants will have a medical history, physical and neurological examinations,
      electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (EKG). Then, electrodes will be attached to
      their scalp, forearm and calf to measure temperatures in those locations. Intestinal (core)
      temperature will be measured with a temperature-sensing pill, which will be swallowed
      earlier), and a hand-held infrared thermometer will be used to measure temperatures from the
      ear canal, face, head, arms legs, and abdomen. Electrodes on the scalp will also measure
      changes in blood volume in the brain for a study of brain blood flow. Subjects will be seated
      in a comfortable chair and fitted with the cooling system, a portable unit with a circulating
      coolant. Cooling will last 30 minutes for the first session and 60 minutes for the second.
      Participants will be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each session to track
      temperature changes and have a post-cooling EEG recording.

      The aim of this protocol is to study thermal responses in normal volunteers using a special
      cooling system designed to cool the head and neck. Temperature will be monitored at various
      locations including the scalp, face, mouth, ears (tympanic), arms, legs, and rectum. Previous
      studies indicate that cooling of the brain can be achieved with the head-neck cooling method.
      We hope to derive cooling parameters that will be used in a future study involving patients
      with epilepsy.
