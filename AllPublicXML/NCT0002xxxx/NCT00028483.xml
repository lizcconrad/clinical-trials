      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver
      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with
      monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and monoclonal
      antibody therapy in treating women who have metastatic or recurrent breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the toxicity and safety profile of doxorubicin-monoclonal antibody BR96
           immunoconjugate (SGN-15) and docetaxel in women with metastatic or recurrent breast
           cancer.

        -  Determine the clinical response rate and duration of response of patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin-monoclonal antibody BR96 immunoconjugate (SGN-15) IV
      over 2 hours and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of weeks 1-6. Treatment repeats every
      8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24
      months.
