  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LErafAON is a liposome encapsulated c-raf antisense oligonucleotide. Raf-1 is a protein
      produced by human cells, both normal and cancerous, which may help protect tumor cells from
      radiation. Antisense oligonucleotides are very specific drugs, which can decrease the amount
      of a certain target protein by blocking the gene that makes it. Antisense oligonucleotide to
      raf gene can reduce the amount of Raf-1 protein in tumor cells. Liposomes are tiny globules
      of fat, which can carry drugs in the body. The experimental agent LErafAON is composed of
      liposomes carrying antisense oligonucleotide against the Raf-1 protein. It is hoped that
      decreased Raf-1 in the cancer cells will make them more sensitive to the radiation therapy.

      Patients with advanced solid tumors will receive IV infusions of LErafAON over at least 60
      minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression, patients may continue on
      weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each dose of study
      medication.

      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort
      will be observed for at least ten days after receiving the first dose of treatment before
      additional patients are treated at a higher dose level. Patients will be followed for one
      month after receiving the last dose of study medication. The study will stop when a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity and MTD of LErafAON when given by weekly IV infusion
      for 8 weeks in patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of LErafAON after IV infusion.

      III. Document in vivo inhibition of Raf-1 protein by LErafAON.

      IV. Detect anti-tumor effects of intravenous LErafAON.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a Phase I Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) study for patients with
      recurrent solid tumor malignancies. Study medication will be administered by intravenous
      infusion over at least 60 minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression,
      patients may continue on weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each
      dose of study medication. Patients will be followed for one month after receiving the last
      dose of study medication. Patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or
      Stable Disease (SD) at the Week 8 disease assessment may continue to receive study medication
      until disease progression (PD).

      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort
      will be observed for at least ten days after receiving the first dose of treatment before
      additional patients are treated at a higher dose level. Patients will be followed for one
      month after receiving the last dose of study medication. The study will stop when a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Estimated enrollment is 15-35 patients; 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if
      DLT occurs.

        At least 30 days must have elapsed since receiving an investigational agent, at least 21
        days since receiving any prior chemotherapy, and at least six weeks since receiving
        nitrosourea-containing therapy; patient must have recovered from any related side effects.

        Must have a measurable or evaluable tumor documented within 4 weeks prior to having
        study-related procedures.
