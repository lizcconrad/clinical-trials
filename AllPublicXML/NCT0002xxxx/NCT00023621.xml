      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent the
      development of basal cell carcinoma.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of celecoxib in preventing
      basal cell carcinoma in patients who have basal cell nevus syndrome.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine whether celecoxib prevents the development of basal cell carcinoma in patients
           with basal cell nevus syndrome.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 2 years in
           the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
