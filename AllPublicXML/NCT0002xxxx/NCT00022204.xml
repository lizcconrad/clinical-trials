      RATIONALE: Vitamin E and pentoxifylline may be effective in decreasing lymphedema in women
      who have received radiation therapy for breast cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of combining vitamin E and
      pentoxifylline in treating women who have lymphedema after receiving radiation therapy for
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the effects of vitamin E and pentoxifylline on lymphedema in
      patients previously treated with radiotherapy for breast cancer. II. Compare the normal
      tissue injury and quality of life in patients treated with this regimen vs placebo.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral vitamin E and oral
      pentoxifylline twice daily for 6 months. Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily
      for 6 months. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients
      are followed at 6 and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
