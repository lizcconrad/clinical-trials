      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as melphalan and fludarabine, and a
      monoclonal antibody, such as alemtuzumab, before a donor bone marrow or peripheral blood stem
      cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the
      patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor
      effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine after the transplant may stop this from
      happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fludarabine, melphalan, alemtuzumab, and
      peripheral stem cell transplant work in treating patients with hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Overall survival-12 months

      Overall survival-24 months

      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Matched Related patients-up to 4 months post transplant

      Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease Unrelated and Mismatched related patients- up to 4 months
      post transplant

      Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease Matched Related patients- up to 2 years post transplant

      Chronic Graft-versus-host disease Unrelated and Mismatched related patients- up to 2 years
      post transplant

        -  OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to donor type (HLA-matched related vs
           HLA-matched unrelated, single HLA-allele disparate related, or unmatched)
           (HLA-mismatched related or matched unrelated donor stratum closed to accrual as of
           1/11/06).

      Patients receive a nonmyeloablative regimen comprising alemtuzumab IV over 8 hours on days -8
      to -5, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -8 to -4, and melphalan IV over 30 minutes on
      days -3 and -2. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells or bone marrow is infused on day 0.

      Patients receive graft-versus host disease prophylaxis comprising cyclosporine IV every 12
      hours beginning on day -1 and continuing orally as tolerated until day 100.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 6 months, every 3-6
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter or as clinically indicated.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 HLA-matched related and 25 HLA-mismatched
      related or matched unrelated) will be accrued for this study within 2 years (HLA-mismatched
      related or matched unrelated donor stratum closed to accrual as of 1/11/06).

Cyclosporine will be initiated at least 1 day prior to transplant at a dose of 1.5 mg / kg IV q12h (3 mg / kg / day = total daily dose). Dose will thereafter be adjusted to maintain a trough serum level of 200-300 ng /ml.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Disease criteria: This trial is primarily designed for: 1) patients with relapsed or
             primary refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 2) chemosensitive relapsed or refractory
             acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemias, 3) relapsed or primary refractory Hodgkin's
             Disease, or advanced (Durie-Salmon stage II or III) multiple myeloma, advanced
             Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, who, by virtue of advanced age, intensity of prior
             radiation and/or chemotherapy, history of prior toxicity associated with
             chemo/radiotherapy or existing organ dysfunction, would be at undue risk of regimen
             associated mortality if transplanted according to protocols involving myeloablative
             conditioning regimens.

          -  Patients with aggressive NHL histologies must have chemo/radiosensitive disease, or
             have non-progressive disease, or have stable disease on therapy, and be ineligible for
             an autologous HSC transplant because of disease in the marrow.

          -  Patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and high risk forms of acute myelogenous
             leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes are also eligible in the absence of an
             alternative active higher priority allogeneic transplant protocol for which they are
             eligible.

          -  Age criteria: Patients may be up to 70 years of age. There is no lower age threshold.
             Patients above the age of 70 may also participate, after evaluation and approval by
             the BMT Service attendings.

          -  Absence of active or uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection that would
             contraindicate the use of myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have a healthy HLA-compatible donor, either a matched or single HLA
             allele disparate related donor or a similarly compatible unrelated donor recruited
             through the National Marrow Donor Program. Related donors must be willing to
             participate as research subjects and be willing to receive G-CSF to mobilize PBPC and
             undergo leukapheresis to donate PBSC. Unrelated donors identified by the NMDP may
             elect to donate either PBSC after treatment with G-CSF, or bone marrow. These
             unrelated donors will provide informed consent and their PBSC or bone marrow donations
             will be obtained at a qualified donor center participating in the NMDP.

          -  Each patient must be willing to participate as a research subject and must sign an
             informed consent form after discussion of the nature and risks of the study prior to
             entering the protocol. Parents or legal guardians of patients who are minors will sign
             the consent form for these patients after discussion of the nature and risks of the
             study.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Active or uncontrolled viral (including HIV-1), bacterial or fungal infection.

          -  Severe renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;2.0 or creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/minute)

          -  Severe hepatic dysfunction, as defined by: total bilirubin greater than 2.5 mg/dL and
             AST and ALT &gt;3xnl, unless the liver is involved with disease.

          -  Severe cardiac insufficiency, defined as a resting left ventricular ejection of less
             than 30% as measured by echocardiography or radionuclide cardiac angiography. Patients
             on cardiac medications for congestive heart failure are eligible, as long as their
             LVEF is greater than 30% on medication.

          -  Severe pulmonary insufficiency, as defined by an adjusted diffusing capacity of less
             than 40% of predicted value.

          -  Karnofsky or Lansky score &lt;40%
