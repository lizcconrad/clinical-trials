  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, an epidemic of pulmonary disease has been recognized among workers in a popcorn
      factory in Jasper, Missouri. The exposure agent has not yet been identified, but suspects
      include butter flavoring and the powdered salt used in the mixing room. This disease
      resembles &quot;Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome&quot;, an illness that makes it difficult to breathe.
      Of the 117 workers studied, one year later, 25 subjects whom were working in the mixing room
      or in the microwave packaging area have had decreases in lung function seven times the norm
      for their age. Industrial hygiene experts revealed that dust concentrations of salt and other
      flavorings were much higher in the mixing room compared to the office and outdoor work areas.
      Recently, rats were exposed to vapors created by heating the butter flavor compound obtained
      from this plant. Six-hour exposure to vapors at very high concentration resulted in
      significant damage to the breathing apparatus. Thus, there is clinical, epidemiological, and
      animal toxicity data that appears to implicate some constituent present during the mixing of
      the butter flavoring, salt, and oil causing a form of obstructive airway disease that has
      been rapidly progressive in a number of workers. It is not clear what the pathophysiologic
      nature of this entity is, though it resembles Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome. It is not
      known what the long term consequence of this will be on the active workers, nor is it clear
      whether preventive measures taken to reduce exposures in the mixing room and elsewhere in the
      plant are going to be effective.
