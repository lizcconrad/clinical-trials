      RATIONALE: Exisulind may be effective in preventing the development and growth of polyps in
      patients who have familial adenomatous polyposis.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to determine the effectiveness of exisulind in
      preventing the development and growth of polyps in patients who have familial adenomatous
      polyposis.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the ability of exisulind to inhibit growth and development of duodenal
           adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.

        -  Determine the effect on apoptosis in polyp vs mucosal tissue in these patients when
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral exisulind 4 times daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 4 times daily. Treatment continues for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
