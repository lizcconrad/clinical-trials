      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of using Iodine-131
      Anti-B1 Antibody for the treatment of patients with large B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)
      who have achieved a response following 6-8 cycles of CHOP therapy.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the incidence of Grade IV hematologic toxicity following
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody consolidation for patients with diffuse large B-cell NHL who
      achieved a response (PR, CRu, CR) following first-line CHOP chemotherapy. The secondary
      efficacy endpoints are to determine the complete response rate, duration of response,
      duration of complete response, progression-free survival, and time to treatment failure. The
      pharmacokinetic endpoint is to determine the total body residence time following the
      dosimetric dose. The secondary safety endpoints are to determine the incidence of adverse
      experiences, hematologic toxicity (e.g., nadir, time to nadir, and time to recovery), use of
      supportive care, percent of patients converting to human anti-murine antibody (HAMA)
      positivity, and survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of de novo diffuse
             large B-cell NHL according to the REAL classification. This includes the intermediate
             grade International Working Formulation subtypes of diffuse, mixed small cell and
             large cell; diffuse large cell; follicular large cell; mantle cell, and large cell
             immunoblastic.

          -  Patients must have had Ann Arbor, stage III or stage IV, or bulky Stage II disease at
             diagnosis.

          -  Patients must be less than or equal to 80 years of age with any IPI score.

          -  Patients must have less than an average of 25% of the intratrabecular marrow space
             involved by NHL in bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens as assessed microscopically
             at study entry. A unilateral bone marrow biopsy demonstrating &lt;10% involvement with
             NHL is also adequate. Verification of bone marrow status must be performed at the time
             of response evaluation following CHOP chemotherapy and within 56 days of study
             enrollment.

          -  Patients must have been treated with 6 or more cycles of first-line CHOP chemotherapy
             and have achieved a PR, CRu, or CR. Patients must have available computed tomography
             (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, and a bone marrow biopsy that were
             performed within 56 days prior to the start of CHOP. In addition, they must have
             written documentation (i.e., copies of original medical notes and radiographic
             reports) describing the pre-CHOP staging evaluation, the number of cycles of CHOP
             administered, the dose of each agent, the start and stop dates of each cycle, and the
             post-CHOP response evaluation. The post-CHOP response evaluation must include a CT
             scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (gallium scan is optional). For patients who
             have palpable cervical lymphadenopathy, a CT scan of the neck must be performed
             following CHOP chemotherapy. The CHOP chemotherapy should consist of standard doses of
             each agent, although dose-reduction is permitted. CHOP cycle delay is also permitted.

          -  The patient must be enrolled within 56 days of the first day of the last cycle of CHOP
             chemotherapy and within 35 days following response evaluation after CHOP chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have evidence that their tumor tissue expresses the CD20 antigen.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of at least 60% on the Karnofsky Performance
             Scale and an anticipated survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients must have an ANC greater than or equal to 1500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count
             greater than or equal to 100,000 cells/mm3 within 14 days of study enrollment. These
             blood counts must be sustained without support of hematopoietic cytokines or
             transfusion of blood products.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine &lt;1.5 times the
             upper limit of normal) and hepatic function (defined as total bilirubin less than or
             equal to 2.0 times the upper limit of normal and AST &lt;5 times the upper limit of
             normal) within 20 days of study enrollment.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must undergo a negative serum pregnancy test within
             14 days prior to study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received prior chemotherapy other than first-line CHOP. Patients
             must not have been treated with radiation, or biological therapy prior to or after
             CHOP chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with active bilateral obstructive hydronephrosis.

          -  Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease or other
             serious illness that would preclude evaluation.

          -  Patients with prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease-free for 5 years. Patients who have been disease-free of another cancer for
             greater than 5 years must be carefully assessed at the time of study enrollment to
             rule out recurrent disease.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  Patients who are HAMA positive.

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases at any time since diagnosis.

          -  Patients with active infection requiring IV anti-infectives at the time of study
             enrollment.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Males and females must agree to use a
             contraceptive method from enrollment to 6 months after receiving Iodine-131 Anti-B1
             Antibody.
