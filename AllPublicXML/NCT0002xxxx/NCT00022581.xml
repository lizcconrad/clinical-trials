      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thalidomide may stop the growth of
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by stopping blood flow to the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the response rate and time-to-progression (TTP) in previously treated patients
      with low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with thalidomide.

      II. To evaluate the effect of thalidomide on microvascular density in the bone marrow of
      patients with low grade cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      III. To evaluate the effects of thalidomide on bFGF levels in serum and urine.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; core biopsies are acceptable if they
             contain adequate tissue for primary diagnosis and immunophenotyping; bone marrow
             biopsies as the sole means of diagnosis are not acceptable for follicular lymphomas;
             patients with NHL must have one of the following World Health Organization (WHO)
             histologic subtypes:

               -  Follicular, grade 1

               -  Follicular, grade 2

               -  Follicular, grade 3

               -  B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma

               -  Note: Patients diagnosed more than one year prior to entry on protocol must have
                  a repeat lymph node biopsy; in the event of rapid tumor growth, rising LDH, or
                  the onset of B symptoms in a period of time less than one year a rebiopsy is also
                  required; patients are ineligible for this study if a separate lymph node biopsy
                  shows a lymphoma with a higher grade; failure to submit pathology slides within
                  60 days of patient registration will result in patient being declared ineligible

          -  No known lymphomatous involvement of the CNS including either parenchymal or
             leptomeningeal involvement (lumbar puncture prior to study is not required in the
             absence of neurologic symptoms) or any seizure disorders or prior brain injury which
             could precipitate seizures

          -  Measurable disease must be present either on physical examination or imaging studies;
             evaluable disease alone is not acceptable; any tumor mass reproducibly measurable in
             two perpendicular diameters and &gt; 1x1 cm by physical examination, X-ray, computerized
             tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acceptable; whenever CT is
             specified, it should be understood that MRI may be substituted as long as the
             measurements for tumor response are made on two successive studies employing the same
             procedure; the following lesions are not considered measurable:

               -  Barium studies

               -  Ascites or pleural effusion

               -  Bony disease (lesions if present should be noted)

               -  Bone marrow

          -  Patients must have received no more than 3 prior chemotherapy regimens and no more
             than 2 prior antibody treatments; patients who have failed to respond to 3 regimens of
             prior chemotherapy (i.e., refractory to 3 regimens) are not eligible

          -  NCI CTC performance status of 0 or 1

          -  Pregnant and nursing women are not eligible for treatment on this protocol; women of
             childbearing potential must agree to abstain from all intercourse or use two methods
             of birth control for 28 days prior to treatment and while under treatment with
             thalidomide and for four weeks after completing therapy; one of the methods of birth
             control must be highly active (IUD, hormonal, tubal ligation or partner's vasectomy)
             and used concomitantly with one additional method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm or
             cervical cap); these precautions are required even in patients with a history of
             infertility unless due to hysterectomy or because the patient has been post menopausal
             or has had no menses for at least 24 consecutive months; in addition, women of
             childbearing potential must have serum B-HCG performed prior to treatment, weekly for
             the first 4 weeks of treatment and then every four weeks if menses are regular and
             every two weeks if menses are irregular; men must agree to abstain from unprotected
             sexual intercourse; male patients should request that female partners use a second
             method of birth control in addition to the male barrier method

          -  No known HIV disease; patients with a history of intravenous drug abuse or any other
             behavior associated with an increased risk of HIV infection should be tested for
             exposure to the HIV virus; because peripheral neuropathies are a common toxicity of
             antiviral therapy and of viral infection in HIV patients, as well as a common
             significant toxicity with thalidomide, patients who test positive or who are known to
             be infected are not eligible; an HIV test is not required for entry on protocol, but
             is required if the patient is perceived to be at risk

          -  No peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1

          -  Patients requiring the use of bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronic acid) are not
             eligible; patients who receive thalidomide in combination with zoledronic acid are
             potentially at increased risk of renal dysfunction; patients enrolled on study prior
             to 15 September 2003 who are receiving bisphosphonates may continue to receive
             thalidomide and bisphosphonate but must have serum creatinine monitored prior to each
             bisphonate infusion; in addition, please inform these patients of the potential for
             renal dysfunction with this combination; this discussion must be documented in the
             patient record

          -  ANC â¥ 750/Î¼L

          -  Î²HCG negative (in female patients unless S/P hysterectomy or menopausal or no menses
             for 24 consecutive months); assay must have a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL

          -  Creatinine â¤ 2 x normal

          -  Bilirubin â¤ within institutional normal limits

          -  AST and ALT â¤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal
