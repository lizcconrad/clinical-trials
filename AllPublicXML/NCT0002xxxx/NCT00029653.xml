      This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate how the brain
      controls movement by sending messages to the spinal cord and muscles.

      Healthy normal volunteers 21 years of age or older may participate in this study.

      They must have no medical, neurological or psychiatric illnesses nor have been taking
      medications that affect nervous system function.

      Participants will undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation. For this procedure, an insulated
      wire coil is placed on the scalp or skin. A brief electrical current is passed through the
      coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. If the coil is placed over a nerve
      or area of the brain that controls muscles, it may cause a muscle twitch, possibly strong
      enough to move the limb. In other cases, the subject may have a feeling of movement or feel a
      tingling sensation in a limb. Stimulation over the muscles on the side of the head may cause
      some discomfort in that area or twitching of the jaw.

      During the stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform
      other simple actions. The electrical activity of the muscles activated by the stimulation
      will be recorded using metal electrodes taped to the skin over the muscle. In most cases, the
      study takes less than 3 hours.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS) on free will to select movement. There have been debates that most of human
      voluntary movements are reflexive rather than volitional in nature, although most people feel
      that their movements are freely chosen. This issue is illuminated by previous TMS studies
      showing external bias of freely chosen movements by TMS. Recently, we tried to confirm these
      observations using a more reliable method with subthreshold TMS, but failed. Thus, in this
      study, we are planning to use suprathreshold TMS to test whether this type of stimulation on
      different motor areas influences free selection of movements or not.

        Normal adult volunteers who are 21 years or older will be eligible.

        Volunteers who have either any medico-surgical, neurological and psychiatric illnesses, who
        have been taking any medication with potential influence on nervous system function, who
        have a pacemaker, an implanted medical pump, a metal plate or a metal object in the skull
        or eye (for example, after brain surgery), or who have a history of seizure disorder, will
        be excluded.
