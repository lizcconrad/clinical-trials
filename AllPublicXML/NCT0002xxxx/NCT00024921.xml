  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney disease in diabetes (diabetic nephropathy) tends to run in families. It is likely,
      therefore, that there are genes that predict or are associated with either getting or not
      getting diabetic nephropathy. The GoKinD Study will provide clinical information and DNA for
      investigators to look for these genes. Evaluation will be performed and DNA obtained from
      approximately 1100 diabetic persons with kidney disease and 1000 diabetic persons without
      kidney disease. In some cases, samples for DNA will also be obtained from the parents of
      these subjects. Clinical information and DNA will be coded so that individuals cannot be
      identified, but the DNA can be linked to the clinical data from the individual. Multiple
      investigators will be able to use this genetic material to test hypotheses about the genetics
      of kidney disease in diabetes.
