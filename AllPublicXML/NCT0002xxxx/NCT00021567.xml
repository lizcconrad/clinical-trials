      This study will test the safety and effectiveness of inhaled interferon gamma-1b and oral
      antibiotics for treating mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection of the lungs.

      Patients 18 years of age or older with MAC infection of the lungs who 1) have been previously
      treated for MAC, or 2) have moderate or severe lung disease due to MAC that has not been
      previously treated may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Group 1 will receive
      500 micrograms of interferon gamma-1b 3 times a week for 48 weeks by inhalation. Group 2 will
      inhale a placebo (inactive substance) according to the same regimen. In addition, all
      patients will receive standard MAC treatment with three antibiotics-clarithromycin or
      azithromycin, ethambutol and rifampin or rifabutin-taken by mouth times a week.

      Patients will come to the clinic for a screening visit, baseline visit, 1 month after
      beginning treatment, and at 3-month intervals thereafter until the end of the study. During
      these various visits, they will undergo the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination, including height and weight measurements,
           heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure and temperature

        -  Possibly computed tomography (CT) and X-ray of the lungs

        -  Sputum sample

        -  Pulmonary function studies

        -  Blood and urine tests

      Patients' eyes will be examined monthly to check for side effects of ethambutol, and hearing
      and balance will be tested to check for side effects of clarithromycin or azithromycin.

      At the baseline visit, the patient or caretaker will be trained to use a nebulizer (a special
      breathing device) to take the study medication.

    <textblock>
      Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are a
      growing problem among older Americans, especially women. These organisms are relatively
      resistant to antituberculous medications and frequently persist or recur. In patients with
      disseminated infections, interferon gamma has been shown to be a critical cytokine in the
      resistance to and therapy of these infections. Previous experience with injected interferon
      gamma has been relatively disappointing, with clinical response rates in conventional
      therapy-refractory patients of about 20%. Aerosol administration of interferon gamma has been
      shown to rapidly convert sputum smears to negative in multidrug resistant tuberculosis and in
      one case of MAC infection. However, in these short-term experiments, cultures have remained
      positive and patients have had clinical relapse. In addition, aerosol administration of
      interferon gamma has significantly less systemic activation and side effects than does
      systemic administration. Therefore, we propose to administer interferon gamma by aerosol into
      the lungs of patients with MAC infection that has persisted despite adequate conventional
      therapy. This aerosol will be delivered 3 times weekly by the patient. This trial is
      randomized and double blinded. The period of therapy is 48 weeks and the follow up is another
      48 weeks. All patients must be on conventional therapy at the same time and have organisms
      that are macrolide sensitive. Screening and treatment will be conducted at the NIH Clinical
      Center as well as multiple collaborative sites. This study should clarify the therapeutic
      role for aerosolized interferon gamma in the treatment of nontuberculous mycobacterial
      infections.
