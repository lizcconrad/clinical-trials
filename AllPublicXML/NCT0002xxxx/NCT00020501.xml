      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug and giving them in different ways may
      kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is most effective for
      colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy
      with or without isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan in treating patients who have
      colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the disease-free and overall survival of patients with unresectable colorectal
           cancer metastatic to the liver treated with regional and systemic chemotherapy with or
           without isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan.

        -  Compare the response rate and duration of response in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the patterns of recurrence (liver vs systemic) in patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare the health-related quality of life (QOL) of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine whether baseline QOL correlates with length of survival of patients treated
           with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      for liver metastasis (yes vs no) and percentage of hepatic replacement (less than 25% vs at
      least 25%). All patients undergo laparotomy to determine final eligibility. Eligible patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo hyperthermic isolated hepatic perfusion with melphalan over 60
           minutes. Patients then undergo placement of an intrahepatic pump or port. At 6 weeks
           post hepatic perfusion, patients receive systemic chemotherapy comprising irinotecan IV
           over 90 minutes on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV over 15 minutes and leucovorin
           calcium (CF) IV over 15 minutes on days 1-3. Patients receive local chemotherapy
           comprising floxuridine (FUDR) and CF by hepatic arterial infusion (HAI) continuously on
           days 14-28.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo placement of an intrahepatic pump or port at laparotomy. At 7
           days post laparotomy, patients receive FUDR and CF by HAI continuously for 14 days.
           Beginning 2 weeks after completion of HAI, patients receive systemic and local
           chemotherapy as in arm I.

      Treatment with combined systemic and local chemotherapy repeats every 35 days for a maximum
      of 6 courses. Treatment with local chemotherapy alone repeats every 28 days for a maximum of
      6 additional courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, postoperatively, every third course of chemotherapy,
      every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 168 patients (84 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 54 months.
