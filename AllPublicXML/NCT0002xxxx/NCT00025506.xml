  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well thalidomide works in treating patients with
      carcinosarcoma of the uterus that has come back or that does not go to remission (decrease or
      disappear but may still be in the body) despite treatment. Thalidomide may stop the growth of
      cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.

      OBJECTIVES: Primary I. Determine the antitumor cytostatic activity of thalidomide, as
      measured by the probability of progression-free survival (PFS) for at least 6 months, in
      patients with recurrent or persistent uterine carcinosarcoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary I. Determine the partial and complete response rates in patients treated with this
      drug.

      II. Determine the duration of PFS and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      III. Determine the effect of this drug on initial performance status and histological grade
      in these patients.

      IV. Correlate serum and plasma biomarkers, including vascular endothelial growth factor and
      basic fibroblast growth factor, with clinical outcome (i.e., PFS) in patients treated with
      this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.

    <description>Progression is defined according to RECIST v1.0 as at least a 20% increase in the sum of LD target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since study entry, the appearance of one or more new lesions, death due to disease without prior objective documentation of progression, global deterioration in health status attributable to the disease requiring a change in therapy without objective evidence of progression, or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tumor Response</measure>
    <time_frame>For those patients whose disease can be evaluated by physical examination, response was assessed prior to each 28-day cycle. CT scan or MRI if used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle. (average = 4 months)</time_frame>
    <description>RECIST 1.0 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>

        <title>Tumor Response</title>
        <description>RECIST 1.0 defines complete response as the disappearance of all target lesions and non-target lesions and no evidence of new lesions documented by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart. Partial response is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest dimensions (LD) of all target measurable lesions taking as reference the baseline sum of LD. There can be no unequivocal progression of non-target lesions and no new lesions. Documentation by two disease assessments at least 4 weeks apart is required. In the case where the ONLY target lesion is a solitary pelvic mass measured by physical exam, which is not radiographically measurable, a 50% decrease in the LD is required. These patients will have their response classified according to the definitions stated above. Complete and partial responses are included in the objective tumor response rate.</description>
        <time_frame>For those patients whose disease can be evaluated by physical examination, response was assessed prior to each 28-day cycle. CT scan or MRI if used to follow lesion for measurable disease every other cycle. (average = 4 months)</time_frame>
