      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating patients who have metastatic
      malignant melanoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the progression-free survival at 18 weeks and overall survival of patients with
      metastatic malignant melanoma treated with PS-341.

      II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Correlate
      p27 levels in tumor tissue with objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2 years after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma

          -  Measurable disease defined as at least one lesion whose longest diameter can be
             accurately measured as &gt;= 2.0 cm

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1500/uL

          -  PLT &gt;= 100,000/uL

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 2.5 x institutional upper normal limit (UNL)

          -  AST =&lt; 2.5 x UNL

          -  Creatinine =&lt; 1.5 x UNL or calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 for
             patients with creatinine levels &gt; 1.5 x UNL using the Cockcroft-Gault formula

          -  Life expectancy of &gt;= 3 months

          -  ECOG performance status 0 or 1

          -  Capable of understanding the investigational nature, potential risks and benefits of
             the study and willing to sign the written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any of the following:

               -  Any prior chemotherapy

               -  Immunotherapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Biologic therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Radiation therapy =&lt; 4 weeks prior to study entry

               -  Failure to fully recover from adverse effects of prior therapies regardless of
                  interval since last treatment

               -  Other concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or any other therapy
                  or supportive care considered investigational

          -  Known brain metastases requiring active treatment; NOTE: these patients are excluded
             from this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often
             develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of
             neurologic and other adverse events

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to PS-341

             with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy; these patients are excluded from the study because of
             possible pharmacokinetic interactions with PS-341; appropriate studies will be
             undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated

                  implants, intrauterine device [IUD], abstinence, etc.)

               -  NOTE: this study involves an investigational agent whose genotoxic, mutagenic and
                  teratogenic effects on the developing fetus and newborn are unknown

          -  Only non-measurable disease, including lesions not clearly measurable in one
             dimension, small lesions (longest diameter &lt; 20 mm), and truly non-measurable lesions,
