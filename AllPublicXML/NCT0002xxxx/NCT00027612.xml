      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage
      tumor cells. Irinotecan may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of irinotecan given together with
      radiation therapy followed by irinotecan and carmustine and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with newly-diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of adjuvant irinotecan when administered concurrently with
           radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme.

        -  Determine survival of patients treated with this regimen followed by irinotecan and
           carmustine.

        -  Assess the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine whether the dose of irinotecan chosen produces radiosensitizing plasma
           concentrations of SN-38 in these patients.

        -  Assess individual variation in responses (toxicity and/or activity), pharmacokinetic
           parameters, and/or biological correlates due to genetic differences in enzymes involved
           in transport, metabolism, and/or mechanism of action of irinotecan in these patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study of irinotecan. Patients are stratified
      according to receipt of concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants (EIACs) (yes vs no).

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 3/5/2005): Patients receive carmustine IV over 2 hours
           on day 1 of courses 2-5 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes (beginning immediately after
           carmustine infusion) on days 1, 8, 22, and 29 of courses 1-5. Patients also undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks concurrently with course 1 only. Treatment
           repeats every 6 weeks for 5 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the recommended dose for
      phase II is determined. The recommended dose for phase II is defined as the dose at which no
      more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

    <description>Phase II (patients receiving concurrent EIACs or non-EIACs open to accrual as of 3/5/2005): Patients receive irinotecan at the recommended dose, carmustine, and cranial irradiation as in phase I.
Patients with disease progression are followed every 3 months for 5 years and then annually for up to 10 years.
Patients taken off study for reasons other than disease progression are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually for 5 years.</description>
