      This study will evaluate immune function in people with a known or suspected immune disorder.
      It will determine participants immune response to vaccines by measuring blood antibody levels
      after vaccination.

      Patients enrolled in a NIH protocol involving immune reconstitution (bone marrow
      transplantation or gene therapy) for a known or suspected primary immune disorder may be
      eligible for this study.

      Participants may be asked to have more than one vaccine, based on their age, use of IVIG,
      past immunization history and underlying immune problem. The possible vaccinations include:

      Rabies vaccine

      Diphtheria and tetanus booster

      23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine

      Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine

      The diphtheria, tetanus, pneumococcus and rabies vaccines are approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and used routinely to protect against disease.

      Study participants will have a blood sample drawn before vaccination. The number of
      additional samples collected will vary according to the vaccines administered; 1 for rabies;
      1 for tetanus; and 1 to 2 for the pneumococcal vaccines. Each sample will be up to 5
      teaspoonfuls. Participation in the study may last up to a year, depending on the blood
      sampling scheduling

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immune responses to vaccines in subjects (both
      children and adults) with known or suspected primary immune disorders. We intend to
      characterize immune responsiveness to standard, well characterized antigens (vaccines) in
      subjects with primary immune disorders, and/or in subjects who have received treatments to
      correct their primary immune disorders. This will be an open label, prospective study
      investigating the functional status of the adaptive immune system. Up to 50 subjects may be
      enrolled. It is anticipated that subjects will be referred by any investigators at NIH
      studying inherited disorders of the immune system under their own protocols.

      After giving standard vaccines, we will test specific antibody. The vaccines include licensed
      and universally mandated diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, two licensed pneumococcal vaccine
      formulations recommended for protection of children from pneumonia, and rabies vaccine
      licensed in 1997 (not the formerly available reaction-prone formulation). We will obtain
      peripheral blood samples from subjects before vaccination and at a specific time intervals
      after vaccination. Measurement of specific antibody titers will be conducted by the
      immunology laboratory at the Department of Laboratory Medicin at the NIH. Subjects may be
      offered one or more of the vaccines based on available information about their exposure
      history and their immune status, and the vaccines may be offered sequentially or in
      combination to shorten study time.

      While the vaccines used here are often medically indicated and given outside of research
      protocols both to provide protection and to assess immune responses, the investigators have
      elected to use a protocol for the following reasons:

        -  Enhancement of subject understanding of the use of vaccines for in vivo assessment of
           immune responses.

        -  Emphasis on the importance of obtaining pre- and post-immunization blood samples to
           monitor how well the body's immune system is working.

        -  Administration of rabies vaccine to subjects who would not ordinarily need it.

        -  Recognition that vaccine side effects have been widely publicized and may be of concern
           to potential enrollees.

        Individuals being evaluated by NIH investigators for known or suspected primary immune
        disorders.

        Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal
        or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for at least 21 days prior to receipt of
        each vaccine and for the duration of study participation.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Documented HIV infection.

        Platelet count less than 40,000/microL or other coagulation disorder.

        Any other major illness that, in the investigator's judgment, may substantially increase
        the risk associated with the patient's participation in this study.

        History of previous systemic reaction to the particular vaccine product being considered
        for administration.
