  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Because people infected with HIV strains that are resistant to anti-HIV drugs have fewer
      effective treatment options, selecting an effective anti-HIV drug combination is difficult. A
      combination of protease inhibitors (PIs), when added to a patient's current anti-HIV therapy,
      may decrease viral load and increase drug activity. Tests that measure drug levels in the
      blood and tests to evaluate the drug resistance of HIV may also be helpful in choosing the
      best anti-HIV drug combination for a patient. This study will determine whether using these
      tests to choose a drug combination and adding PIs to that combination will improve the
      patient's response to anti-HIV therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment options are limited for HIV infected individuals who have extensive treatment
      experience and harbor resistance to antiretrovirals (ARVs) from multiple drug classes.
      Increasing the concentration of PIs in a regimen may be one way to provide more substantial
      ARV activity. It is uncertain how combining specific PIs with RTV affects viral
      susceptibility and ARV effect. The relationship of PI concentration (e.g., Cmin) to virus
      susceptibility (IC50) may be a better predictor of treatment outcome than susceptibility
      alone. This study will evaluate the predictive value of pharmacokinetic-adjusted phenotypic
      susceptibility (C12h/IC50) on ARV response to ritonavir (RTV)-boosted regimens in patients
      failing their current PI-containing regimens.

      Participants will have blood drawn during a screening visit for phenotypic assay and to
      determine viral load. At study entry, participants will discontinue their PIs while
      continuing to take their other ARVs. Each participant and his or her doctor will choose to
      add one of three RTV-boosted regimens: 1) indinavir (IDV) and RTV; 2) fosamprenavir (FPV) and
      RTV; or 3) lopinavir (LPV)/RTV plus additional RTV. Participants will take this regimen for
      14 days. On Day 14, patients will have a 12-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation. On Day 15,
      patients will add tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) to their regimens and may choose to
      modify their other ARVs while continuing their RTV-boosted therapy. Participants will have
      additional study visits at Weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24. Study visits will include a physical exam
      and blood and urine tests. Participants will complete adherence questionnaires four times
      during the course of the study.
