      This study will determine whether a stepwise increase of the drug infliximab (RemicadeÂ®
      (Registered Trademark)) controls juvenile rheumatoid arthritis more effectively than a fixed
      dose. It will look at the safety and effectiveness of increasing the dose to a maximum of
      15mg/kg body weight per dose, examining the drug's effect on bone and cartilage, and whether
      it can improve abnormal growth, metabolism and hormones. Infliximab is approved for treating
      adults with rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

      Children between 4 and 17 years of age with active juvenile rheumatoid arthritis who do not
      respond adequately to standard therapy may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will receive nine infusions of infliximab during this 62-week study. The drug is
      given intravenously (IV, into a vein) over 2 hours. The first three infusions will be at a
      dose of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Children who improve on this regimen will receive another 6
      infusions at the same dose. Children who do not significantly improve on 5 mg/kg at the end
      of 6 weeks (the third infusion) may continue with phase 2 of the study, in which they will be
      randomly assigned to receive either: 1) 6 additional doses of the drug at 5 mg/kg per dose,
      or 2) a gradually increased dose to a maximum of 15 mg/kg. In addition, all children will
      continue to take methotrexate at the same dose as when they entered the study.

      Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center 12 times (about every 8 weeks) during the
      study for the following tests and procedures:

        -  History and physical examination, including a complete joint exam

        -  Puberty assessment - breast development in girls, testicle size in boys, and pubic hair

        -  Height and weight measurements

      Children will have imaging studies (x-rays, MRI and Dexa scan) at the beginning and end of
      the study and will collect a 24-hour urine sample before each infliximab infusion.

      Patients may elect to have an endocrine evaluation. This involves Clinical Center
      hospitalizations for 1-1/2 days on visits 1, 4 and 12. Small amounts of blood will be drawn
      every 20 minutes (through an indwelling catheter to avoid multiple needle sticks) for 8 hours
      while the child sleeps. The blood will be examined for the normal rhythm of growth hormone
      and other substances in the body and how they are affected by arthritis.

      Participants will complete a questionnaire once a year for 2 years to provide information on
      their health status and any problems that might be related to the study drug.

    <textblock>
      Infliximab, a murine chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against TNF-alpha has recently
      been licensed for the treatment of adult patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
      A double blind placebo controlled trial in children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA)
      using a single dose fixed infusion regimen is currently ongoing. This dose finding study is
      designed to determine whether a clinically guided intravenous (iv) infusion regimen allowing
      for intra-patient dose escalation is superior in achieving a 70% clinical response to fixed
      dose administration of infliximab in children with a polyarticular course of JRA. We will
      model the pharmacokinetic profile in both phases of the study. We plan to enroll a maximum of
      48 patients to allow for 36 patients to be randomized into the two treatment arms. In the
      first phase of the study all patients will receive a fixed dose of 5mg/kg/dose for a total of
      3 infusions over 6 weeks (weeks 0, 2, 6). In the second phase at week 14, patients who have
      not achieved a 70% improvement will be randomized at a 2:1 ratio to either receive
      intra-patient dose escalation capped at 15mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks or continue to receive
      5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks in a blinded fashion. After 6 additional IV doses, patients will
      again be evaluated clinically, radiographically and serologically for clinical response.
      Patients who achieved a 70% response by week 14 will be kept on 5mg/kg/dose every 8 weeks for
      the trial duration of 62 weeks, but will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis. We
      also plan to evaluate patients endocrinologically and metabolically to determine the effect
      of TNF blockade on these systems.
