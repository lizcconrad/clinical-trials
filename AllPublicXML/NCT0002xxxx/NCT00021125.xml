      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. It is not yet
      known which regimen of radiation therapy is more effective for head and neck cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of different regimens of
      radiation therapy in treating patients who have head and neck cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare adjuvant continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy vs conventional
           radiotherapy, in terms of preventing disease recurrence, in patients with head and neck
           cancer.

        -  Compare the early and late toxic effects of these treatments in this patient population.

        -  Compare disease-free and overall survival of patients receiving these treatments.

        -  Assess quality of life in patients receiving these treatments.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy 3 times daily, with an interval of at least 6 hours
           between any 2 treatments, 5 days a week, for just over 2 weeks, for a total of 13-14
           treatment days.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6-6.5 weeks. Quality of
           life is assessed at baseline and then annually for 5 years.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients (230 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2-3 years.
