  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood levels of the hormones estradiol and progesterone are of interest in evaluating ovarian
      function. However, because these hormone levels vary from day to day, blood samples must be
      taken very often or elaborately timed to specific phases of the menstrual cycle. A method has
      now been developed for measuring estradiol and progesterone levels in saliva. This study will
      test the accuracy of this method and examine whether salivary levels of these hormones change
      after treatment with raloxifene.

      Hormone levels will be measured during 3 menstrual cycles in women currently enrolled in the
      clinical study, &quot;A Phase II Trial of Two Doses of Raloxifene in Women at Risk of Developing
      Invasive Breast Cancer.&quot; Participants will provide a saliva sample every morning for about a
      month during three collection periods-1 month before beginning raloxifene treatment, and 3
      and 12 months after treatment starts. Patients will be given kits for collecting the samples
      and mailing them to the laboratory at the end of each collection period.

      Deviations from normal levels of serum E(2) and P are of interest in evaluating ovarian
      function. However, the day-to-day variations in these levels necessitates serial blood
      sampling or elaborate efforts to time blood draws within specific phases of the menstrual
      cycle. A noninvasive method for assessment of the levels of sex steroids on a daily basis
      using saliva has been developed. This study will assess the levels of estradiol and
      progesterone during 3 menstrual cycles (pre-drug and after 3 and 12 months of raloxifene
      therapy) in pre-menopausal women participating in a pilot chemoprevention trial of
      raloxifene.
