      This is a randomized trial to determine if echinacea is effective in shortening the length
      and/or lessening the severity of colds in children 2 through 11 years old.

      Upper respiratory tract infections (URI's) are a significant health burden in childhood.
      URI's are a major reason for visits to health care providers, and up to 35 percent of young
      children at any given time are taking some over-the-counter cold medication. Unfortunately,
      data suggest that most of these medications have limited effectiveness. Alternative medical
      therapies are growing in popularity; in a recent survey of parents of children being seen by
      pediatricians in Seattle, Washington, 24.2 percent indicated that their child had been seen
      by an alternative medicine health care provider, and 53.3 percent received therapies for the
      treatment of URI's in children. The proposed study is a randomized, double blind, placebo
      controlled trial of Echinacea for the treatment of URI's in children 2-11 years old. The aims
      of the project are: to determine if Echinacea shortens the duration and/or lessens the
      severity of URI's, if children receiving Echinacea for treatment of URI's have a reduced rate
      of secondary bacterial infections, and to determine if the use of Echinacea in patients 2-11
      years old is associated with any significant side effects. A two-year study of 600 children
      is planned. Not only will the results of this study determine if Echinacea, the most popular
      medicinal herb sold in the United States, is an effective therapy for URI's in children, the
      study will provide a design framework for further assessment on the efficacy of other
      complementary and alternative medicines in children.
