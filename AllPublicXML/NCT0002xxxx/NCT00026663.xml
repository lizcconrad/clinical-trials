    <textblock>
      This study will examine blood, bone marrow, tumor and tissue samples from patients with
      cancer to study tumor resistance to chemotherapy (drug treatment). Many patients with cancer
      improve initially with chemotherapy, but then have a disease relapse, after which their tumor
      no longer responds to treatment. Other patients tumors are drug-resistant from the start. The
      study will look for &quot;resistance factors&quot; substances in blood and tissues that render tumors
      resistant to chemotherapy. The findings may provide information needed to develop methods of
      combating drug resistance.

      Patients with cancer who are 18 years or older may be eligible for this study. Participants
      will have 40 milliliters (3 tablespoons) of blood drawn at the beginning of the study;
      additional samples will be obtained periodically during the course of treatment. A small
      sample of tumor or normal tissue will be taken from patients who undergo surgery or tumor
      biopsy (removal of a small piece of tumor) for medical reasons or as part of a research
      treatment protocol. Patients who do not require surgery or biopsy may be asked permission to
      obtain a tumor sample. Depending on the location of the tumor, this may be done by: 1)
      withdrawing bone marrow through a small needle; 2) removing fluid from the chest or abdomen;
      3) removing a small tumor sample through a needle; or 4) removing the sample with a small
      incision into or around the tumor. These procedures will be done only if they are of low risk
      to the patient.

      Background:

      Ongoing research in the Experimental and Molecular Therapeutics Sections, NCI, requires the
      availability of blood, serum, tumor, hair follicle and tissue samples from patients with
      cancer.

      Resistance is the underlying cause of treatment failure, and may present as acquired or
      intrinsic drug resistance. Patients with cancer frequently present with
      chemotherapy-responsive disease, and undergo tumor response, only to eventually experience
      relapse, at which time the tumor may be refractory to further treatment. This is termed
      acquired drug resistance; while intrinsic resistance implies a cancer that is refractory from
      the outset. Diverse mechanisms of drug resistance have been described and are often dependent
      upon the particular drug under study.

      Objectives:

      To obtain blood, serum, tumor, hair follicle or normal tissue samples that would allow
      development of assays for use in subsequent clinical trials

      Eligibility:

      Patients with a prior diagnosis of malignancy, with advanced or refractory cancer will be
      evaluated in the Medical Oncology Clinic, NCI.

      Blood samples or hair follicle samples may be collected at the initial visit, and at follow
      up visits.

      Tumor samples may be obtained by fine needle aspirate, by removal of pleural or peritoneal
      fluid, or by excisional biopsy, providing the tumor is accessible with a minimal risk to the
      patient.

      Patients may be on, or in the process of being evaluated for a research protocol.

      Patients may receive treatment on the standard care protocol.

      Normal volunteers may enroll in the study for collection of blood or hair follicle samples.

      Design:

      Acquired samples will be recorded in the computerized data bank currently existing in the
      Molecular Therapeutics Section. No germline testing will be performed on any of the samples
      collected. Tests will be pilot studies relating to the Section s work on the biology of drug
      resistance and cell survival in cancer. If any research tests are considered to be themselves
      of more than minimal risk to the patient, separate permission will be requested from the IRB
      to perform that test, and a new consent will be obtained.

      Examples of the types of studies to be performed with biopsies will be drug resistance gene
      expression assays, with the goal of demonstrating the utility of the assay in patient
      samples.

      Evaluation of methods to detect drug resistance proteins and genes will be explored,
      including Northern blot, immunoblot, polymerase chain reaction assay, and RNA in situ
      hybridization. With whole blood, we may evaluate the presence of dye transport in an ex vivo
      assay, for example, using inhibitors of ABCG2. Evidence of drug accumulation or DNA damage
      may be sought in patient mononuclear cells or in hair follicle samples.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients 18 years of age and older are eligible.

               2. Patients must have a performance status of ECOG 0, 1, 2, or 3 for admission to
                  this protocol.

               3. Patients with malignancy are eligible.

               4. Patients requiring a surgical procedure for any medical indication can be
                  included on study.

               5. Patients requiring biopsy or any procedure for any medical indication can be
                  included on study.

               6. Patients not requiring biopsy for a medical indication can be included on the
                  study solely for the purpose of obtaining research samples, including blood,
                  pleural fluid, or peritoneal fluid, or biopsy samples, providing the biopsy or
                  aspiration procedure is of minimal risk, i.e. fine needle aspirate, bone marrow
                  aspirate, or excisional biopsy. No radiology tests will be used in the procedure
                  to collect a sample that would not be otherwise used for an appropriate medical
                  indication.

               7. Normal volunteers 18 years of age and older are eligible to enroll. Normal
                  volunteers must be willing to sign informed consent and must be willing to
                  provide samples to be used for research.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Pregnant individuals will not be eligible due to potential risks to the fetus
             associated with radiologic procedures required for biopsy.

          2. Children will not be eligible because of potential risks from complications due to
             procedures involved in obtaining the biopsies.

          3. Normal volunteers with a history of a clotting disorder may not enroll.
