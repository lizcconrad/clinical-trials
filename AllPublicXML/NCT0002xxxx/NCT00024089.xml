  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gefitinib in treating patients who have
      recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck cancer. Biological therapies such as gefitinib may
      interfere with the growth of tumor cells by blocking an enzyme necessary for cell growth.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the disease control rate, in terms of complete response, partial response, and
      stable disease for at least 4 months, in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous
      cell cancer of the head and neck treated with gefitinib.

      II. Determine the effect of this drug on epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation and
      expression of selected genes in these patients.

      III. Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified as delineated in the Disease Characteristics.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib daily. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
