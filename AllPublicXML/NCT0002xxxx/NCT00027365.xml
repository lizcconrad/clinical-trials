  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if the investigational vaccines NefTat and gp120w61d are
      safe and tolerable in humans and to see how the immune system responds to the vaccines.

      There have been advances in the treatment and prevention of HIV, but the spread of HIV/AIDS
      is getting worse. HIV/AIDS is the main infectious cause of death in the world. A vaccine to
      prevent HIV disease is the best way to try to deal with this situation. Several vaccine
      products have been tested, but only 2 are still in trial. There is a need for a new product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in the treatment and prevention of HIV disease, the epidemic is
      worsening throughout most of the world. HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan
      Africa and the leading infectious cause of death in the world. An effective and inexpensive
      vaccine to prevent HIV disease remains as the best option to try to deal with this expanding
      epidemic. A number of vaccine products have been tested; however, only 2 have progressed to a
      Phase III trial, underscoring the need for new vaccine strategies.

      Prior to study entry, participants have their risk status for HIV infection determined by a
      series of questions. Further eligibility is determined by results of physical exam,
      laboratory tests, and further questions. Blood is drawn on each study visit. Participants are
      assigned randomly to 1 of 4 study groups:

      Group I: NefTat or placebo. Groups II, III, and IV: NefTat and gp120 or placebo. Each group
      receives a different concentration of gp120.

      All immunizations are admixed with AS02A adjuvant. Vaccinations are administered
      intramuscularly at 3 time points (entry, 1 month, and 3 months). Product safety and
      immunogenicity are performed at designated time points; participants have about 11 clinic
      visits.
