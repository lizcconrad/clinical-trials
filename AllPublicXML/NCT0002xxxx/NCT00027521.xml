      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Electroporation therapy may enhance the ability of chemotherapy
      drugs to enter tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy with electroporation therapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of electroporation therapy and bleomycin in
      treating patients who have locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety and surgical feasibility of electroporation therapy with
      bleomycin in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the overall and
      progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bleomycin intratumorally during laparotomy. Approximately 15
      minutes after the intratumoral injection, patients receive bleomycin IV over 10 minutes.
      Approximately 5 minutes after the IV injection, patients undergo electroporation therapy
      comprising electrical pulses directly to the pancreas and surrounding tissues. Patients are
      followed weekly for 4-6 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18 months.
