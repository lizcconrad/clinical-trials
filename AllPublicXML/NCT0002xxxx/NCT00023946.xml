    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of BMS-247550 in treating patients who have liver
      or gallbladder cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from
      dividing so they stop growing or die.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with hepatobiliary cancer treated with
      BMS-247550.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the duration of
      response, median and overall survival, and time to progression in patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for at
      least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression
