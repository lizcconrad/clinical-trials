  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Butadiene is a suspect human carcinogen to which most people are exposed daily. Exposures are
      difficult to measure by air sampling. This study examines the relationship between air levels
      and several biomarkers of exposure. Biomarkers are substances analyzed in human tissues or
      waste products. Adducts are materials formed when a chemical reacts with a biological
      material. In this study we are looking at biomarkers in the blood: hemoglobin and DNA
      adducts, and urinary metabolites. If a strong relationship is found then the amounts of
      biomarkers in a person's blood or urine can tell us how much they have been exposed. The
      tests are being conducted on petrochemical workers who have a wide range of exposures to
      butadiene. An international group of investigators is conducting the study.
