      RATIONALE: Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were
      destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of allogeneic peripheral stem cell
      transplantation in treating patients who have stage IV breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the ability of T-cell-depleted allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation
           after an immunoablative conditioning regimen to induce a state of mixed host/donor
           chimerism in patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the ability of this treatment regimen to induce an allogeneic
           graft-versus-tumor response in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of giving other approved therapies to these patients at the
           first sign of disease progression in order to stabilize or produce a minimal or partial
           response.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive chemotherapy comprising fludarabine IV over 30 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SC daily
      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days
      for a maximum of 2 courses.

      Patients receive a transplantation preparative regimen comprising fludarabine IV over 30
      minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3 (beginning on day 22 of
      immune-depleting chemotherapy) followed by allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      transplantation IV on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC daily beginning on day 0 and
      continuing until blood counts recover, plus cyclosporine IV over 1-2 hours every 12 hours on
      days -1 to 14 and then orally until day 40.

      Patients with persistent malignant disease and less than grade II acute graft-versus-host
      disease receive donor lymphocytes IV on days 42, 70, and 98.

      Patients are followed twice weekly until day 100, and then at 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months.
