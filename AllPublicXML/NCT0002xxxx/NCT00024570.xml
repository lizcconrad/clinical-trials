  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IL13-PE38QQR is an oncology drug product consisting of IL13 (interleukin-13) and PE38QQR (a
      bacteria toxin). IL3-PE38QQR is a protein that exhibits cell killing activity against a
      variety of IL13 receptor-positive tumor cell lines indicating that it may show a therapeutic
      benefit. In reciprocal competition experiments, the interaction between IL13-PE38QQR and the
      IL13 receptors was shown to be highly specific for human glioma cells.

      IL13-PE38QQR will be infused in two courses of 96 hours each, eight weeks apart, directly
      into the malignant brain tumors of patients to determine the dose of drug these patients can
      tolerate. After that, the selected dose will be studied to give an estimate of the response
      rate, response duration, time to response, and survival after infusing that dose of
      IL13-PE38QQR into the recurrent malignant glioma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of IL13-PE38QQR delivered by
      continuous infusion into malignant glioma over 96 hours, in two courses eight weeks apart.

      II. Estimate the response rate, response duration, time to response, and survival after
      interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR into recurrent malignant glioma.

      III. Describe the toxicities of interstitial infusion of IL13-PE38QQR at the selected dose.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: Patients are expected to receive two IL13-PE38QQR infusions at 8-week
      intervals. For each course, drug will be infused through each of two catheters; infusion rate
      will be held constant during a 96-hour infusion.

      In Phase I, the dose of IL13-PE38QQR will be increased by increasing the IL13-PE38QQR
      concentration in stepwise fashion, while holding infusion volume and duration constant. Three
      patients will be treated at each dose level until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      reached, and an additional three patients are treated at that level. In Phase II, patients
      will be treated at the selected MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: In Phase I, up to 30 patients will be treated. In Phase II, up to 35
      patients will be treated.

        Disease Characteristics

          -  Must have had surgery (or biopsy) of a supratentorial brain tumor with pathologic
             diagnosis of malignant (grade 3 or 4) glioma, including anaplastic astrocytoma,
             glioblastoma multiforme and malignant mixed oligoastrocytoma. (Note: If diagnosis is
             dependent upon the Day 0 biopsy, pathology must be confirmed prior to start of
             IL13PE-38QQR infusion).

          -  Must have received cranial radiotherapy, with tumor dose of at least 48 Gy, completed
             at least 12 weeks prior to study entry.

          -  Must have radiographic evidence of recurrent or progressive supratentorial tumor
             compared with a previous study. The baseline tumor measurements must be determined
             within 2 weeks prior to study entry. The tumor must have a solid portion at least 1.0
             cm but not more than 5.0 cm in maximum diameter. A maximum of one satellite lesion is
             permitted, if separated by less than 3 cm from the primary mass.

          -  Stereotaxic biopsy at study entry must confirm the presence of glioma.

        Patient Characteristics

             Bilirubin not more than 2.0 mg/dL.
