      Tipifarnib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for their
      growth. Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of tipifarnib in treating older patients
      who have previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete response rate of R115777 (tipifarnib) in previously untreated
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in (a) elderly patients (age &gt;= 75) and (b) patients (age &gt;= 65)
      with AML preceded by myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), using a chronic dosing schedule.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free and overall survival in patients with previously untreated
      AML treated with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.

      II. To determine the duration of response in patients with previously untreated AML treated
      with R115777, using a chronic dosing schedule.

      III. To determine the effect of R115777 on the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein
      kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha
      (PI3K) in leukemic cells.

      IV. To determine the effect of R115777 on processing of the farnesylated protein HDJ-2.

      V. To determine the toxicities of R115777 when given in a chronic dosing schedule.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Patients with a complete or
      partial response, hematologic improvement, or stable disease continue treatment every 29-63
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete
      response after the second course of therapy receive 2 additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study within 11-17
      months.
