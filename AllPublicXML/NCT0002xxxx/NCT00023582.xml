  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide biomedical and behavioral information that is
      necessary for planning and starting HIV prevention trials in Lima, Peru.

      The occurrence of HIV is high among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Lima, Peru, and
      bacterial sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HSV-2 (genital herpes) are very prevalent
      in HIV-positive and -negative MSM there. Methods to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently
      needed among MSM in Peru. The information gained from this study is very important for future
      HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will take place in Peru.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV incidence is high among MSM in Lima, Peru, and bacterial sexually transmitted diseases
      (STDs) and HSV-2 are prevalent in both recently and chronically HIV-infected MSM as well as
      HIV-uninfected MSM. Bisexual HIV-infected MSM could be an important &quot;bridge&quot; transmitting HIV
      and other STDs to women. Interventions to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently needed among
      MSM in Peru. Given these associations and the high prevalence of STDs among MSM in Lima,
      prevention of HIV infections is dependent partially on innovative methods to control
      bacterial and viral STDs among high-risk HIV-uninfected MSM. The data from this prevention
      preparedness study is critical for future HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will be
      conducted in Peru.

      All MSM are counseled and tested for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis at the screening visit. [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 07/23/02: The syphilis test results are provided at screening, whereas the HIV and
      HSV-2 test results are provided at the enrollment visit.] High-risk HIV-uninfected MSM in
      Lima, Peru, are enrolled. Men are interviewed about risk behaviors in the past 6 months.
      Trained counselors provide risk-reduction counseling according to locally accepted standards.
      Men are followed at 3-month intervals for 1 year to determine the incidence of and risk
      factors for prevalent and incident HIV and HSV-2, and to evaluate the effectiveness of
      retention strategies. In the baseline questionnaire, 2 additional modules address sexual
      networks and willingness to participate in HIV vaccine or prevention trials, including an
      acyclovir trial. Study data are collected and entered into a local database.
