      This study will examine the underlying mental processes that determine how people understand
      social behavior, remember information, and think. Language, planning, problem solving,
      reasoning, social behavior, and memory are the critical parts of cognition that make up daily
      life. This study will explore the association between performance on various experimental
      tasks and day-to-day functioning.

      Healthy normal volunteers and patients with certain kinds of brain damage (primarily focal or
      degenerative lesions of the human prefrontal cortex) or psychiatric disorders may be eligible
      for this study. Candidates with central nervous system trauma, disease or dysfunction will be
      screened with a routine neurological examination and history.

      Participants may be asked to complete written tests, sit in front of a computer monitor and
      press a key to indicate a decision about what appears on the screen (for example, whether a
      statement is accurate) and answer questions from a test examiner. A skin conductance response
      (SCR) test may be done along with some of the cognitive tests. SCR uses electrodes (pieces of
      metal attached to wires) placed on the fingers to measure the subject's emotional reaction to
      a test. Participants may also do an evoked response test, in which the subject watches words
      or scenes on a TV screen while his or her responses are recorded from electrodes placed on
      the scalp (similar to an electroencephalogram). The tests will be scheduled for an average of
      one session a week, with each session lasting from 30 minutes to 3 hours. Generally, 15
      sessions will be scheduled over a 1-year period. Special arrangements will be made to
      accommodate participants from out-of-town.

      Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain. This test uses
      radio waves and a strong magnetic field to picture structural and chemical changes in tissue.
      For the procedure, the subject lies on a table in a space enclosed by a metal cylinder (the
      scanner) for about 1 hour.

      In addition, some study subjects will be invited to participate in a training study designed
      to improve their planning or social behavior. Participation requires coming to NIH daily over
      a 1- to 2-month period for 1 to 2 hours each visit.

      The purpose of this protocol is to test a comprehensive model of the underlying knowledge
      representations stored in the human prefrontal cortex developed by the principal
      investigator. Utilizing a variety of standardized and experimental neuropsychological tasks
      and techniques, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral
      prefrontal cortex in planning, problem-solving, and reasoning and the ventromedial prefrontal
      cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will ascertain the relationship
      between so-called &quot;cold&quot; cognitive processes such as planning and &quot;hot&quot; social processes such
      as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the prefrontal cortex. Besides
      cognitive paradigms, we will use skin conductance and event-related EEG recording techniques
      when subjects are performing selected cognitive tasks in order to determine the relationship
      between autonomic and central nervous system markers of emotional modulation and
      speed/duration of processing and task performance. The data we collect in this protocol will
      be of value in 1) Developing a model of the forms of knowledge representation stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex; 2) Developing outcome measures for drug and behavioral treatments
      for disorders of prefrontal cortex functions; and, 3) Developing biologically plausible
      computer models of the cognitive sub-components stored in the human prefrontal cortex that
      compose the complex skills referred to above.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Controls: Healthy normal controls matched to specific patient groups for age, education,
        gender, and race to be recruited by advertisement from the community or from among friends
        and relatives of the patient. Individuals with a neurological or psychiatric history or
        medical condition that would compromise our interpretation of the test results will not be
        included.

        Patients: Patients will be selected from referrals to the Cognitive Neuroscience Section,
        the NIH Clinical Center, and from referrals recruited through approved advertisement in
        appropriate media and medical journals.

        All patients must have a diagnosed CNS disorder with lesions localization (when suspected)
        verified by CT or MRI scanning available from the referring physician or completed at the
        NIH Clinical Center. Subjects without neurological, neuropsychological, and imaging
        evidence compatible with one of the recruited diagnoses will be excluded from the study as
        will subjects who cannot cooperate with neuropsychological testing (based on family report
        and the report of the referring healthcare professional).

        The bulk of the patients recruited for this protocol will have focal or degenerative
        lesions of the HPFC. We also will recruit patients with non-frontal lesions in order to
        determine the specificity of the deficit we observe in patients with HPFC lesions. These
        patients will undergo the same testing but are not expected to have marked cognitive
        deficits on tests of frontal lobe function.

        Patients with different basal ganglia disorders or limbic system lesions are included
        because their lesions involve differing subsets of subcortical structures that are thought
        to play an important role in the automatic activation of stored plans and social behavior.
        Another prediction from the SEC model is that patients with basal ganglia disorders will
        have deficits primarily on over-learned components of tasks that require visuomotor
        interaction (e.g., a visuomotor serial reaction time task) but have spared performance on
        higher level cognitive planning tasks that don't require simple visuomotor responses.

        The bulk of the patients will be patients with focal penetrating head injuries who will be
        seen here at the NIH as part of a newly funded study to be conducted primarily, but not
        solely, at the National Naval Medical Center. Patients with dementing disorders (e.g.,
        frontotemporal dementia) are suitable for assessment of the structure of knowledge, and in
        particular, the systematic general breakdown of social and non-social SEC knowledge
        representation. Patients with focal lesions (e.g., dorsolateral frontal) will be studied to
        assess damage to specific sub-components of the structured event complex model.
        Occasionally, single cases will be intensively studied due to a unique behavioral
        presentation (see above for a lengthier description).

        A durable power of attorney will be appointed if the patient is unable to make decisions
        about any or all aspects of this protocol. In the past in our protocols, this has almost
        always been the spouse.

        The age range of the brain-damaged patients will be determined on entrance into the
        protocol. An equal number of left and right unilateral lesions will be sought for
        determination of laterality differences. Patients with lesions limited to (rather than
        simply including) the frontal lobe will also be especially sought.

        Minors (ages 6-17) are included in this protocol in order to examine 3 specific questions:
        (1) What is the distinction in retrievable SEC knowledge (e.g., plans or social rules)
        learned prior to adolescence from that subsequent to adolescence?; (2) Does learning and
        development of all aspects of social cognition require an intact prefrontal cortex?; and
        (3) Will some effects of early prefrontal cortex lesions only appear after the age of 14?
        The first question will be addressed by studying healthy normal children before the age of
        14 on experimental social cognition and planning tasks slightly modified from those used
        with adults (see the six studies described above). The second question will be addressed by
        studying single cases and groups of children with prefrontal cortex lesions on social
        cognition tasks before and after the age of 14. The third question will be addressed by
        studying children with prefrontal cortex lesions incurred before the age of 14 both before
        and after the age of 14 on social cognition, meta-cognition, and planning tasks.
