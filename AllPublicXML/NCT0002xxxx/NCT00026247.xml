      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation may be effective in decreasing pain from bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in decreasing
      pain in patients who have bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the side effects of radiofrequency ablation in patients with bone metastases.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on pain in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this regimen on mood in these patients.

        -  Determine the effects of narcotic usage in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the relationship between laboratory and imaging features of this treatment and
           the effects of the treatment in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation directly to the metastatic
      lesion over approximately 12 minutes.

      Pain and mood are assessed at baseline, daily for 14 days after treatment, and at 1 and 3
      months after treatment.

      Patients are followed at 1 week and then at 1 and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 75 patients will be accrued for this study within 12.5
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant disease with a bone lesion that
             appears to be metastatic disease by clinical and/or imaging techniques

          -  Persistent intractable pain from a solitary site of bone metastases (greater than 5 on
             pain scale of 0-10)

          -  Bone metastasis must be amenable to radiofrequency ablation using a percutaneous
             CT-guided approach

          -  Bone metastasis must be no greater than 8 cm

          -  No tumor mass in contact with hollow viscera

          -  No primary musculoskeletal malignancies, lymphoma, or leukemia
