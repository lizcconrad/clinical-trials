      This study will test the safety, side effects and antiviral activity of different doses of
      tenofovir DF in children and adolescents with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
      Tenofovir DF belongs to a group of drugs called nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase
      inhibitors. These drugs prevent the virus from replicating (making more copies of itself).

      HIV becomes resistant to many drugs used to fight the virus and these drugs become
      ineffective. In laboratory tests, tenofovir DF has remained effective against HIV longer than
      other anti-HIV medicines, and when resistance does develop, the virus may still be sensitive
      to other drugs.

      HIV-infected children between the ages of 4 and 18 years who weigh at least 10 kg (22 pounds)
      may be eligible for this study. They must be able to receive antiretroviral therapy and have
      completed at least two previous antiretroviral courses of treatment without benefit.

      Upon entering the study, participants will have physical, eye and neuropsychiatric
      examinations, blood tests, including tests to determine what anti-HIV drugs the patient is
      resistant to, an echocardiogram (echo), electrocardiogram (EKG), chest X-ray, head CT scan,
      skin tests, and special tests to examine the bones. These physical exams and tests will be
      repeated throughout the study to determine changes in health.

      Participants will continue their current anti-HIV therapy for 2 weeks and then stop all
      medicines for a 1-week 'washout' period. After the washout period, patients will begin taking
      tenofovir DF. For the first 2 days on the drug, a small blood sample (1/2 teaspoon) will be
      collected 11 times over a 48-hour period through. A heparin lock (a tube kept in place in a
      vein) may be put in place to avoid multiple needle sticks. Blood samples will be collected
      for another 4 days to measure how well tenofovir DF alone works against HIV before other
      drugs are added to the treatment regimen. After these first 6 days, at least two other
      anti-HIV drugs will be added. They will be selected based on the results of the earlier blood
      tests for resistance and on the child's medication history.

      After 3 days of combination therapy, patients will continue therapy on an outpatient basis.
      They will be seen in the clinic every 4 weeks at the start of the study and then every 12
      weeks for physical exams, lab tests and other procedures as needed. The study will last
      approximately 48 weeks. Patients who benefit from therapy may be able to continue to receive
      tenofovir DF from the drug company sponsor or as part of another study, or the protocol for
      this study may be amended to lengthen the treatment period.

      This is a pediatric phase I study to determine a biologically active dose and to obtain
      information concerning the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of tenofovir disoproxil
      fumarate (TDF, (9 - [(R)-2[[bis [[isopropoxycarbonyl) oxy] methoxy] phosphinyl]
      -methoxy]propyl] adenine fumarate (1:1)), formerly known as PMPA prodrug, a potent nucleotide
      analogue HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor, that demonstrates antiviral activity
      against most NRTI-resistant HIV-1. In addition to obtaining needed biological activity,
      pediatric safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, the study will utilize tenofovir
      DF's potent antiretroviral activity and novel resistance mutation pattern, together with
      serial measurements of plasma HIV viral load, T-cell flow cytometry, and genotypic and
      phenotypic viral resistance analysis to conduct pilot studies in pediatric HIV pathogenesis,
      the response to antiretroviral therapy and to develop strategies to optimize the management
      of pediatric antiretroviral therapy. We will also use initial viral decay dynamics and other
      patient characteristics to model prediction for the long-term response to antiretroviral
      therapy. We will enroll children who have become refractory to or have experienced toxicity
      on prior antiretroviral therapy. Initial viral genotyping and phenotyping will be performed
      on the failing regimen, and this data will be used to create the most effective combination
      regimen with tenofovir DF. After an initial 6 days of tenofovir DF monotherapy, patients will
      receive tenofovir DF in combination with the optimal antiretroviral therapy as determined by
      their baseline viral resistance mutation pattern and history. The patients will be followed
      for at least 96 weeks to assess long-term tolerability and toxicity, and to assess the
      clinical, virological, and immunological response to tenofovir DF.
