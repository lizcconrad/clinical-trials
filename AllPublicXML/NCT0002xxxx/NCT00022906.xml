    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proper dose, effectiveness, and safety of using
      Iodine-131 Anti-B1 Antibody for the treatment of patients with previously treated
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who have greater than 25% bone marrow involvement with lymphoma.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of Iodine-131 Anti B-1
      Antibody in patients with previously treated NHL having more than 25% bone marrow involvement
      with lymphoma. Secondary endpoints include assessment of response rate, duration of response,
      relapse-free survival, time to treatment failure, safety, and survival.

      The dose escalation will be started at 45cGy and will be escalated in 10cGy increments until
      the maximum tolerated dose in reached.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed initial diagnosis of low-grade
             non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma according to International Working Formulation (i.e.,
             small lymphocytic [with or without plasmacytoid differentiation]; follicular small
             cleaved, or follicular, mixed small cleaved and large cell), or low-grade lymphoma
             that has transformed to a higher grade histology, or de novo follicular large cell
             lymphoma.

          -  Patients must have Ann Arbor Stage IV disease and greater than an average of 25% of
             the intratrabecular marrow space involved by NHL in bilateral bone marrow biopsy
             specimens as assessed microscopically at study entry. A unilateral bone marrow biopsy
             demonstrating greater than 50% involvement with NHL is also adequate for study entry.

          -  Patients must have been previously treated with chemotherapy and progressed on, failed
             to achieve an objective response on, or progressed after completion of their last
             chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have evidence that their tumor tissue expresses the CD20 antigen.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of at least 60% on the Karnofsky Performance
             Scale and an anticipated survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Patients must have an ANC greater than 1500 cells/mm3 and a platelet count greater
             than or equal to 150,000 cells/mm3 within 14 days of study entry. These blood counts
             must be sustained without support of hematopoietic cytokines or transfusion of blood
             products.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function (defined as serum creatinine less than 1.5
             times the upper limit of normal) and hepatic function (defined as total bilirubin less
             than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and AST less than 5 times the upper limit of
             normal) within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Patients must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease. At least one lesion must be
             greater than or equal to 2 x 2 cm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active obstructive hydronephrosis.

          -  Patients with New York Heart Association class III or IV heart disease or other
             serious illness that would preclude evaluation.

          -  Patients with prior malignancy other than lymphoma, except for adequately treated skin
             cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the patient has been
             disease-free for 5 years. Patients who have been disease-free of another cancer for
             greater than 5 years must be carefully assessed at the time of study entry to rule out
             recurrent disease.

          -  Patients with known HIV infection.

          -  Patients who are HAMA positive.

          -  Patients with known brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

          -  Patients who have undergone therapy with either stem cell or bone marrow transplant.

          -  Patients who have received cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, or cytokine
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to study entry (6 weeks for nitrosourea compounds). The
             use of systemic steroids must be discontinued at least 1 week prior to study entry.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients of childbearing potential must
             undergo a serum pregnancy test within 7 days prior to study entry. Males and females
             must agree to use effective contraception for 6 months following the
             radioimmunotherapy dose.

          -  Patients with progressive disease within 1 year of irradiation arising in a field that
             has been previously irradiated with more than 3500 cGy.

          -  Patients who are concurrently receiving either approved or non-approved (through
             another protocol) anti-cancer drugs or biologics.

          -  Patients with active infection requiring IV anti-infectives at the time of study
             entry.

          -  Patients who have previously received radioimmunotherapy.

          -  Patients with de novo intermediate- or high-grade NHL, except for intermediate subtype
             of follicular large cell NHL.
