      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention therapy is the use of certain drugs to try to prevent the
      development or recurrence of cancer. The use of celecoxib may be an effective way to prevent
      actinic keratoses.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to determine the effectiveness of celecoxib in
      preventing skin cancer in patients who have actinic keratoses.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare celecoxib vs placebo in terms of preventing the development of new actinic
           keratoses in patients with actinic keratoses.

        -  Compare these treatment regimens in terms of inducing regression of actinic keratoses in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the effect of these treatment regimens on potential surrogate end-point
           biomarkers in areas of actinic keratosis, sun-exposed skin, and non-sun-exposed skin and
           correlate these biomarkers with clinical outcome in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily for 9 months in the absence of
           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo as in arm I. Patients are followed at 2 months
           after completing treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
