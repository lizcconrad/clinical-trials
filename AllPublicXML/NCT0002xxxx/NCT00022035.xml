      RATIONALE: Flu vaccine may help the body build an immune response and decrease the occurrence
      of flu in children who are receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in preventing flu in
      children who have acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the immune response, in terms of the formation of protective antibody titers
           to influenza, in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with split-virus
           trivalent influenza vaccine.

        -  Correlate the formation of protective antibody titers following immunization with the
           absolute neutrophil counts and absolute lymphocyte counts in these patients at the time
           of vaccination.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to current treatment
      for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (consolidation chemotherapy vs maintenance chemotherapy vs
      off therapy for the past 6 months).

      Patients receive split-virus trivalent influenza vaccine intramuscularly once or twice at 4
      weeks apart for 2 doses.

      Patients are followed at week 5. Patients receiving 2 doses of vaccine are also followed at
      week 9.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 175 patients (50 receiving consolidation therapy, 75 receiving
      maintenance therapy, and 50 off therapy) will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
