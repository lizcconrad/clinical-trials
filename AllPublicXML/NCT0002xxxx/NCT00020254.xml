      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from prostate cancer cells may make the body build an immune
      response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase
      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Interleukin-2 may
      stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill prostate cancer cells. Androgens can stimulate
      the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using nilutamide may fight prostate
      cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It is not yet known which treatment regimen
      is more effective for treating prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus
      sargramostim and interleukin-2 with that of nilutamide alone in treating patients who have
      prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the difference in time to radiographic evidence of disease progression at 6
           months in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer when treated with vaccine
           containing recombinant vaccinia-prostate-specific antigen (PSA) admixed with rV-B7.1
           plus recombinant fowlpox-PSA vaccine, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and interleukin-2 vs
           nilutamide alone.

        -  Evaluate the vaccination therapy in relation to the change in T-cell precursor frequency
           and to the rise of serum PSA in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to HLA-A2 typing
      (positive vs negative). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccine containing recombinant vaccinia-prostate-specific
           antigen (PSA) and rV-B7.1 subcutaneously (SC) on day 2 only. Beginning on day 30,
           patients receive recombinant fowlpox-PSA vaccine SC every 4 weeks for 12 vaccinations
           and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily
           on days 1-4 and interleukin-2 SC daily on days 8-12 with each vaccination.

      Patients without disease progression after 12 courses receive the vaccine regimen every 12
      weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral nilutamide daily. Treatment continues in both arms for at
           least 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After 6 months of therapy, patients with a rising PSA and no radiographic evidence of disease
      progression may receive therapy in the other arm in addition to the therapy to which they
      were randomized.

      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56-78 patients (28-39 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 1.5-2 years.
