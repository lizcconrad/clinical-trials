      RATIONALE: PS-341 may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking the enzymes necessary for
      cancer cell growth.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of PS-341 in treating women who have
      metastatic breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the objective tumor response in women with metastatic breast cancer treated
           with bortezomib.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds twice weekly for 2 weeks. Treatment
      repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-24
      months.
