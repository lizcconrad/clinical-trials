  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the brain operates during execution and control of voluntary
      movement and what goes wrong with these processes in disease. It will use
      electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) to compare brain function in normal
      subjects and in patients with-a disorder affecting patients with stroke and other brain
      lesions. These patients have problems with timing, sequence and spatial organization of
      certain types of movements.

      EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain. The activity is recorded using wire
      electrodes attached to the scalp or mounted on a Lycra cap placed on the head. EMG measures
      electrical activity from muscles. It uses wire electrodes placed on the skin over the
      muscles.

      Adult healthy normal volunteers and patients with ideomotor apraxia with a single left brain
      lesion may be eligible for this study.

      Study participants will be asked to make certain movements with their arms or hands, such as
      waving and using scissors. Brain and muscle activity will be measured during these tasks with
      EEG and EMG recordings. Patients may be asked to repeat these tests over time as their
      condition changes (such as during recovery from a stroke) to gain information about the
      recovery process.

    <textblock>
      Ideomotor apraxia is a disorder affecting patients with stroke and a variety of other brain
      lesions. The disorder involves problematic timing, sequence, and spatial organization of
      gestured movements. As a result, patients suffer from incorrect temporal and spatial
      components to movements as evidenced during pantomime of transitive and intransitive
      movements. The errors can be seen in left and right hemisphere damaged patients during
      intransitive movements, but lesions predominate in the left hemisphere for inability to
      pantomime transitive movements. Thus far, damage to parietofrontal circuits has been
      implicated in significantly contributing to this disorder. These circuits, which pave the way
      for sensorimotor processing, are of clear interest in the nature of praxis.

      In the present study, we plan to evaluate further the parietofrontal circuits in these
      patients. Using EEG, we will analyze the movement related cortical potentials (MRCP) in these
      patients compared to controls to evaluate any cortical planning differences. We will analyze
      how the circuits play a role in transitive and intransitive movements in normal subjects and
      patients with Ideomotor apraxia. Each patient will make a series of movement during 64
      channel EEG and EMG recordings. Following recordings, analysis will be made of the event
      related desynchronization (ERD) and the MRCP. Further analysis will look at the activation of
      the parietofrontal circuitry in patients using correlation and coherence methods. For the
      same purposes, MEG studies will be performed to assess similar measures.

        We will study normal volunteers and patient groups between the ages of 18-80 years of age
        within the following parameters:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Normal subjects.

        Patients diagnosed with Ideomotor apraxia with a single left hemisphere lesion.

        Patients with Ideomotor apraxia with corticobasal ganglionic degeneration.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Normal subjects: abnormal neurologic examination or history of neurologic disorders.

        Ideomotor apraxic patients: a second neurologic disorder including more than one brain
        lesion or the inability to cooperate fully.

        Normal and Ideomotor apraxic patients: cognitively impaired subjects will not be accrued
        (for the purposes of this study, patients that can provide full informed consent for the
        study are not considered cognitively impaired).

        For MRI studies, patients with metallic implants to remove potential risks from this
        procedure.

        For MRI purposes, women who are pregnant are excluded from this part of the protocol.
        Therefore, all women of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed, which
        must be negative, before proceeding.
