  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of APC8015 combined with bevacizumab in treating
      patients who have undergone radiation therapy and/or surgery and who have progressive
      prostate cancer. Biological therapies such as APC8015 use different ways to stimulate the
      immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab
      can locate tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Combining monoclonal
      antibody therapy with biological therapy may kill more cancer cells.

      OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of APC8015 (Provenge) and bevacizumab, in terms of decline in
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value and effect on PSA doubling time, in patients with
      progressive prostate cancer.

      II. Determine any immune response in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the
      safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Autologous dendritic cells (DCs) are harvested and pulsed with prostatic acid
      phosphatase-sargramostim fusion protein to produce APC8015 (Provenge). Patients receive
      APC8015 IV over 30 minutes and bevacizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 14 days for 3 courses. Patients continue to receive bevacizumab alone every 14 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every month.
