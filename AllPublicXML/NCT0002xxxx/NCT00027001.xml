  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to improve the overall physical health and quality of life of
      patients attached to mechanical heart devices while awaiting heart transplantation. Qigong,
      an ancient Chinese exercise that involves active participation of the individual in the form
      of meditation, breathing exercises and simple physical movements, is used in combination with
      a structured exercise program. We are testing the hypotheses that Qigong, in combination with
      a structured exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training will improve the
      cardiovascular health and improve the quality of life of patients on mechanical heart
      devices. To test these hypotheses, we are measuring cardiovascular function and quality of
      life parameters in patients attached to mechanical heart devices who have participated in the
      exercise program and have practiced Qigong, and comparing these measures to patients who
      participated in the exercise program, but did not practice Qigong. Information gained from
      this research will serve as a basis from which the application of exercise training and
      Qigong can be applied to the treatment of other chronic diseases in which the physical
      conditioning and/or quality of life of individuals is compromised.

      The goal of this study is to improve the overall physical health and quality of life of
      patients attached to mechanical hearts or assist devices while awaiting heart
      transplantation. Qigong, an ancient Chinese exercise that involves active participation of
      the individual in the form of meditation, breathing exercises and simple physical movements,
      will be used as an adjunct to the therapies, including a structured exercise program,
      currently provided to these patients at the University of Arizona Health Sciences Center.
      Based on the results of studies that have demonstrated physiological and psychosocial
      benefits of structured exercise programs and the practice of qigong, the following hypotheses
      are proposed: 1) a structured exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training
      will improve the cardiovascular health of patients on mechanical hearts and assist devices;
      these conditioning effects will be amplified by the practice of Qigong; 2) a structured
      exercise program that combines aerobic and resistance training will improve the quality of
      life of patients on mechanical hearts and assist devices; these conditioning effects will be
      amplified by the practice of Qigong; 3) improved quality of life and physical conditioning
      effected by the structured exercise program and Qigong will enhance quality of life and
      physical conditioning after cardiac transplantation. To test these hypotheses, the following
      specific aims will be accomplished: 1) obtain pilot data to evaluate alterations in specific
      measures of cardiovascular function and health in patients attached to mechanical heart or
      assist devices who have participated in a structured aerobic/resistance exercise program,
      with and without Qigong; 2) obtain pilot data to evaluate alterations in specific quality of
      life measures in patients attached to mechanical heart or assist devices who have
      participated in a structured aerobic/resistance exercise program, with and without Qigong; 3)
      as part of the clinical follow-up of these patients following heart transplantation, obtain
      pilot data to evaluate specific parameters of cardiovascular health and quality of life of
      individuals who were attached to mechanical heart or assist devices prior to receiving the
      transplant. Information gained from this research will serve as a basis from which the
      application of exercise training and Qigong can be applied to the treatment of other chronic
      disease states in which the physical conditioning and/or quality of life of individuals is
      compromised.
