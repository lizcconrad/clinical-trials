      RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs
      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Tetanus toxoid may make tumor cells more sensitive to chemotherapy and
      vaccine therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy and vaccine
      therapy with or without tetanus toxoid compared with chemotherapy alone in treating patients
      who have metastatic colorectal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine and chemotherapy, with or without tetanus
           toxoid, vs chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.

        -  Determine whether tetanus toxoid enhances the immune response in patients treated with
           the vaccine and chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a priming dose of tetanus toxoid. Beginning 2 weeks later,
           patients receive tetanus toxoid and ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine subcutaneously (SC) once
           weekly for 3 weeks.

      Two weeks after the third vaccine administration, patients receive tetanus toxoid and
      ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine SC on day 1 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV,
      and fluorouracil IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for 4 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine and chemotherapy as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I. After completion of chemotherapy,
           patients with partial or complete response may receive ALVAC-CEA-B7.1 vaccine SC once
           weekly on weeks 1-3 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients (30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
