      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of taurolidine in treating patients who
      have recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal
      cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of
      taurolidine after positive second-look surgery in patients with recurrent ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and safety of
      this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive taurolidine intraperitoneally
      weekly on weeks 1-3 and 7-9 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of taurolidine until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 weeks for 9
      weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
