      This study will evaluate T-20 in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children are stratified by age group (3 through 11 years and 12 through 16 years). Samples
      for HIV-1 genotype and phenotype resistance testing are obtained at screening to aid in the
      selection of concomitant antiretrovirals. Simultaneous to initiating T-20, all patients begin
      a &quot;new&quot; optimized antiretroviral regimen based on the patients' prior treatment history,
      historical resistance testing results, and the results of the testing performed at screening.
      Patients are followed for safety and other assessments at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, then monthly
      through Week 24 and bimonthly through Week 48. Pharmacokinetic sampling at selected study
      visits are performed.

        <description>The Area Under the Plasma Concentration-Time Curve (AUC) is a measure of the plasma concentration of the drug over time. It is used to characterize drug absorption.

        <description>An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is a significant medical event.</description>
