  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether and how nitrites and nitrates in the diet affect the level
      of nitric oxide gas that is breathed out in air. Nitric oxide is involved in many bodily
      processes, such as immune function, nerve signal transmission, inflammation, and dilation of
      blood vessels and bronchial tubes (tubes that branch out from the trachea into the lungs).

      Healthy male volunteers age 18 years or older who have not smoked for at least 5 years may be
      eligible for this study. Candidates will undergo blood and urine tests, breathing tests, and
      an electrocardiogram.

      Participants will follow two special diets for 3 days each. One is a low-nitrate and nitrite
      diet, and the other is a high-nitrate and nitrite diet. Both diets must be completed within a
      month's time. Participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for two 3-night
      hospital stays during the two diet periods, but may go out on passes at any time. While on
      the diets, they may consume only food prepared by the NIH Nutrition Department; eating other
      foods will seriously affect the study results. Meals may be eaten at the NIH Clinical Center,
      or packaged meals prepared by the Nutrition Department can be taken out. Participants may not
      engage in any heavy exercise during the diet periods, as exercise affects nitric oxide
      levels.

      Blood samples of about 4 milliliters, or 1 teaspoon, each will be collected before starting
      each diet and at the end of each diet to measure blood levels of nitrate and nitrite.
      Additional blood samples, totaling about 2 tablespoons, will be collected for research. Each
      day, participants will have a test to measure exhaled nitric oxide levels. This involves
      blowing air into a mouthpiece attached to a machine that measures levels of the gas in each
      breath.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) has been recognized for its multifaceted roles in many physiological
      processes (e.g., vasodilatation, host defense, neurotransmission, bronchodilatation, and
      inflammation.) NO is produced by a family of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms in a
      reaction that converts L-arginine to L-citrulline. NO metabolites in vivo include nitrite
      (NO2) and nitrate (NO3). Plasma NO2/NO3 concentrations have been used extensively as a marker
      for NOS activity and NO radical production. Studies have shown that dietary intake of
      nitrate, estrogen, atmospheric pollution, and heavy exercise can influence NO2/NO3 levels in
      blood. NO can also be detected in exhaled air. NO levels vary with disease, and in some cases
      (e.g., asthma) respond to treatment (e.g., steroid).

      This pilot study is designed to determine whether or not dietary intake influences exhaled NO
      levels. To use plasma metabolite measurements to monitor NOS activity, subjects must adhere
      to a strict low NO2/NO3 diet before and during the study where measurements of exhaled NO can
      be performed quickly and easily in an inpatient setting. Subjects will be studied as
      inpatients consuming standardized high and low nitrite/nitrate (NO2/NO3) diets each for a
      period of three days. Since L-arginine is a NOS substrate and can affect the generation of
      NO, diets will also be monitored by protein intake. Blood samples will be collected four
      times during the study, pre- and post-diet for each diet, for the quantification of NO2/NO3
      concentration. Exhaled NO will be measured daily. In addition, blood pressure, pulmonary
      function testing, and blood plasma levels of L-arginine, cyclic guanosine monophosphate
      (cGMP), and S-thiolation may be monitored. Results of this study should allow us to determine
      the most effective method of monitoring NOS activity, and potentially identify activities
      responsible for maintaining nitric oxide levels.
