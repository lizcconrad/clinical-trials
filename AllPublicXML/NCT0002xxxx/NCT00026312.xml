    <textblock>
      This partially randomized phase III trial studies isotretinoin with dinutuximab, aldesleukin,
      and sargramostim to see how well it works compared to isotretinoin alone following stem cell
      transplant in treating patients with neuroblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      isotretinoin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may block tumor growth in different ways by targeting
      certain cells. Aldesleukin and sargramostim may stimulate a person's white blood cells to
      kill cancer cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without
      dinutuximab, aldesleukin, and sargramostim following stem cell transplant in treating
      neuroblastoma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 (dinutuximab) + cytokines + isotretinoin
      (13-cis-retinoic acid, or RA) improves event free survival after myeloablative therapy and
      stem cell rescue as compared to RA alone, in high risk neuroblastoma patients who have
      achieved a pre-autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) response of complete response (CR),
      very good partial response (VGPR), or partial response (PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 + cytokines + isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid,
      or RA) improves overall survival after myeloablative therapy and stem cell rescue as compared
      to RA alone, in high risk neuroblastoma patients who have achieved a pre-ASCT response of CR,
      VGPR, or PR.

      II. Determine if immunotherapy + RA improves event free survival and overall survival as
      compared to RA alone, in the subgroup of high risk International Neuroblastoma Staging System
      (INSS) stage 4 neuroblastoma patients who have achieved a pre-ASCT response of CR, VGPR, or
      PR.

      III. Determine the toxicities of the combination of monoclonal antibody Ch14.18 with
      cytokines.

      IV. To compare the outcome data of the patients with persistent disease documented by biopsy
      (Stratum 07) to the historical data for the analogous patients from Children's Cancer Group
      (CCG)-3981.

      V. To further describe and refine the event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS)
      estimates and baseline characteristics for subjects receiving Ch14.18 + cytokines + RA,
      following cessation of the randomized portion of the study.

      VI. To further describe the safety and toxicity of Ch14.18 + cytokines + RA under the new
      administration guidelines implemented following cessation of the randomized portion of the
      study with focus on: a) number of courses delivered per subject; b) number of dose reductions
      or stoppage (ch14.18 and/or interleukin [IL]-2); and c) number of toxic deaths.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. In the subgroup of neuroblastoma patients who have achieved a pre-ASCT response of CR,
      VGPR, or PR, determine if there is a difference between the two randomized regimens in
      reducing the minimal residual disease (MRD) burden as detected by the following parameters:
      meta-iodobenylguanidine (MIBG) scan, immunocytology (IC) of blood and bone marrow samples,
      reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for tyrosine hydroxylase,
      phosphoglycolate phosphatase (PGP) 9.5, and melanoma antigen family A, 1 (MAGE-1) in blood
      and bone marrow.

      II. Determine if change from baseline of MRD is associated with event free and overall
      survival.

      III. Determine whether tumor biology at diagnosis correlates with event-free and overall
      survival, for either of the randomized regimens.

      IV. To explore the relationship between antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity (ADCC) and
      EFS.

      V. To determine a descriptive profile of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) during
      immunotherapy.

      VI. To determine the variability of 13-cis-retinoic-acid pharmacokinetics and relationship to
      pharmacogenomic parameters and determine if these levels and/or genetic variations correlate
      with EFS or systemic toxicity.

      VII. To determine the potential effect of ch14.18 on cardiac repolarization and to evaluate
      ch14.18 plasma levels.

      VIII. To determine if the presence of naturally occurring anti-glycan antibodies correlates
      with allergic reactions and blood levels of ch14.18.

      IX. To determine if the genotype of Fc receptor (FcR) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like
      receptor (Kir)/Kir-ligand correlate with EFS.

      X. To determine if natural killer cell p30-related protein (NKp30) isoform expression and
      single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and circulating ligand B7-H6 are prognostic of EFS or
      OS.

      OUTLINE: Patients stratified with biopsy-confirmed post-ASCT persistent disease who are also
      enrolled on Children's Oncology Group (COG)-A3973 or COG-ANBL0532 are assigned to treatment
      Arm II. Patients in the first set of strata are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning on day 56-85 post-ASCT, patients receive isotretinoin orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may cross over to Arm II provided they
      have not experienced disease progression and have not received any further anti-neuroblastoma
      therapy following completion of isotretinoin therapy. (closed to accrual as of 4/16/2009)

      ARM II: Beginning on day 56-85 post-ASCT, patients receive immunotherapy comprising
      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 0-13
      during courses 1, 3, and 5 and dinutuximab IV over 10-20 hours on days 3-6 of courses 1-5.
      Patients also receive aldesleukin IV continuously on days 0-3 and 7-10 during courses 2 and
      4. Immunotherapy repeats every 28 days for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive isotretinoin as in Arm I beginning on day 11 of
      immunotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.

             after diagnosis to the date of ASCT except for the rare occasions as noted below; for
             tandem ASCT patients, this will be the date of the FIRST stem cell infusion;
             exception: for those who are initially diagnosed as non-high risk neuroblastoma, but
             later converted (and/or relapsed) to high risk neuroblastoma, the 12 months
             restriction should start from the date of induction therapy for high risk
             neuroblastoma (not from the initial induction therapy for non-high risk disease), to
             the date of ASCT

          -  At pre-ASCT evaluation patients must meet the International Neuroblastoma Response
             Criteria (INRC) for CR, VGPR, or PR for primary site, soft tissue metastases and bone
             metastases; patients who meet those criteria must also meet the protocol specified
             criteria for bone marrow response as outlined below:

               -  =&lt; 10% tumor (of total nucleated cellular content) seen on any specimen from a
                  bilateral bone marrow aspirate/biopsy

                  and/or pre-enrollment evaluation will also be eligible (note that per INRC this
                  would have been defined as &quot;overall&quot; response of progressive disease [PD])

          -  Prior to enrollment on ANBL0032, a determination of mandatory disease staging must be
             performed (tumor imaging studies including computed tomography [CT] or magnetic
             resonance imaging [MRI], MIBG scan, and vanillylmandelic acid [VMA]/homovanillic acid
             [HVA]; bone marrow aspirates are required but biopsy may be omitted if negative prior
             to ASCT); this disease assessment is required for eligibility and should be done
             preferably within 2 weeks, but must be done within a maximum of 4 weeks before
             enrollment

               -  For those with residual disease before radiotherapy, re-evaluation of irradiated
                  residual tumors is preferably performed at the earliest 5 days after completing
                  radiotherapy; patients with residual disease are eligible; biopsy is not
                  required; patients who have biopsy proven residual disease after ASCT will be
                  enrolled on Stratum 07

               -  Patients must not have progressive disease at the time of study enrollment except
                  for protocol specified bone marrow response and except for elevations of
                  catecholamines as the only sign of disease in a patient who had normal
                  catecholamines at pre-ASCT evaluation

          -  Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins; the date protocol therapy is
             projected to start must be no later than ten (10) calendar days after the date of
             study enrollment; patients should be enrolled preferably between day 56 and day 85
             after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) infusion (day from 2nd stem cell infusion for
             tandem transplant); patients must be enrolled no later than day 200 after PBSC
             infusion; enrollment must occur after completion of radiotherapy, and after completion
             of tumor assessment post-ASCT and radiotherapy; informed consent should be obtained
             within 3 weeks pre-ASCT up to the time of registration

          -  Patients must not have received prior anti-disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody therapy

          -  Patients must have a Lansky or Karnofsky performance scale score of &gt;= 50% and
             patients must have a life expectancy of &gt;= 2 months

          -  Total absolute phagocyte count (APC = %neutrophils + %monocytes) X white blood cell
             (WBC) is at least 1000/uL

          -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 or a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:

               -  No greater than 0.4 mg/dL (1 month to &lt; 6 months)

               -  No greater than 0.5 mg/dL (6 months to &lt; 1 year)

               -  No greater than 0.6 mg/dL (1 to &lt; 2 years)

               -  No greater than 0.8 mg/dL (2 to &lt; 6 years)

               -  No greater than 1.0 mg/dL (6 to &lt; 10 years)

               -  No greater than 1.2 mg/dL (10 to &lt; 13 years)

               -  No greater than 1.4 mg/dL (&gt;= 13 years [female])

               -  No greater than 1.5 mg/dL (13 to &lt; 16 years [male])

               -  No greater than 1.7 mg/dL (&gt;= 16 years [male])

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 x normal

          -  Veno-occlusive disease, if present, should be stable or improving

          -  Shortening fraction of &gt;= 27% by echocardiogram, or if shortening fraction abnormal,
             ejection fraction of &gt;= 55% by gated radionuclide study or echocardiogram; note: the
             echocardiogram or gated radionuclide study must be performed within 4 weeks prior to
             enrollment

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 60%
             predicted by pulmonary function test; for children who are unable to do pulmonary
             function tests (PFTs), no evidence of dyspnea at rest and no exercise intolerance
             should be documented; note: the pulmonary function test must be performed within 4
             weeks prior to enrollment
