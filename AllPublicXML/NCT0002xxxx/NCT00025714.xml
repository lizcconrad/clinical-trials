  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect brain tissue samples for research purposes from patients undergoing
      surgery to treat epilepsy. The standard surgical procedure for medically intractable epilepsy
      i.e., epilepsy that cannot be controlled with medicine requires removal of more brain tissue
      than is needed for diagnostic study. This extra tissue, which would otherwise be discarded,
      will be used for research purposes. In addition, a blood vessel in the scalp, called the
      superficial temporal artery, is also normally cut during surgery, and a piece of this vessel
      will be taken for research use.

      Patients 4 years of age or older who undergo surgery for medically intractable epilepsy may
      be eligible for this study.

      Brain tissue collected under this protocol will be used for studies of brain cells in other
      diseases and of serotonin receptors. Any remaining brain tissue will be frozen for use in
      future research. The superficial temporal artery will be used for comparison with carotid
      arteries (a neck artery that supplies the brain) from patients with blockage of this blood
      vessel.

      This is a protocol to perform research studies on tissues that are removed in the operating
      room during surgical procedures for drug resistant epilepsy. Our aim is to acquire and supply
      useful tissue specimens for intramural NIH research projects.

      The investigators will evaluate participants with medically intractable drug resistant
      epilepsy who are considered for surgery to determine whether surgical specimen may be
      available for this protocol. Surgery and standard care for these participants will be
      performed under a separate protocol, 11-N-0051 Epilepsy Surgery. The intent of this protocol
      is solely for procuring tissue that is resected for standard clinical care during surgery.
      This protocol is not designed to test any new treatments.

      These are the research aspects of the protocol: 1) Any brain tissue that is removed and is
      not required for diagnostic studies will be used for laboratory studies, consistent with
      institutional guidelines. 2) Blood tests to test for immune and inflammatory mediators will
      be performed. 3) Saliva will be collected to test for immune and inflammatory markers.
