  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxic effects of
      clofarabine in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and other acute leukemias.
      Clofarabine is a synthesized hybrid nucleoside analog, which is believed to possess the
      better qualities of fludarabine and chlorodeoxyadenosine, the 2 most active agents against
      lymphoproliferative disorders. Thus, it is hoped that this drug will be more active and less
      toxic than similar drugs.

      The first group of patients will be treated at the starting dose level of 2 mg/m2 over 1 hour
      daily for 5 days. Dosage escalation will be permitted in individual patients if no toxicity
      occurred during the preceding course. Subsequent dose escalations will be by 50% until Grade
      2 toxicity, then by 35% until the maximum tolerated dose.
