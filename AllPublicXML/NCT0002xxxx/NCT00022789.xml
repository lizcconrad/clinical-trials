      To investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)
      in children.

      BACKGROUND:

      SDB in children appears to be a common condition, affecting approximately 1 to 3 percent of
      children. Many aspects of childhood SDB remain understudied and poorly understood, including
      its precise prevalence, the optimal means of identifying children who should undergo
      polysomnography, and the potentially major impact of this condition on health, cognitive
      development, and behavior.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The population-based, cross-sectional study of 6- to 16-year-old schoolchildren in Dauphin
      County, Pennsylvania is a two-part study. In the first part of the study, parents of every
      child enrolled in local elementary schools will complete a questionnaire that will assess
      general sleep, behavior, and learning problems. In the second part of the study, 1,000
      children will be randomly selected based on their risk for SDB, as determined by the
      questionnaire. They will be evaluated in a sleep laboratory to determine the presence of SDB.
      A thorough pediatric ear, nose, throat, and pulmonary evaluation will be conducted; school
      records and behavior will also be assessed. The parents of the children will be interviewed,
      and information will be collected on the family history of risk factors associated with
      childhood SDB. This strategy will be beneficial in establishing the prevalence and clinical
      significance of SDB in children.
