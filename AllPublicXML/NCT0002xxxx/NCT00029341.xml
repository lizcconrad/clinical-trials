    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if anti-HIV drugs can be stopped without the virus
      becoming resistant to the drugs. The study will also examine how fast anti-HIV drugs leave
      the body.

      Not all HIV-infected patients may require continuous and indefinite anti-HIV therapy. There
      is evidence that stopping anti-HIV therapy will not make the virus resistant to efavirenz
      (EFV), an anti-HIV drug that remains in the body longer than most treatment drugs. In another
      study, patients were treated with EFV, zidovudine (ZDV), and lamivudine (3TC). The patients'
      virus was controlled despite the fact that some patients missed medication dosages. Many
      patients stop anti-HIV therapy because of negative effects. This study will examine the
      body's ability to fight and control virus in patients who stop therapy.

      The concept that all patients with HIV-1 infection require continuous and indefinite
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been questioned. There are both theoretical reasons and
      supporting empiric evidence that suggest that discontinuing ART should not select for
      EFV-resistance. In Dupont Protocol 006, antiretroviral-naive patients were randomized to
      receive EFV, ZDV, and 3TC. This regimen was associated with an excellent and sustained
      virologic response. It is certain that many patients in this study were able to maintain
      sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA to below limits of detection despite missing occasional
      doses of all medications. Since therapy with ZDV and 3TC alone is unlikely to maintain
      virologic control, emergence of substantial high-level EFV resistance should have led to
      virologic failure. The fact that there were relatively few virologic failures in that study
      provides indirect but strong evidence that simultaneous discontinuation of EFV, ZDV, and 3TC
      is unlikely to be associated with emergence of EFV resistance. Many individuals discontinue
      antiretroviral therapy because of adverse effects. This study provides the opportunity to
      determine whether the virologic response of patients who discontinue antiretroviral therapy
      will be compromised.

      Participants will discontinue their EFV. Other antiretroviral drugs in the patients' regimens
      may be continued for up to three days after the last EFV dose. Patients will not resume EFV
      or other antiretroviral agents for at least 28 days after stopping EFV, unless the CD4 cell
      count declines to a level that indicates the need to resume therapy. Throughout the study,
      patients will have blood drawn on specified days for plasma EFV assays, intracellular NRTI-TP
      assays, and demonstration of EFV resistance. After patients have been off their
      antiretrovirals for at least four weeks, they may choose to restart their ART, start a new
      regimen, or discontinue their ART. Patients who restart their ART need to come to the clinic
      seven days after restarting to have blood drawn. After plasma EFV assays have been completed
      and HIV resistance has not been demonstrated, three patients will have a clonal analysis
      performed.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Patients may be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Are at least 18 years old.

          -  Are on EFV and at least 2 other anti-HIV drugs.

          -  Are HIV-infected.

          -  Have a CD4 cell count greater than 350 cells/mm3 within 21 days of study entry.

          -  Have a viral load less than 50 copies/ml within 21 days of study entry.

          -  Have an estimated creatinine clearance greater than 30 ml/minute within 21 days of
             study entry.

          -  Have a negative pregnancy test if female. All patients able to have children must
             agree not to become pregnant or to impregnate or agree to use 2 reliable methods of
             contraception, including a barrier method.

          -  Are planning to stop anti-HIV drugs as part of another study, not solely to
             participate in this study.

          -  (This study has been changed. In an earlier version, EFV plus lamivudine plus
             zidovudine or stavudine was required.)

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients may not be eligible for this study if they:

          -  Had a serious illness and have not finished therapy for the illness or become stable
             on the therapy.

          -  Abuse alcohol or drugs.

          -  Have taken any nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor other than EFV.

          -  (This study has been changed. In an earlier version, patients were ineligible if they
             had taken certain anti-HIV agents or stopped treatment for more than 7 days in a row
             before the study.)
