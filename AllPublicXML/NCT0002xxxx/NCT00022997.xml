  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the genetics of taste and taste deficits. The sense of taste plays a
      crucial role in food choices, allowing people to identify beneficial foods (those with high
      caloric value, which are typically sweet) and foods likely to be toxic (usually bitter
      substances). The loss of sense of taste in older people plays a role in decreased appetite
      and poor nutrition. Taste deficits may adversely affect people in ways that are not well
      understood. This study will examine why some people (about one-fourth of all people in the
      United States) cannot taste a substance called phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The inability to
      taste PTC is due to inherited factors that are not yet clear.

      Individuals age 18 and older who can taste PTC and individuals who cannot taste PTC may be
      eligible for this study. Participants will taste a number of liquid solutions until they find
      one with a clear taste. Then they will taste another group of solutions and decide which ones
      have that taste and which have no taste. Finally, they will taste a third group of solutions
      until they find one with a different taste. About 2 tablespoons of blood will be drawn from
      participants for genetic tests related to the sense of taste.

      The primary goal of this study is to identify the underlying cause of deficits in the ability
      to taste different commonly consumed substances, including the bitter compound
      phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) as a model. Individuals will be tested to identify those who can
      and cannot taste PTC, as well as for their ability to taste a variety of sweet, sour, salty,
      and savory substances. Individuals will have 20 cc of blood drawn to obtain DNA. These DNA
      samples will then be analyzed for variation in genes whose products are known to be involved
      in taste perception pathways. Information about individuals DNA sequence variation will then
      be correlated with their taste phenotype to identify the specific genetic variation that
      causes phenotypic variation, providing molecular structure-function information in taste
      sensory pathways.
