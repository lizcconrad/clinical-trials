      RATIONALE: Radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver
      tumor-killing substances such as radioactive iodine to them without harming normal cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies in
      treating patients who have large cell lymphoma that has been previously treated.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 in
           patients with previously treated diffuse large cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response of patients to this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.

      Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 40 minutes followed 15-30
      minutes later by iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1 IV over 2 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody Lym-1
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed weekly for 8 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-36 patients will be accrued for this study.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Histologic diagnosis of B-cell diffuse large cell lymphoma (REAL classification
             system) confirmed by an independent central pathology reviewer.

          -  The tumor's B-cell phenotype will be confirmed by positive L-26 (CD20).

          -  Previous treatment with 2 common combination chemotherapy regimens. Patients
             previously treated with unlabeled monoclonal antibody therapy are eligible.

          -  Men or women at least 18 years of age.

          -  Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) estimated to be &gt; 60 at the time of the scheduled
             therapeutic dose of 131I-Lym-1.

          -  Life expectancy estimated to be at least 3 months from the time of the therapeutic
             dose of 131I Lym-1.

          -  Measurable disease demonstrable by physical examination or computerized tomography
             (CT).

          -  CT scan evidence of at least one indicator lesion with at least one diameter that
             measures &gt; 2 cm. (The CT scan should be done within 2 weeks of the imaging study.)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the following:

          -  Bone marrow biopsy

          -  Return for follow-up visits

          -  Remaining motionless for extended periods of time for imaging procedures

          -  Serial blood/urine sampling (for dosimetry patients only)

          -  Pregnancy (Women of childbearing potential must be practicing an effective method of
             contraception.)

          -  Presence of a second malignancy except for basal cell skin carcinoma or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix

          -  Presence of active lymphomatous meningitis or other CNS involvement with lymphoma.

          -  HIV positive patients.

          -  Prior total body irradiation, or a course of prior radiation &gt; 3,000 cGy delivered to
             &gt; 20% of the central marrow or the lumbar vertebrae within 6 months of screening.

          -  Serum creatinine or total bilirubin &gt; 2 x the upper limit of normal.

             phosphatase &gt; 3 x the upper limit of normal.

          -  Significant marrow lymphoma (defined as lymphoma cells constituting greater than 20%
