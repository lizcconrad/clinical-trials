  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to provide patients with adequate informed consent to
      understand that screening tests with minimal health risk will be performed to evaluate their
      eligibility for a research study. The protocol makes it clear that patients initial visit to
      the intramural clinical program may include screening studies that are not medically
      necessary for disease management, but are done purely for research purposes.

      Patients with a known or suspected diagnosis of cancer, HIV infection, skin disorder or
      immunodeficiency who are being considered for enrollment in a National Cancer Institute
      intramural clinical research protocol will participate in this consent protocol. It informs
      patients of screening tests and procedures involving minimal risk that are done for research
      purposes only, including blood tests, electrocardiogram, standard X-rays (e.g., chest X-ray),
      bone films, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and nuclear medicine
      studies. It explains that other eligibility screens that are more invasive and involve
      greater risk, such as a biopsy, will require separate consent.

      Background:

        -  Patients and healthy volenteerswho are being evaluated for NIH Intramural Research
           Program (IRP) protocols must be screened to determine whether they meet the eligibility
           criteria prior to enrollment.

        -  Performing invasive procedures for the sole purpose of obtaining tissue specimens or
           biological fluids for research purposes is often not ethically justifiable in human
           subjects, yet these specimens are needed to advance our knowledge on a variety of
           cancers. Therefore, it is critical to obtain tissue and biological fluid samples for
           future research when procedures (e.g., surgical excision, diagnostic biopsy) are
           performed for clinical indications in this population.

      Objectives:

        -  Evaluate patient or healthy volunteer eligibility for participation in NIH IRP research
           protocols.

        -  Collect results of screening test for use on subsequent research protocols as baseline (
           e.g., pretreatment) values.

        -  Collect specific research samples required for the primary research protocol as part of
           a screening test or procedure in order to avoid from having to subject the patient to a
           painful procedure on multiple occasions.

        -  Procure residual tissues or fluids that are remaining from tests or procedures that are
           performed for clinical indications (e.g., diagnosis or treatment of the cancer) during
           the screening process or during treatment and follow-up on a primary research protocol.
           These specimens will be stored for future research studies.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients and healthy volunteers who are being evaluated for and treated on protocols within
      the NIH IRP.

      Design:

        -  This protocol is not a research study

        -  Screening tests and procedures that are required by the primary research protocols are
           conducted in order to establish eligibility for these protocols.

        -  In some cases specific research samples required for the primary research protocol may
           be collected during the screening process in order to avoid from having to subject the
           patient to a painful procedure on multiple occasions.

        -  Tissues and biological fluids that are obtained during or after the screening process or
           at any time during treatment and follow-up on a primary NIH IRP research protocol will
           be stored. Residual biological fluids will be obtained during tests or procedures that
           are considered clinically indicated for the diagnosis or treatment of the patient's
           cancer or related disease.

        -  Once a patient or healthy volunteer completes the screening process and is either
           enrolled onto another NIH study or is returned to the care of their local physician they
           will be taken off study.
