  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation delivered over the skin
      increases the muscle strength as measured by a dynamometer in chronic stroke patients. We
      recently also found out that such stimulation enhances the ability of healthy brains to learn
      faster, enhancing the beneficial effects of the motor training.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if this stimulation can enhance the ability of
      stroke patients to experience plastic changes in the brain. It may aid in the development of
      new strategies for rehabilitation after brain injury in the future.

      A clinical and neurological exam will be administered. Each patient will participate in three
      different sessions separated by at least 48 hours: a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to
      the weak hand, a 2-hour peripheral nerve stimulation to the leg, and no stimulation. The
      sessions will be randomly ordered. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be
      done as well.

      Nerve stimulation will be done by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In TMS, the head
      is immobilized within a frame. An insulated coil wire is placed on the scalp and brief
      electrical current passed through it. Participants may be asked to perform movements, do
      simple tasks, or simply tense muscles. Electrical activity of the muscles will be recorded
      with a computer. Some experiments may be recorded on videotape.

      Participants must be stroke patients who have recovered to the point of being able to make
      thumb movements, and the stroke must have occurred more than 6 months ago.

    <textblock>
      There are very few therapeutic options for the treatment of motor disabilities resulting from
      chronic stroke. Motor training results in use-dependent plasticity, thought to underlie
      recovery of motor function after cortical lesions. We recently demonstrated that stimulation
      of peripheral nerves (SPN) administered in association with motor training enhances
      use-dependent plasticity in healthy volunteers. The purpose of this protocol is to
      investigate if SPN administered in association with motor training enhances use-dependent
      plasticity in patients with chronic stroke. If so, it may become an important tool to enhance
      the beneficial effects of rehabilitative treatment in this patient group.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Hemiparetic patients (right or left who had thromboembolic non-hemorrhagic infarction
        (documented by CT or MRI) more than 6 months before. Patients should have recovered motor
        function to the point of being able to perform thumb movements.

        Patients will be recruited from referrals from the community, particularly Baltimore and
        Washington VA hospitals, and Suburban Hospital as well as stroke clubs. An anatomical MRI
        scan will be acquired at the NIH if a recent one (within 6 months) is not available.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Large hemorrhagic or brain stem stroke.

          -  Multiple cerebral lesions with residual deficits.

          -  History of head injury with loss of consciousness.

          -  History of severe alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  History of psychiatric illness.

          -  Unstable cardiac dysrhythmia or unresponsive arterial hypertension (greater than
             160/100 mmHg).

          -  H/o hyperthyroidism.

          -  Receiving alpha-adrenergic antagonists or agonists, major/minor tranquilizers,
             clonidine,prazosin, phenytoin, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, haloperidol, other
             neuroleptics, barbiturates.

          -  Degree of aphasia or cognitive deficit that makes patient unable to give informed
             consent.

          -  Pregnancy, glaucoma, h/o hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy to sympatomimetic drugs.
