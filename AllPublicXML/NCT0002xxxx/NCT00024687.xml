      Although Neopharm has terminated its sponsorship of this study, it is continuing under the
      sponsorship of the NCI. Please contact Raffit Hassan, MD at 301-451-8742 for more
      information. Also see the related NCI study &quot;Experimental Drug SS1(dsFv)-PE38 to Treat
      Cancer&quot; (Study ID number 010011).

      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 is an oncology drug product containing a bacteria toxin, fused to a high
      affinity, disulfide stabilized antibody. The fused protein retains cell killing activity, but
      binds only to cells expressing mesothelin. Tumors characterized by very high surface
      mesothelin expression include mesothelioma; epithelial carcinomas of ovary and peritoneum;
      and squamous cancers of cervix and upper aerodigestive tract, including esophagus, head, and
      neck cancers.

      This is a dose-escalating study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intravenous
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 administered once every other day for six doses. Dose escalation will proceed
      in cohorts of 3 until dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of six doses of
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered by intravenous infusion to patients with advanced
      malignancies.

      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 after intravenous infusion.

      III. Determine toxicities attributable to subsequent courses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38.

      IV. Evaluate the response of selected advanced malignancies to intravenous infusion of six
      doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered at the MTD.

      V. Determine the induction of antibody against SS1(dsFv)-PE38 and its relationship to
      pharmacokinetics.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: To exclude immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction, each patient will
      receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38, and be observed for 30 minutes prior to receiving
      study dosing. Each treatment will be given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every
      other day. Hydration will be maintained. (Oral hydration may be adequate, but intravenous
      hydration may be used at the Investigator?s discretion.) Patients will be observed for at
      least 4 hours after infusion on Day 1 of each treatment course to exclude immediate allergic
      reaction. Treatment may be repeated for a maximum of two additional courses after 4 weeks if
      re-treatment criteria are met. At least three patients will be accrued at each dose level.
      Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.
