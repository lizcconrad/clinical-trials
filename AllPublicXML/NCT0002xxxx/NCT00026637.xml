      To define the benefits of antidepressant treatment or cognitive behavior therapy on mood,
      function, and quality of life in persons with depression and refractory epilepsy.

      This randomized clinical trial will be conducted to compare the drug sertraline to cognitive
      behavioral therapy on symptoms of depression, antiepileptic medication compliance, seizure
      frequency, and quality of life outcomes in persons with depression and a seizure disorder or
      epilepsy. Approximately 140 persons will be enrolled in this study over a period of five
      years. Individual participation will last approximately 16 weeks. Study participants will be
      chosen randomly to receive either the study medication (sertraline) or cognitive behavior
      therapy for 16 weeks. Sertraline is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
      Subjects who receive cognitive behavior therapy will be provided with a one-hour individual
      session with a licensed clinical psychologist each week for 15 weeks. All study participants
      will attend scheduled clinic visits every 4 weeks for 16 weeks.

    <description>Sertraline: 25-200mg PO (orally); Subjects begin at 25mg for week 1 and increase to 50mg at the beginning of week 2. Sertraline is increased in 50mg increments when subjects score in the depressed range on the CES-D, a questionnaire that is administered every 2 weeks over the 16 week intervention period. Subjects may reduce dosage if toxicity occurs.</description>
