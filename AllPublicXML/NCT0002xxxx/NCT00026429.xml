      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as denileukin diftitox may be able to deliver
      cancer-killing substances directly to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of denileukin diftitox in treating
      patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the efficacy of denileukin diftitox in patients with stages I-IV
      low- or intermediate-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the safety of this
      drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV over 30-60
      minutes on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive up to 2 additional courses after achieving
      complete response. Patients are followed every 3 months until they have progressed or for 2
      years from date of termination.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients (29 with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and
      29 with intermediate-grade NHL) will be accrued for this study within 12 months. The study
      may be stopped after accrual of 20 patients (10 with low-grade NHL and 10 with
      intermediate-grade NHL) if observed response rate is less than 1 in 10 for each stratum.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS: Histologically confirmed low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma

        lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic Lymphoplasmacytoid Marginal zone/MALT Follicular
        small or mixed small and large cell OR Histologically confirmed intermediate-grade B-cell

        Diffuse small cell Marginal zone/MALT Large B-cell Lymphoplasmacytoid Stage I, II, III, or
        IV disease No cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or other T-cell NHL Bidimensionally measurable
        disease Unidimensionally measurable disease allowed for mediastinal lymphoma only if
        outside previously irradiated field or there is evidence of progression Received prior
        monoclonal antibody therapy OR ineligible for monoclonal antibody therapy A new
        classification scheme for adult non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been adopted by PDQ. The
        terminology of &quot;indolent&quot; or &quot;aggressive&quot; lymphoma will replace the former terminology of
        &quot;low&quot;, &quot;intermediate&quot;, or &quot;high&quot; grade lymphoma. However, this protocol uses the former
        terminology.

        contraception HIV negative No serious concurrent illness or active infection requiring
        parenteral antibiotics that would preclude study No known hypersensitivity to study drug or
        its components, including diphtheria toxin, interleukin-2, or excipients No other
        malignancy within the past 5 years except resected basal or squamous cell skin cancer or
        carcinoma in situ of the cervix (prostate cancer in situ or breast cancer in situ within
        the past 5 years is allowed if patients are in complete remission with no active disease,
        have stable tumor markers for at least 3 months, and have a life expectancy of at least 2
        years)
