      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy in treating
      patients who have advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the recommended phase II dose of irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and
           fluorouracil in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of irinotecan and
           fluorouracil in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the correlation of polymorphisms in the promoter region of the thymidylate
           synthase gene with clinical toxicity and response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the correlation of polymorphisms in the uridine diphosphate
           glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 gene promoter with the extent of SN-38 glucuronidation and
           severity of diarrhea in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess any anti-tumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of irinotecan and fluorouracil.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV continuously over 24 hours on days 1 and 15 and leucovorin
      calcium IV over 30 minutes followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 48 hours on days 2
      and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD of irinotecan has been determined, additional cohorts
      receive escalating doses of fluorouracil until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as
      the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
