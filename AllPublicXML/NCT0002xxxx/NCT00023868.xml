      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping the cells from dividing. Chemoembolization kills tumor cells by blocking the blood
      flow to the tumor and keeping chemotherapy drugs near the tumor. It is not yet known if
      chemoembolization is more effective than standard chemotherapy in treating metastatic cancer.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial and randomized phase III trial is studying the effectiveness of
      chemoembolization in treating patients who have colorectal cancer metastatic to the liver.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the survival of patients with liver-dominant metastatic colorectal
           adenocarcinoma treated with irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium with or
           without hepatic chemoembolization.

        -  Compare response in the liver, time to hepatic tumor progression, and time to
           extrahepatic tumor progression in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the possible treatment differences with respect to morbidity, toxic effects of
           chemoembolization, toxic effects of chemotherapy, and death from cancer-related
           complications in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase III randomized,
      multicenter study. (Phase I closed as of 10/14/02.)

        -  Phase I: Patients in phase I are sequentially enrolled to 1 of 3 treatment regimens.
           (Phase I closed as of 10/14/02.)

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium
                IV, and fluorouracil IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients undergo
                hepatic embolization with embolic suspension only on day 36.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive chemotherapy as in regimen A. Patients undergo hepatic
                chemoembolization with lower-dose cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin on day 36.

             -  Regimen C: Patients receive chemotherapy as in regimen A. Patients undergo hepatic
                chemoembolization with higher-dose cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin on day 36.

      After 1 week of rest, patients in all regimens receive a second 4-week course of systemic
      chemotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-10 patients are sequentially enrolled until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      chemotherapy and chemoembolization is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which at least 4 of 10 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase III: Patients are stratified according to liver volume involvement (less than 25%
           vs 25-50% vs more than 50% to less than 75%) and participating center. Patients are
           randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 60-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV,
                and fluorouracil IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every
                6 weeks in the absence of disease progression.

             -  Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients undergo hepatic
                chemoembolization with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and mitomycin on day 36.
                Chemotherapy repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression.
                Chemoembolization may repeat every 6 weeks for 2-4 courses as necessary.

      Patients in phase III are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-18 patients will be accrued for phase I of this study. (Phase
      I closed to accrual as of 10/14/02.) Approximately 315 patients will be accrued for phase III
      of this study within 2.5 years.
