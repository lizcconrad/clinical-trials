      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body
      build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be
      able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with
      vaccine therapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be effective in treating
      multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by vaccine
      therapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of induction chemotherapy followed by autologous tumor cell
           vaccine and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with
           multiple myeloma.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous tumor cells are harvested. The vaccine is prepared in vitro by mixing
      autologous tumor cells with a bystander cell expressing sargramostim (GM-CSF). Patients
      receive induction chemotherapy followed by autologous tumor cell vaccination (ATCV) once.
      Patients then undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. At 6 weeks after
      transplantation, patients receive additional ATCVs every 3 weeks for a total of 8
      vaccinations.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
