    <textblock>
      This study will examine the production of proteins called chemokines in inflammatory skin
      reactions. It is thought that chemokines attract or recruit white blood cells from the blood
      stream into the skin when there is a skin injury or infection, causing inflammation. This
      study will examine chemokine production in induced inflammatory reactions to try to gain a
      better understanding of how white blood cells are attracted to inflamed areas of the body.

      Healthy normal volunteers between 33 and 60 years old may be eligible for this study if they
      1) have no history of chronic skin disease; 2) are not allergic to eggs; and 3) do not tend
      to form large irregular scars after trauma to the skin from, for example, cuts, scratches and
      surgical incisions. Candidates will be asked a short series of questions and have a limited
      skin examination.

      Participants will have 10 ml (2 tablespoons) of blood drawn from an arm vein at the start and
      end of the 5-day study and undergo the following procedures:

        1. Day 1 - Participants receive an injection in the right upper arm of mumps antigen (a
           protein commonly used to tests for immunization against mumps) and an injection of
           &quot;vehicle&quot; (saline plus the preservatives thimerosal, glycine and formaldehyde) in the
           left upper arm.

        2. Day 3 - Participants who develop a swelling from the mumps antigen larger than 5 mm wide
           will receive another injection of antigen in the right arm and another injection of
           vehicle in the left arm. Those whose swelling is not greater than 5 mm will be excluded
           from the study at this point.

        3. Day 5 - All four injection sites, plus another site on the left upper arm will be
           biopsied. For this procedure the five injection areas are numbed with a local
           anesthetic. A punch biopsy instrument that resembles a small cookie cutter (about
           one-third the diameter of a dime) is inserted about one-fifth of an inch deep into the
           skin and the tissue is removed. Two stitches are used to close the wound. Antibiotic and
           bandages are applied for 5 days. Nine days after the biopsy the participant returns to
           NIH for removal of the stitches.

      New molecular biology techniques will be used to measure changes in chemokine production in
      the biopsied tissue.

      In the skin, T lymphocytes are critical modulators and effectors of acquired defense
      responses such as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). T lymphocytes and other leukocytes are
      recruited to the challenged site via the interaction of selectins, integrins, immunoglobulin
      gene superfamily molecules with their ligands, and cytokines including the large and growing
      chemokine group. Endogenous proinflammatory agents such as Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha
      and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) modulate lymphocyte recruitment via up-regulation of endothelial
      adhesion molecules and chemokines. In vitro evidence suggests that endothelial cell-derived
      chemokines may play a crucial role in inducing firm arrest of leukocytes on endothelial cells
      prior to transmigration. However, the investigation of the expression patterns and regulation
      of chemokines in human skin has been limited. Our goal is to qualitatively and quantitatively
      investigate changes in chemokine expression patterns in human skin using a DTH response to
      mumps antigen as a model T cell mediated immunological response. We will study the effects of
      intradermal injection of mumps antigen on cutaneous chemokine expression in healthy human
      volunteers over a five-day period. Skin biopsies of treated and mock-treated areas will be
      obtained and processed for state-of-the-art, real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mRNA
      for chemokines and related molecules of interest. Routine and immunohistological analysis of
      chemokine receptor, chemokines, cytokines and other cell markers on fixed and frozen tissue
      will also be performed in an attempt to correlate chemokine expression patterns with the
      influx of leukocyte subsets into skin. Our hypothesis is that the chemokines will be
      up-regulated, but that the kinetics and expression patterns of individual chemokines may not
      be identical, thus possibly accounting for the differential recruitment of T lymphocytes and
      other leukocytes during the course of the DTH response. Chemokine expression as determined by
      quantitative RT-PCR will be compared with results obtained semi-quantitatively by
      immunohistochemical staining. This study may increase the understanding of the pathogenic
      mechanisms of inflammatory diseases that are characterized by the recruitment of T
      lymphocytes, thus possibly identifying targets for the treatment of cutaneous inflammatory
      diseases such as psoriasis.
