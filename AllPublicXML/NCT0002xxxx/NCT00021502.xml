  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and effectiveness of pyridoxylated hemoglobin polyoxyethylene
      conjugate (PHP) administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion in systemic inflammatory
      response syndrome (SIRS) patients with shock. PHP is a human-derived chemically modified
      hemoglobin preparation. PHP selectively scavenges excess nitric oxide (NO) and does so in a
      catalytic, concentration-dependent reaction that results in the formation of the non-toxic NO
      metabolite, nitrate. PHP is postulated to reduce excess, toxic levels of NO while allowing
      critical beneficial levels of the molecule to persist.

    <textblock>
      This Phase 3, randomized, placebo controlled, multi-center study is designed to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of continuous IV infusion of PHP plus conventional vasopressor treatment,
      as compared to continuous IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte A plus conventional vasopressor, as a
      treatment for restoring hemodynamic stability in SIRS patients with shock. Conventional
      vasopressors include dopamine &gt; 5 mcg/kg/min; or norepinephrine, phenylephrine or epinephrine
      at any dose.

      The study consists of a Screening period, a Pre-Treatment period, and a 28-day Treatment
      period. Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality
      and organ function over the 28-day treatment period.

      The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a
      number of measures including an evaluation of:

        -  all cause mortality,

        -  median patient survival time and

        -  adverse event rates and duration.

        Determination of study eligibility will be made by the Investigator on the basis of the
        inclusion criteria listed below:

        SIRS Inclusion Criteria

        Patients with SIRS as characterized by two or more of the following conditions (worst
        values in a 24 hour period):

          -  Either respiratory rate &gt;/= 20 breaths/minute, partial pressure of arterial carbon
             dioxide (PaCO2) &lt;/= 32 torr, or mechanical ventilation,

          -  Heart rate &gt;/= 90 beats/minute,

          -  Either hyperthermia &gt;/= 38 degrees C, or hypothermia &lt;/= 36 degrees C or

          -  Either white blood cell (WBC) &gt;/= 12,000 cells/mm3, &lt;/= 4,000 cells/mm3, or &gt;/= 10%
             immature (band) forms

        Shock Inclusion Criteria Patients with adequate fluid resuscitation (PCWP &gt;/= 12mmHg) and
        with one or more conventional vasopressors (continuing up to the time of randomization)
        being used to treat hypotension (MBP &lt; 60 mmHg or SBP &lt; 90 mmHg). Patients cannot be
        entered if they have been in shock for more than 24 hours.
