      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. Treatment plus supportive care may improve quality of life in
      patients undergoing cancer treatment.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to compare the effect of different gemcitabine
      regimens plus supportive care on quality of life in patients who have locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare quality of life, in terms of the degree of symptom palliation and improvements
           in performance status, of patients with locally advanced or metastatic poor prognosis
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with 2 schedules of gemcitabine combined with best
           supportive care.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the response rate in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once a week for 3 weeks.
           Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once a week for 2 weeks.
           Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients on both arms also receive best supportive care. Additional courses of gemcitabine
      may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then after each course of chemotherapy.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 174 patients (87 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
