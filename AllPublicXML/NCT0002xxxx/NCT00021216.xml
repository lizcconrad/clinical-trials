    <textblock>
      Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop
      growing or die. Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating children
      who have advanced solid tumors that have not responded to previous treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib in pediatric patients with refractory
      solid tumors.

      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these
      patients.

      III. Preliminarily determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. If dose-limiting toxicity in the form of
      myelosuppression occurs in stratum I, dose escalation continues with patients meeting the
      qualifications for stratum II.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study.
