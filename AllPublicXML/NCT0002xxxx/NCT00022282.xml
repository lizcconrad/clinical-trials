      RATIONALE: AE-941 may help to slow the growth of multiple myeloma.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of neovastat in treating patients who have
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the confirmed tumor response rate in patients with early relapse or refractory
           multiple myeloma treated with AE-941 (Neovastat).

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the duration of tumor response (partial response, response, and complete
           response) in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label study.

      Patients receive oral AE-941 (Neovastat) twice daily.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 125 patients will be accrued for this study.
