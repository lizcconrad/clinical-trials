      This study is a phase II, placebo controlled, double-blind, one year trial investigating the
      effect of HmG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin calcium in the treatment of persons with
      possible or probable Alzheimer's disease. Subjects may continue to take stable doses of
      Aricept and Exelon. Following enrollment, participants will make visits to the study center
      every three months for blood tests and neuropsychological testing.
