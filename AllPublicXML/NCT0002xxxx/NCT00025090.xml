      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or
      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet
      known if fluorouracil plus radiation therapy is more effective with or without additional
      chemotherapy in treating anal cancer.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus
      radiation therapy with or without additional chemotherapy in treating patients who have
      primary anal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the response rates in patients with primary epidermoid anal cancer treated with
           radiotherapy and fluorouracil with either mitomycin or cisplatin and with or without
           maintenance therapy.

        -  Compare local control and prevention or delay of disease dissemination in patients
           treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of
      four treatment arms.

      All patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. All patients also
      receive fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and 29-32.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitomycin IV on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV on days 1 and 29.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive mitomycin as in arm I and maintenance therapy comprising
           fluorouracil IV continuously over days 1-4 and cisplatin IV on day 1 beginning 4-8 weeks
           after completion of primary therapy and repeating once 3 weeks later.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive cisplatin as in arm II and maintenance therapy as in arm III.

      Patients are followed at 2 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
