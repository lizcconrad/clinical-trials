      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Multiple CT scans
      may improve the accuracy of radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of multiple CT scans in guiding the
      treatment of patients who have prostate cancer and are undergoing radiation therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the accuracy of radiotherapy delivery using multiple CT scans to guide patient
           positioning vs the standard portal image guided procedure in patients with prostate
           cancer undergoing external beam radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the reduction in the proportion of patients with large target positioning
           errors using the CT-guided procedure.

        -  Determine organ motion and setup errors over the course of radiotherapy in order to
           develop efficient clinical intervention strategies in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy over 9 weeks. Patients undergo a CT scan immediately
      prior to receiving radiotherapy on treatment days 3-8 and then weekly thereafter. On 3
      different days, patients also undergo CT scan immediately after radiotherapy. If the CT scans
      indicate a correction that exceeds the action level currently in effect, then beginning with
      the next treatment, the patient's position with respect to the radiation field is adjusted.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
