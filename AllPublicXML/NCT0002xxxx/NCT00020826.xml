      RATIONALE: Assessing quality of life in patients who are undergoing cancer treatment may help
      determine the effect of treatment on these patients.

      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of a quality of life assessment in
      patients who are receiving treatment for stomach cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the scale structure, reliability, and validity of the tumor-specific
           questionnaire, QLQ-STO22, in assessing the quality of life of patients with gastric
           cancer.

        -  Determine the questionnaire's sensitivity to change in clinical health status in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to type of treatment (potentially curative vs
      potentially palliative), disease stage (local and locoregional vs metastatic), Karnofsky
      performance status (less than 80% vs more than 80%), and initial weight gain (none vs less
      than 10% of total body weight vs 10% or more of total body weight).

        -  Curatively Treated Group: Quality of life is assessed at 4 weeks prior to surgery and 3
           months after surgery in patients receiving total or partial gastrectomy with curative
           intent; at 4 weeks prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, 4 weeks prior to surgery,
           and 3 months after surgery in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or
           radiotherapy followed by total or partial gastrectomy with curative intent; at 4 weeks
           prior to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy and 6 weeks after completion of therapy in
           patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy following total or partial
           gastrectomy; and at 4 weeks prior to therapy and 3 months after completion of therapy in
           patients receiving endoscopic mucosal resection or laparoscopic wedge resection.

        -  Palliatively Treated Group: Quality of life is assessed at 3 weeks prior to palliative
           therapy and 4 weeks after beginning palliative therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 220 patients (110 per group) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.

    <time_frame>The EORTC QLQ-C30 and the gastric cancer module (QLQ-STO22) will be prospectively administered once before and once after primary treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life scores will be evaluated for psychometric validity by:
Scale structure using multi-trait scaling analysis
Reliability using tests of internal consistency
Test-retest reliability in patients recruited in the UK
Validity using inter-scale correlations and known group comparisons
Sensitivity to change using two measurements of Quality of Life and ANOVA to look for the significance of changes in quality of life scores as a function of observed changes in clinical status over time.</description>

        The study sample will be composed of a consecutive series of patients with gastric cancer
        meeting the eligibility criteria in each participating centre. The definition of gastric
        cancer is adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and includes all tumours of the fundus, body and
        antrum, linitis plastica and tumours of the cardia that infiltrate the gastro-oesophageal
        junction and distal oesophagus from below; classified as type III according to Siewert
        (1998. The study sample will be stratified by treatment - potentially curative and purely
        palliative.
