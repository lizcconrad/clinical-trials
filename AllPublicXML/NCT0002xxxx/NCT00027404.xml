  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to determine the effect of fluoxetine in the treatment of adult autism and on
      functional ability and behavior associated with autism. Evidence suggests abnormal serotonin
      function in autism. Fluoxetine is a selective inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.

      Eligible patients will undergo comprehensive evaluation. Informants familiar with the patient
      will also provide information. Patients will be randomized to receive treatment or placebo.
      During the 12-week treatment there will be weekly monitoring for the first 4 weeks and
      biweekly monitoring for the next 8 weeks. The drug dosage will be increased each week as
      tolerated by the patient. Serum levels of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine will be documented at
      Week 12.
