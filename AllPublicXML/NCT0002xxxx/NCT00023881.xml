      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing
      so they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bortezomib in treating patients who
      have chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of bortezomib, in terms of response rate, duration of response,
           and survival of patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous
           leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib intravenous (IV) over 3-5 seconds twice weekly on weeks
      1-2. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-30
      months.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
             in chronic or accelerated phase, defined as having any of the following:

               -  Peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM) blasts at least 10% but less than 30%

               -  PB or BM blasts and promyelocytes at least 20%

               -  PB or BM basophils at least 20%

               -  Progressive splenomegaly (at least 10 cm confirmed twice at least 4 weeks apart
                  or 50% increase in splenomegaly over 4 weeks)
