      RATIONALE: Photodynamic therapy uses light and drugs that make cancer cells more sensitive to
      light to kill tumor cells. This may be effective treatment for skin cancer and cancer that is
      metastatic to the skin.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy in treating
      patients who have either squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or solid tumors
      metastatic to the skin.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) when
           administered with a fixed dose of light in patients with advanced cutaneous
           malignancies.

        -  Determine the MTD of the light when administered with a fixed dose of study drug in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of Pc 4 in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical antitumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 (Pc 4) IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by light
      therapy over 30-60 minutes on day 2. Treatment repeats in 6 weeks for a total of 2 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and a fixed dose of light until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pc 4 is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding
      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for Pc 4 is
      determined, additional patients are treated with a fixed dose of Pc 4 (2 dose levels below
      the MTD) and escalating doses of light until the MTD is determined. The MTD of light is
      defined as above.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks (or 8 weeks if treated lesion on lower extremity has not
      healed) and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study annually.
