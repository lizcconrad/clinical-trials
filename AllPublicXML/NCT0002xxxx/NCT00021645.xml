    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate whether vitamin E can help treat swelling of the macular area of the
      retina (the back part of the eye) associated with uveitis (inflammatory eye disease). The
      macula is responsible for sharp vision; swelling in this area is one cause of vision loss in
      uveitis patients. Macular swelling is also associated with eye problems related to diabetes.
      In these patients, the swelling is thought to be caused by a substance called vascular
      endothelial growth factor, or VEGF. High doses of vitamin E have been used to treat these eye
      problems in diabetics. This study is a first step to find out if vitamin E will help reduce
      the retinal swelling in uveitis, which may also be caused by VEGF.

      Patients 9 years of age and older with macular edema associated with uveitis may be eligible
      for this study. Candidates will be screened with the following tests and procedures:

        -  Medical history and physical examination. This includes measurement of vital signs
           (blood pressure, pulse, temperature and breathing rate) and examination of the head and
           neck, heart, lungs, abdomen, arms and legs.

        -  Eye examination. This includes measurement of visual acuity using a vision chart,
           measurement of eye pressure and examination of the pupils and eye movements. The pupils
           will be dilated with drops to permit examination of the back of the eye.

        -  Fluorescein angiography. This test uses a yellow dye (fluorescein) to take photos of the
           retina. The fluorescein is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in
           the eye. The camera flashes a blue light into the eye and takes pictures of the retina.
           The pictures show if the dye has leaked from the blood vessels into the retina.

        -  Stereoscopic color fundus photography. These are photographs of the back of the eye,
           taken after the pupils have been dilated with drops.

        -  Optical coherence tomography. This test measures the macular swelling. It is used to
           determine if the swelling is getting worse, better or staying the same.

        -  Blood tests. About a tablespoon of blood is drawn to measure inflammation and cell
           counts and side effects of treatment.

        -  Pregnancy test. All women of child-bearing potential are tested for pregnancy.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to daily treatment with oral high-dose vitamin E (1600
      units) or placebo (a pill with no active ingredient) for 4 months. They will be examined at 2
      months and 4 months with the same tests performed for screening and will return for a final
      clinic visit 1 month after treatment has ended.

      We plan to test the efficacy of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), a potent inhibitor of the
      protein kinase C pathway in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced vascular
      permeability, for the treatment of uveitis-associated macular edema. This will be performed
      using a double-masked, randomized study in which uveitis patients with macular edema will
      receive either alpha-tocopherol or placebo. This study should be considered a pilot study
      that will provide information on design and outcome measurement for the development of a
      larger, definitive, future study. Patients will receive 1600IU/day of Vitamin E or placebo
      for 4 months. The primary outcome will be a visual acuity increase of 10 letters or more from
      baseline to month 4. Secondary outcomes are total area of leakage and macular height as
      determined by fluorescein angiography, changes in CME as measured by stereoscopic color
      photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT), the need for periocular injections or
      additional systemic immunomodulatory medications, and the NEI VFQ summary score.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients with documented cystoid macular edema associated with intraocular inflammatory
        disease. This should be documented both by clinical examination and by fluorescein
        angiography and should be agreed upon by two independent observers.

        Patients must have at least one eye with best corrected visual acuity of 20/32 or less (as
        measured by the ETDRS chart) and macular edema. These will be considered eligible eyes.

        A patient must have at lease one eligible eye with clinical opacity grades of less than or
        equal to 1+ for posterior sub-capsular opacity and less than or equal to 2+ for nuclear
        opacity.

        Patients 9 years and above, of either sex (non-pregnant females), who carry the diagnosis
        of endogenous anterior, intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis.

        Patients may be receiving systemic therapy for the treatment of their cystoid macular
        edema, or may have been treated for the cystoid macular edema in the past.

        Vitreous haze in both eyes equal to or less than 1+ cell and 1+ haze.

        The patient or patient's guardian must understand and sign the protocol informed consent
