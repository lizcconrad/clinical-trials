      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die. It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more
      effective for metastatic cancer of an unknown site of origin.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination
      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have metastatic cancer of an unknown site of
      origin.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the efficacy of the regimens, in terms of tumor response,
      progression-free survival, and overall survival of vincristine, doxorubicin, and
      cyclophosphamide vs epirubicin, cisplatin, and fluorouracil in patients with metastatic
      carcinoma of unknown primary. II. Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.
      III. Compare quality of life and symptom control in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to presence of liver metastases (yes vs no) and type of tumor (adenocarcinoma vs
      non-adenocarcinoma). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive vincristine IV, doxorubicin IV, and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1. Arm II: Patients
      receive epirubicin IV and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously
      on days 1-21. Treatment in both arms repeats every 3 weeks for 3-6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the
      end of courses 2, 4, and 6, and 1 month after completion of therapy. Patients are followed at
      1 month and then until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 398 patients (199 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
