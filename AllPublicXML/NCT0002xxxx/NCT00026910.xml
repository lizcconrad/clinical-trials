  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the cause(s) of clinical drug resistance in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are
      unknown, in vitro studies suggest that abnormalities of the cell cycle and mechanisms of
      apoptosis may play an important role. Clinical studies have now shown that p53, bcl-2 and
      tumor proliferation all have significant effects on clinical drug resistance. To further
      investigate the role of genes that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, we wish to correlate
      the expression of multiple molecular targets [including but not restricted to bcl-2, BAX,
      bcl-6, MIB-1, p53, p21, p27, p16, cyclin D(1), cyclin A, cyclin E, mdm-2, cpp 32, mcl-1,
      EBER-1, ALK, and a panel of B, T and other cell lineage markers], involving these pathways,
      with clinical outcome following treatment with combination chemotherapy. All clinical data
      and tissue samples for this study will come from patients who have been previously enrolled
      on two protocols for the initial treatment of aggressive lymphomas. No new patients will be
      enrolled for this study.
