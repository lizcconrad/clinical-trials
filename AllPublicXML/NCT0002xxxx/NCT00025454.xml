      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so
      they stop growing or die.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of R115777 in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of R115777 in patients with advanced malignant
           solid tumors.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the potential predictors of response in patients treated with drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral R115777 twice daily on weeks 1 and 3. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of R115777 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
