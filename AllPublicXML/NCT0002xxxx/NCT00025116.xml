      RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth of tumor cells
      and slow the growth of prostate cancer. It is not yet known which dose of ZD 1839 is more
      effective in treating prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare different doses of ZD 1839 in treating patients
      who have prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of 2 different doses of ZD 1839, in terms of objective response,
           PSA response, and duration of response, in patients with hormone-refractory
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Compare the tolerability and quantitative toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine whether there is an association between any response or stable disease and
           clinical benefit as assessed by changes in quality of life of patients treated with
           these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      measurable disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral, low-dose ZD 1839 twice daily on day 1 and once daily on
           days 2-28 during course 1 and then once daily on days 1-28 during subsequent courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral, high-dose ZD 1839 as in arm I. Treatment in both arms
           continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of each course during study, and then at
      4 weeks after study.

      Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      until disease progression. All other patients are followed at 4 weeks only.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-60 patients (15-30 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  PSA at least 20 ng/mL at study entry

          -  Must have documented evidence of disease progression, defined by 1 of the following
             conditions:

               -  Rising PSA documented after discontinuation of peripheral antiandrogens

                    -  Minimum evidence of progression is a 25% increase in PSA over the reference
                       value, provided that the increase is at least 5 ng/mL

                         -  Must have a first increase in PSA documented at least 1 week after the
                            reference value and a second increase in PSA documented at least 1 week
                            after the first increase
