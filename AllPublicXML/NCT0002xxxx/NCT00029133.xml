  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a large multi-center, prospective, randomized trial designed to determine whether
      mild intraoperative hypothermia results in improved neurological outcome in patients with an
      acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who are undergoing an open craniotomy to clip their
      aneurysms.

      The purpose of this trial is to determine whether mild intraoperative body cooling (body
      temperature = 33 degrees Celsius or 91.4 degrees Fahrenheit) during open neurosurgical
      craniotomies for aneurysm clipping improves neurological outcome (measured as 3 months after
      surgery) in patients who have suffered an aneurismal SAH. This may be the only NIH-funded
      trial to examine the impact of an intraoperative intervention on neurological outcome
      following any neurosurgical procedure, and is certainly the largest trial of its kind yet
      undertaken.

      Many methods have been proposed to &quot;protect&quot; neurosurgical patients from neurological
      complications that can occur during and after intracranial vascular procedures. However, no
      treatment targeted at the intraoperative period has ever been systematically tested. Mild
      hypothermia was chosen as the treatment to be tested after an extensive review of medical
      literature and discussions with many anesthesiologists and neurosurgeons expert in the field
      suggested it was the intervention most likely to be beneficial. Hypothermia is also easily
      produced in the operating room and most anesthesiologists are familiar with managing mild
      hypothermia. As a result, the investigators felt that a trial of hypothermia was practical
      and reasonably safe.

        -  Adult greater than 18 years old

          -  Non-obese (body mass index less than 35kg/m2)

          -  Non-pregnant

          -  World Federation of Neurologic Surgeons preoperative Grade I, II, or III patients with
             acute SAH and scheduled to undergo open craniotomies for aneurysm clipping within 14
             days of a documented SAH.

          -  There must be no contraindications to cooling (e.g., sickle cell anemia,
             cryoglobulinemia, or severe Raynaud's disease).

          -  Patients must also have pre-SAH Rankin disability scores of 0 to 1 (i.e., no serious
             pre-existing functional disability of any kind), and a perioperative course of
             Nimodipine (a calcium-channel blocker and the only drug known to improve outcome in
             patients with SAH) must be planned.

          -  Each center must have approval from their local Human Subjects Committee to
             participate in the trial and written informed consent from either the patient,
             next-of-kin, or legal guardian is required.
