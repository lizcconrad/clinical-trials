      Phase I/II trial to estimate the maximum tolerated dose of imatinib mesylate in newly
      diagnosed brain stem gliomas and recurrent high grade gliomas and to assess the effectiveness
      of imatinib mesylate in treating young patients who have newly diagnosed intrinsic brain stem
      glioma. Imatinib mesylate may interfere with the growth of tumor cells by blocking the
      enzymes necessary for their growth. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor
      cells. Combining imatinib mesylate with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of imatinib mesylate after completion of
      radiation in children with newly diagnosed poor prognosis brainstem gliomas. (Phase I, strata
      I closed to accrual as of 5/28/04.) II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      imatinib mesylate in children with recurrent high-grade intracranial glioma stratified
      according to the use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (EIACDs). (Phase I, strata IIA
      and IIB closed to accrual as of 8/15/03 and 8/15/04, respectively) III. Determine the safety
      and efficacy of this drug in patients with newly diagnosed diffuse intrinsic brainstem
      gliomas. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore neuroimaging and biological correlatives of therapeutic activity of this regimen
      in these patients. (Phase I, all strata closed to accrual as of 8/15/04) II. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of these regimens in these patients overall and by enzyme-inducing
      anticonvulsant drugs (EIACDs) (Phase I, all strata closed to accrual as of 8/15/04.) III.
      Estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of newly diagnosed
      diffuse intrinsic brainstem gliomas treated with this drug. (Phase I and II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation, multicenter study followed by a phase II.
      Patients are stratified according to tumor type (newly diagnosed intrinsic brainstem glioma
      vs recurrent/refractory intracranial high-grade glioma). Patients in stratum II (phase I
      only) are further stratified according to concurrent use of enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant
      drugs (EIACDs) (yes vs no). Patients are assigned to one of three strata in the phase I
      study.

        -  Phase I

             -  Stratum I (newly diagnosed brainstem glioma): Patients undergo radiotherapy once
                daily five days a week for 6 weeks. Beginning 1-3 weeks after completion of
                radiotherapy, patients without evidence of intratumoral bleed receive oral imatinib
                mesylate twice daily. Imatinib mesylate treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to
                13 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. (Closed
                to accrual as of 5/28/04.)

             -  Stratum II A (recurrent or refractory high-grade intracranial gliomas/no concurrent
                EIACDs): Patients receive imatinib mesylate as in stratum I. (Closed to accrual as
                of 8/15/03.)

             -  Stratum II B (recurrent or refractory high-grade intracranial gliomas and
                concurrent EIACDs): Patients receive imatinib mesylate as in stratum I. (Closed to
                accrual as of 8/15/04.)

      Cohorts of 2-3 patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which it is estimated
      that 20% of patients will experience dose-limiting toxicity. MTDs are independently estimated
      in each strata. For stratum I, newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas, the dose level which at
      least 5 of 6 patients experience no dose-limiting toxicity will be the dose used in the
      efficacy and safety phase (phase II).

        -  Phase II: (Open to accrual as of 5/28/04.)

             -  Stratum I only: Patients undergo radiotherapy as in phase I. Patients receive
                imatinib mesylate at the MTD established in phase I.

      Patients enrolled in the phase I portion and not treated at the MTD are to be followed for
      the shortest of 1) three months after the last protocol based treatment or 2) the date other
      therapy is initiated. Stratum I patients treated at the MTD in the phase I portion and all
      patients in the phase II portion of the study are to be followed until death or withdrawal
      from the study

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 140 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.

    <measure>Number of Participants in Phase I Stratum I With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) Observed During First 8 Weeks (Courses 1 and 2) of Imatinib Therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 of Imatinib Mesylate Therapy to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis population consists of phase I stratum I participants who developed DLT during the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period (course 1 and 2) or who completed the MTD estimation period (courses 1 and 2) without DLTs. DLTs observed during courses 1 and 2 were used to estimate the MTD. The estimated MTD based on the 23 participants who either had a DLT during course 1 or 2 or completed courses 1 and 2 without DLT is 265 mg/m2/day.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 1 of Imatinib Mesylate Therapy to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis population consisted of phase I stratum II participants who developed DLT during the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period (courses 1 and 2) or who completed the MTD estimation period (courses 1 and 2) without DLTs. DLTs observed during courses 1 and 2 were used to estimate the MTD. The estimated MTD based on the DLT analysis population of 20 in stratum IIA was 465 mg/m2/day. An MTD was not established in stratum IIB as no DLTs were observed at the higher dose levels of 620 and 800 mg/m2/day.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants from PBTC member institutions were enrolled on the phase I component between 09May2001 and 28MAY2004 (stratum I), 15AUG2003 (stratum IIA), and 15AUG2004 (stratum IIB). The phase II component of the study opened on 28MAY2004 and was terminated on 13APR2005 due to poor accrual.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The intent of the phase I part of the study was to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) independently in stratum I, in stratum IIA, and in stratum IIB. The estimated MTD from stratum I was the recommended dose for the phase II part. Phase I participants in stratum I who received study drug at the MTD contributed to the phase II objectives.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Stratum I: Radiation + Imatinib Mesylate</title>
          <description>Children with newly diagnosed brainstem gliomas received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 8 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity.
Local irradiation (RT) was administered concurrently with imatinib at the initiation of treatment with conventional fractionation at 180 cGy/day fractions, five days per week for six weeks, to a total dose of 5580 cGy.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage during RT, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to enroll patients without evidence of hemorrhage prior to RT and begin imatinib treatment 2 weeks (± 1 week) after completion of RT.
Participants enrolled to the phase II part received imatinib at the MTD (from phase I) after RT.
Six participants were enrolled on the phase I before the amendment, 29 after the amendment, and 1 on the phase II.</description>

          <description>Children with recurrent high-grade gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (EIACDs) received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 350 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 4 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity. Study participants did not receive radiation therapy in this stratum.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to extend the MTD estimation period to 8 weeks (courses 1 and 2).

        <title>Number of Participants in Phase I Stratum I With Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) Observed During First 8 Weeks (Courses 1 and 2) of Imatinib Therapy</title>
        <description>The dose limiting toxicity (DLT) analysis population consists of phase I stratum I participants who developed DLT during the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period (course 1 and 2) or who completed the MTD estimation period (courses 1 and 2) without DLTs. DLTs observed during courses 1 and 2 were used to estimate the MTD. The estimated MTD based on the 23 participants who either had a DLT during course 1 or 2 or completed courses 1 and 2 without DLT is 265 mg/m2/day.</description>

            <description>Children with newly diagnosed brainstem gliomas received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 8 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity.
Local irradiation (RT) was administered concurrently with imatinib at the initiation of treatment with conventional fractionation at 180 cGy/day fractions, five days per week for six weeks, to a total dose of 5580 cGy.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage during RT, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to enroll patients without evidence of hemorrhage prior to RT and begin imatinib treatment 2 weeks (± 1 week) after completion of RT.
Participants enrolled to the phase II part received imatinib at the MTD (from phase I) after RT.
Six participants were enrolled on the phase I before the amendment, 29 after the amendment, and 1 on the phase II.</description>

            <description>Children with newly diagnosed brainstem gliomas received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 8 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity.
Local irradiation (RT) was administered concurrently with imatinib at the initiation of treatment with conventional fractionation at 180 cGy/day fractions, five days per week for six weeks, to a total dose of 5580 cGy.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage during RT, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to enroll patients without evidence of hemorrhage prior to RT and begin imatinib treatment 2 weeks (± 1 week) after completion of RT.
Participants enrolled to the phase II part received imatinib at the MTD (from phase I) after RT.

          <title>Stratum I: Radiation + Imatinib Mesylate</title>
          <description>Children with newly diagnosed brainstem gliomas received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 200 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 8 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity.
Local irradiation (RT) was administered concurrently with imatinib at the initiation of treatment with conventional fractionation at 180 cGy/day fractions, five days per week for six weeks, to a total dose of 5580 cGy.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage during RT, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to enroll patients without evidence of hemorrhage prior to RT and begin imatinib treatment 2 weeks (± 1 week) after completion of RT.
Participants enrolled to the phase II part received imatinib at the MTD (from phase I) after RT.
Six participants were enrolled on the phase I before the amendment, 29 after the amendment, and 1 on the phase II.</description>

          <title>Stratum IIA: Imatinib Mesylate</title>
          <description>Children with recurrent high-grade gliomas not on enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drugs (EIACDs) received imatinib twice daily at a starting dose of 350 mg/m2/day. Treatment cycles were 4 weeks (maximum tolerated dose (MTD) estimation period - first 4 weeks) and imatinib was continued for up to 52 weeks in the absence of progression or serious toxicity. Study participants did not receive radiation therapy in this stratum.
Because of concerns of intratumoral hemorrhage, the protocol was amended (08JAN2003) to extend the MTD estimation period to 8 weeks (courses 1 and 2).
Ten participants were enrolled on the phase I before the amendment and 23 after the amendment.</description>
