      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency electric current to kill tumor cells
      and may help to relieve pain caused by bone metastases.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation in relieving
      pain in patients who have bone metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation, in terms of pain relief at 4 weeks,
           in patients with painful bone metastases.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Compare the change in pain interference with daily life and analgesic use at 4 weeks vs
           baseline in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to recurrence of worst pain in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to targeted tumor(s) on day 0 (multiple tumors
      may receive ablation in multiple sessions). Patients who achieve a reduction in worst pain of
      at least 2 points within 4-8 weeks but experience recurring pain at the RFA site or are
      diagnosed with a new painful lesion within 4-24 weeks receive 1 additional treatment to the
      recurring or new site.

      Pain (using the Brief Pain Inventory scale of 0-10), analgesic use, and quality of life are
      assessed at baseline, on day 1, weekly for 4 weeks, and then every 2 weeks for 20 weeks.

      Patients are followed for 6 months beyond the last RFA treatment.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
