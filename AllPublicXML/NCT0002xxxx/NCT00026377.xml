    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: SU5416 may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood flow to the tumor.
      Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells. Hormone therapy using flutamide,
      bicalutamide, leuprolide, or goserelin may fight prostate cancer by reducing the production
      of androgens. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining
      SU5416, hormone therapy, and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 plus hormone therapy and
      radiation therapy in treating patients who have prostate cancer.

      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the safety of SU5416 in combination with standard androgen ablation
      and radiotherapy in patients with intermediate or advanced-stage prostate cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive oral
      bicalutamide once daily or oral flutamide three times daily for at least 1 month followed by
      leuprolide or goserelin subcutaneously once monthly for four months. Beginning after the
      fourth administration of leuprolide or goserelin, patients undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week
      for 7-8 weeks. Beginning one month before radiotherapy and continuing until 1 month after
      radiotherapy, patients receive SU5416 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 4. Treatment repeats
      weekly in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-12
      patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 3 of 12 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 4-6 weeks for 4 months and
      then every 8-12 weeks for 8 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>Subjects receive 5 months of hormone suppression therapy consisting of 1 month of Bicalutamide or Flutamide followed by 4 months of leuprolide or goserlin injections. After completion of at least 12 weeks of hormone therapy, subjects will receive 7 1/2 weeks of radiation therapy. SU5416 will be given by IV infusion starting 4 weeks before beginning radiation treatment and continuing until 4 weeks after completion of radiation. Multiple doses of SU5416 will be studied.</description>
