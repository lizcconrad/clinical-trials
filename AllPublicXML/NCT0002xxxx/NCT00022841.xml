    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the drug pamidronate can safely and
      effectively improve bone mineral density in growing children who have bone disease caused by
      taking steroid medications. People who take steroid medications called glucocorticoids, like
      prednisone or dexamethasone, for long periods almost always have decreased bone density and
      are at increased risk of breaking a bone. Research has shown that pamidronate improves bone
      density in adults who take glucocorticoids. However, use of pamidronate is not approved in
      children because it has not been extensively tested in children. It is possible that children
      will have a different response or unique problems with the medication because their bones are
      still growing. We will assign all study participants to one of two groups. One group will
      receive pamidronate intravenously (through a vein) every 3 months in addition of daily oral
      calcium and vitamin D and the other group will receive calcium and vitamin D. The study is
      scheduled to run for 36 months, with visits to the study center once every 3 months.

      This is a randomized study to determine whether pamidronate can safely and effectively
      improve bone mineral density (BMD) in children with glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.
      After we stratify participants on the basis of whether they are taking glucocorticoids for
      treatment of inflammatory disease or for immunosuppression following organ transplant, we
      will randomize them to receive daily calcium and vitamin D in addition to 30 mg/kg (1 mg/kg
      for weight less then 30 kg) of pamidronate in normal saline every 3 months or daily calcium
      and vitamin D only for 24 months, followed by a 12-month followup period off of therapy. We
      will measure endpoints at 24 months. The primary endpoint is lumbar spine BMD determined by
      DEXA. Secondary endpoints will include volumetric BMD of the spine, proximal femur BMD and
      volumetric BMD, total body bone mineral content (BMC), fracture incidence, bone turnover
      markers, and growth and skeletal changes. The study radiologist will be blinded to treatment
      group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic inflammatory disease or transplant recipient, currently on steroid therapy at
             supraphysiologic dose (greater than hydrocortisone equivalent of 15 mg/m2/day) for
             more than 6 months

          -  Bone age less then 14 years in females, 16 years in males, to correspond to &lt; 90% of
             peak BMD

        And

          -  Presence of glucocorticoid induced bone disease defined by:

          -  Presence of at least one atraumatic fracture (defined as fracture that occurs during
             activities of daily living, without a fall), or a vertebral fracture, OR

          -  AP lumbar spine BMD (determined by DEXA) of more than 2 or more SD below the mean
             lumbar BMD for a healthy child of similar stature (height age). OR

          -  A low trauma fracture (suspicious fracture - defined as a fracture the occurs with a
             fall from standing height or below, and not during a high velocity activity) and AP
             spine BMD 1.5 or more SD below the mean for height age, OR

          -  Recent loss of BMD of greater then 3% over a 6 month or greater interval at any one of
             the following sites, lumbar spine, total hip or whole body (excluding head). OR

          -  Recent increase in BMD of less then 3% over a 12 month period at all of the three
             sites listed above.
