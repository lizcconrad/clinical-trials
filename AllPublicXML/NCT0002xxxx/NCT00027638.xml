      RATIONALE: Thalidomide may stop the growth of neuroendocrine tumors by stopping blood flow to
      the tumor.

      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of thalidomide in treating patients who
      have metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of thalidomide in patients with metastatic low-grade
           neuroendocrine tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on weeks 1-8. Courses repeat every 8
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study.
