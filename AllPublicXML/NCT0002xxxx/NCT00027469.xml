    <textblock>
      This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to picture the kidney and renal arteries
      (arteries that supply blood to the kidney) in patients scheduled for kidney artery angiogram
      and angioplasty/stenting procedures. An angiogram is a way of taking pictures of arteries
      that shows areas of narrowing caused by atherosclerosis-a buildup of plaque on the vessel
      wall. Angioplasty/stent is a treatment procedure in which a balloon-tipped catheter is
      inserted in the artery and advanced to the area of blockage to open the vessel, increasing
      blood flow to the kidney. A permanent metal tube (stent) may or may not be put in place to
      maintain the opening. During either of these invasive procedures, small pieces of plaque can
      break off and travel in the blood to lodge elsewhere in the body. This is called
      embolization. Lodged in the kidney, the embolus can impair kidney function. Currently, these
      emboli cannot be detected. A new way of visualizing the kidneys that allows detection of
      emboli may reveal whether material has moved to the kidneys and predict if there will be any
      kidney damage.

      Patients 21 years of age and older with suspected kidney artery disease scheduled for
      invasive angiographic evaluation in NIH protocol 95-H-0047 may be eligible for this study.

      Participants will be assigned to one of two study groups, based on the angiogram findings and
      the decision to have the angioplasty/stent procedure. Participants in both groups will have
      baseline MRI scans up to 2 weeks before the invasive procedure (angiogram with or without
      angioplasty/stent) and again within a day after the procedure. Patients who undergo
      angioplasty/stent will have another MRI study within about a month following the procedure.

      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of body tissues. The patient lies
      on a table that slides into a large hollow tube (the scanner). During part of the scan, a
      material called gadolinium contrast may be injected into a vein. This substance brightens the
      images to better show the kidneys, their blood vessels and blood flow. The procedure lasts
      from about 1 to 2 hours. During the MRI, the heart is monitored with an electrocardiogram
      (EKG) and breathing is monitored with a flexible belt. Blood pressure is measured
      intermittently. The patient can communicate with a staff member at all times.

      Blood samples will be drawn from an arm vein at the initial clinic visit, within a day after
      the procedure and about 1 week after the procedure. For patients who had the
      angioplasty/stent procedure, a third blood sample will be taken within another 6 six weeks.
      The blood samples will be used to check for changes in kidney function.

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is common and is associated with uncontrolled
      hypertension and renal excretory dysfunction. Percutaneous stenting of ARAS effectively
      relieves arterial obstruction, but approximately one-quarter of patients derives no apparent
      clinical benefit or actually suffers deterioration in renal excretory function. There are
      reasons to suspect that percutaneous renal intervention is associated with embolization of
      aorto-ostial atheromatous debris, which may lead to adverse clinical outcomes. There are no
      known clinical, imaging, or biochemical markers of renal embolism or ischemic necrosis.
      Investigational or clinical detection of such events might guide future modification of
      mechanical interventional technique, for example, with the introduction of procedural embolic
      protection devices.

      This pilot study of patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal renal artery stenting
      (PTRAS) will attempt to image embolization using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
