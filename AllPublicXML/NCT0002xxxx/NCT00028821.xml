    <textblock>
      Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of 2-methoxyestradiol in treating patients who have
      advanced solid tumors. 2-methoxyestradiol may stop or slow the growth of solid tumors by
      stopping blood flow to the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the optimal biologic dose and/or maximum tolerated dose of 2-methoxyestradiol in
      patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of this drug in these patients.

      IV. Determine the biologic changes within the tumor of these patients when treated with this
      drug.

      V. Correlate the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of this drug in these patients. VI. Evaluate
      the biologic evidence of angiogenesis inhibition in patients receiving this drug.

      VII. Correlate genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 and sulfotransferases isoforms with
      the pharmacokinetics of this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) once daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 2-ME until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      Patients are followed for 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 19 months.
