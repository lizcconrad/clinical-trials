  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While trastuzumab has been shown to prevent recurrences of breast cancer, some women may also
      experience damage to their heart muscle (including heart failure) as a result of their
      treatment. The investigators hope to learn if standard medications used in heart failure can
      prevent heart damage caused by trastuzumab in women with breast cancer. The investigators
      would also like to know if there are any ways to detect this damage earlier using magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) and blood tests.

      We propose a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study evaluating the efficacy of an
      ACE-inhibitor (perindopril) or a beta blocker (bisoprolol) for the prevention of LV
      remodeling among women with early breast cancer scheduled for chemotherapy and one year of
      trastuzumab. Participants will undergo cardiac MRI at baseline and 3 and 12 months, replacing
      the usual MUGA, as well as a post-treatment cardiac MRI at 24 months to evaluate long-term
      effect.
