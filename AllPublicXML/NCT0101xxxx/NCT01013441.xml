      The purpose of this research study is to test whether giving T-cells (type of white blood
      cell that are also known as immune cells) that have been specially processed in the
      laboratory will help chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients' immune system return to
      normal faster after chemotherapy. This research study will also look into the ability of the
      lab to process the T-cells for infusion and the side effects of giving T-cells to patients
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

      Single arm, multi-center trial to evaluate the efficacy of administering CD3/CD28 stimulated
      T cells to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients following treatment with fludarabine
      or alemtuzumab based chemo- immunotherapy. All patients will undergo an apheresis to collect
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for generation of expanded T cells post-
      chemo-immunotherapy. Those subjects who achieve a complete or partial response to the
      chemoimmunotherapy based regimen will receive an infusion of 1.0 x 1010 (+/- 20%) activated
      autologous T cells expanded from the collected apheresis unit. Prior to T-cell infusion, at
      Day +30, +60, and +365 after T cell infusion, blood draws will be performed to assess immune
      reconstitution and immune function as compared to baseline.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of CLL by immunophenotyping and flow cytometry analysis of blood or bone
             marrow.

          -  Patients with Rai stage III-IV - OR - Patients with Rai stage 0-II

          -  Zubrod performance status of 0-3

          -  Prior treatment with fludarabine or alemtuzumab based regimens.

          -  No untreated or uncontrolled life-threatening infection

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test and agree to
             use a medically accepted form of contraception from the time of initial screening
             through completion of the study

          -  No active CNS disease

          -  Negative tests for HIV antibodies, Hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C
             antibodies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of glucocorticoids (with the exception of inhaled glucocorticoid steroids for
             the use of allergic rhinitis or pulmonary disease) within 2 months prior to
             registration

          -  History of autoimmune disease unrelated to CLL (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, multiple
             sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosis). Autoimmune disease related to CLL, e.g.

        idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) or autoimmune hemolytic anemia, is permitted if
        not requiring active treatment
