    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study that will evaluate the
      safety profile, establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), and inform the recommended phase 2
      dose of MLN4924 as well as evaluate antitumor activity in patients with metastatic melanoma.

    <description>Patients will be administered MLN4924 via an IV infusion. Each 21-day treatment cycle is composed of 2 weeks intermittent dosing of MLN4924 on Days 1, 4, 8 and 11, followed by a rest period of 10 days. A cohort of patients will receive a reduced first dose on Day 1, approximately half the strength of the dose received on Days 4, 8, 11 and dose will not be administered on Day 4 if the Day 1 dose is not tolerated.(Schedule A ramp-up), or continuous weekly dosing (Days 1, 8, and 15) of MLN4924 (Schedule B)</description>

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Female patients who are post menopausal, surgically sterile, or agree to practice 2
             effective methods of contraception or abstain from heterosexual intercourse

          -  Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception or agree to

          -  Suitable venous access for study-required blood sampling

          -  Appropriate functional status, including the recovery from the effects of prior
             antineoplastic therapy, and acceptable organ function as described in the protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:

          -  Major surgery or, serious infections, or infections that required systematic
             antibiotic therapy within 14 days before the first dose of study drug

          -  Systemic antineoplastic or radiation therapy within 14 days or treatment with any
             investigational products within 21 days before the first dose of study treatment

          -  CYP3A inducers within 14 days of study treatment. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors
             and CYP3A inducers are not permitted during the study

          -  Other clinical and laboratory assessments that do not meet the criteria specified in
             the protocol
