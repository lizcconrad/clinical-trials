      RATIONALE: Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Radioactive drugs, such as iobenguane I 131, may carry radiation
      directly to tumor cells and not harm normal cells. Giving vorinostat together with iobenguane
      I 131 may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving vorinostat
      together with iobenguane I 131 in treating patients with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of vorinostat in combination with iobenguane I
           131 in patients with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma.

        -  To define the toxicities of vorinostat in combination with therapeutic doses of
           iobenguane I 131 in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To describe, within the context of a phase I study, the response rate in patients
           treated with vorinostat and iobenguane I 131.

        -  To describe histone acetylation levels and norepinephrine transporter mRNA levels in
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells after treatment with different doses of vorinostat.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and iobenguane I 131 IV over 1Â½-2
      hours on day 3. Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day
      17.

      Blood samples may be collected periodically for correlative biological studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>Patients on study will receive vorinostat orally once daily on days 1 to 14. The starting dose level is 180 mg/M2. The maximum dose is 400 mg. Patients will receive 131- I Metaiodobenzylguanidine on day 3, 1hr after vorinostat dosing. Patients will initially receive 8 mCi/kg 131-I MIBG with 180 mg/m2/dose vorinostat. The dose of 131-I MIBG will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 15 mCi/kg and then to 18 mCi/kg. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Infusion is planned for 2 weeks after MIBG infusion (day 17). The dose for Purged PBSC is a minimum of 2 x 106 viable CD34+ cells/kg and for Unpurged PBSC: a minimum of 2 x 106 viable CD34+ cells/kg. Stem cells must be infused over 15-30 minutes and within 1.5 hours of thawing. Patients will receive filgrastim following hematopoietic stem cell infusion according to institutional guidelines.</description>

Dose level -1). If this combination still exceeds the maximum tolerated dose, then a dose level using reduced dose 131-I MIBG will be studied (6 mCi/kg. Dose level -2).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be at least 24 months and no older than 30 years of age when registered
             on study.

          -  Patients must have relapsed neuroblastoma, refractory neuroblastoma that had less than
             a partial response to standard treatment or persistent neuroblastoma that had at least
             a partial response to standard treatment.

          -  Patients who have at least a partial response to standard treatment who still have
             neuroblastoma that can be seen on CT/MRI or MIBG scans must have a surgical biopsy
             done of the tumor to confirm that it is neuroblastoma. Patients with relapsed or
             refractory neuroblastoma do not need to have a biopsy done to enter on study.

          -  Patients must have evidence of MIBG uptake into tumor at one site within 4 weeks prior
             to entry on study and subsequent to any intervening therapy.

          -  Patients must have a stem cell product available that meets study criteria. If they
             don't already have stem cells frozen away then they must be able to have a stem cell
             collection done to collect the necessary amount of stem cells for study entry and
             these stem cells must meet study criteria.

          -  Patients must have adequate heart, kidney, liver and bone marrow function. Patients
             who have bone marrow disease must meet the bone marrow function criteria to enter the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  They have had treatment with 131I-MIBG before.

          -  They have had prior treatment with vorinostat or other HDAC inhibitor.

          -  They have had a stem cell transplant using another person as the stem cell donor. (You
             can still be in the study if a previous transplant used your own stem cells)

          -  They have other medical problems that could get much worse if they had this treatment.

          -  They are on dialysis for bad kidney function.

          -  They have a history of unexplained blood clot, pulmonary embolus, thrombotic stroke,
             or arterial clot.

          -  They are pregnant or breast feeding.

          -  They have active infections such as hepatitis or fungal infections.

          -  They had total body radiation or radiation to the entire belly or a large amount of
             radiation to the liver or kidney (some radiation to the liver or kidneys is ok).

          -  They can't cooperate with the special precautions that are needed during MIBG
             treatment.
