  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether zanamivir aqueous solution given by
      intravenous injection is safe in treating hospitalized patients with confirmed influenza
      infection. A single arm open-label design has been selected to achieve the primary objective
      of providing regulatory authorities with safety data on IV zanamivir.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, Phase II, multi-center, single arm study to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of IV zanamivir 600mg twice daily for 5 days in hospitalized subjects
      with laboratory confirmed influenza infection. The initial 5-day treatment course may be
      extended for up to 5 additional days if viral shedding is determined to be ongoing or if
      clinical symptoms warrant further treatment with IV zanamivir.

      Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled into the study (approximately 150
      adult/adolescent subjects and approximately 50 pediatric subjects). Adult (&gt;/= 18 years of
      age) with normal renal function will receive 600mg per dose. Pediatric (6 months to &lt;13
      years)/adolescent (&gt;13 years to &lt;18 years) subjects will receive an age-adjusted,
      weight-based dose (not to exceed the 600 mg adult dose) intended to provide comparable
      systemic exposures to 600mg in adults. Subjects with renal impairment will receive an
      adjusted dose based on calculated creatinine clearance and renal replacement modality.

      Serum pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed in subjects across all age groups
      wherever possible. Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted, in real-time to the extent
      possible, when 4 subjects (from whom samples can be obtained) are enrolled in each of the
      following age cohorts: 6 months to less than 1 year; 1 to less than 2 years, and 2 to less
      than 6 years to determine the need for pediatric dose adjustments. PK assessments are
      required in the first 4 subjects enrolled in the 6 months to less than 1 year age cohort, and
      PK data must be analyzed and IV zanamivir dosage must be reviewed before additional subjects
      in this age cohort can be enrolled.

      The study duration is approximately 28 days for subjects whose treatment duration is 5 days,
      and up to approximately 33 days for subjects whose treatment duration is extended to a
      maximum of 10 days. The study will consist of Pre-dose Baseline Assessments (Day 1), During
      Treatment Assessments (Days 1 to 5, and up to Day 10), and Follow-up Assessments on the
      following days: Post-Treatment +2 +5, +9, +16 and +23 Days. If the first dose of IV zanamivir
      is administered in the afternoon/evening of Day 1, the twice daily dosing schedule will
      result in one treatment day encompassing two calendar days. For subjects who have been
      discharged from hospital, the Post-Treatment +2, +5, +9 and +16 Days Assessments can be made
      by telephone contact.

          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. AEs that occured during the study were evaluated by the Investigator and graded according to the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS) table for grading the severity of adult and pediatric AEs. Grade 3=severe; Grade 4=potentially life threatening.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Hematology Values Relative to the Normal Range at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 5</title>
        <description>Blood samples for laboratory assessments were collected at Baseline (Day [D] 1), Days 3 and 5, and on post-treatment +2 days (if hospitalized) and post-treatment +23 days. Hematology parameters included hemoglobin, total neutrophils (TN), and white blood cell (WBC) count. The number of participants with values that were high (H)/normal (N)/low (L) relative to the normal range at Baseline (D 1) and D 5 for the indicated hematology parameters are summarized. Baseline is defined as the last pre-treatment value collected. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Median Oxygen Saturation Measured Via Transcutaneous Oximetry (TCPO2) at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 5</title>
        <description>TCPO2 is a noninvasive test that directly measures the oxygen level of tissue beneath the skin. Because oxygen is carried to tissues by blood flow in the arteries, TCPO2 is an indirect measure of blood flow. The percent (%) oxygen saturation was measured at Baseline (Day 1), Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; and post-treatment +2 days, +5 days, +9 days, +16 days (assessments to be done if participant remained hospitalized), and +23 days. Oxygen saturation was assessed once daily during inpatient follow-up visits. The median oxygen saturation values at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 5 are summarized. Baseline is defined as the last pre-treatment value collected. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X, X, X, X in the category titles).</description>

          <title>Median Oxygen Saturation Measured Via Transcutaneous Oximetry (TCPO2) at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 5</title>
          <description>TCPO2 is a noninvasive test that directly measures the oxygen level of tissue beneath the skin. Because oxygen is carried to tissues by blood flow in the arteries, TCPO2 is an indirect measure of blood flow. The percent (%) oxygen saturation was measured at Baseline (Day 1), Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10; and post-treatment +2 days, +5 days, +9 days, +16 days (assessments to be done if participant remained hospitalized), and +23 days. Oxygen saturation was assessed once daily during inpatient follow-up visits. The median oxygen saturation values at Baseline (Day 1) and Day 5 are summarized. Baseline is defined as the last pre-treatment value collected. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X, X, X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline in viral load was measured from nasopharyngeal swab samples, as determined by RT-PCR (PCR positive at Baseline). Nasopharyngeal swab samples were collected at Baseline (Day 1); Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 10; and, only if the participants had continued symptoms and were hospitalized, post-treatment (PT) samples were collected at +2 days, +5 days, +9 days, +16 days, and +23 days. 'PT +23 days' also comprises viral load values at early study withdrawal. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X, X, X in the category titles). &quot;NA&quot; indicates that data are not available/analysis was not performed.</description>

        <description>Viral RNA isolated from participants at Baseline (Day 1) and post-Baseline visits were sequenced to determine the presence of TE neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) mutations resulting from selective pressure. A mutation was considered to be TE if it was not present at Baseline and was present in the last post-Baseline sample analyzed.These mutations were classified as either known to confer zanamvir resistance or novel mutations with unknown clinical significance.

          <description>Times to return to afebrile status (normal body temperature), normal respiratory status, normal heart rate, and normal systolic blood pressure were assessed. Afebrile status is defined as a temperature &lt;=36.6 axilla, &lt;=37.2 oral, or &lt;=37.7 rectal, core or typanic, degrees Centigrade. A return to normal respiratory status is defined as either: (a) return to pre-morbid oxygen requirement; or (b) return to no need for supplemental oxygen; or (c) respiratory rate &lt;=60, &lt;=40, &lt;=34, &lt;=30, &lt;=24 or &lt;=24 breaths/minute (without supplemental oxygen) for Cohorts 1-6 respectively . A normal HR is defined as &lt;=160, &lt;=150, &lt;=140, &lt;=120, &lt;=100 or &lt;=100 bpm for Cohorts 1-6 respectively, and a normal SBP is defined as &gt;=70, &gt;=74, &gt;=76, &gt;=80, &gt;=90 or &gt;=90 mmHg for Cohorts 1-6 respectively. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X, X, X, X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Geometric Mean Maximum Serum Concentration (Cmax) of Zanamivir at the End of Infusion</title>
        <description>The Cmax of zanamivir was evaluated at the end of infusion.

        <title>Geometric Mean Terminal Half Life (t1/2) of Zanamivir</title>
        <description>The t1/2 of zanamivir was evaluated. Terminal half life is defined as the time it takes for a substance to lose half of its pharmacologic, physiologic, or radiologic activity. Serial blood samples for PK analysis were collected if possible in conjunction with the initial dose on Day 1 (5-7 serial samples) and over a dosing interval during repeat dosing on Day 3, 4, or 5 (5 serial samples). PK data for all participants with available blood samples were analyzed. PK data for those participants with a CLcr&gt;=80 mL/minutes (&gt;=80 mL/minute/1.73m^2 for cohorts 1-4) and who received an ID and a MD of 14 mg/kg (6 months to &lt;6 years of age), 12 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg (6 to &lt;18 years of age) or 600 mg zanamivir (&gt;=18 years of age) (represented by n=X in the category titles) were summarized. &quot;NA&quot; indicates that data are not available/analysis was not performed.</description>

          <title>Geometric Mean Serum Clearance of Zanamivir</title>
          <description>The serum clearance of zanamivir was evaluated. Clearance is defined as the volume of zanamivir per unit time eliminated from serum. Serial blood samples for PK analysis were collected if possible in conjunction with the initial dose on Day 1 (5-7 serial samples) and over a dosing interval during repeat dosing on Days 3, 4, or 5 (5 serial samples). PK data for all participants with available blood samples were analyzed. PK data for those participants with a CLcr &gt;=80 mL/minutes (&gt;=80 mL/minute/1.73m^2 for cohorts 1-4) and who received an ID and a MD 14 mg/kg (6 months to &lt;6 years of age), 12 mg/kg, not to exceed 600 mg (6 to &lt;18 years of age) or 600 mg zanamivir (&gt;=18 years of age) (represented by n=X in the category titles) were summarized. &quot;NA&quot; indicates that data are not available/analysis was not performed.</description>
