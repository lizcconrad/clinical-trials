      Primary Aim

        -  Evaluate whether human embryo exposure to physiologic levels of oxygen during culture
           improves the percentage of women who deliver a baby following in vitro fertilization and
           embryo transfer.

      Hypothesis to be tested: Physiologic oxygen tension during embryo culture, which approximates
      the oxygen tension in the fallopian tube and uterus, improves live birth rate in clinical In
      Vitro Fertilization Embryo Transfer (IVF-ET).

      Secondary Aims

      Evaluate whether human embryo exposure to physiologic levels of oxygen during culture during
      in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer

        -  improves embryo cleavage

        -  improves clinical pregnancy rate

        -  reduces multiple pregnancy rate

        -  reduces miscarriage rate

      Hypothesis to be tested: Physiologic oxygen tension during embryo culture, which approximates
      the oxygen tension in the fallopian tube and uterus, improves embryo cleavage and clinical
      pregnancy rates and reduces miscarriage rates in clinical IVF-ET.

      Study Design

      This will be a multi-center, prospective, double-blind clinical trial of physiologic (5%)
      oxygen tension in culture media vs. standard of care, atmospheric (SOC, 20%) oxygen tension
      with 840 eligible couples recruited to participate. The randomization scheme will be
      coordinated through the central data coordinating center (DCC-Yale) and the randomization
      will be stratified by age group of the woman (18-34, 35-37, 38-40 and 40-42) and each
      participating site.

      Treatment

      Couples will be randomized to either have their gametes and embryos placed in a physiologic
      (5%) oxygen atmosphere or in the currently widely used atmospheric (20%) oxygen atmosphere.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        The critical inclusion criteria will be the diagnosis of infertility and the need for in
        vitro fertilization as determined by the treating clinician. (We do not plan to alter the
        standard of care for the indication for IVF at any of the sites.)

          -  Couple's age must be between 18 and 42 years old

          -  Patient and partner are scheduled to undergo in vitro fertilization for treatment of
             infertility

          -  Couple able to participate in a research project and A) Able to understand study
             requirements B) Willing to sign informed consent C) Able to return for required
             follow-up D) Have access to telephone

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Critical exclusion criteria for this trial will be medical conditions which may complicate
        treatment or no plans to undergo embryo transfer, as in patients banking embryos prior to
        cancer therapy. In addition, donor egg and frozen embryo transfer cycles will be excluded.

          -  Medical contraindication to egg retrieval or pregnancy

          -  Inability to participate in a research project (Non-English speaking or unable to read
             or write and/or concurrent participation in any other interventional trial)

          -  Couple with more than three previous failed IVF cycles

          -  Donor egg and frozen embryo transfer cycles
