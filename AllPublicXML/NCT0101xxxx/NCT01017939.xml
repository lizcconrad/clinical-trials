    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of multiple doses of abiraterone acetate
      plus prednisone on the pharmacokinetics (study of what the body does to a drug) of single
      doses of dextromethorphan hydrobromide and theophylline in patients with castration resistant
      prostate cancer.

      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study of abiraterone
      acetate plus prednisone in male patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer. This study will consist of screening, treatment, and follow-up periods, and will have
      2 study groups. Patients in Group A and B will receive daily abiraterone acetate (1000 mg)
      plus prednisone (5 mg) twice daily beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1 until disease progression.
      Patients in Group A will take dextromethorphan hydrobromide 30 mg administered orally once
      daily on Day -8 and Day 8 of Cycle 1. Patients in Group B will take theophylline 100 mg
      administered orally once daily on Day -8 and Day 8 of Cycle 1. Serial pharmacokinetic samples
      will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the study.
