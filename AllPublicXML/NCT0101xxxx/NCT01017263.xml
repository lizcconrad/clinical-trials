      The purpose of this study to assess the effects of chronic administration of Vyvanse
      (lis-dexamphetamine) on glucose metabolism in a sample of children and adolescents with
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who also have glucose intolerance and are
      obese.

    <description>The study was terminated due to lack of enrollment therefore outcome measures were not assessed. If completed, the expected outcomes would have shown an improvement of the subject's fasting and 2 hour post prandial glucose values, insulin levels and HbA1c. However, all of the subjects recruited did not have abnormal values to start with. The two subjects who were enrolled were the younger kids to which the entry lab criteria do not apply.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Potential participants are pre-screened at the Duke Obesity Clinic. Eligible participants then come to the Duke ADHD Clinic for their first study visit.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>At the screening visit, psychiatric evaluation and fasting labs were obtained to determine eligibility. Of the 14 subjects only 2 qualified and received study drug. Reasons for screen fails: 8-did not meet lab parameters for glucose intolerance, 1-elevated BP, 1- elevated TSH, 1- doing well with current ADHD treatment, 1- diagnosed with depression.</pre_assignment_details>
