  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was based on baseline data derived from a large prospective study called the Suwon
      Project (SP), a cohort comprising random clustering samples of elderly people, all of whom
      are ethnic Koreans aged over 60 years.

    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence supporting the protective effect of health behaviors against
      cognitive decline and dementia in older persons. With this increasing evidence and a better
      understanding of the underlying mechanisms, lifestyle modification is likely to be
      increasingly promoted as a convincing strategy for maintaining cognitive health in later
      life.

      The study protocol included cognitive screening through the Korean version of the Mini-Mental
      State Examination (K-MMSE), which has been validated for the Korean-speaking population ({YW,
      1997 #88}Kang YW et al., 1997), recording of the subject's medical history. A Korean study in
      the community defined the cut-off point of K-MMSE score during the screening of dementia as
      17/18 points; the sensitivity and specificity of the findings were 91% and 86%, respectively
      ({YW, 1997 #88}Kim et al., 2003). Based on these results, we defined cognitive impairment
      (CI) as the group that had a K-MMSE score lower than 17, and not cognitive impairment (NCI)
      was defined as the group that had a K-MMSE score higher than 18.

    <measure>Change of Cognitive Function Measured by a Mini Mental State Examination Scores on a Scale According to Study Group</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. It ranges from 0 to 30 points. The higher scores mean better outcome. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.
In the time span of about 10 minutes it samples various functions including arithmetic, memory and orientation.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was conducted from August 2008 to December 2010 at a geriatric mental health community center in Suwon, south Korea. The center, which has been established since 2008 and has outreach sites throughout the districts, provides a range of social, health, educational, and recreational services for users of elderly groups.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Criteria for exclusion included severe visual or hearing impairment and a previous diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, liver disease, alcoholism, or known terminal illness. Prior to initiating the study, we obtained a list of all senior citizen centers. A random number table was used to classify the intervention group.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change of Cognitive Function Measured by a Mini Mental State Examination Scores on a Scale According to Study Group</title>
        <description>The mini–mental state examination (MMSE) or Folstein test is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. It ranges from 0 to 30 points. The higher scores mean better outcome. It is also used to estimate the severity of cognitive impairment at a given point in time and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time, thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.
In the time span of about 10 minutes it samples various functions including arithmetic, memory and orientation.</description>
