      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is characterised by a partial or complete collapse of the
      upper airway during sleep. The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway
      Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive airway
      pressure to the upper airway via a tube and mask. Humidification is used during CPAP therapy
      to improve the comfort of the delivered air and to alleviate nasal dryness/congestion.

      The latest design of a CPAP device, known as Nexus (S9), encompasses new features including
      an improved humidification system (heated tube and climate control), reduced noise, improved
      comfort of breathing, and a new user interface.

      This study will assess whether compliance on CPAP therapy is improved on the Nexus (S9) CPAP,
      and will assess the usability of the Nexus (S9) CPAP

    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a condition characterised by the partial or complete
      collapse of the upper airway during sleep. OSA comprises a continuous spectrum of severity
      ranging from simple snoring and upper airway resistance through mild to severe symptomatic
      obstructive hypopnoea and apnoea. The prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in the adult
      population is 24% males and 9% for females. The prevalence of symptomatic OSA in the adult
      population has been estimated to be 4% in males and 2% in females. These patients demonstrate
      behavioural and neuropsychological consequences to varying degrees, including excessive
      daytime sleepiness, intellectual deterioration and depression. More serious consequences
      include arterial systemic hypertension, arterial pulmonary hypertension and heart disease.

      The treatment of choice for OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). CPAP acts as a
      positive airway splint, delivering a fixed positive airway pressure to the upper airway via a
      tube and mask. Humidification is used during CPAP therapy to improve comfort of the delivered
      air and alleviate nasal dryness/congestion.

      Compliance with CPAP is a known issue which is affected by many things, including negative
      side effects and issues with the equipment. The most common complaints involve nasal
      dryness/congestion and noise from the machine.

      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the improved humidification system, reduced
      noise, improved comfort of breathing and new user interface on the Nexus (S9) CPAP will
      improve compliance.

      Aims:

        1. To determine if compliance on the new Nexus (S9) CPAP is improved over the patient's
           usual CPAP

        2. To assess the usability of the Nexus (S9) CPAP.

    <description>The usability quesitonnaire was administered at the end of the 4 week trial of Nexus (S9). Usability was defined as ease of using the Nexus (S9) and overall satisfaction with the Nexus (S9) CPAP. The outcome measure was collected through 11 point Likert questionnaires, where 0 = very poor usability and 10 = excellent usability.</description>

    <description>Fifty subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), established on CPAP therapy (â‰¥ 6 months) were recruited into this study. These patients use their CPAP device every night while sleeping to treat their OSA.
Nexus (S9) is a new CPAP device with improved humidification system (heated tube and climate control), reduced noise, improved comfort of breathing and new user interface. During the study, patients will use this CPAP every night in place of their own CPAP for a period of 4 weeks. Compliance data from the Nexus will then be compared to the patient's usual CPAP pre trialling Nexus and post trialling Nexus.</description>

    <description>The patient will use the new Nexus (S9) CPAP for four weeks in place of their usual CPAP every night when they sleep to treat their OSA. Compliance data will be compared between four weeks on this device to the last four weeks on their current device (CPAP Pre S9). After using the Nexus (S9) CPAP for four weeks, participants will return to their current device for four weeks. Data from this post-trial period will be compared with both the Nexus (S9) four weeks, and the four weeks pre Nexus (S9) usage.</description>
