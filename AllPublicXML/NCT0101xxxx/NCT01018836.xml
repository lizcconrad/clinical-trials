      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs, such as
      riluzole, may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving riluzole together
      with whole-brain radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of riluzole when given
      together with whole-brain radiation therapy in treating patients with brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of riluzole that can be administered
           concurrently with standard whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) in patients with multiple
           brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the long-term toxicity of riluzole when administered with WBRT.

        -  To assess neurocognitive function before and after treatment with riluzole and WBRT.

        -  To determine the MRI response of brain metastasis after treatment with riluzole and
           WBRT.

        -  To compare survival of patients treated with riluzole and WBRT to published historical
           data for patients with brain metastases.

        -  To evaluate the response of brain metastasis to riluzole and WBRT as a function of the
           expression of glutamate receptors on the primary tumor specimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of riluzole.

      Patients receive oral riluzole twice daily beginning on day 0. Beginning within 2 days after
      the initiation of riluzole, patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy for 15 fractions.

      Patients undergo neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments at baseline, at 5 weeks, and
      at 3 months.

      Tumor tissue samples are collected for laboratory biomarker studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

    <description>The first dose of Riluzole will be day 0 of study enrollment. WBRT must begin within 48 hours of the initiation of Riluzole therapy. At the completion of radiation, Riluzole should be discontinued and steroids should be tapered over the course of 1-3 weeks, at the discretion of the treating physicians.</description>
