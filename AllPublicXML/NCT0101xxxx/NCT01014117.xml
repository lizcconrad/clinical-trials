  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SRT2104 is a potent small molecule activator of SIRT1 that has been found to inhibit systemic
      inflammation induced by intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in mice. The
      objective of this study is to test if SRT2104 may be a novel compound for the treatment of
      inflammatory disorders in man.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine if a single or 7 daily doses of SRT2104 attenuates the inflammatory response in normal healthy male subjects after exposure to low-dose endotoxin (LPS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements of inflammation will be conducted on plasma samples obtained on Day7 at -3, 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 12hrs. Samples will also be taken on Day8, approximately 24hrs after dosing on Day7.</time_frame>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine PK of SRT2104 in normal healthy male subjects exposed to low-dose endotoxin (LPS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Plasma samples will be collected at pre-dose, 15min, 30min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12hrs post-dose on Day1 and Day7. Plasma samples will also be collected on Day2 and Day8 and at 24hrs post-dose Day1 and Day7, respectively.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the safety profile of SRT2104 in healthy male subjects exposed to low-dose endotoxin (LPS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety will be monitored by AEs, VS, physical exam, labs and ECGs during the course of the study.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the effect of SRT2104 on other parameters following low-dose endotoxin (LPS) exposure in humans e.g., lipid profile, serum amyloid phospholipids, metabolic profiles and gene expression analysis etc.</measure>
    <time_frame>Blood samples will be collected for exploratory gene expression analysis pre-dose on Days1 and 7, and 4hrs after LPS exposure on Day7. Samples for other parameters will be collected during fasting, pre-dose on Days1 and 7 and 24hrs post-dose on Day8.</time_frame>

    <description>The Placebo treatment group will be administered eight oral placebo capsules once daily for 7 days.
A trained investigative site member will administer the test material to subjects on Day 1, 2, and 7. On Days 1, 2 and 7 the subjects will receive SRT2104 or placebo approximately 15min following the consumption of a standardized meal at the study center. During non-clinic days, the subject will self-administer the test material approximately 15 min following consumption of a standardized meal at home. Test material should be administered with approximately 400mL of water. On Days 1 and 7, dosing will occur at approximately 7AM. Dosing on Days 2-6 will occur before 9AM. Subjects must wait at least 1-2 hrs after dosing before consuming additional calories on all dosing days.</description>
