    <textblock>
      This is a research study designed to look at the pharmacokinetics (distribution, breakdown,
      and removal) and tolerability of a single dose of daptomycin in patients aged 3 months to 24
      months who have proven or suspected infections that are caused by a specific group of
      bacteria (called Gram-positive bacteria)or perioperative subjects that are receiving
      prophylactic antibiotics .

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Written parental (or appropriate legal representative) informed consent prior to any
        study-related procedure not part of normal medical care; 2.1 Male or female between the
        ages of 3 months and 24 months, inclusive; 3. Able to comply with the protocol for the
        duration of the study; 4.1 Clinically stable with no evidence of hemodynamic instability
        (defined as a requirement for inotropic or vasodilatory support to manage blood pressure)
        in the 24 hour window prior to first dose, and no history or evidence of renal or hepatic
        compromise; 5.1 Suspected or diagnosed bacterial infection for which the subject is
        receiving standard antibiotic therapy; including prophylactic use of antibiotics
        peri-operatively; 6. A calculated creatinine clearance rate (CLcr) â‰¥ 80 ml/min/1.73m2 as
        determined by the Schwartz equation at baseline; 7. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels
        less than 2X ULN (upper limit of normal) at baseline; 8.1 Presence of two patent
        intravenous lines (or comparable means of venous or arterial access)prior to dosing on
        Study Day 1. A single intravenous line (or comparable means of venous access) is acceptable
        for both drug administration and sample collection if reasonable effort to gain a second
        line is unsuccessful. The line must be flushed as described in Appendix B of the protocol
        prior to obtaining PK samples. PK sample can be obtained from a peri-operatively placed
        arterial line. Arterial PK samples should be indicated on the CRF.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigational drug use (including daptomycin) or participation in any experimental
             procedure in the 30 days preceding study entry;

          2. Known allergy/ hypersensitivity to daptomycin; 3.1 History of clinically significant,
             renal, hepatic, autoimmune disease or primary immune deficiency;

        4. Deleted 5. Subjects with clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results
        (including ECGs), as determined by Investigator; 6. Administration of rifampin within 7
        days of study drug administration; 7. Deleted 8. Subjects in whom collection of the
        required blood volume would put them at risk of hemodynamic disturbance (at the discretion
        of Investigator); 9. Deleted; 10.1 Planned administration of intramuscular injection within
        12 hours following study administration unless approved by the Medical Monitor; 11. Deleted
        12.1 Guillian-Barre or spinal cord injury; 13. History of or current rhabdomyolysis.
