  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that diabetes affects both the patient and family, and that support from
      family and partners helps diabetes patients manage their illness better. However, diabetes
      programs rarely involve the partner. The purpose of this study is to test an intervention
      that helps partners and patients who have type 2 diabetes better support each other. The
      intervention will be delivered over the telephone to reach more people. Our hypothesis is
      that an intervention that targets the couple has a greater effect on health and well-being of
      patients than one that targets the individual patient alone.

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a serious illness that affects an estimated 7% of the US population, and is
      associated with life-threatening and disabling complications. Research has shown that
      diabetes affects both the patient and family, and that support from one's spouse has been
      found to be the most important source of support during illness episodes. Research clearly
      shows that marital interaction, i.e., how the support is given and received, impacts both
      marital quality and health functioning. Despite the acknowledged importance of social
      support, the vast majority of chronic illness interventions target the individual patient.
      Telephone counseling has been effectively used to enhance feasibility and target patients
      with many illnesses, and has many benefits including low cost, decreased subject burden, and
      the ability to reach a broader population. This study proposes a study of a
      telephone-administered behavior change that promotes couples communication and collaboration.
