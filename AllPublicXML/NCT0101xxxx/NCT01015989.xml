      The purpose of this study is to see if a computerized counseling tool helps patients reduce
      their sexual transmission risk and improve their antiretroviral adherence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Helping people living with HIV to remain healthy and reduce transmission to sexual partners
      ('positive prevention') can be accomplished by behavioral counseling and supporting adherence
      to infectivity-reducing antiretroviral therapy (ART). Positive prevention and ART adherence
      approaches that are not staff-dependent are urgently needed in Africa, the region hardest hit
      by HIV and decimated health workforce. Interactive health communication tools offer one
      approach. We will adapt a computerized counseling intervention found to be efficacious in
      reducing HIV-1 viral load and risk behaviors in the US ('CARE+') with the largest HIV
      provider in Kenya, the Academic Model for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV/AIDS (AMPATH).
      Aim 1: Adapt a theoretically driven computerized counseling intervention for use in Kenya
      ('CARE+_Kenya'). Conduct in-depth interviews with nâ‰¤ 50 urban and rural AMPATH patients to
      understand HIV support needs, and two staff focus groups to assess counseling practices and
      beliefs about computer use. Modify intervention content; translate and record audio into
      local Kiswahili. Adapt skill-building videos (e.g., on secondary prevention, HIV disclosure,
      ART adherence, reproductive health). Conduct software usability testing with n=20 patients
      and n=8 staff. Perform 3-day test-retest reliability assessment to establish psychometric
      performance of measures.

      Aim 2: Establish biological and behavioral efficacy of CARE+_Kenya. Longitudinal randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) in one urban and one rural AMAPATH clinic. Randomly assign
      HIV-positive adults with any missed ART or unprotected sex in last 6 months, &gt;1 sex partner
      in last year, or sexually transmitted infection (STI)diagnosis in last 3 years, to
      intervention (n=125) or risk-assessment control (n=125) for baseline, 3, 6, and 9 month
      sessions. HIV transmission risk will be measured by self-reported unprotected sex with HIV
      negative/unknown partner, and trends in Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and T.
      vaginalis. ART adherence will be measured by HIV-1 viral load, electronic monitoring,
      pharmacy refill, self-report, and clinic attendance. Aim 3: Establish cost-effectiveness of
      CARE+_Kenya. At baseline, follow 100 patients at each of the two clinics to evaluate standard
      of care counseling, and collect time-spent and facility data to determine costs and unmet
      counseling need. Conduct economic evaluation to compare CARE+_Kenya vs. standard of care. If
      the RCT shows that the intervention reduces viral load and transmission risk behaviors, we
      will use a Bernoulli transmission dynamics model to estimate number of secondary HIV
      infections prevented; then create a cost-effectiveness model to calculate 2 incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratios: 1) cost per HIV infection averted, and 2) cost per daily adjusted
      life year saved. If CARE+_Kenya is efficacious and efficient, we will develop a proposal for
      a cluster-randomized trial to assess translational effectiveness of CARE+_Kenya throughout
      the AMPATH system. This is directly responsive to PA-08-107's call for innovative, integrated
      interventions that leverage ART roll-out infrastructure in international settings to benefit
      people living with HIV.

    <description>The computer will ask patients questions about taking HIV medicine. The computer will also ask patients questions about sexual and substance use activities. The computer will let patients look at short videos on various HIV medicine and HIV risk reduction topics and will then help patients create a health plan. Patients will get an anonymous print out at the end of the session and can choose to share with health care provider. There are questions about depression, suicide, or domestic violence. If a patient's answers indicate that they may be depressed, suicidal, or currently in an abusive relationship, we will refer them to a health worker at the clinic. We will repeat the session every 3 months up to 9 months total.</description>
