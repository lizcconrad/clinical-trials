    <textblock>
      This trial was designed for comparison and evaluation of the efficacy and safety of
      buprenorphine transdermal patch (Norspan® patch 5 mg, 10 mg and 20mg) against oral tramadol
      (Tridol® SR (slow release) tablet 100mg) in patients with moderate to severe pain due to
      osteoarthritis.

    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this non-inferiority study with active, parallel control group is to
      compare and assess efficacy and safety of buprenorphine transdermal patch (Norspan® Patch 5
      mg, 10 mg and 20 mg) and tramadol (Tridol® SR (slow release) Tablet 100mg) in patients with
      moderate to severe pain due to osteoarthritis. During the period of treatment for 8weeks,
      titration and maintenance is kept up after 1:1 ratio randomization.
