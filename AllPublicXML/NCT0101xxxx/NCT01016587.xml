  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD patients often have a wide range of physical (e.g., dyspnea, fatigue, pain) and
      psychological (e.g., depression, anxiety) symptoms and various other debilitating conditions
      that cause considerable suffering for the individual. Unfortunately, many of the symptoms and
      health problems in patients with COPD are unrecognized and untreated. Due to the irreversible
      nature of COPD, the aim is not to cure the disease, but to reduce symptoms and improve
      quality of life.

      Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate the existence and nature of symptom
      clusters over time in patients with COPD and their effects on patient outcomes. Since this
      study aims to identify possible new subgroups of patients with COPD defined by the clustering
      of certain symptoms, the study also aims to investigate the relationship between the clinical
      presentation and certain immunologic and genetic factors.

      The specific aims of this translational, interdisciplinary, multi-center, international
      research study will follow 308 COPD patients with repeated measures over 12 months, are to:

        1. Explore COPD patients' symptoms, symptom clusters, and changes in symptoms and symptom
           clusters over time; as well as the genetic markers for subgroups of patients with
           different symptom clusters.

        2. Identify the occurrence of HGG and assess immune function in COPD patients.

        3. Explore relationships between HGG and immune function, genetic markers, symptoms,
           symptom clusters, health and respiratory status, frequency of exacerbations and
           health-related QOL.

      One foci is to perform a genome wide association study in patient with COPD to identify novel
      genetic markers for the patient subgroups who report different experiences with the symptom
      cluster of pain, fatigue, breathlessness, sleep disturbance, and depression. It is likely
      that genetic and immunologic factors may be involved in symptom severity and morbidity.
      Specifically, low levels of circulating immunoglobulins have been observed in a subset of
      COPD patients. Although hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG) is known to lead to frequent airway
      infections in other patients groups, the relationship between HGG and clinical symptoms in
      COPD has not been studied. The resulting knowledge can help clinicians to better identify
      COPD patients at particular risk for severe single and multiple symptoms.
