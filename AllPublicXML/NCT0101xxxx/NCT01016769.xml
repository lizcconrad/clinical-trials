    <description>In Part 1 (Phase I) of the study, the primary endpoint is to establish the phase II recommended dose for the combination of temsirolimus + weekly paclitaxel + carboplatinPart 1 (Phase I) features a standard 3 + 3 phase I dose escalation design. Up to 3 dose levels are planned in the Phase I portion of the study.
In Part 2 (Phase II) of the study, the primary endpoint is to determine the objective response rate (CR or PR) after two cycles (approximately 6 weeks) of treatment with the combination of temsirolimus + weekly paclitaxel + carboplatin as palliative therapy for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. A two-stage design will be employed.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have microscopically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
             (HNSCC), recurrent and/or metastatic.

          -  Confirmation of HNSCC may be obtained from the primary site or metastatic disease.

          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

          -  Karnofsky Performance status must be ≥ 70%.

          -  Disease must be measurable by RECIST criteria.

          -  At least 6 weeks must have elapsed from previous radiation therapy. Patient must have
             recovered from the acute toxic effects of treatment prior to study enrollment.

          -  Adequate organ function, as follows:

          -  Adequate bone marrow reserve: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 X 109/L, platelets
             ≥ 100 X 109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

          -  Hepatic: total bilirubin within normal limits (≤ 1.0 mg/dL); alkaline phosphatase
             (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 1.5 X ULN (upper
             limit of normal)

          -  Renal: Serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 mg/dL. Patients with serum creatinine &gt; 1.3 mg/dL may be
             eligible if creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 45 mL/min based on the standard Cockroft and
             Gault formula.

          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14
             days of treatment. Patients must agree to use a reliable method of birth control
             during and for 3 months following the last dose of study drug.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous exposure to temsirolimus or other mTOR inhibitors

          -  More than 2 prior cytotoxic regimens in the recurrent/metastatic disease setting

          -  History of any brain metastases

          -  Patients who require concomitant medications that are metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4,
             due to potential drug-drug interaction with temsirolimus

          -  Patients with known active interstitial pneumonitis

          -  Active infection or serious underlying medical condition that would impair the
             patient's ability to receive protocol treatment.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  Other active malignancy, other than indolent malignancies which the investigator
             determines are unlikely to interfere with treatment and safety analysis

          -  Diagnosis of Nasopharyngeal cancer is excluded.

          -  Patients with multifocal peripheral sensory alterations or paresthesias (including
             tingling) interfering with function, per patient report (example: activities of daily
             living)

          -  Therapeutic anticoagulation with Coumadin (warfarin)

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia ≥ grade 2 (CTCAE version 3.0).

          -  Impaired lung function: O2 saturation 88% or less at rest on room air by Pulse
             Oximetry. If O2 saturation is ≤ 88% at rest, further pulmonary function tests (PFTs)
             should be ordered to confirm normal pulmonary function and eligibility.
