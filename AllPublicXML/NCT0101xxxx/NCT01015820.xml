  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States and is
      associated with a poor prognosis. The average life expectancy after diagnosis is
      approximately 5 to 8 months. At present, successful surgical resection is the only curative
      therapy that can improve long-term survival. However, it can be achieved only when a tumor is
      detected at an early stage. Unfortunately, due to non-specific symptoms associated with
      pancreatic cancer, it is commonly detected in the later stages of the disease.

      The investigators hypothesized that pancreatic cancer could be detected by measuring the
      changes in the early increase in blood supply (EIBS) found in the surrounding
      normal-appearing duodenal tissue. The investigators tested a device called Four-dimensional
      Elastic Light-Scattering Fingerprinting (4D-ELF). The device used in this study is considered
      investigational, which means it has either not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. However
      the FDA allowed the use of this device in this research study.

      According to field effect theory, by detecting microvasculature changes in the early increase
      of blood supply in the surrounding tissue neoplastic lesions can be identified from a
      distance.

      The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of a fiberoptic
      probe containing novel Polarization Gating Spectroscopy (PGS) technology to identify patients
      with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) by field effect theory. EIBS markers, deoxyhemoglobin
      concentration (DHb), and average blood vessel radius (BVR) were evaluated in patients with
      PAC versus controls.

      During the subjects' esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with upper endoscopic ultrasound (EUS),
      the new optic probe was inserted inside the endoscope and advanced to the tip of the
      endoscope prior to the scope being withdrawn. As the scope was withdrawn, the light optic
      probe was used to examine approximately 5 sections of the small bowel: 1) directly on the
      ampulla, 2) approximately 5 mm proximal from the ampulla, 3) approximately 5 mm distal from
      the ampulla, 4) 1 cm proximal from the ampulla, and 5) 1 cm distal from the ampulla.
      Spectroscopy measurements were obtained four times in each of these five peri-ampullary
      locations. The rest of the EGD and upper EUS endoscopy procedures were then completed as
      clinically indicated. During the procedure, all visualized mucosal abnormalities were
      recorded and photographed.

          <description>Deoxygenated hemoglobin is the form of hemoglobin without the bound oxygen. It serves as a marker for early increase of blood supply (EIBS). DHb concentration was determined spectroscopically from five peri-ampullary locations.</description>
