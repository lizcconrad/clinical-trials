  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess if a single dose of Diclofenac potassium (0.5 mg/kg)
      is more or as effective as a single dose of Acetaminophen (10 mg/kg) in the reduction of
      fever during 2 hours, in the treatment of febrile children with acute upper respiratory
      infections.

      This is a comparative double blind, double dummy, randomized study on the effectiveness of
      Diclofenac potassium versus Acetaminophen in febrile children with acute upper respiratory
      tract infections. The patient will be randomized to either group: Group A (Diclofenac
      potassium (0.5 mg/kg) or Group B (Acetaminophen (10 mg/kg)). A Health Care Professional
      trained will measure the temperature during 2 hours. During the study period, parents or
      legal representatives will be invited to fill a survey about the habits and knowledge
      regarding fever management at home.
