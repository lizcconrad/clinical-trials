  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of the combination of panitumumab with irinotecan in malignant
      glioma patients. The primary objective of the study is to determine the activity of the
      combination of panitumumab with irinotecan as measured by 6-month progression-free survival.
      Secondary objectives include the following- to determine the safety of panitumumab in
      combination with irinotecan in patients with malignant glioma; to determine the effect of
      panitumumab in combination with irinotecan on corticosteroid dose for each patient; to
      explore any relationship between epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) mutational analysis
      and efficacy or toxicity; and, to determine the response rate and overall survival of
      recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients treated with panitumumab in combination with
      irinotecan.

      The patients will have histologically documented grade 4 malignant gliomas (glioblastoma
      multiforme or gliosarcoma) that have failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen and all
      patients will have received radiation therapy. This study will investigate second or greater
      line of therapy for recurrent grade 4 malignant glioma. The patient population will include
      32 patients.

      The patients will undergo a baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as a MRI after
      every six-week cycle to determine response and progression. After 16 patients with recurrent
      GBM are treated, an interim analysis will be conducted. The most common side effects
      associated with panitumumab have been dermatological (skin) problems such as erythema
      (redness of the skin), acneiform rash (skin eruptions of the face), skin exfoliation,
      pruritus (itching), skin fissures (skin tears), xerosis (dryness of the eye, skin, or mouth),
      and rash. The most common side effects associated with irinotecan have been decreased blood
      counts of platelets (increased risk of bleeding), white blood cells (increased risk of
      infection), red blood cells (anemia); diarrhea, constipation, nausea, vomiting, tiredness,
      fever, mouth sores, dehydration (excessive loss of body fluids), rash, itching, changes in
      skin color, swelling, numbness, tingling, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, sweating,
      hot flashes, hair loss, inflammation of the liver, flu-like symptoms, decreased urine output,
      shortness of breath, and pneumonia (inflammatory disease of the lungs).

          <description>Percentage of participants surviving six months from the start of study treatment without progression of disease. PFS was defined as the time from the date of study treatment initiation to the date of the first documented progression according to the Macdonald criteria, or to death due to any cause. Macdonald criteria are standard criteria in neuro-oncology. Tumor assessment was made according to the adapted MacDonald criteria based on the combined evaluation of: 1) assessment of the MRI scan for measurable, evaluable, and new lesions (made by the independent external expert too), 2) overall assessment of neurological performance (made by the investigator), and 3) concomitant steroid use (as reported by the investigator).</description>
