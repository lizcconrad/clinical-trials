  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cancer vaccine tecemotide (L-BLP25) in
      addition to best supportive care is effective in prolonging the lives of Asian subjects with
      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer in comparison to a placebo plus best
      supportive care (a so-called placebo controlled study).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) Time</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until death, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS time was measured as the time (in months) between the date of randomization and the date of death. For subjects alive or lost to follow-up at time of analysis, the time between the date of randomization and the date on which the subject was last known alive was calculated and used as a censored observation in the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Symptom Progression (TTSP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of symptomatic progression, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTSP was measured from randomization to symptomatic progression by lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS) used to measure symptom changes relevant to quality of life (QoL).It consisted of 9 items focused on cancer symptoms (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, blood in sputum, pain, symptoms of cancer, illness affecting normal activity, QoL).For each symptom score distance from left boundary to point where subject has marked line was measured in millimeters (mm).Total scale length was 100 mm. Symptomatic progression was defined as increase/worsening of average symptomatic burden index (ASBI) (mean of 6 major lung cancer specific symptom scores);Worsening defined as 10% increase of scale breadth from baseline. Score 0 indicate no/minimum symptoms;100 indicates maximum level of symptoms. Subjects without symptomatic progression/lost to follow-up at time of analysis: time from date of randomization to date of last LCSS assessment was calculated &amp; used as censored observation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of radiological confirmation of PD, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time from randomization to radiological confirmation of disease progression (PD) as determined by the investigator. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from nadir, or the appearance of one or more new lesions as per RECIST version 1.0. For subjects without radiological confirmed PD who discontinued or died due to PD, the date of trial treatment discontinuation was used as event date. Subjects who missed 2 consecutive scheduled doses without evaluable assessment for the related visits and who were lost to follow-up thereafter were considered as having PD, TTP was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their first missed treatment. Subjects without PD at time of analysis are censored at either date of last vaccination or death or discontinuation of treatment or lost to follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to PD, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>Time from randomization to objective disease progression (PD) as determined by the investigator or death. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions from nadir, or the appearance of one or more new lesions as per RECIST version 1.0. Subjects who missed 2 consecutive scheduled doses without evaluable assessment for the related visits and who were lost to follow-up thereafter were considered as having PD, and the PFS was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their first missed treatment. PFS time for subjects without an event was censored as of the date of last performed imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure (TTF)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of first missed treatment, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>TTF was time from randomization to discontinuation of trial treatment for any reason as reported by the investigator. For subjects still receiving treatment at the time of analysis, the time between the date of randomization and the last date of treatment will be used as a censored observation in the analysis. Subjects who missed 2 consecutive scheduled doses without evaluable assessment for the related visits and who were lost to follow-up thereafter were considered treatment failure and the TTF was calculated from the date of randomization to the date of their first missed treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs, TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation and TEAEs Leading to Death</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study drug administration until 42 days after the last dose of study drug administration, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) was defined as any new untoward medical occurrences/worsening of pre-existing medical condition without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 42 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Number of subjects with TEAE leading to death and permanent discontinuation of any trial treatment were presented.</description>

        <title>Time to Symptom Progression (TTSP)</title>
        <description>TTSP was measured from randomization to symptomatic progression by lung cancer symptom scale (LCSS) used to measure symptom changes relevant to quality of life (QoL).It consisted of 9 items focused on cancer symptoms (loss of appetite, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, blood in sputum, pain, symptoms of cancer, illness affecting normal activity, QoL).For each symptom score distance from left boundary to point where subject has marked line was measured in millimeters (mm).Total scale length was 100 mm. Symptomatic progression was defined as increase/worsening of average symptomatic burden index (ASBI) (mean of 6 major lung cancer specific symptom scores);Worsening defined as 10% increase of scale breadth from baseline. Score 0 indicate no/minimum symptoms;100 indicates maximum level of symptoms. Subjects without symptomatic progression/lost to follow-up at time of analysis: time from date of randomization to date of last LCSS assessment was calculated &amp; used as censored observation.</description>
        <time_frame>From the date of randomization to the date of symptomatic progression, assessed up to 5.6 years</time_frame>
        <population>The mITT analysis set was based on the ITT analysis set (ITT analysis set included all the subjects randomized into the study), but included only subjects with concurrent primary chemo-radiotherapy and prospectively excluded the 5 subjects who were randomized prior to the clinical hold.</population>

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 42 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Number of subjects with TEAE leading to death and permanent discontinuation of any trial treatment were presented.</description>

A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs were defined as the AEs that occur between first dose of study drug administration and 42 days after the last dose of study drug administration that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Number of subjects with TEAE leading to death and permanent discontinuation of any trial treatment were presented.</description>
