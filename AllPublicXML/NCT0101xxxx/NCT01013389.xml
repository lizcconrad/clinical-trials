        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Has degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine as indicated by back pain of
             discogenic/degenerative origin, with or without leg pain, and has one or more of the
             following conditions as documented by plain X-rays, CT scan or MRI scan:

               -  Modic changes.

               -  High intensity changes in the annulus.

               -  Loss of disc height.

               -  Decreased hydration of the disc.

               -  Canal stenosis with or without spondylotic slip.

               -  Gross facet joint changes requiring fusion for treatment.

               -  Have documented annular pathology by other means. (e.g., with discography).

          -  Has a preoperative Oswestry Back Disability Score of 30 or more.

          -  Aged 18 to 75 years and skeletally mature at time of surgery.

          -  Has not responded to non-operative treatment (e.g., bed rest, physical therapy,
             medications and/or spinal injections) for a period of six months.

          -  If of childbearing potential, patient is non-pregnant, non-nursing and agrees not to
             become pregnant for one year following surgery.

             the Patient Informed Consent Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has had previous failed attempts at fusion surgery at the involved level(s).

          -  Requires surgery at more than two (2) levels.

          -  Has osteoporosis (excluding osteopenia) as evidenced on plain X-rays, CT scans (or
             DEXA scan in cases of doubt).

             the planned surgery date (e.g., steroids or methotrexate) excluding routine
             perioperative, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

             imperfecta).

          -  Has any disease that would preclude accurate clinical evaluation (e.g., neuromuscular
             disease, etc.).

          -  Has a primary diagnosis of a spinal disorder other than degenerative disc disease or
             other conditions as set out in &quot;inclusions&quot; above at the involved level(s).

          -  Has a condition that requires postoperative medications that interfere with fusion,
             such as steroids or prolonged use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, excluding
             routine perioperative non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This does not include low
