          -  Patients must be accessible for follow-up.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 months from randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             spine and/or total hip.

          -  Patients with a history of fracture with low-density or no associated trauma.

          -  Osteoporotic patients with T-score &lt;= -2.5

          -  Previous treatment with a bisphosphonate.

          -  Patients with abnormal renal function as evidenced by either a serum creatinine
             determination 1.5 x or greater above the upper limit of normal or by a calculated
             creatinine clearance of 30 ml/minute or less.

          -  Pregnancy and lactation.

          -  Women of childbearing potential not on a medically recognized form of contraception.

          -  Subjects participating simultaneously in studies with unapproved drugs, indications or
             treatment regimens.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to zoledronic acid or bisphosphonates.

          -  Patients with prior exposure to anabolic steroids, growth hormone, Parathyroid Hormone
             (PTH) or other drugs known to affect the skeleton (e.g., calcitonin, mithramycin, or
             gallium nitrate).

          -  History or surgery at the lumbosacral spine, with or without implantable devices.

          -  Any disease of the spine that would preclude the proper acquisition of a lumbar spine
             DXA.

          -  Mental illness that precludes the patient from giving informed consent.

          -  Current active dental problems including infection of the teeth or jawbone (maxilla or
             mandibular); dental or fixture trauma, or a current or prior diagnosis of
             osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), of exposed bone in the mouth, or of slow healing after
             dental procedures.

          -  Recent (within 6 weeks) or planned dental or jaw surgery (e.g.. extraction, implants)
