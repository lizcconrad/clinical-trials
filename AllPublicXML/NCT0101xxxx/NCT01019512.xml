      RATIONALE: The Flexitouch lymphedema system may lessen lymphedema caused by treatment for
      breast cancer. It is not yet known whether the Flexitouch lymphedema system is more effective
      than complex decongestive therapy in treating lymphedema. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical
      trial is studying the Flexitouch lymphedema system in treating stage II lymphedema in
      patients with breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To quantitatively assess, by circumferential measurements and CT
      imaging techniques, the ability of the Flexitouch Lymphedema System to maintain reductions in
      limb volume after completion of the reductive phase of complex decongestive therapy in a
      population of patients with upper limb lymphedema secondary to the effects of breast cancer
      treatment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the drainage territory of the lymphatics of
      the affected arm and chest using CT and to determine whether these patterns are changed by
      treatment with the Flexitouch Lymphedema System/daytime garments versus Flexitouch Lymphedema
      System/daytime garments/nighttime bandaging versus standard self-care. OUTLINE: Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo complex decongestive therapy
      comprising daily compression garment (sleeve and glove) use, daily manual lymphatic drainage
      (self-administered), and nighttime bandaging with low stretch Comprilan bandages. Arm II:
      Patients undergo daily compression with garments (sleeve and glove), nighttime bandaging with
      low stretch Comprilan bandages, and daily Flexitouch treatment over 1 hour every evening. Arm
      III: Patients undergo daily compression with garments (sleeve and glove) and daily Flexitouch
      treatment over 1 hour every evening. In all arms, treatment continues for 3 months.
