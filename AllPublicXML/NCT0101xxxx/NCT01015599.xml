      This study presents evaluates the effectiveness of the Healthy Opportunities for Physical
      Activity(HOP'N) After-School Program on preventing obesity in children. The investigators
      hypothesized that normal and overweight/obese children attending after-school sites
      randomized to the control condition will increase in weight status to a greater extent
      compared to children at sites randomized to receive the HOP'N program. The investigators also
      hypothesized that after-school intervention HOP'N sites will increase in physical activity
      and healthful eating opportunities compared to control sites.

    <textblock>
      The dramatic increase in the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents has led
      to obesity prevention becoming a major national health priority. Although schools offer a
      logical choice for a setting to reach a great number of youth, these disappointing findings
      may be due in part to the difficulties of implementing interventions in school settings where
      competing demands for time have made it difficult to add anything other than academics to the
      school day. After-school programs may provide promise for preventing child obesity because
      there are fewer bureaucratic obstacles and curricular inflexibilities. A three-year
      group-randomized controlled trial will be conducted with random assignment at the school
      level . The study will use a nested cross section design with a baseline year, and two
      subsequent intervention years.
