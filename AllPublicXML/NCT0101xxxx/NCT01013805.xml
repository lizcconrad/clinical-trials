      The aims of the trial are (1) to determine the tolerability rate in the setting of a
      multi-centre study and (2) to determine secondary tolerability endpoints, toxicity rates and
      complete pathologic response rate in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are
      treated with an integrated preoperative radiotherapy with FOLFOX chemotherapy regimen.

          -  Lower border of tumour must be within 12 cm of anal verge.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-1 (Appendix 2)

          -  No symptomatic peripheral neuropathy greater than or equal to grade 2.

          -  Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female. Patients on study with reproductive
             potential, or female partners with reproductive potential, must use an effective
             contraceptive.

          -  Has provided written informed consent for participation in this trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of metastatic disease.

          -  Prior pelvic radiotherapy

          -  Febrile intercurrent illness or infection.

          -  Previous history of unstable angina

          -  Cardiac arrhythmia which in the opinion of the investigator would compromise the safe

             potentially exacerbated by these modalities.

          -  Locally recurrent rectal cancer.
