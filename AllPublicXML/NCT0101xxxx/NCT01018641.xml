  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human (Phase 1) study using three dose levels of an investigational
      vaccine directed against Staphylococcus aureus (SA3Ag). This study is primarily designed to
      assess how safe and well tolerated SA3Ag is, but will also describe the immune response over
      12 months elicited by SA3Ag. Additionally, this study will assess the effect of SA3Ag vaccine
      on the number of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria that naturally occur on the skin and within
      the nose and throat.
