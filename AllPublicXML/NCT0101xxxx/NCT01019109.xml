      The purpose of this study is to find out the outcomes of using the PASS LP System to correct
      idiopathic scoliosis. This system is a unique set of spinal instrumentation used to
      surgically correct the rotation and deformity of the spine that is caused by scoliosis. Also,
      this study wants to find out the effects this system has on the physical appearance and
      quality of life for patients with scoliosis.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical, functional and radiographic outcomes
      following the reduction of idiopathic scoliosis.

      The following will be evaluated

        1. The 3D correction of scoliosis:

             -  Reduction of scoliosis in the coronal plane (Cobb angles)

             -  Correction in the sagittal plane (kyphotic and lordotic angles)

             -  Correction of the axial vertebral rotation in the transverse plane

        2. The functional and aesthetic outcomes

    <description>PASS LP Implant System is designed to contribute to correction and surgical stabilization of the thoracic, lumbar and sacral spine only. These implants are designed to stabilize the spine during normal development of solid bony consolidation which takes about 18 months. The internal fixation devices are composed of screws, hooks,rods, plates, cross links, connection and locking devices. The range of different sizes and shapes of the implants allows the surgeon to adapt to the pathology and morphology of each of his patients.</description>
