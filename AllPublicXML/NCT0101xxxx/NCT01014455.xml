  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking causes 90% of all lung cancer deaths among men and 80% of lung cancer deaths in
      women. Surgery is a great opportunity to help patients quit smoking. Smokers are at increased
      risk for heart, lung, and wound complications around the time of surgery. Even a brief
      abstinence from smoking can produce benefits. Surgery can also motivate smokers to quit
      spontaneously. If the investigators can take advantage of this great opportunity, they may be
      able to help many smokers quit using simple means. However, currently most smokers continue
      to smoke cigarette on the morning before surgery, as shown by the measurement of exhaled
      carbon monoxide (CO) on the morning of surgery. CO is one of the many poisons in cigarette
      smoke. It only stays in the body for a few hours. By asking smokers to blow into a small
      machine, the investigators can test the CO level in the smokers' body and thus know if they
      have just smoked within the past few hours. The goal of this study is to determine the role
      of carbon monoxide monitoring as a means to decrease cigarette smoking before surgery. The
      investigators will identify a group of smokers who are scheduled for surgery and invite them
      to participate. One or two days before surgery, half of the patients will receive a brief
      advice about quit smoking. The other half of patients will be told that their CO will be
      checked before surgery, in addition to the brief advice. On the morning of surgery, the
      investigators will then check their CO level to determine if they have followed the advice.
      In order to have a better understanding about the factors influencing patients' intent to
      quit smoking, the investigators will ask all study participants to fill out a questionnaire.
      The questionnaire is constructed according to behavioral theories which provide good
      framework for studying people's intent and behavior. If the investigators are successful,
      they will determine how much of an impact the message of CO testing has on smoking before
      surgery. The investigators will also gain insights into facilitators and barriers to smoking
      cessation around the time of surgery. The brief intervention evaluated in this study has
      potential to be disseminated and to promote the long term health of surgical patients.

    <description>On the morning of surgery, as matter of clinical routine all patients receiving surgery requiring anesthesia services at one of the two main surgical facilities at Mayo Clinic Rochester and who self-report as a current smoker are asked about their typical cigarette consumption (cigarettes per day), if they have smoked cigarettes today, and have their exhaled CO levels measured (Micro Smokerlyzer; Bedfont, United Kingdom). This information is entered into the clinical record. The CO monitors are maintained by the Division of Respiratory Therapy, including regular calibration.</description>
