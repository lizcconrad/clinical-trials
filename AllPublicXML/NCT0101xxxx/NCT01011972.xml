  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      XMT-1107 has been shown in nonclinical studies to slow the growth of tumors. These effects
      may result from blocking the growth of new blood vessels that help the tumors survive.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, ascending-dose study of XMT-1107 administered intravenously over 90
      minutes every 21 days (1 cycle). Blood sampling for PK analyses will be performed immediately
      prior to dosing and after dosing. Adverse events will be graded according to the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria (CTC) version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0)
