  <brief_summary>

      Goal: The investigators propose to test whether giving the supplement coenzyme Q10 (Q10)
      improves symptoms and subjective health in Gulf War veterans (GWV) with chronic,
      multi-symptom health problems.

      Rationale: Direct empirical evidence, in groups that are not GWV, has supported benefit of
      Q10 to many of the symptoms that GWV are at heightened risk of experiencing - such as
      fatigue, muscle pain, and cognition, which are syndrome-defining conditions. In addition, Q10
      has also been reported to benefit other symptoms arising at increased rates in GWV, including
      headaches, sleep disturbances, and breathing problems. This provides a strong rationale for
      testing whether Q10 will have similar benefit to these symptoms in GWV.

      Method: 46 GWV with chronic health problems will participate.The design is a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Each subject will be &quot;crossed over&quot; between
      Q10 and an identical placebo, receiving each agent twice, for 3.5 month periods. In one of
      the Q10 phases, a lower dose of Q10 will be used - 100mg three times a day; while in one a
      higher dose will be used - 300mg three times a day. Neither subjects nor investigators will
      know which substance each subject is receiving in which phase. Subjects will be randomly
      assigned to one of four crossover orders.

      Assessments: Assessments will include subjective quality of life; symptoms that are &quot;syndrome
      defining&quot; for Gulf War illness (like fatigue and muscle problems); and other symptoms and
      conditions reported to occur more commonly in GWV (like sleep problems). Analyses will show
      whether Q10 led to improvements when compared to placebo; whether higher Q10 doses improved
      outcomes more than lower doses; and whether people with certain symptoms or characteristics
      get more benefit than people with other symptoms or characteristics.

      Goal: To determine, via a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, whether coenzyme
      Q10 (Q10) administration reduces symptoms and improve subjective health in Gulf War veterans
      (GWV).

      Rationale: In a number of settings, studies have reported benefits of Q10 to fatigue, muscle
      pain and cognition, &quot;syndrome&quot; defining symptoms in GWV. It has also been reported to improve
      a range of other symptoms and conditions that arise at increased rates in GWV. Additionally
      Q10 defends against mechanisms that may play a role in health problems in GWV. For these
      reasons, a study evaluating benefits by Q10 to symptoms and quality of life in symptomatic
      GWV is merited.

      Subjects: 46 GWV meeting Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Kansas criteria for &quot;Gulf War
      illness.&quot; Design: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Intervention:
      Coenzyme Q10 at 100mg three times a day (tid) or 300mg tid or matching placebo for 3.5 Â± 0.5
      month periods.

      Primary Outcome: Subjective health; syndrome defining symptoms (fatigue, muscle pain, muscle
      strength; and cognition).

      Secondary Outcomes: A variety of secondary outcomes will be assessed including other symptoms
      reported to be elevated in GWV; markers of oxidative stress; and dose-response.

      Analyses: Nonparametric and secondarily parametric analyses will compare effects of Q10 vs
      placebo; and of higher dose vs lower dose Q10 on primary and secondary endpoints. Possible
      effect modification (differential benefit) based on factors such as oxidative state and Q10
      serum concentration will be explored through regression analysis.

             category is apparent. Gulf War illness criteria symptoms must have persisted or
             recurred in the year prior to interview and first have been a problem for respondents
             in 1990 or later. Full criteria are as delineated in Steele 2000.

          -  Willing to agree to defer initiating other over the counter medications till after
             completion of study participation.
