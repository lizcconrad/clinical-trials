  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether injections of ranibizumab into the eye are
      safe and well tolerated when given to subjects in multiple doses.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Choroidal neovascularization is a hallmark of angioid streaks, and presumably VEGF-driven.
      Ranibizumab has been shown to be effective in CNV secondary to age-related macular
      degeneration. Therefore, we hypothesize that ranibizumab may be efficacious in the treatment
      of CNV secondary to angioid streaks
