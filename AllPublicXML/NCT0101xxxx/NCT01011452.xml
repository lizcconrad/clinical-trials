    <textblock>
      Patients presenting to hospital with an acute asthma exacerbation severe enough to require
      admission would receive full standard treatment according to British Thoracic Society
      guidelines in addition they would be offered the opportunity to take part in the study which
      would requite them to take a capsule of either montelukast or placebo.
