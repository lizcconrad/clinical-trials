    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three radiant warmer beds that contain different
      computer heating software and different bed styles. Radiant warmers are used in many neonatal
      intensive care units (NICU) to provide heat to infants to help regulate an infant's
      temperature. It is common for babies to require care on an open bed that provides heat to the
      baby according to the baby's needs and at the same time allows easy access to the baby for
      care and necessary procedures. There are different styles of beds, each with unique computer
      software that can guide how a bed's heater output is automatically adjusted according to a
      baby's temperature needs. It is unknown which style of bed or method of heating might be
      best. This study seeks to evaluate infant responses to three different types of radiant
      warmer beds.

          -  Any baby who is deemed too sick to tolerate movement from one radiant warmer to
             another by the attending physician.

          -  Any baby who has a medical condition or anomaly that contraindicates axillary or
             abdominal temperature measurements
