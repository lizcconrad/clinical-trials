  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot, phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of bortezomib in treating
      patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related Kaposi sarcoma that has come
      back or has not responded to treatment. Bortezomib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of single agent bortezomib in subjects with
      AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (KS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical response of KS tumors to bortezomib. II. Evaluate the impact of
      bortezomib on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) plasma viral loads and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) apolipoprotein B messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) editing enzyme,
      catalytic polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) levels.

      III. Determine the impact of bortezomib on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).

      IV. Assess bortezomib effects on KSHV copy number in PBMC and plasma and whether changes in
      viral copy number measured in PBMC and plasma are associated with clinical response of KS
      tumors.

      V. Monitor KSHV gene expression in KS biopsy specimens and PBMC pre- and post-bortezomib and
      assess whether changes in viral gene expression (i.e., to a lytic pattern) in tumor biopsy
      are associated with clinical response.

      VI. Assess whether changes in viral copy number in PBMC and plasma occur in concert with or
      independently of changes in viral antigen expression in tumor biopsy specimens.

      VII. Assess effects of bortezomib on proteins relevant to KS tumor survival and proliferation
      (i.e., P53, von Hippel-Lindau [VHL], p27, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 [HIF1]-alpha) as well as
      levels of nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB) gene target mRNAs in tumor biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months for up to 1 year.
