    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cisplatin in treating patients
      with stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer or tumors that have spread from where they
      started to the lung (metastasis). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving cisplatin directly into the
      arteries around the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of cisplatin when
      delivered selectively by isolated lung suffusion to patients with any biopsy or cytologically
      proven resectable or unresectable primary or secondary malignancy in the lung.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess lung tissue levels of cisplatin after isolated lung suffusion as a function of
      the dose delivered.

      II. To evaluate systemic and pulmonary artery concentrations of cisplatin during isolated
      lung suffusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cisplatin intra-arterially via isolated lung suffusion over 2 hours.
      Beginning approximately 2 weeks later (6-8 weeks if indicated for patients with sarcoma
      undergoing surgery after cisplatin), patients receive standard chemotherapy regimen.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 90 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any biopsy or cytologically proven resectable or unresectable primary or secondary
             (metastatic) malignancy in the lung; this is defined as

               -  Tumors whose only remaining residual deposits are confined to the lungs OR

               -  Oligometastatic tumors with &gt; 80% of measurable tumor volume in the target lung
                  In both of the above situations, no clinical evidence of central nervous system
                  (CNS) metastases can exist; oligometastatic disease is difficult to define but
                  would, as a guideline, have only 1-4 loci of disease established in 1-2 organ
                  systems outside the affected lung; exceptions to these guidelines can occur,
                  particularly in cases where sites of metastatic disease are equivocal or so
                  minute that it would not exceed 20% of tumor volume

          -  Unresectable stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

          -  Unresectable stage IIIB NSCLC

          -  Modified Borg dyspnea scale &lt; 5

          -  Six minute walk &gt;= 50% of the expected distance; this will not be used as exclusion
             criteria if due to a reason other than respiratory per judgment of physician e.g.,
             pain

          -  Ambulatory and resting oxygen (O2) saturation &gt; 88%

          -  PPO (predicted post operative)* forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &gt;= 50%
             predicted

               -  PPO values should be calculated for each patient

          -  PPO * diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &gt;= 50% predicted

               -  PPO values should be calculated for each patient

          -  PPO * vital capacity &gt;= 50% predicted

               -  PPO values should be calculated for each patient

          -  Granulocytes &gt; 1,500 ul

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent disease

          -  Prior chemotherapy for proven metastatic disease within 4 weeks

          -  Evidence of pulmonary toxicity from previous or ongoing chemotherapy

          -  Creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL

          -  Liver enzymes &gt; 2 times upper normal

          -  Uncontrolled congestive heart failure (in judgment of the PI)

          -  Optional: ejection fraction &lt; 40% for clinical evidence of insufficient cardiac
             reserve (multi gated acquisition scan [MUGA] or echocardiogram [ECHO] will be done
             only if indicated in the judgment of the PI)

          -  Myocardial infarction or angina within past 6 months

          -  Contraindications to anticoagulation

          -  Hydration intolerance (e.g., uncontrolled congestive heart failure [CHF])

          -  Human immunodeficiency virus positive (HIV+) on antiretroviral therapy

          -  Metastatic sarcoma to lung that is not able to have tumors resected thoracoscopically

          -  Prior lung removal in the affected lung (would have decreased lung volume)
