  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability of two oral formulations of
      Triazolam in healthy volunteers, in order to determine that they are bioequivalent.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The bioequivalence trial of triazolam is due to change in manufacture site.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Only healthy volunteers, between the ages of 18 and 40 years, will be included.

          -  Subjects' body mass index must be between 19-27.

          -  Volunteers must be in good health, as determined by the results of a complete clinical
             history prepared by doctors at the clinical research site and laboratory tests
             performed at certified clinical laboratories.

          -  Volunteers must agree to use at least two birth control methods (except hormonal
             contraceptives) from the first dose of the study drug and for up to 28 days after the
             last dose. (acceptable methods are surgically definitive sterilization, menopause,
             barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragm, and spermicidal gels/foams)

          -  The limits of variation permitted within normality at the screening visit will be:

             rate between 55 and 100 beats per minute and respiratory rate between 14 and 20
             respirations per minute.
