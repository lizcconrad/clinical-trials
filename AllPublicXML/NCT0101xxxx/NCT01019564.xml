  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to assess Complete Easy Rub compared to a competitor multi-purpose
      solution in terms of lens cleanliness, subjective response and ocular response, when lenses
      are worn bilaterally on a daily wear basis for two months.

      The hypotheses for this trial are:

        -  Lens cleanliness measures between solutions will be no different.

        -  Subjective ratings between solutions will be no different.

        -  Ocular response between solutions will be no different.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to read and comprehend English and give informed consent as demonstrated by
             signing a record of informed consent;

          -  Be at least 18 years old, male or female;

          -  Willing to comply with the wearing and clinical trial visit schedule as directed by
             the investigator;

          -  Have ocular health findings considered to be &quot;normal&quot; and which would not prevent the
             participant from safely wearing contact lenses;

          -  Is correctable to at least 6/12 (20/40) or better in each eye with contact lenses;

          -  Able to successfully wear one of the lens types to be used in this study on a daily
             wear (DW) basis in conjunction with any multi-purpose contact lens care solution (not
             including hydrogen peroxide-based systems) for at least one month prior to allocation
             of test or control solution;

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any pre-existing ocular irritation, injury or condition (including keratoconus and
             herpes keratitis) of the cornea, conjunctiva or eyelids that would preclude contact
             lens fitting and safe wearing of contact lenses;

          -  Any systemic disease that adversely affects ocular health e.g. diabetes, Graves
             disease, and auto-immune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis,
             Sj√∂grens syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Conditions such as systemic
             hypertension and arthritis do not automatically exclude prospective participants;

          -  Use of, or a need for, concurrent category S3 and above ocular medication at enrolment
             and/or during the study;

          -  Use of, or a need for, any systemic medication or topical medications which may alter
             normal ocular findings/are known to affect a participant's ocular health/physiology or
             contact lens performance either in an adverse manner or beneficial manner at enrolment
             and/or during the study
