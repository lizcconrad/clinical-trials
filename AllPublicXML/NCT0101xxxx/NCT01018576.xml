  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delayed cord clamping has been shown to decrease the risk of bleeding in the brain of
      premature infants. However this procedure is not standard due to concerns that the premature
      infant will get too cold. In this study the investigators look at using a plastic covering
      and a chemical warmer to keep the small premature baby warm while waiting 30-60 seconds to
      clamp the umbilical cord.

      Enrolled premature infants will be compared to age matched historical controls that did not
      receive delayed cord clamping but were placed under a warmer immediately after birth.
      Outcomes to be analyzed include initial body temperature, hematocrit at birth and 24 hours of
      age, number of red blood cell transfusions during hospital stay, umbilical cord gas, first
      blood gas following delivery, blood pressure data in the first 24 hours, fluid bolus and
      inotrope requirement in the first 24 hours, incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and
      late-onset sepsis, peak bilirubin level, length of phototherapy, and Apgar scores.
