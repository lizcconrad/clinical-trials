  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a computer counseling tool helps Spanish-speaking
      people living with HIV to have safer sex and to do well on their HIV medicines.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Latinos are the fastest-growing group with some of the largest health disparities including
      HIV. Barriers including language are associated with lower antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      adherence seen among Latinos. There are no evidence-based interventions (randomized trials
      that significantly reduced viral load and HIV transmission risk to sexual partners -
      'positive prevention') delivered in Spanish in routine clinical practice. Our computerized
      counseling tool (CARE+) in a phase III trial of English-speaking adults increased ART
      adherence and reduced viral load and condom use errors. We now propose a longitudinal
      effectiveness (phase IV) study to evaluate the impact of computerized counseling in
      audio-narrated Spanish in a busy urban HIV clinic. This 'CARE+ Spanish' proposal is
      responsive to 06-OD(OBSSR)-101, for new technologies to improve adherence in clinical
      practice. Aim 1: Adapt CARE+ Spanish for use during routine clinical visits by
      Spanish-speaking HIV clinic attendees using an expert panel to shorten content and add
      Spanish audio dialects; do usability testing (n≤8). Aim 2: Establish real-world utility of
      'CARE+ Spanish'. Peer staff will recruit Spanish-speaking adults on ART who will be randomly
      assigned to intervention (Group A n=250) or risk-assessment control (B, n=250) for
      0,3-,6-,9-month sessions; at 12-month session groups will switch to opposite arm (delayed
      intervention design). Linear and generalized linear mixed effects models will analyze impact
      on 30-day ART adherence, clinic visit adherence, HIV-1 viral load and sexual risks, and to
      assess whether any Group A changes are sustained at month 12, among an expected n=400
      retained study participants (120 female, 280 male). Aim 3: Explore cultural acceptability of
      tool among clients and clinic providers. Conduct qualitative exit interviews with patients
      (n=75) to assess technology uptake factors, cultural/linguistic acceptability, and
      suggestions for ongoing use among older vs. younger, and US-born vs. foreign-born Latino
      groups. Conduct two focus groups with providers (n≤30) to assess perceived technology
      barriers/facilitators. Analysis will identify factors affecting acceptability, utilization,
      and impact. Technology tools like CARE+ present significant opportunities to bridge the
      health promotion delivery gap, especially if linguistically adapted for often-neglected
      groups such as Latinos (15% of the US population).

    <description>The computer will ask patients questions about taking HIV medicine. The computer will also ask patients questions about sexual and substance use activities. The computer will let patients look at short videos on various HIV medicine and HIV risk reduction topics and will then help patients create a health plan. Patients will get an anonymous print out at the end of the session and can choose to share with health care provider. There are questions about depression, suicide, or domestic violence. If a patient's answers indicate that they may be depressed, suicidal, or currently in an abusive relationship, we will refer them to a health worker at the clinic. We will repeat the session every 3 months up to 12 months total.</description>
