  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the feasibility of &quot;Teens Taking Charge: Managing Arthritis On-line&quot;
      intervention that will help adolescents with arthritis to better manage their disease and
      improve their health-related quality of life (HRQL).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This feasibility study will (1) assess adolescents' willingness to be randomized; (2) pilot
      the intervention, attention control strategies (e.g., adolescents' 'own best efforts' at
      managing arthritis), and outcome measures; (3) determine adolescents' perceptions regarding
      acceptability of the web-based intervention; and (4) obtain estimates of treatment effects in
      primary (HRQL) and secondary (knowledge, coping, self-efficacy, stress, treatment adherence,
      pain) outcome measures to inform the calculation of appropriate sample size for the future
      RCT.

      We hypothesize that adolescents with JIA in the web-based intervention will demonstrate: (a)
      improved HRQL; (b) increased disease-specific knowledge; (c) improved coping, self-efficacy,
      and adherence to prescribed management; and (d) decreased pain and stress compared to
      adolescents in the attention control group

Total score was composed of the 4 dimension scores (top 5 items of that dimension) divided by 4, with higher scores denoting poorer HRQOL.</description>

          <title>Juvenile Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JAQQ)</title>
          <description>The questionnaire is divided into 4 dimensions: gross motor function, fine motor function, psychosocial function, and general symptoms. A 7-point ordinal scale is used to rate responses to each item from 1 (none of the time) to 7 (all of the time), based on how often the item was a problem for the child over the past 2 weeks. Total score was composed of the 4 dimension scores (top 5 items of that dimension) divided by 4, with higher scores denoting poorer HRQOL.</description>

          <description>Teens Taking Charge : The intervention is a 12-week multi-component treatment protocol that consists of self-management strategies (e.g., how to deal with stress and treatment related symptoms like pain), information (e.g., common problems associated with treatment and disease) and social support (e.g., monitored discussion boards and narratives in the form of written stories and video clips). It will be delivered on a restricted web-site and through regular contact with a trained coach by means of email and/or telephone using standardized scripts.</description>
