      To investigate the efficacy of acupuncture compared with steroid treatment in patients with
      mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) as measured by objective changes in nerve
      conduction studies (NCS) and subjective symptoms assessment in a randomized, controlled
      study.

      A total of 77 consecutive and prospective CTS patients confirmed by NCS were enrolled in the
      study. Those who had fixed sensory complaint over the median nerve and thenar muscle atrophy
      were excluded. The CTS patients were randomly divided into 2 treatment arms: (1) 2 weeks of
      prednisolone 20 mg daily followed by 2 weeks of prednisolone 10 mg daily (n =39), and
      (2)acupuncture administered in 8 sessions over 4 weeks (n=38). A validated standard
      questionnaire as a subjective measurement was used to rate the 5 major symptoms (pain,
      numbness, paresthesia,weakness/clumsiness, and nocturnal awakening) on a scale from 0 (no
      symptoms) to 10 (very severe). The total score in each of the 5 categories was termed the
      global symptom score (GSS). Patients completed standard questionnaires at baseline and 2 and
      4 weeks later. The changes in GSS were analyzed to evaluate the statistical significance. NCS
      were performed at baseline and repeated at the end of the study to assess improvement. All
      main analyses used intent-to-treat.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        presence of at least one of the following primary symptoms:

          1. numbness, tingling pain, or paresthesia in the median nerve distribution;

          2. precipitation of these symptoms by repetitive hand activities, which could be relieved
             by resting, rubbing, and shaking the hand; and

          3. nocturnal awakening by such sensory symptoms.- plus the presence of 1 or more of the
             following standard electrophysiologic criteria:

               -  (1) prolonged distal motor latency (DML) to the abductor pollicis brevis
                  (APB)(abnormal Z4.7 ms, stimulation over the wrist, 8 cm proximal to the active
                  electrode);

               -  (2) prolonged antidromic distal sensory latency (DSL) to the second digit
                  (abnormal Z3.1 ms; stimulation over the wrist, 14 cm proximal to the active
                  electrode); and

               -  (3) prolonged antidromic wrist-palm sensory nerve conduction velocity (W-P SNCV)
                  at a distance of 8 cm (W-P SNCV, abnormal &lt;45 m/s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. symptoms occurring less than 3 months before the study or symptoms improving during
             the 1-month initial observation period (to exclude patients who might have spontaneous
             resolution of symptoms);

          2. severe CTS that had progressed to visible muscle atrophy;

          3. in our study, mild CTS referred to patients with decreased conduction velocity over
             the palm-wrist segment and delayed DSL, with normal median SNAP amplitude and CMAP
             amplitude of the APB. Moderate CTS referred to patients with abnormally delayed DML
             and DSL with either decreased median SNAP amplitude or decreased CMAP amplitude of the
             APB muscle. Thus, CTS patients with the presence of either fibrillation potentials or
             reinnervation on needle EMG in the APB were excluded (to ensure the inclusion of only
             mildly or moderately affected individuals);

          4. clinical or electrophysiologic evidence of accompanying conditions that could mimic
             CTS or interfere with its evaluation, such as cervical radiculopathy, proximal median
             neuropathy, or significant polyneuropathy;

          5. evidence of obvious underlying causes of CTS such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid
             arthritis, hypothyroidism (acromegaly), pregnancy, alcohol abuse or drug usage
             (steroids or drugs acting through the central nervous system), use of vibrating
             machinery, and suspected malignancy or inflammation or autoimmune disease were
             documented as underlying causes for CTS;

          6. recent peptic ulcer or history of steroid intolerance;

          7. prior unpleasant experience with acupuncture or a bleeding diathesis; or

          8. cognitive impairment interfering with the patient's ability to follow instructions and
             describe symptoms.-
