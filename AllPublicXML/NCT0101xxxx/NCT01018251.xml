      This study will investigate the sensitivity and specificity of FLT-PET/CT in primary breast
      cancer detection and in the use of FLT-PET in monitoring how well a breast tumor respond to
      treatment. We will compare this technique with other imaging modalities as well as with
      tissue collection (during a biopsy). We will recruit women with a newly diagnosed invasive
      breast cancer, who are able to tolerate undergoing a PET/CT (possibly two scans) scan,

      Our overall goal is to use this clinical trial as a platform to validate fibroblast
      activation protein (FAP) as a biomarker for the tumor microenvironment and to explore the
      dynamic interaction between proliferating tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment. Our
      long term goal is to develop new drugs that will target the tumor microenvironment as novel
      therapeutic and chemoprevention strategies.
