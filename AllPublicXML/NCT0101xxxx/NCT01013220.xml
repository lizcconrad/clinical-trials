    <textblock>
      Randomized trials demonstrate that depression management products can improve clinical and
      organizational outcomes sufficiently for selected employers to realize a return on
      investment. Rather than usual care marketing which uses voltage-enhanced promises to sell
      voltage-diminished products, the investigators designed an evidence-based (EB) intervention
      to encourage employers to purchase a depression management product that offers the type,
      intensity and duration of care shown to provide clinical and organizational value. In an RCT
      designed to examine employer benefit purchasing behavior of depression products in 360
      employer members of over 20 regional business coalitions, the research team proposes: (a) to
      compare the impact of evidence-based (EB) to usual care (UC) presentations on employer
      benefit purchasing behavior, and (b) to identify mediators and organizational moderators of
      intervention impact on employer benefit purchasing behavior.

      This study addresses what policy analysts argue is one of the most pivotal problems in the
      translation of evidence-based care to 'real world' settings: whether purchasers can be
      influenced to buy health care products on the basis of value rather than cost. In the likely
      event that EB &gt; UC, the study will provide encouragement to use an evidence-based approach to
      market new health care products to private payers on the basis of the product's clinical and
      organizational value. UC may achieve comparable outcomes to EB if the limiting factors in
      benefit purchasing are organizational, purchasing group and vendor constraints that no
      intervention can meaningfully modify. Support for this scenario would encourage the targeted
      marketing of new products to coalition members with empirically identified organizational,
      purchasing group and vendor characteristics, using usual care strategies.
