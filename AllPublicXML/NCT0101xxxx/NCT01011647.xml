    <textblock>
      A novel technique in identifying unspecified sleep apnea has been developed. This technique
      uses signals typical acquired from a bedside monitor that is found in critical care
      environments. Those signals are then processed by a sleep analysis algorithm to provide an
      Apnoea Hypopnea Index (AHI) score. This study is intended to determine whether the prevalence
      of sleep disordered breathing identification among patients in a Coronary Care Unit (CCU)
      using this novel approach is significantly different than using routine techniques.

      This study will focus on inpatients diagnosed with coronary conditions. Specific eligibility
      criteria will include:

        -  Unstable angina

        -  Acute myocardial infarction

        -  Congestive heart failure Subjects enrolled in the study will be scored for sleep apnea
           using a novel approach designed by the sponsor. That score will not be used in the
           course of treatment. A follow-up call will determine whether the subject was identified
           for sleep disordered breathing during the hospital stay. A comparison will be done on
           the number of those identified with and without the use of the sleep scoring device.
