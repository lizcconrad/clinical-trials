      The purpose of this study is to assess corneal staining and to measure the relative corneal
      epithelial &quot;barrier&quot; function (the degree to which the cornea can prevent penetration of
      colored sodium fluorescein dye into the eye) after 8 hours of wear with a known soft contact
      lens and multipurpose lens care solution combination.

      This investigation will evaluate corneal staining and epithelial barrier function after eight
      hours of contact lens wear, which is past the peak staining time and more typical of daily
      lens wear time. A silicone hydrogel lens and multipurpose solution combination shown to
      induce significant corneal staining ( e.g. equivalent Grade 3 out of Grade 4 scale) will be
      used to evaluate potential corneal compromise. The study will be a prospective,
      single-center, double-masked, contralateral, daily wear investigation in adapted soft contact
      lens wearers. After a three day washout period (without lens wear, lenses will then be worn
      on one day for eight hours. Corneal staining and barrier function will be determined for a
      regimen and a saline control situation for each subject. Staining will be graded using the
      Efron Grading Scale, and permeability data will be estimated as the fluorescein penetration
      rate, Pdc in nm/sec for the test and control condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Understand your rights as a research subject and give written informed consent by
             signing the Informed Consent Form, Subject Bill of Rights, and Patient Authorization
             for Use and Release of Health and Research Study Information (HIPAA form).

          -  Be likely to finish the entire study, understand the study instructions, and be
             willing to follow the instructions.

          -  Contact lens prescription between +4.00 D to -9.00 D (spherical equivalent).

          -  Best correctable visual acuity of at least 20/40 in each eye.

          -  Willing to de-adapt (do not wear) from habitual contact lenses for a period of at
             least two days prior to eligibility visit and at least two days prior to the testing
             day.

          -  Possess a functional spectacle (eyeglass) prescription to allow adequate vision during
             the de-adaptation and barrier function determination periods.

          -  No known allergies, which may interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  No known systemic (pertaining to general health) disease, or need for medication that
             may interfere with contact lens wear (i.e. antihistamines, beta-blockers, steroids).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Less than one month successful, full time (defined as at least 8 hours per day, and
             more than 5 days per week) soft lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant corneal swelling (greater than grade 3 or 4 on a 0-4 scale),
             corneal blood vessel growth (vascularization), corneal staining, bulbar redness,
             tarsal redness, or any other abnormality of the cornea that may cause unsafe contact
             lens wear.

          -  Any active ocular infection.

          -  Prior corneal refractive surgery (i.e., LASIK, PRK, etc).

          -  Have used medications within 24 hours of study entry or have an ongoing need to use
             ocular medication.

          -  Are taking part in any other study or have taken part in a study within the last 14
             days

          -  Have a medical condition that your study eye doctor thinks may make it not appropriate
             for you to participate in this study.

          -  Are pregnant, or anticipate becoming pregnant during the course of this study.
