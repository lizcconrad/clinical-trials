  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunosuppressive drugs such as tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus
      and everolimus may have toxic pulmonary effects, particularly interstitial alterations. The
      aim of the present study is to explore the presence of subclinical interstitial lung
      abnormalities in stable renal transplant recipients taking the different immunosuppressive
      drugs used as maintenance therapy for renal transplantation.

      Prospective, cross-sectional study examining the high-resolution CT scans obtained in 63
      stable renal transplant recipients taking immunosuppressive treatment for at least 24 months.
      The findings in patients taking the newer immunosuppressive drugs (mycophenolic acid,
      sirolimus and everolimus) are compared with those of the patients treated in the traditional
      way (cyclosporine, tacrolimus, azathioprine). All patients undergo high-resolution CT
      scanning.

      Eligibility criteria: recipients of kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant, on
      immunosuppressive therapy for at least 24 months, with stable renal function and absence of
      any overt lung disease or lung alterations induced by other drugs, systemic diseases or
      occupational exposure to fibrogenic agents.
