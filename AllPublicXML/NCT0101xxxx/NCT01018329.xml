      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging, may help doctors
      predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment. PURPOSE: This
      clinical trial is studying magnetic resonance imaging in response to radiation therapy in
      patients with high grade glioma.

      Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop a multimodality statistical model to act as a surrogate marker scheme of early
      changes in high grade glioma patients undergoing radiation therapy, using conventional MRI,
      MR diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion, permeability, and spectroscopic imaging while
      incorporating the radiation dose calculations delivered locally and the results of a clinical
      questionnaire into the model.

      II. To assess treatment response to tumor and normal tissue changes. OUTLINE: Patients
      undergo multimodality MRI imaging at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and then 4-6 weeks
      after completion of radiation therapy.
