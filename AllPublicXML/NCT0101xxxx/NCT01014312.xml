      This research study develop a collaborative depression care management model (C-DCM) that
      encourages collaboration between primary care physicians (PCPs) and trained social workers
      employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depression affects 5%-9% of older primary care patients, is often chronic or recurrent
      and disabling, and leads to frequent use of medical services. Most depressed elders are
      treated by primary care physicians (PCPs) and prior research has shown that collaboration
      between primary care physicians and depression care managers is effective in treating
      depression. The challenge has been in securing third-party reimbursement for such services.

      This research study will address this barrier by developing a collaborative depression care
      management model (C-DCM) that encourages collaboration between PCPs and trained social
      workers employed by community-based, public and nonprofit mental health clinics. In addition
      to developing C-DCM, a total of 112 primary care outpatients will participate in this study
      to test whether C-DCM is more effective than the standard of care in decreasing the severity
      of depression and disability experienced by older adults. Each subject will be randomized
      into either Usual Care or C-DCM. All subjects will be assessed at Baseline and at 2 and 4
      months while the C-DCM subjects will also meet with social worker depression case managers
      bi-weekly over four months. If shown effective, C-DCM may bring to bear an available, yet
      untapped resource in the care of depressed elders.

    <description>Depression Care Management (DCM) includes: 1. Monitoring the course of the depressive disorder; 2. Contacting the referring primary care physician (PCP) and offering information on the patients' current psychiatric status and medical complaints and the treatment recommended by published pharmacotherapy guidelines; 3. Determining the nature and extent of stressors affecting the patients' clinical status and functioning; 4. Psychoeducation concerning depression and depression treatment, working with the patient to select an appropriate treatment based on informed treatment preferences, and emphasizing treatment adherence; and 5. Supportive psychotherapy.</description>

    <description>Primary Care Physicians will be informed by letter from a study psychologist of the participants' depression diagnosis and of suicidal ideation when present. They will have no direct assistance regarding depression treatment, but they will be educated on guideline-based antidepressant treatment recommendations. Moreover, research assistants will use a suicide risk protocol at baseline and at all follow-up assessment periods that mandates immediate contact with PCPs by telephone or beeper in cases with significant risk.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 60 years and older: This study focuses on the clinical complexities of late-life
             depression and its treatment. Family Services of Westchester (our partner community
             mental health agency) offers geriatric mental health counseling services to adults age
             60 and older.

          -  Diagnosis of unipolar major depression

          -  MADRS score &gt;=18: Depression of such severity in primary care patients requires
             treatment.

          -  CANE score &gt;0: Reflects the presence of at least one unmet need in the domains of
             housing, self-care, safety, finances, benefits, legal matters, transportation, etc.
             and thus need for social services.

          -  Capacity to provide written consent for both research assessment and depression care
             management: PCPs will be asked to clinically evaluate prospective participants'
             capacity to consent and document it in their medical record.

          -  Working knowledge of English: Command in English sufficient for comprehending
             questionnaires of the study and/or for understanding the DCM therapists. English does
             not have to be the subject's first language.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Psychotic depression: This will be determined by the Structured Clinical Interview for
             DSM Disorders(SCID) assessment; presence of delusions and or hallucinations. This is a
             severe disorder typically referred for treatment to mental health specialists.

          -  Active suicidal ideation: This will be determined by the SCID and MADRS assessments.
             Older patients at these levels of risk for self-harm typically are referred to mental
             health specialists.

          -  Antisocial personality by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
             (DSM)IV: This disorder will possibly interfere with adherence to research procedures
             and treatment.

          -  Significant Cognitive Impairment (MMSE score &lt;24) or clinical diagnosis of dementia by
             DSM-IV: These conditions may limit the patient's ability to participate in treatment
             and require social service interventions exceeding those available through the
             proposed depression care management models.

          -  Current participation in specialist psychiatric care: Such patients will require the
             development of collaborative arrangements for depression care management which differ
             from those being tested in this study.

          -  Acute or severe medical illness: i.e., delirium, metastatic cancer, decompensated
             cardiac, liver or kidney failure, major surgery, stroke or myocardial infarction
             during the three months prior to entry; or drugs often causing depression, e.g.,
             steroids, reserpine, alpha-methyl-dopa, tamoxifen, vincristine.
