  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an inherited syndrome manifested by a variety of benign
      and malignant tumors. Hemangioblastomas are the most common lesion associated with VHL
      disease affecting 60-84% of patients with a mean age at diagnosis of 29 years. Standard
      treatment for this disease is by surgery or radiotherapy. No approved systemic therapy yet
      exists. Patients with VHL have an increased growth factor production, specifically vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), resulting in angiogenesis (growth of blood vessels).
      Studies show that Bevacizumab inhibits the growth of VEGF protein and will block the
      VEGF-driven angiogenesis and result in stabilization and regression of hemangioblastomas in
      VHL disease patients. The dose of bevacizumab will be 10 mg/kg every two weeks for up to 6
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  One or more CNS hemangioblastomas not amendable to surgical resection or recurrent
             post resection

          -  Confirmed diagnosis of von-Hippel-Lindau disease

          -  No prior treatment with VEGF inhibitors

          -  Index hemangioblastomas lesion at least 5mm on MRI

          -  No major bleeding event from hemangioblastoma within 90 days

          -  KPS &gt; or equal to 60%

          -  Age &gt; or equal to 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with VEGF inhibitors

          -  Major bleeding event from hemangioblastoma within 90 days

          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow up procedures

          -  Life expectancy of less than 12 weeks

          -  Current or recent (within 4 weeks of the first infusion of this study) participation
             in an experimental drug study other than a Genentech sponsored bevacizumab cancer
             study

          -  Active malignancy will be permissible if treating physician deems that concurrent
             administration of bevacizumab is not contraindicated and that the patient would be
             able to complete with the other parameters of the protocol
