      Viral eradication in selected HIV-infected patients is possible with intensive antiretroviral
      therapy plus immunomodulation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall strategy of the ERAMUNE 01 Trial is to treat selected patients with an optimal
      synergistic antiretroviral regimen plus one or more immunomodulating agents. Among
      immunomodulating treatments the candidates include therapies from two functional classes: 1)
      agents that target actively replicating cells and 2) agents activating latently infected
      cells31.

      The novelty of this approach is three-fold: first, the use of highly potent antiretroviral
      therapy combining drugs with different HIV enzymes targets or receptors and different
      penetrations in cells, with the aim to suppress virus to truly undetectable levels as
      measured by the most sophisticated viral quantification techniques; secondly, the addition of
      an immunomodulatory therapy that specifically targets viral reservoirs to this
      intensification strategy; and lastly, the rigorous selection of patients having already a low
      HIV reservoir as measured by peripheral blood HIV DNA content. To our knowledge, this type of
      strategy has not been implemented. We believe this strategy is feasible.
