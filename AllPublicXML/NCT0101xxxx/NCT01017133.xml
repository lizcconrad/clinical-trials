      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography, using the drug
      fluorine F18-EF5 to find oxygen and fludeoxyglucose F18 to find sugar in tumor cells may help
      in planning treatment for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying fluorine F18-EF5 and fludeoxyglucose F18 positron
      emission tomography in assessing hypoxia and glycolysis in patients with stage I, stage II,
      or stage III non-small cell lung cancer.Detailed DescriptionOBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and hypoxia as
      determine by 18F-EF5 PET scanning in patients with NSCLC.

      II. To determine whether there is an association between Akt activation and increased
      glycolysis as determined by 18F-FDG PET imaging in patients with NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: Within 6 weeks prior to surgery, patients undergo fluorine F18 (18F)-EF5 PET at 10
      minutes and 90 minutes after injection of 18F-EF5. Patients also undergo fludeoxyglucose F18
      (18F-FDG) PET at 1 hour and 3 hours after injection of 18FFDG.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a histologically confirmed NSCLC or clinical and imaging evidence
             of a de novo mass that is likely to be a NSCLC, stage I, II, or IIIA, for which
             surgery would be indicated for routine medical indications

          -  ECOG performance status between 0 and 2

          -  Subjects must sign an informed consent document that indicates they are aware of the
             investigational nature of the treatment in this protocol as well as the potential
             risks and benefits

          -  WBC &gt; 2,000/mm^3

          -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm^3

          -  Total bilirubin

          -  Serum AST and ALT

          -  Serum creatinine

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test if a female of childbearing age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to Flagyl (metronidazole), which has a
             chemical structure similar to EF5

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness that would limit compliance with study requirements

          -  Pregnant women and women who are breastfeeding are excluded

          -  Subjects who have been treated with neoadjuvant radiation or chemotherapy prior to
             their biopsy or excision are excluded because the impact of these therapies upon the
             degree of hypoxia of the tumor is unknown
