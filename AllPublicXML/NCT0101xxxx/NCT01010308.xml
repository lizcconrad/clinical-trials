  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of Nadolol in hemangiomas of
      infancy.

      The secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled
      trial comparing nadolol with corticosteroids and propranolol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Systemic corticosteroids are currently the most frequent used medication for treatment of
      problematic infantile hemangiomas (IH's). Since June 2008, systemic propranolol has been an
      important addition to the therapeutic options for problematic IH, allowing decreased
      dependence on the systemic corticosteroids. So far, we have found excellent response with
      propranolol with minimal short-term side effects. Studies, which compared nadolol and
      propranolol in children with other conditions, suggest that nadolol is safer and more
      efficacious than propranolol. In addition, it has better dosing schedules and less central
      nervous system (CNS) penetration, making it suitable even for patients with suspected or
      proven PHACES syndrome.
