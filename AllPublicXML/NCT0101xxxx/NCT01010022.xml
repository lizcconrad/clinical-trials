  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study shall evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different hydroxyethyl starch
      solutions (artificial colloids 6% HES130/0.4 and 6% HES70/0.5, Salinhes®) for intra-operative
      therapy of hypovolemia and maintenance of circulating blood volume in patients undergoing
      orthopedic surgery. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the required volume of colloid
      solution infused from start until end of surgery. It is the aim of the clinical trial to
      demonstrate that comparable volumes of colloid solution are used between treatment groups.
