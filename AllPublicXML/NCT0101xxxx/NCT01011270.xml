  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Workers in the various branches of the investigators industrial society can be considered as
      a group susceptible to risks due to the nature of its activities related to the intense
      demands of their work units with varying degrees of physical overload. Among the risk factors
      involved in postural genesis of occupational low back pain is work in uncomfortable
      positions, such as maintenance of static postures for long periods of time and frequent
      implementation of flexion, extension and trunk rotation.The association between body
      instability (lack of postural balance) and back pain is seen with some frequency, especially
      in working groups.

      The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of rehabilitation of the dynamic muscle
      (RDM®) in back pain and postural balance of industrial operators. The sample consisted of
      industrial operators, individuals with low back pain, referred to the industry of Physical
      Therapy. After the screening criteria of inclusion and exclusion, 82 individuals were
      randomly selected and divided at random in: experimental group (GE, n = 41, age = 41 ± 4
      years, body mass index (IMC) = 26.46 ± 3 , 25) and control group (CG, n = 42, age = 42 ± 5
      years, IMC = 26.47 ± 3.34).

      The GE was part of treatment with RDM. The CG was composed of individuals who did not
      participate in any physical therapy treatment during the search. The procedures used for
      evaluation were: back pain (Borg scale) and postural balance (pedana stabilometric and
      posturométrica). The process of intervention by the RDM had a duration of 20 minutes,
      frequency of twice a week and was extended for 12 weeks, and the systematic treatment
      performed on 4 occasions.
