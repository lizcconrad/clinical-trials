      The purpose of this study is to introduce a new operative technique for reconstruction of
      fingertip degloving injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Incidence of fingertip degloving injury is common and can result in functional morbidity. A
      cross-finger flap based on the dorsal branch artery (DBA) including sensory nerve is a useful
      reconstructive technique.In our modification, the innervated sensory flap is vascularized by
      the DBA, both its pedicle is narrow and its coverage is extended, the projecting tip of
      exposed distal phalanx of adjacent digits therefore can be wrapped.
