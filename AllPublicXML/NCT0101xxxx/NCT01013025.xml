      The main study objective was to collect implant retrieval information in 10 patients using
      Vantas®, the 50 mg histrelin implant. Patients who had been identified as having a difficult
      to locate or non-palpable implant were to have been enrolled. Sites were to adhere to the
      instructions in the Package Insert, which included specialized investigations such as
      ultrasound, CT, and MRI, to be used for the location and removal of implants.

      Up to 50 centers using Vantas, the recently approved histrelin implant as part of their
      urology practice for treating patients with advanced prostate cancer, were to be identified
      for participation in this Phase IV post-marketing trial. Up to 10 patients who had been
      implanted with Vantas at these participating centers, and who had difficult to locate or
      non-palpable implants at the time of removal, were to be enrolled in this trial. A Screening
      Visit was to be conducted to consent the patient and to collect basic medical and safety
      information for patient participation. Upon patient enrollment, up to three subsequent Visits
      (Visits 1, 2, and 3) were to be conducted (within 2 weeks of the Screening Visit). The
      investigator was to locate and remove the implant by following the instructions provided in
      the protocol. Methods for location of the implant included ultrasound, CT, or MRI procedures.
      The visit at which the implant was successfully located and removed was to be the final study
      visit for the patient. Upon successful retrieval of the implant or a determination that, per
      Study Instructions, the implant cannot be located/removed, the study was completed for the
      patient. No information was to be collected on re-implantation of a new implant. Safety was
      to be monitored throughout the two week study. Blood samples for testosterone and PSA were
      only collected at the Screening Visit. The implants removed from the patients were to be
      returned to Indevus Pharmaceuticals for analysis.
