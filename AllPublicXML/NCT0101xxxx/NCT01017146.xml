      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group study comparing
      tazarotene foam with vehicle foam in subjects with acne vulgaris. Approximately 742 subjects
      will be enrolled and randomized to 1 of the 2 study product groups in a 1:1 ratio (tazarotene
      foam: vehicle foam). Subjects will apply tazarotene foam or vehicle foam to the entire face
      once daily for 12 weeks; study visits will occur at baseline (week 0/day 1) and at weeks 2,
      4, 8, and 12.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0/Day 1) and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>LC: count of all inflammatory lesions (ILs, i.e., papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-inflammatory lesions (NILs, i.e., open and closed comedones) at Baseline and at Week 12. Total lesions (TLs) were calculated as the sum of ILs and NILs. LC was confined to the face (including forehead, nose, checks, and chin). Change from Baseline at Week 12 was calculated as the value at Week 12 minus the value at Baseline.</description>

    <description>Investigators evaluated the acne severity (S) of the participants' face using the ISGA scale, ranging from 0 to 5: 0=clear skin with no ILs or NILs; 1=almost clear: rare NIL with no more than rare papules; 2=mild S: &gt;G 1, some NILs with no more than a few ILs (papules/pustules only, no nodular lesions [NLs]); 3=moderate S: &gt;G 2, up to many NILs and may have some ILs, but no more than one small NL; 4=severe: greater than G 3, up to many NILs and ILs, but no more than a few NLs; 5=very severe: many NILs and ILs and more than a few NLs, may have cystic lesions.</description>

    <description>LC: count of all ILs (i.e., papules, pustules, and nodules) and NILs (i.e., open and closed comedones) at Baseline and at Week 12. TLs were calculated as the sum of ILs and NILs. LC was confined to the face (including forehead, nose, checks, and chin). Percent change from Baseline in LC at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and12 was calculated as the (Week 2/4/8/12 value minus the baseline value divided by baseline value) x 100.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Week 0/Day 1); Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DLQI was used to measure how much the participants' skin problem had affected their life over the last week.

        <title>Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score From Baseline at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 in Participants 17 Years of Age or Older</title>
        <description>The DLQI was used to measure how much the participants’ skin problem had affected their life over the last week. The DLQI total score ranges from 0 to 30: 0-1=no effect at all on the participant’s life; 2-5=small effect on the participant’s life; 6-10=moderate effect on the participant’s life; 11-20=very large effect on the participant’s life; 21-30=extremely large effect on the participant’s life. A lower score on the DLQI indicates increased quality of life; therefore, negative changes from Baseline indicate improvements.</description>

        <description>Erythema is a skin condition characterized by redness or rash. Local tolerability assessments were performed by the Investigator at each study visit and were graded based on severity as G0 to G4: G0=absent (no redness); G1=slight (faint red or pink coloration, barely perceptible); G2=mild (light red or pink coloration); G3=moderate (medium red coloration); G4=severe (beet red coloration). Maximum During Treatment is defined as the maximum severity of erythema reported at any time during treatment.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Local Tolerability Assessment for Drying as Evaluated by the Investigator</title>
        <description>Dryness: skin epidermis that lacks moisture/sebum. Local tolerability assessments were performed by the Investigator at each study visit and were graded based on severity as G0 to G4. G0=absent (none); G1=slight (barely perceptible dryness with no flakes or fissure formation); G2=mild (easily perceptible dryness with no flakes or fissure formation); G3=moderate (easily noted dryness and flakes but no fissure formation); G4=severe (easily noted dryness with flakes and fissure formation). Maximum During Treatment is defined as the maximum severity of drying reported at any time during treatment.</description>

Local tolerability assessments for peeling were performed by the Investigator at each study visit and were graded based on severity as G0 to G4: G0=absent (no peeling); G1=slight (mild localized peeling); G2=mild (mild and diffuse peeling); G3=moderate (moderate and diffuse peeling); G4=severe (moderate to prominent, dense peeling). Maximum During Treatment is defined as the maximum severity of peeling reported at any time during treatment.</description>

        <description>Burning/stinging is a pain and burning sensation. Local tolerability assessments were performed by the participant at each study visit based on severity as G0 to G3: G0=none; G1=slight; G2=moderate; G3=strong. Maximum During Treatment is defined as the maximum severity of burning/stinging reported at any time during treatment.</description>

A sufficient amount of study product was applied to cover the entire face and was gently rubbed into the skin until the study product disappeared. Tazarotene foam was packaged in a 100-gram aluminum can pressurized with a hydrocarbon propellant.</description>

          <description>Tazarotene foam containing 0.1% tazarotene in an emulsion formulation foam vehicle was applied to the face once daily in the early evening for 12 weeks. A sufficient amount of study product was applied to cover the entire face and was gently rubbed into the skin until the study product disappeared. Tazarotene foam was packaged in a 100-gram aluminum can pressurized with a hydrocarbon propellant.</description>
