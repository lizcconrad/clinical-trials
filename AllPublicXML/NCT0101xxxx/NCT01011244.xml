      Up to date, a sure cure for Crohn's fistula does not known and the fistula recurrence rate is
      high. On 15 October 2008, orphan designation was granted by Korea FDA for human
      adipose-derived stem cell (ADIPOPLUS) for the treatment of Crohn's fistula. In this study,
      patients are given injection of ADIPOPLUS in fistula site and followed for 8 weeks to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy.
