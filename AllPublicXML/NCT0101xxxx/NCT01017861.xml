    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that women are more likely to experience pain in many medical
      situations. During pregnancy, women may experience an increase in pain threshold. This is
      thought to be related to hormonal changes and an increase in the level of certain natural
      pain-relieving substances in their bodies.

      It is important to develop simple tests to identify woman at higher risk for pain so the
      investigators can help them.

      Temporal summation is what happens when a person becomes more sensitive to a certain feeling
      on their skin when it is applied several times over the course of several seconds. The
      investigators hypothesize that pregnant women show decreased temporal summation and pain
      scores to venipuncture, compared to non-pregnant women.

      Recent epidemiologic studies have shown that women are at substantially greater risk for many
      clinical pain conditions, and there is a suggestion that postoperative and procedural pain
      may be more severe among women then men. During pregnancy, women experience an elevation in
      the threshold to pain and discomfort. In addition to hormonal changes, the changes in pain
      perception during pregnancy may be related to an increase in endogenous opioids.

      Pain is the most feared experience in the intra and postpartum period, and severe pain
      experienced during this time can lead to significant morbidity, including chronic pain and
      depression. Much attention has been paid to tests that can predict patients at higher risk
      for pain. Temporal summation (TS) has been shown to be a simple and reliable test. Temporal
      summation represents the physiological wind-up phenomenon taking place at the spinal level of
      the central pain pathways. TS extent can be measured in humans by administering a series of
      noxious stimuli of constant intensity and of various modalities in order to evoke an increase
      in perceived pain. It is a very simple and easy test to perform, and very well tolerated by
      patients. Whether TS changes in pregnancy and whether TS in pregnancy correlates with pain
      perception during acute stimuli such as venipuncture is unknown.
