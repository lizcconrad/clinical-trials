  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research trial is testing the experimental treatment MSC1936369B in combination with
      Gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The study will be run in
      two parts:

      Safety Run-In: Will determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase II
      dose of MSC1936369B, when combined with gemcitabine, in subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

      Phase II: Will assess the anti-tumor activity of MSC1936369B combined with gemcitabine
      compared to gemcitabine alone as first line treatment in subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has provided signed informed consent. Fully understands requirements of the
             trial and willing to comply with all trial visits and assessments.

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas
             and availability of tumor sample.

          3. Evidence of disease (not necessarily measurable disease). Complete tumor assessment
             including chest X ray, CT scan of abdomen and other scans as necessary to document all
             sites of disease performed within 28 days prior to trial entry/randomization.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative blood pregnancy test at the
             screening visit. For the purposes of this trial, women of childbearing potential is
             defined as: &quot;All female subjects after puberty unless they are post-menopausal for at
             least two years, are surgically sterile or are sexually inactive.&quot;

          6. Female subjects of childbearing potential and male subjects with female partners of
             childbearing potential must be willing to avoid pregnancy by using an adequate method
             of contraception for 2 weeks prior to screening, during and four weeks after the last
             dose of trial medication. Adequate contraception is defined as two barrier methods, or
             one barrier method with a spermicide, or intrauterine device. The use of hormonal
             contraceptives should be avoided in female subjects of childbearing potential due to a
             possible drug-drug interaction.

All AEs (serious and non-serious) except AEs recorded with an onset date prior to the first day of drug administration unless a worsening of the event was recorded after the first dosing date, in which case the event was counted as a TEAE.
