  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While sunitinib can be very helpful to treat kidney cancer, these medications can also cause
      side effects, including heart damage. Studies performed in the past did not look at heart
      function in detail, so the investigators do not know what happens to the heart when people
      start sunitinib treatment. The aim of the study is to prospectively study acute effects of
      sunitinib on heart function, overall fitness and blood markers of heart disease.

      Participants will undergo cardiac MRI, maximal exercise testing(VO2 peak), blood and urine
      samples before and after 2 treatments of sunitinib. An extra blood sample will be collected
      the 2nd week of the first treatment to check blood levels of sunitinib. We will also examine
      routine CT scans to study body composition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma

          -  Eligible to receive first-line sunitinib

          -  Willingness to attend Cross Cancer Institute and University of Alberta for
             study-related assessments

          -  Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS)82 ≥ 70

          -  Age ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Adequate creatinine clearance to receive gadolinium

          -  All patients with bone metastases are eligible; those with lesions identified at
             weight-bearing bones will undergo plain films to evaluate fracture risk prior to CPET;

          -  Fluent in English language

          -  No contraindication to MRI or other concern eg., metallic implants, claustrophobia

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior systemic therapy for mRCC

          -  Documented history of major cardiac event in last year i.e. MI, unstable angina, CABG,
             symptomatic CHF, CVA or TIA, or pulmonary embolism

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Other severe condition or abnormality that, in the judgement of the investigator or
             treating oncologist, would make participation in this study inappropriate

          -  Unstable brain metastases
