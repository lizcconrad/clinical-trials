  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this protocol is to determine the frequency of oncogenic mutations
      in 1000 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung. The linked clinical and mutational
      analyses will be used to determine the frequency of each mutation, its association with
      clinical features and outcome, and its association with other mutations. As future
      therapeutic protocols specific for these mutations are developed, patients may be notified of
      their eligibility for these studies. Future translational studies may be used to: a) unravel
      the complex biology of lung cancer; b) identify prognostic markers; c) define predictive
      markers of response/resistance to new therapies; d) identify new targets. A secondary goal is
      to establish a consortium of sites that have the capability of conducting multiple mutation
      testing in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified lab.
