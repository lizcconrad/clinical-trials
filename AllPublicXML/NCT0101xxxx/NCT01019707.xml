  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of 4 nontreatment seeking individuals who were MA-dependent and the safety
      and tolerability of atomoxetine. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study
      is to determine the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine.

      MA abusing participants will undergo a 1-day outpatient screening and if it is safe for the
      participants to proceed with the study they will participate in two inpatient components of
      the study that will occur in the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) General Clinical
      Research Center (GCRC). The first inpatient stay will be 15 days, and the second will be a 9
      days stay that includes drug administration and assessments. There will be at least a two
      week interval between inpatient components. During the inpatient components participants will
      receive alternating study drugs; atomoxetine or placebo and four sessions of IV MA
      administration or saline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The safety of using atomoxetine in MA users will be characterized by measuring the
      cardiovascular effects of MA and by determining the occurrence of adverse reactions during
      treatment with atomoxetine and placebo. We will evaluate atomoxetine (0 and 40 mg, BID) and
      MA doses (0 and 30 mg, IV).

      Participants will be randomized to atomoxetine or matched placebo for 6 days. Study drug will
      be administered once daily at 40 mg/day on the first two study days, twice daily for days
      3-5, &amp; once on day 6. After discharge from the first component, and at least a 2-week washout
      period, participants will be re-admitted to the UCLA GCRC and switched to the opposite study
      medication for an additional 6 days.

      Methamphetamine/saline will be administered non-contingently on component I day 13, and
      component II day 7, over 1 min using a syringe pump activated by the study physician or nurse
      practitioner in order to assess safety and tolerability of atomoxetine. During drug
      administration sessions, heart rate and blood pressure will be monitored frequently. A code
      team will respond if required. Vital signs must remain within values specified under Stopping
      Criteria for initiation of MA administration. The physician or nurse practitioner will
      administer the MA/placebo and will be available in-house on pager for at least 4 h after each
      infusion. In addition, heart rate and blood pressure will be assessed three times daily
      throughout the inpatient portion of the protocol.

        recent use).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. A current or past history of seizure disorder, including alcohol- or stimulant-related
             seizure, febrile seizure, or significant family history of idiopathic seizure
             disorder.

             to the lungs.) If respiratory disease is excluded and the subject will consent to
             discontinue agonist use, s/he may be considered for inclusion.

         13. For subjects suspect for asthma but without formal diagnosis, 1) have a history of
             coughing and/or wheezing, 2) have a history of asthma and/or asthma treatment two or
             more years before, 3) have a history of other respiratory illness, e.g., complications
             of pulmonary disease (exclude if on beta agonists), 4) use over-the-counter agonist or
             allergy medication for respiratory problems (e.g., Primatene Mist): a detailed history

         14. Have any illness, condition, and/or use of medications that in the opinion of the site
             Principal Investigator and the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or
             successful completion of the study.

         15. Have active syphilis that has not been treated or refuse treatment for syphilis.

         16. Be undergoing HIV treatment with antiviral and non-antiviral therapy.

         19. Have evidence of significant liver or kidney dysfunction.

         20. Have a history of urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction.
