  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people involved know the identity of the intervention), single
      arm, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), prospective study (study following participants forward in time) to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of OROS methylphenidate in participants with ADHD (behavior disorder
      originating in childhood in which the essential features are signs of developmentally
      inappropriate inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity). The study duration will be of 12
      weeks per participant, which is divided into 2 parts Screening (within 14 days before study
      commences on Day -1) and treatment (8 weeks and will include titration period [from the
      initiation of the study treatment to determination of the individual's maintenance dose] and
      maintenance period [at least 4 weeks after determination of maintenance dose]). Participants
      will receive initial dose depending on their body weight. OROS methylphenidate hydrochloride
      (HCL) will be given orally once daily at an initial dose of 18 milligram (mg) for
      participants below 30 kilogram (kg) and 27 mg for those over 30 kg of body weight. The dose
      will be increased by 9 mg or 18 mg every week for up to Week 8, followed by a maximum
      maintenance dose of 54 mg orally once daily up to Week 12 during which the dose can be
      decreased by 9 mg depending on tolerability. Efficacy will be evaluated by Korean Version,
      ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) total score and Clinical Global Impression)-Severity / Impression
      rating scale CGI-S/I. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the trial.

        <description>CAT was developed to properly reflect brain function in childhood. It provided measurement of simple visual selective attention in terms of omission (number of missing response to target stimulus [0-150], higher score indicate greater omission), false alarm (number of response to non-target stimulus [0-150], higher score indicate greater false alarm), response mean (average time spent to response to target stimulus [200-1100, low score means faster response to target stimulus]), Response (consistency of response time to target stimulus [30-650, Low score means good consistency of response]).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included participants who received the study drug at least once and had the primary efficacy endpoint data available. LOCF method was used. “N” (Number of Participants Analyzed) represents number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <description>CAT was developed to properly reflect brain function in childhood. It provided measurement of simple interference-selective attention in terms of omission(number of missing response to target stimulus[0-150], higher score indicate greater omission), false alarm(number of response to non-target stimulus[0-150], higher score indicate greater false alarm), response mean (average time spent to response to target stimulus [200-1100, low score means faster response to target stimulus]), Response (consistency of response time to target stimulus [30-650, Low score means good consistency of response]).</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population included participants who received the study drug at least once and had the primary efficacy endpoint data available. LOCF method was used. “N” (Number of Participants Analyzed) represents number of participants who were evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Working Memory Forward Subtest of Comprehensive Attention Test (CAT) at Week 12</title>
        <description>CAT was developed to properly reflect brain function in childhood. The test battery provided a comprehensive measurement of simple visual auditory attention, interventional visual-auditory selective attention, divided attention, continuous attention, and operational memory. Working memory forward was measured in terms of width of space and number of correct responses ranging from 0 to 10. For width of space boxes were presented on the screen and participants remembered the order of presented box. Participants pressed the box using mouse in the forward order. Maximum number that participants correctly memorized box in the screen in the respective order was reported and overall number of times a participant responded correctly was also reported.</description>

          <description>CAT was developed to properly reflect brain function in childhood. The test battery provided a comprehensive measurement of simple visual auditory attention, interventional visual-auditory selective attention, divided attention, continuous attention, and operational memory. Working memory forward was measured in terms of width of space and number of correct responses ranging from 0 to 10. For width of space boxes were presented on the screen and participants remembered the order of presented box. Participants pressed the box using mouse in the forward order. Maximum number that participants correctly memorized box in the screen in the respective order was reported and overall number of times a participant responded correctly was also reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;Normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;Among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher change scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale that requires the clinician to assess how much the participant’s illness has improved or worsened relative to a baseline state at the beginning of the intervention and rated as: 1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse. Improved very much, Improved much and Improved a little are defined as improvement and No change, Aggravated a little, Aggravated much and Aggravated very much were defined as aggravation.</description>
