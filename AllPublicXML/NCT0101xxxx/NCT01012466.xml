  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if negative thoughts have an effect on pain
      experienced during labor and how labor progresses. Other studies have shown that women who
      experience intense pain in the earliest stages of labor have a higher risk of complications.
      The investigators want to know if negative thoughts can predict this outcome.

      Subjects will complete questionnaires at three timepoints: during the prenatal period, within
      24-48 hours of giving birth, and 4-8 weeks postpartum. The questionnaires will measure pain
      catastrophizing, depression, maternal support, support and control in birth, and childbirth
      satisfaction. Chart review following delivery will record data such as length of labor,
      medication used, need for augmentation or surgical delivery, complications.
