    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this clinical trial are to determine if replacing sugar sweetened
      beverages with water consumption promote weight loss over 6 months in overweight adults and
      if replacing sugar sweetened beverages with water consumption promote greater weight loss
      over 6 months relative to replacement with other non-caloric sweetened beverages or control.

      The secondary objective is to identify mediators and moderators of the effect of water
      replacement including hydration status, glucose metabolism, anthropometrics, physical
      activity, dietary intake and resting metabolic rate.
