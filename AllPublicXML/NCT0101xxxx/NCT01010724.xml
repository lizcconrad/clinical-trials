    <textblock>
      The study drug bIAP, or matching placebo, will be administered as a bolus of 1000 Units bIAP
      or matching placebo prior to anaesthesia (T = -15 minutes), directly followed by intravenous
      continuous infusion of about 5.6 units per kg bodyweight/hr at pump rate 4 ml/hr for
      approximately 36 hrs (total 200 IU/kg/36 hrs) into each of a total of 50 patients scheduled
      for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Risk of surgical complications and mortality
      due to co-morbid conditions will be collected and the EuroSCORE will be used to screen
      patients prior to surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or non-pregnant, non-lactating female patients of any race in the ages of &gt;18
             years. Women must be of non-childbearing potential.

          2. Patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery with CPB.

          3. Patients must have a EuroSCORE (Appendix I) of &gt;2 and &lt;6.

          4. Patients who have given written informed consent prior to participation in the trial
             and who undertake to comply with the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are unwilling or unable to be fully evaluated for follow-up.

          2. Patients who undergo CABG for emergency due to complications from percutaneous
             transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)/ catheterization, unstable angina or ongoing
             myocardial infarction.

          3. Patients who have base alkaline phosphatase levels at &gt; 100 IU/l (70 IU/L as mean
             concentration) levels, or levels &lt; 30 IUnits/L (ammediol, DEA units)

             (values base levels in glycine units at pH9.6 and 25 C are respectively &gt;40 and &lt; 12
             IU/L).

          4. Patients who show pre-operative infections or who are suspected of having endocarditis
             or systemic infection.

          5. Patients who refuse to accept medically-indicated blood products.

          6. Patients who have evidence of significant hepatic disease, including history of
             clinical signs or laboratory values of total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL, ALT or AST&gt; 3X
             upper limit of normal.

          7. Patients who received investigational drugs in the 30 days prior to study drug
             administration, or are currently participating in a study during which the
             administration of investigational drugs within one month is anticipated.

          8. Patients who require pre-operative ventilatory support.

          9. Patients who have renal insufficiency (history of creatinine&gt; 2.0 mg/dL) or chronic
             renal failure requiring dialysis.

         10. Patients who are planned to receive leukocyte-depletion filtration as part of the
             bypass circuitry.

         11. Patients with severe neurological deficits (see Appendix I).

         12. Patients who have a recent history of substance or alcohol abuse.

         13. Patients with a diagnosis of idiopathic thrombocytopenia.

         14. Concomitant surgical procedures (i.e., not included in Appendix VI) anticipated to
             require greater than 2.5 hours time &quot;on-pump&quot; or patients for whom surgery other than
             coronary artery bypass surgery is planned during the 30-day study period.

         15. Patients with a history of cancer who have received chemotherapy or radiation therapy
             within the past 3 months. Patients receiving only adjuvant hormonal therapy are not
             excluded. If the cancer has not resolved completely, the patient should not be
             enrolled without permission of Alloksys.

         16. Patients who are scheduled to receive &quot;stress doses&quot; of glucocorticoids (i.e., doses
             &gt;2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone or equivalent) prior to, during or following the
             operation.

         17. Patients who are vegetarians or vegenists or those patients that may be expected not
             to be tolerant for bovine proteins.

         18. Patients who have a BMI (body mass index) &lt; 18 or &gt; 30

         19. Patients who are, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, unsuitable for
             the study.
