  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      BI 10773 at two different doses compared to placebo during long term treatment (78 weeks) in
      combination with basal insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with insufficient
      glycaemic control.

Symptomatic hypoglycemic events were to be reported as adverse events. Investigator-defined hypoglycaemia adverse events include all events that investigator marked as 'Hypoglycaemic event' in CRFs, regardless of the reported term or blood glucose value. It may include hypoglycemia itself as reported term or any other symptoms that that investigator may have attributed to hypoglycemia (e.g. dizziness, hyperhidrosis, and asthenia).</description>
