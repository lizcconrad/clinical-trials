      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether heparin is an effective treatment in
      pregnant women at risk for thrombosis and other pregnancy-associated complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women with thrombophilia, i.e. carriage of a factor V leiden mutation, a factor II
      prothrombin G20210A mutation or a reduced amount of antithrombin III, protein C or protein S,
      are at elevated risk for thrombosis and related sequelae. Specifically, pregnant women with
      thrombophilia are at risk for pregnancy-associated thrombosis, pregnancy-associated
      thromboembolism as well as early miscarriage (until 20 weeks gestation) late miscarriage
      (after 20 weeks gestation), preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation &lt;10th
      percentile. Uncontrolled retrospective and prospective studies indicate that a therapy with
      unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin in pregnancy significantly reduces
      these pregnancy complications and improves maternal and fetal outcome. The use of low
      molecular weight heparin in pregnancy is safe with complication rates between 1% and 3%,
      mainly thrombocytopenia and bleeding complications. Randomized trials to adequately assess
      the safety and efficacy of heparin in pregnant women with thrombophilia are not available to
      date. Thus, we intend to randomize pregnant women with thrombophilia during weeks of
      gestation 11 to 14 into a therapy with nadroparin calcium (fraxiparin®) 0.3 mL daily during
      pregnancy and six weeks post partum and usual care. The primary end point of this study is a
      composite endpoint of pregnancy-associated thrombosis, pregnancy-associated thromboembolism,
      early miscarriage (until 20 weeks gestation) late miscarriage (after 20 weeks gestation),
      preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation &lt;10th percentile. We hypothesize that a
      prophylactic therapy with nadroparin calcium will significantly reduce pregnancy
      complications in pregnant women with thrombophilia.
