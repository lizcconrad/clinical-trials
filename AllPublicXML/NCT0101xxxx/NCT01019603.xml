    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess systemic exposure of a new foam formulation of
      tazarotene, 0.1% compared with Tazorac Gel, 0.1%. The study design and dosing regimen are
      based on previous clinical studies with Tazorac Gel and Tazorac Cream.

      A single-center, randomized, open-label, phase 1, comparative bioavailability study in
      subjects with moderate to severe acne vulgaris. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled
      and randomized to 1 of the 2 study product groups in a 1:1 ratio (tazarotene foam: Tazorac
      Gel). Study product will be applied once daily for 22 days to the face, upper chest, upper
      back, and shoulders. Following the baseline visit, subjects will return to the study center
      daily for study product application. Blood samples to determine plasma concentrations of
      tazarotenic acid will be collected before study product application on days 1, 8, 12, 15, 18,
      20, and 22, and collected at multiple time points over a 72 hour period on days 22 through
      25.
