  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assessed the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of two different
      formulations of indacaterol, one administered via the Concept1 device and one administered
      via the Simoon device. The study aimed to determine whether the novel formulation (Simoon)
      had a similar profile to that of the established formulation (Concept1).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was double-blind with regards to the Concept1, where placebo for the
      lactose-blended indacaterol was available. However, with regards to the Simoon, neither the
      subject nor the investigator was blinded due to lack of a placebo to the PulmoSphere
      formulation. Hence, the overall designation of the study was partially-blind.

    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of measurements made 23 hours 10 minutes and 23 hours 45 minutes post-dose for each treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) for Each Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made at 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post-dose in Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Time to Peak Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) for Each Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From 5 minutes to 12 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards at 5, 15, and 30 minutes; 1 hour, 1 hour 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours post-dose in Day 1.</description>

    <measure>Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 Second (FEV1) Standardized (With Respect to Length of Time) Area Under the Curve (AUC) From 5 Minutes to 4 Hours Post-dose for Each Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From 5 minutes to 4 hours post-dose for each treatment</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 was measured with spirometry conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Measurements were made at 5, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, and 4 hours post-dose. The standardized AUC FEV1 was calculated as the sum of trapezoids divided by the length of time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Indacaterol Exposure (AUC[0-24 Hours]) for Each Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>All patients fasted for at least 10 hours prior to administration of study medication and continued to fast for at least 4 hours thereafter. Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were collected at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose in each treatment period and were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS assay. Area under the concentration-time curve up to 24 hours (AUC[0-24 hours]) was calculated from concentration-time data using non-compartmental analysis.</description>

    <measure>Indacaterol Exposure (Cmax) for Each Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>0 to 24 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>All patients fasted for at least 10 hours prior to administration of study medication and continued to fast for at least 4 hours thereafter. Venous blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation were collected at 5, 10, 15, and 30 minutes; and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-dose in each treatment period and were analyzed using a LC-MS/MS assay. Maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration after drug administration (Cmax) was calculated from concentration-time data using non-compartmental analysis.</description>

Patients received each treatment only once. There was a washout period of 14-17 days between treatments for patients undergoing pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments; for patients not undergoing PK assessments, the washout period was 7-10 days. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>

There was a washout period of 14-17 days between treatments for patients undergoing pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments; for patients not undergoing PK assessments, the washout period was 7-10 days. Daily inhaled corticosteroid treatment (if applicable) was to remain stable throughout the study. The short-acting β2-agonist salbutamol was available for rescue use throughout the study.</description>
