             compliance.

          -  The parents/legally acceptable representative (LAR) signed the written consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Had previously received Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine prior to this clinical
             study.

          -  Had a plan for vaccination with the vaccine other than those permitted in the protocol
             based on the standard vaccination schedule.

          -  Had been contacted with a patient with confirmed Hib infection within 30 days before
             the study start.

          -  Had had fever of ≥ 37.5°C within the last 3 days (If measured by tympanic thermometer,
             fever of 38°C or higher)

          -  Had or were suspected for immune function disorders; had previously received or were
             suspected to receive the immunosuppressive therapy; or had received the
             immunosuppressive therapy within 30 days prior to participating in the study

             not the exclusion criteria to have received corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone
             equivalent ≤ 0.5 mg/kg/day) not more than for 14 consecutive days at least 30 days

             that the evaluation of study objective might be interrupted.

          -  Had been treated with other investigational drug by participating in another clinical
             trial within 30 days prior to this study entry, or were participating in another
             clinical study at that time.

          -  Had plans to move away from the area of the study site before completing the study.

          -  Inappropriate to take part in this clinical study in the principal investigator or
             sub-investigator's opinion, for the reasons other than above criteria.
