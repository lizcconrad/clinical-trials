      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. determine the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response rate at Day 85 in
           subjects with active rheumatoid arthritis(RA) administered MDX 1100 with methotrexate
           (MTX); and

        2. determine the tolerability and safety of multiple doses of MDX-1100 in combination with
           MTX in subjects with active RA.

      This Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-dose, multicenter study of
      MDX 1100 (anti CXCL10 human monoclonal antibody) in combination with MTX in subjects with
      active RA. All subjects will continue to receive stable doses of MTX (10 to 25 mg weekly)
      during the study. Eligible subjects (n=70) will be randomized to receive either placebo
      (n=35) or MDX-1100 (n=35) at 10 mg/kg intravenously, every other week for a total of 6 doses.
      Concomitant treatment with stable doses of prednisolone (≤ 10 mg/d, or equivalent) and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and analgesic drugs will be permitted during
      the study, however, the dose should not be changed until after the Day 85 assessment has been
      completed unless rescue therapy is required for significant worsening symptoms prior to Day
      85. After Day 85, subjects will be followed until Day 141 only for safety and
      pharmacokinetics, and changes to baseline medications or addition of new medication will be
      permitted at the Investigator's discretion. Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) or
      analgesics should not be administered prior to disease activity assessments on study visit
      days.

      Subjects withdrawn prior to Day 85 will be followed for safety for 70 days following their
      last dose of study drug.
