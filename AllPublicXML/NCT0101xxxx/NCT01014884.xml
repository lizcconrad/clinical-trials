  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are studying the impact of the interventions of a multidisciplinary team
      (MDT) - consisting of a Coventry case manager, social worker, and medical director, alongside
      a Medco specialist pharmacist - on the hospitalization rates of high risk seniors with
      chronic conditions, compared with a usual care approach. The study will also examine the
      impact on quality of life, medication adherence, medical costs, hospital readmission rates,
      and a variety of other important measures. The outcome of COSS may support a means to further
      enhance and develop a comprehensive care model program by leveraging the partnership between
      a health plan and a pharmacy benefit manager.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The multidisciplinary team will provide face-to-face visits in a home setting with
      interventions that focus on five key areas: care transitions, self-management, care
      coordination, pharmacy and prevention, all designed to support high-risk Medicare members and
      their relationship with their primary care providers. If the study proves to reduce
      hospitalizations in the senior population, it could provide important guidance for future
      efforts to reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for seniors with chronic
      conditions.
