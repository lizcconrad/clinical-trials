  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been questioned whether patients with type 2 diabetes who are advised to restrict
      their fruit consumption to two or less pieces of fruits daily have better outcomes (HbA1c,
      body weight, fruit intake and serum lipids) after three months compared to patients with type
      2 diabetes who are advised to eat at least two pieces of fruits.

      To the investigators' knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has evaluated this.

      The investigators therefore perform a randomized controlled trial including 76 patients with
      type 2 diabetes to investigate this.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that:

      Type 2 diabetics who are advised to restrict their fruit consumption have the same Hba1c
      three months after an initially dietary treatment as type 2 diabetics who are advised not to
      restrict their fruit consumption.
