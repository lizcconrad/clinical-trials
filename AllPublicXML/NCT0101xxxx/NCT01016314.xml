      This is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical
      outcome of subjects with degenerative disc disease (DDD) treated with ALIF and supplemental
      posterior fixation using ASPEN Spinous Process System compared to pedicle screw
      instrumentation.

      This is a multi-center, prospective randomized clinical study to evaluate the clinical
      outcome of subjects with DDD who are treated with ALIF and supplemental posterior fixation
      using Aspen compared to pedicle screw instrumentation. The study will involve up to
      approximately 25 investigational sites and enroll up to 156 67 subjects. The randomization
      ratio of two Aspen subjects to one pedicle screw subject (2:1) will be utilized.

      Subjects with lumbar DDD who are candidates for ALIF at a single level will be screened for
      inclusion in the study. If the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria, they will be
      enrolled and randomized to either the Aspen or pedicle screw group. Subjects will continue to
      be followed by the guidelines set forth in this clinical protocol, which include: a
      postoperative discharge exam; six week, three month, six month, and one year post-op visits;
      and, concludes with a two year post-op visit. The follow-up is counted from the day of
      surgery. The enrollment period is expected to be approximately 12 months and subjects will be
      followed for 2 years post-op for the duration of the clinical investigation. The anticipated
      duration of the study is approximated to be 3 years.
