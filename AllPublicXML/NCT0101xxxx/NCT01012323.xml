  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of NewGam in preventing serious
      bacterial infections and to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of NewGam. The safety of
      NewGam and its effect on quality of life were also evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NewGam is a new 10% human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG) solution developed by Octapharma for
      intravenous administration. It is supplied as a liquid formulation ready to use. The primary
      therapeutic use of immunoglobulins is to provide antibodies to prevent viral and bacterial
      diseases (replacement therapy). IVIG has proved to be useful in a variety of clinical
      conditions other than for replacement of immunoglobulins; IVIG exhibits an immunomodulatory
      effect. Children and adults with a Primary Immunodeficiency Disease (PID) have an increased
      risk of recurrent bacterial and viral infections that typically attack the respiratory tract
      (sinusitis, bronchitis, pneumonia) but can also affect the gastrointestinal tract
      (gastroenteritis). Theses diseases can be severe and can lead to substantial morbidity.
      Responses to antibacterial therapy are often poor. At present, most primary immune
      deficiencies are not curable, but IVIGs have been shown to decrease the total number of
      severe infections and the duration of hospitalization.

        <description>The Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaire Child Health Questionnaire-Parent Form (CHQ-PF50) was completed by a parent or guardian in study participants &lt; 14 years of age. The CHQ-PF50 consists of 50 items organized into 15 subscales.The 15 subscales could be combined into 2 summary scores, physical and psychosocial. The calculated summary scores were transformed to a range of 0-100, where a higher score indicates more positive functioning or better health status. A positive change score indicates improvement.</description>
