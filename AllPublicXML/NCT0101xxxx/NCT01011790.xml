  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess a novel meditation program which is biofeedback
      reinforced (Healing Rhythms™) as a means to improving stress management in a population of
      nurses practicing in the hospital setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stress is a common problem with significant ramifications for health. This is especially true
      in the workplace and particularly true for nurses practicing in a hospital environment. A
      number of factors (e.g. an aging population, the obesity epidemic, patients presenting with
      multi-system diseases, etc.) have dramatically increased the demands on hospital nurses in
      the past decade. This increased stress has potential ramifications at a personal level (e.g.
      increased risk of ill health) as well as an institutional (e.g. higher staff turnover).
      Meditation has been shown to be an effective tool for stress management. A self-directed,
      computer-guided meditation training program that can be pursued independently may be
      particularly useful for hospital nurses where scheduling challenges may preclude the use of
      scheduled classes. Healing Rhythms™ is a computer program that teaches meditation and uses
      biofeedback (heart rate variability and galvanic skin response) to reinforce the training.

    <description>The Healing Rhythms™ meditation program was chosen as the intervention for this study because it has a long history of use in the consumer market, it provides a dual-mode biofeedback which allows users to visually see their progress, and it provides an attractive and engaging user interface which is enjoyable to use. This is a critical factor as the research cited documents the importance of adherence in achieving optimal outcomes.</description>
