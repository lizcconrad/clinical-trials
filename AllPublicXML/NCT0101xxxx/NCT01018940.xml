  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if prasugrel is superior to clopidogrel in providing adequate antiplatelet
      effect in a high risk population that requires concomitant use of a Proton Pump Inhibitor
      (PPI).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate if simultaneous treatment with the PPI omeprazole and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist
      will influence the effect of either clopidogrel and/or prasugrel on platelet reactivity in
      patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) or Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults between 18 and 75 years of age

          -  Known or documented history of CAD or PAD prior to enrollment (a diagnosis of CAD may
             be based upon a positive stress test, prior documented acute coronary event, or
             angiographic demonstration of CAD; a diagnosis of PAD may be based upon an
             ankle-brachial index less than 0.9, or angiographic demonstration of PAD)

          -  Have not had thienopyridine therapy for at least 15 days before the study

          -  Have not had treatment with a PPI for at least 15 days before the study

          -  Are taking aspirin (75 to 325 mg/day) for at least one week prior to randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have New York Heart association (NYHA) Class III and IV congestive heart failure

          -  Have any form of coronary revascularization (PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting
             [CABG]) planned to occur during the study

          -  Have undergone PCI or CABG within 30 days of entry to the study

          -  Have received a drug eluting endovascular stents in the past year

          -  Have any of the following:

               1. Prior history of hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)

               2. Intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation, or aneurysm

               3. A body weight less than 60 kg

          -  Have prior history of GI ulcer disease or bleeding

          -  Have symptoms of dyspepsia or gastroesophageal reflux disease

          -  Have active internal bleeding or history of bleeding diathesis

          -  Have clinical findings, in the judgment of the investigator, associated with an
             increased risk of bleeding

          -  Have an International Normalized Ratio (INR) known to be &gt;1.5 at the time of
             evaluation

          -  Have a platelet count of &lt;100,000/mm3 at the time of screening, if known

          -  Have anemia (hemoglobin [Hgb] &lt;10 gm/dL) at the time of screening, if known

          -  Are receiving or will receive oral anticoagulation or other antiplatelet therapy
             (other than aspirin) that cannot be safely discontinued for the duration of the study

          -  Are receiving daily treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that
             cannot be discontinued or require daily treatment with NSAIDs during the study.

          -  Are receiving corticosteroid therapy
