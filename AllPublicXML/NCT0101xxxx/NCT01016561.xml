      Rationale: Computer systems that allow doctors to create a 3 dimensional (3-D) picture of the
      tumor may help in planning radiation therapy and may result in more tumor cells being killed.
      Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor
      may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs, such as cisplatin,
      may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying magnetic resonance imaging-based radiation therapy
      and cisplatin in treating patients with stage I, stage II, stage III, or stage IV cervical
      cancer.Detailed DescriptionPRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using MRI based treatment planning for intracavitary
      brachytherapy treatment planning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of early toxicities, specifically genitourinary and
      gastrointestinal.

      II. To evaluate the incidence of late toxicities, specifically genitourinary and
      gastrointestinal.

      III. To evaluate local, regional, and distant recurrence rates. IV. To evaluate disease-free
      and overall survival rates. OUTLINE: Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy
      (3-dimensional conformal OR intensity-modulated) and 4-6 insertions of MRI-guided
      intracavitary brachytherapy over 8 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV over 30-60
      minutes for 5-6 weeks during radiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 4 months for 2
      years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
