  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Gastric bypass is the most commonly performed type of bariatric (obesity)
      surgery, has dramatically increased in popularity and is now considered to be preferred
      treatments in severely obese patients that fail non-surgical therapy - particularly in
      patients with type 2 diabetes. Drug malabsorption is a potential concern post-gastric bypass
      because intestinal length is reduced.

      Purpose: The purpose of this controlled, pharmacokinetic study is to determine whether the
      absorption of a single dose of metformin, the first line drug treatment in patients with type
      2 diabetes, is significantly reduced after gastric bypass.

      Methods: A single dose of standard release metformin 1000 mg will be administered to patients
      who have undergone gastric bypass and to patients who have not received surgery but are on
      the wait list (wait-listed controls). Blood sampling and urine sampling will occur in
      standardized fashion over the ensuing 24 hours to measure and compare the absorption of
      metformin between study arms. 34 patients total will be recruited.

      Significance: Following completion of this study, we will better understand how gastric
      bypass affects metformin absorption. Ultimately, this information will help to ensure that
      this patient population is receiving optimal doses of this important drug treatment.
