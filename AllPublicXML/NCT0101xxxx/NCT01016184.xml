  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D has multiple systemic effects: bone and calcium metabolism, muscle function,
      insulin responsiveness, body-composition regulation, cell differentiation, and the immune
      system. Proper status of vitamin D is found to be related to risk reduction in hypertension,
      cardiac and vascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and others. Furthermore, vitamin D
      supplementation resulted in improved endothelial function. Limited sun exposure may lead to
      vitamin D deficiency, and it may be assumed that modern life styles lead to a lack of sun
      exposure. Long work-days may be the primary risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. The purpose
      of this research is to study the effect of vitamin D treatment on multi systemic functions in
      young healthy men with vitamin D deficiency due to working conditions.

      The study has 2 stages: first stage would be survey of 400 employees, who will fill out a
      questionnaire to identify occupational and demographic risk factors, a nutritional
      questionnaire, and data from periodic checkups will be collected. Participants will sign a
      consent form for vitamin D level determinations, and for freezing blood samples. From this
      survey, the participants that have vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D levels &lt; 20 ng/ml) will
      continue to the second stage of the study - administration of vitamin D or placebo.
      Participants in the interventional study will sign an additional consent form. Length of
      follow-up: one year. All parameters will be tested at 0, 6, and 12 months.
