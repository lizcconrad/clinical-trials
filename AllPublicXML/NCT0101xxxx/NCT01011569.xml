  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are largely 2 surgical methods for one-level cervical disc disease; cage only and
      plate/graft. Even there are many reports about the efficacy of either cage only or
      plate/graft, prospective comparative study is few. The object of the present study is to
      present design of prospective study and to demonstrate preliminary result.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective study was started from April 2004 after permission by our Institutional Review
      Board. Inclusion criteria were single cervical disc disease with radiculopathy/myelopathy. We
      excluded patients with severe spondylosis, multiple disc disease, overt instability,
      osteoporosis or previous cervical operation history. Operation method was randomized using
      the table of random sampling numbers. All operations were performed with standard
      anterior-medial approach. Two types of cages and 2 types of plates were used: cage, MC+ cage
      (LDR, Austin, Tx, USA) or Solis cage (Stryker, Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA); plate, Black stone
      (Orthofix, McKinney, Tx, USA) or Atlantis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA). We checked neck
      disability index (NDI), neck visual analogue scale (VAS) and limb VAS before operation and
      1/3/6/12/24/36 months after operation. Disc height ratio, cervical lordosis, bone fusion
      status and segmental lordosis at the index level were measured from X-rays and follow-up
      X-rays were obtained at before operation and 1/3/6/12/24/36 months after operation. The
      present prospective study was planned until 80 patients (cage n = 40, plate/graft n = 40)
      were enrolled.
