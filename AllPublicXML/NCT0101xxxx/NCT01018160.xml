      The purpose of this study is to examine the treatment profile of approximately 1,000 adult
      patients with gastroesophageal reflux who begin raberpazole sodium treatment for 4 months,
      and assess patients' adherence to the study drug.

      This study is a multicenter, open-labeled, prospective, phase IV, observational study for
      patients visiting the gastroenterology department. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the treatment profile of approximately 1,000 adult patients with gastroesophageal reflux
      (GERD) who begin raberpazole sodium treatment for 4 months and assess patients' adherence to
      the study drug. The primary objective is to examine the treatment profile of gastroesophageal
      reflux in the secondary or tertiary clinical center. The secondary objective is to examine
      GERD patients' adherence to the study drug (rabeprazole sodium) during the treatment period.
      Of the patients who visit the study centers and complain about gastroesophageal reflux
      symptoms during the study period, those who are deemed to need rabeprazole sodium
      administration at the investigator's discretion will be considered for this study. The main
      outcome measures are the patterns of gastroesophageal reflux management (eg. treatment
      duration of initial therapy etc) and the compliance of proton pump inhibitor treatment.The
      compliance data (number of tablets taken) will be calculated at the clinical visit by
      counting the number of dispensed tablets that are remaining. Also, investigators will observe
      the gastroesophageal reflux symptom free rate at the end of initial therapy, gastrointestinal
      (GI) symptom relief and safety information at each visit. Study period is up to 4 months.
      During the study, no standardized treatment is stipulated, and patients may receive any
      treatment considered by their physicians. Rabeprazole sodium 10 mg - 20 mg tablet once daily
      for 4months.
