  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many elderly patients have multiple medications and variable dosing regimens and the ability
      for hospitals to properly reconcile medications between what is given on paper to the patient
      and what the patients take at home depends on the patient's ability to get the medications.
      Some patients may delay in getting their medications from the pharmacy after being
      discharged. For some it may be a lack of transportation, others may feel too ill to travel
      and may not have family members who will be able to pick up the medications.

      It is for these reasons the authors of this study want to inventory the medications that an
      elderly patient is being discharged on during a home visit and check on the actual
      prescriptions that a patient has at their house the following 1-2 days after discharge.

      The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of discharge instruction in the elderly by
      assessing medication compliance post-discharge. Patients are identified on the units and from
      a Beaumont Troy discharge planning master list. Prior to discharge the patients are consented
      and informed they will be contacted to schedule a home visit. During the home visit, the
      medications the patient is currently taking are recorded. Discharge medications are recorded
      from the medical record following the home visit. The Investigator performing the visit is
      blinded to the discharge medications as the intent of the visit is only to collect data and
      not to ensure compliance or make clinical judgment regarding the appropriateness of the
      medication regimen. Anyone 65 or older can be included, who are discharged with medications
      and can consent. Those excluded are patients who do not live in close proximity and those
      discharged to extended or long-term care facilities.
