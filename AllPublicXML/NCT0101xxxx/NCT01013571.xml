  <brief_title>Self Titration With Apidra to Reach Target Study (START)</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Canadian, Phase IV, Multicenter, Comparative, Open-label Study Evaluating 2 Approaches of Blood Glucose Monitoring and Insulin Titration (Patient-managed vs Health Care Professional) in T2DM Patients While Receiving the Addition of 1 Injection of Insulin Glulisine at Breakfast Following Optimization of Insulin Glargine</official_title>

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of a patient-managed
      titration algorithm (including blood glucose monitoring) for the addition of a single dose of
      insulin glulisine at breakfast in Canadian patients with inadequately controlled T2DM after
      optimization of basal insulin, compared with an HCP-managed titration algorithm. The primary
      endpoint for assessment of this objective is the percent of patients reaching a target HbA1c
      &lt;=7.0% without severe hypoglycemia at the end of the study.

      Secondary Objective:

      Secondary objectives of the study are to compare the effect of the two different insulin
      glulisine titration algorithms (patient-managed versus HCP-managed) on the following:

        -  change in HbA1c, FG, and 7-point glucose profile at Week 24 and Week 36

        -  satisfaction with treatment (DTSQc for patient and questionnaire for HCP) at Week 36

        -  change in weight at Week 24 and Week 36

        -  incidence of hypoglycemia

        -  insulin doses

        -  resource utilization (rural/urban, blood glucose meter test strips, lancets, HCP visits,
           telephone calls, and hospitalizations)

        -  adherence with the patient-managed monitoring algorithm

        Inclusion criteria:

        Run-in phase:

          -  T2DM

          -  Treated for at least 3 months with a basal insulin (insulin glargine, NPH, detemir)
             +/- oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) with an HbA1c &gt;7.0% or insulin naive (2-3 OADs)
             with an HbA1c &gt;=7.8% (historic HbA1c result up to 3 months of screening is acceptable)

        Randomized treatment phase:

          -  Completed run-in phase

          -  HbA1c &gt;7.0% and &gt;= 1 episode of confirmed nocturnal hypoglycemia (BG &lt;4.0 mmol/L) or
             &gt;= 2 measurements of FG &lt;=6.0 mmol/L within the previous week Patients who completed
             the run-in phase with HbA1c &gt;7.0% and did not meet the randomization criteria will
             continue titrating insulin glargine and be followed until the end of study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No food intake before lunch (noon)

          -  Unstable diet intake or significant changes to current diet regimen

          -  Active cancer or any other disease or condition which in the opinion of the
             investigator would make the subject unsuitable for participation in the study

          -  Any clinical significant laboratory findings that in the judgment of the investigator
             would preclude safe completion of the study

          -  Known allergies to study drugs
