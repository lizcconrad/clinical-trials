  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, of treating patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma using Gamma-Knife Radiosurgery (GKS) to target a tumor volume defined by a
      combination of gadolinium enhancement and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). This is a
      single center, Phase II trial. A total of 40 glioblastoma patients will be enrolled into the
      primary arm of the trial. In addition, a minimum of 10 patients with recurrent anaplastic
      (grade III) gliomas and a minimum of 10 patients with recurrent low-grade (grade II) gliomas
      will be enrolled into exploratory arms.

      The investigators hypothesize that the use of a combination of gadolinium enhancement and
      elevated Cho:NAA ratio via MRS to determine the treatment target volume for Gamma Knife may
      be an effective way to treat focally-recurrent glioblastoma.

      Study Design: A single-center, single-arm, one-stage phase II clinical trial for patients
      with recurrent grade IV glioma (glioblastoma), with two additional exploratory arms for
      patients with recurrent grade II and grade III gliomas.

      Patient Numbers: A total of 40 patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be enrolled. In
      addition, a minimum of 10 patients with recurrent grade III (anaplastic) glioma and a minimum
      of 10 patients with recurrent grade II (low-grade) glioma will be enrolled independently into
      separate exploratory arms.

      Summary of Patient Eligibility Criteria Histological confirmation of glioma, grades II - IV;
      prior first-line treatment with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for malignant (grades
      III and IV) gliomas; age &gt; 18 years; life expectancy &gt;8 weeks; Karnofsky Performance Status ≥
      60; adequate organ function; signed patient informed consent; willingness to forego
      additional therapy until evidence of disease progression.

      End Points

      Primary: Six-month progression-free survival (PFS-6)

      Secondary: Median overall survival (mOS), median progression-free survival (mPFS), location
      of recurrence, symptomatic necrosis rate, reoperation rate, reoperation findings (estimated

    <description>Patient treatments will be planned with the Gamma Plan software. The dose will be prescribed to the isodose surface which encompasses the target volume within a range of 50-60% based on a local maximum of 100%. Radiosurgery dose will be prescribed based on volume within the prescribed isodose surface (not to exceed 18 cc)</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed glioblastoma, gliosarcoma, anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic
             oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma, malignant glioma not otherwise
             specified, low-grade astrocytoma, low-grade oligodendroglioma, low-grade
             oligoastrocytoma, or low-grade glioma not otherwise specified.

          2. Prior first-line treatment with surgery or biopsy followed by fractionated
             radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide-containing chemotherapy is required for
             malignant (grade III or IV) glioma patients. Additional prior chemotherapy is allowed,
             without limitation on number of recurrences. In patients with low-grade tumors,
             neither prior radiotherapy nor prior chemotherapy is required.

          3. An interval of &gt; 2 months since completion of fractionated radiotherapy.

          4. Age &gt; 18 years

          5. Life expectancy of at least 8 weeks.

          6. Karnofsky Performance Status score (KPS) of ≥ 60

          7. Documented recurrent disease: Recurrent disease is defined either as histological
             confirmation of tumor, as an increase in tumor size of at least 25% based upon serial
             MR images, or as development of a new site of disease.

               -  Tumor size will be calculated using the sum of the largest cross-sectional
                  perpendicular diameters of contrast-enhancing tumor for high-grade tumors, the
                  sum of the largest cross-sectional perpendicular diameters of FLAIR abnormality
                  for low-grade tumors, or as worsened spectroscopic characteristics for any tumor
                  type (development of ≥ 2 new voxels with CNI ≥ 3, or ≥ 25% increase in the sum of
                  the CNI ratios within a group of previously abnormal voxels [where abnormal is
                  defined as CNI ≥ 3]).

               -  Disease must be evaluable, but does not need to be measurable.

               -  The target site for GKS does not need to be located in a previously-irradiated
                  area.

          8. Eligibility for gamma-knife radiosurgery: The decision to treat with gamma-knife
             radiosurgery will be made by a consensus of the radiation oncology, neurosurgery and
             neuro-oncology co-chairs or their alternates at the weekly Brain Tumor or Gamma-Knife
             Tumor Conferences. The MRS defined target volume must be ≤ 15 cc. and not involving
             eloquent brain (speech/language cortex, motor/sensory cortex, basal ganglia,
             brainstem, or corpus callosum 2) on an MRI done within 14 days of the planned GKS
             procedure.

          9. BUN &lt; 25 and Cr &lt; 1.7

         10. Negative pregnancy test at the time of GKS in any patient who could be pregnant.

         11. Willingness to forego additional therapy until evidence of disease progression.

         12. Signed and witnessed informed consent and signed authorization for the release of
             their protected health information.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. MRS defined tumor volume greater than 15 cc.

          2. MRS defined tumor volume involving eloquent brain (speech/language cortex,
             motor/sensory cortex, basal ganglia, brainstem, or corpus callosum).

          3. Concurrent treatment with chemotherapy.

          4. Active infectious process requiring IV antibiotics.

          5. History of any other cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in-situ of
             the cervix), unless in complete remission and off of all therapy for that disease for
             a minimum of three years.

          6. Other major medical illness judged by the investigator to preclude prolonged
             follow-up.

          7. Any condition that compromises compliance with the objectives and procedures of this
             protocol, as judged by the principal investigator.
