  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 7000 patients are diagnosed with pancreas cancer every year in the UK. Only 10% have it
      caught early enough to have surgery to cure it. The rest at best can undergo chemotherapy to
      extend survival, but current treatments offer at best an improvement of only a few months
      compared to no treatment at all. In addition only about a quarter of patients will respond to
      the treatment. In addition these patients often experience profound weight loss, loss of
      appetite and energy primarily because of the cancer process itself. Our hypothesis is that
      the addition of fish oil infusion to gemcitabine chemotherapy will result in an improved rate
      of tumour response on CT imaging.

      Fish oils, or specifically the omega-3 fatty acid component, appear to have a range of
      powerful anti-cancer actions. This is supported by evidence from a wide range of sources,
      from laboratory experiments to basic human studies. Although this evidence specifically
      includes many pancreatic cancer studies in the laboratory it has not yet been confirmed in
      human trials.

      Contrary to conventional chemotherapy, fish oil is a naturally occuring non-toxic compound
      and so is not associated with the side-effects of chemotherapy. In fact a number of clinical
      studies have demonstrated significant improvements in quality of life for pancreas cancer
      patients treated with fish oil, particularly with reference to improvements in appetite and
      energy levels. This is of course in addition to the anti-cancer actions.

      Our trial will involve recruiting patients who have unresectable pancreatic cancer and who
      are suitable for the current standard of care which is gemcitabine chemotherapy. They will be
      assessed for suitability and then offered entry into the trial. This essentially consists of
      a 4 hour long infusion of purified omega-3 fish oil immediately after their gemcitabine
      chemotherapy has finished. This will occur once a week for three weeks, with a rest on the
      fourth week. The cycle then continues until the cancer has shown progression on a CT scan,
      the gemcitabine chemotherapy is stopped due to toxicity or the patient withdraws or dies. CT
      scans to assess this are performed every 2 months. Blood tests will be taken before and after
      each treatment and analysed for changes in inflammatory markers. The patients will be asked
      to fill in a quality of life and pain questionnaire each week during the 4 hour infusion.
