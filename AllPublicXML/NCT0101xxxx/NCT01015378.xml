      Aim: This is a longitudinal cohort study to assess long-term clinical outcome of patients who
      were admitted in our institution for a first episode of uncomplicated sigmoid diverticulitis.

      Methods: All patients who were diagnosed with a first episode of sigmoid diverticulitis will
      be evaluated for inclusion in the study, pending informed consent. Those patients who have
      evidence of complicated diverticulitis (fistula, abscess) will receive a recommendation to
      undergo elective sigmoid resection, while those who have a simple attack will be recruited in
      the cohort. Follow-up will be performed at yearly intervals through telephone interview with
      the patient. The duration of study is expected to last 10 years (2010-2020), with &gt;50 new
      patients/year, for a total of &gt;500 patients.

      Endpoints:

        1. the occurrence of a second episode of diverticulitis

        2. severity and outcome of recurrent diverticulitis

        3. evolution in digestive symptoms and quality of life (QoL)

        4. need for subsequent elective or emergency sigmoid resection

      Rationale: This study will help in determining the risk/benefit of the current approach for
      this common condition, which is to manage patients conservatively with antibiotics and adopt
      a wait-and-see attitude. Specifically, the following events will be assessed quantitatively:

        -  the rate of relapse in an urban community.

        -  the burden of this common disease on QoL and digestive function

        -  the percentage of patients who may need emergency surgery

      Colonic diverticulosis is an increasingly common condition in the Western societies; in our
      country, a third of the population is affected by the 6th decade and two-thirds by the 9th
      decade. Fortunately, a majority of patients with diverticulosis remain asymptomatic;
      diverticulitis, the most common presentation of diverticular disease, has an estimated
      incidence of 10 patients per 100,000/year.

      The diagnosis of sigmoid diverticulitis is usually suspected clinically in a patient
      presenting with acute lower abdominal pain, associated with an inflammatory syndrome with
      elevated CRP and/or leukocytes count. The preferred imaging modality to establish definitive
      diagnosis is computerized tomography (CT) scan with triple (oral, intravenous and
      intra-rectal) administration of contrast. CT scan may also influence management by
      demonstrating whether sigmoid diverticulitis is simple (phlegmonous, showing an infiltration
      of pericolic fat and a thickening of intestinal wall) or complicated (abscess, fistula or
      peritonitis).

      A majority of patients present with simple diverticulitis, and will be conservatively and
      successfully managed with antibiotics alone. Full colonoscopy is performed eventually, in
      order to rule out an associated condition, most notably cancer and Crohn's disease. Colonic
      diverticular disease is usually restricted to the sigmoid colon, and conservative treatment
      with antibiotics is indicated in cases of a first attack of uncomplicated diverticulitis, the
      rationale being that a majority of patients treated for a first episode of acute inflammation
      will eventually recover and have no further problems.

      Elective sigmoidectomy is currently recommended in the following clinical situations:

        -  Patients who had two episodes of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

        -  Patients who had one episode of complicated (perforated) diverticulitis, with either
           pericolic of pelvic abscesses (Hinchey stage I and II respectively), fistula formation
           and/or stenosis.

      These guidelines, however, reflect expert consensus rather than scientific evidence;
      currently, there is no way to predict for each patient the risk for developing subsequent
      complications and recurrences. Thus, the important question is to determine whether a
      conservative approach is not simply delaying definitive treatment and expose patients to
      additional complications and alterations in quality of life.

      3. OBJECTIVES

      The main objective of this study is to assess the natural history of sigmoid diverticulitis
      in a cohort of patients living in an urban community, who had radiological and endoscopic
      evidence of diverticular disease, who benefited initially from adequate antibiotherapy,
      received dietary counselling, and were followed for a long period of time. In order to do
      that, we will assess prospectively the following variables:

      3.1. Primary endpoints

        -  Annual rate of recurrent diverticulitis

        -  Severity and timing of recurrent episodes

        -  Quality of Life and gastrointestinal symptoms assessed with the GIQLI questionnaire

      3.2. Secondary endpoints

        -  Risk for undergoing emergency surgery

        -  Surgical morbidity/mortality

        This cohort study is designed in order to detect recurrent episodes of diverticulitis in a
        population of patients who were previously admitted in our institution for a first episode.

        4.1. Study population

        The cohort will consist in the population of patients with CT-scan demonstrated,
        endoscopy-proven sigmoid diverticulitis who will be admitted in the Department of Surgery
        of the University Hospital Geneva from January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2019. At
        baseline, participants are between the ages of 18 and 90, and medical information will be
        updated every year until the end of follow-up, which is December 31st, 2020.
