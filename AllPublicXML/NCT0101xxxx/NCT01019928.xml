    <measure>Time to Visual Analogue Scale 7 (VAS7) During Thermal Stimulation at 1.5 Hours Post-Dose.</measure>
    <time_frame>1.5 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>A probe (bag) was inserted 7cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Heat stimuli were applied by recirculation of heated water in the bag. Prior to recirculation the bag is filled with 7mL to ensure adequate mucosal contact. Water was heated up to a maximum of 63° C and the stimulation was continued until VAS 7 was reached.
The intensities of the non-painful sensations were scored with the following descriptors added to facilitate the scoring:
= vague perception of mild sensation
= definite perception of mild sensation
= vague perception of moderate sensation
= definite perception of moderate sensation
For painful sensations the patients will use the scale from 5-10 anchored at:
= pain detection
= slight pain
= moderate pain
= medium pain intensity
= intense pain
= unbearable pain</description>

        <title>Time to Visual Analogue Scale 7 (VAS7) During Thermal Stimulation at 1.5 Hours Post-Dose.</title>
        <description>A probe (bag) was inserted 7cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Heat stimuli were applied by recirculation of heated water in the bag. Prior to recirculation the bag is filled with 7mL to ensure adequate mucosal contact. Water was heated up to a maximum of 63° C and the stimulation was continued until VAS 7 was reached.
The intensities of the non-painful sensations were scored with the following descriptors added to facilitate the scoring:
= vague perception of mild sensation
= definite perception of mild sensation
= vague perception of moderate sensation
= definite perception of moderate sensation
For painful sensations the patients will use the scale from 5-10 anchored at:
= pain detection
= slight pain
= moderate pain
= medium pain intensity
= intense pain
= unbearable pain</description>

          <title>Volume at Visual Analogue Scale 7 (VAS7) During Mechanical Stimulation at 2.5 Hours Post-Dose.</title>
          <description>A probe (bag) was inserted 7cm above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Volume change in the bag was recorded continuously at each level of the visual analogue scale (VAS) and up to VAS7 (Volume at Visual Analogue Scale 7).
The intensities of the non-painful sensations were scored with the following descriptors added to facilitate the scoring:
= vague perception of mild sensation
= definite perception of mild sensation
= vague perception of moderate sensation
= definite perception of moderate sensation
For painful sensations the patients will use the scale from 5-10 anchored at:
= pain detection
= slight pain
= moderate pain
= medium pain intensity
= intense pain
= unbearable pain</description>
