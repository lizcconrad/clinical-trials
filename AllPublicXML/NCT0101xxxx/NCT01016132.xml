    <description>Overall preference when comparing study lenses to &quot;habitual&quot; lenses, as interpreted by the participant and reported on a questionnaire as a single, retrospective evaluation of four weeks' wear time. Overall preference was measured on a 5-point Likert scale as follows: Strongly Prefer Study Lenses; Somewhat Prefer Study Lenses; No Preference; Somewhat Prefer &quot;Habitual&quot; Lenses; Strongly Prefer &quot;Habitual&quot; Lenses.</description>
