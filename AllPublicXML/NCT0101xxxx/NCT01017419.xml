      Aim: To verify how much of the orientation provided at diagnosis and hearing aid fitting are
      retained by new hearing aid users and analyze whether age, degree of hearing loss, academic
      and socio-economics status have an influence on this

      Introduction: The understanding and retention of orientations provided by the health
      professional increases patient's satisfaction and compliance to treatment and reduces
      treatment duration and costs. Aim: To verify how much of the orientation provided at
      diagnosis and hearing aid fitting are retained by new hearing aid users and analyze whether
      age, degree of hearing loss, academic and socio-economics status have an influence on this.
      Methods: Participated in this study 30 adults (18 female and 12 male) with age varying from
      18 to 88 years, with post lingual uni or bilateral hearing loss of various degrees and types.
      Orientations were offered at the time of diagnosis and hearing aid fitting. At the first
      follow up visit patients were interviewed regarding their hearing loss' characteristics as
      well as hearing aid care and use (probed recall task). It was also evaluated how participants
      manipulated their devices. A protocol was used to score participant's responses. Results: on
      average participants could retain 31,6% and 83,6% of the orientation provided regarding their
      hearing loss and hearing aid care and use. There was a negative correlation between age and
      amount of information retained. There was no influence of degree of hearing loss, academic
      and socio-economic statues. Conclusion: The hearing impaired patients have difficulty to
      recall orientation provided therefore the use of facilitation strategies to information
      retained is necessary.
