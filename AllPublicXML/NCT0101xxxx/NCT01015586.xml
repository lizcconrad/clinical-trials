      The study will determine if individuals with co-occurring bipolar disorder and alcohol
      dependence report reduced alcohol consumption, improvement in mood symptoms, and cognitive
      performance if treated with lamotrigine plus their usual mood stabilizing medications
      relative to subjects treated with placebo plus usual mood stabilizing medications over a 16
      week period.
