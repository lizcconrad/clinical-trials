      The purpose of this study is to improve the ability to diagnose problems after mild traumatic
      brain injury (MTBI) and to test a drug that may improve the outcome from these injuries. Of
      the more than 1.5 million people who experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year in
      the United States, as many as 75% sustain a mild TBI which can cause long-term or permanent
      impairments/disabilities in a significant proportion of patients. In addition, traumatic
      brain injury has become a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. For people
      with these injuries, it is difficult to determine whether symptoms are due to the head injury
      or another condition, such as Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. In this project, there are 3
      observational studies that involve testing of mental functions and behavior, imaging of the
      brain with special x-ray procedures, and blood samples to look at glandular function, which
      may be affected by head injury. A fourth study is a test of a drug, atorvastatin, which may
      provide protection for injured brain cells and improve outcome. By collecting and analyzing
      the information from these tests, it will be possible to make the process of diagnosing mild
      TBI or post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) more precise, and also to see if atorvastatin is
      a helpful drug for patients with MTBI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the more than 1.5 million people who experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year
      in the United States, as many as 75% sustain a mild TBI (MTBI) which can cause long-term or
      permanent impairments/disabilities in a significant proportion of patients. In addition,
      traumatic brain injury has become a signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

      One of the most difficult diagnostic problems is separating the effects of MTBI and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), because signs and symptoms of these conditions often
      overlap. Early and accurate diagnosis of MTBI and its differentiation from both acute stress
      disorder (ASD) and PTSD are a major priority for military medicine due to overlap in symptoms
      (e.g., attention problems) and the frequent lack of external signs or even self-awareness of
      MTBI, especially in association with blast injury.

      The major goals of this project are to improve the ability to diagnose mild traumatic brain
      injury (MTBI) and to test a drug, atorvastatin, which may improve outcome after MTBI. To
      accomplish these goals, 200 MTBI subjects and 100 orthopedic injury (OI) subjects, for
      comparison purposes, will be recruited for variety of clinical evaluations and a phase II
      drug trial. Only the MTBI subjects will participate in the phase II drug trial, and these
      subjects may choose to participate only in the observational studies, declining the drug
      trial.

      Potential subjects will be identified in the Emergency Departments (EDs) of two level I
      trauma centers, located within a few blocks of each other in Houston, Texas. Once discharged
      from the ED, subjects will be enrolled and baseline procedures will be performed, including
      behavioral/cognitive testing, sample collection, and medication teaching, including the first
      dose of study drug. Subjects will be followed by phone at Day 3-4 during the 7-day dosing
      period of the drug trial, then with return visits for all subjects at one week, one month,
      three months, and six months after injury.

      Investigation of acute civilian MTBI could potentially elucidate the diagnostic issues of
      distinguishing between MTBI, post-concussion syndrome (PCS), acute stress disorder (ASD), and
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) because, in the civilian setting, mild traumatic brain
      injuries can be characterized prospectively using advanced brain imaging, EEG, and
      neuropsychological assessment.

      We hypothesize that in comparison with OI subjects, the MTBI group will exhibit slowing of
      EEG frequency, alteration of cerebral white matter microstructure on diffusion tensor imaging
      (DTI), and cognitive deficit within 24 hours after injury. We also hypothesize that MTBI
      subjects will show recovery in their EEG frequency and cognition over six months following
      injury despite residual white matter injury on DTI. We will also collect two plasma samples
      and a saliva sample, the first within 24 hr of injury (baseline) and the second at six months
      post-injury, for measurement of potential biomarkers and genetic studies.

      Magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be used to detect and characterize focal abnormalities in
      neurophysiological function in subjects with MTBI diagnosed with PTSD for the purpose of
      distinguishing between the two. MEG is a completely non-invasive imaging modality which is
      able to provide information regarding focal abnormalities in the brain. MEG has been shown to
      be sensitive to cognitive complaints in patients with MTBI and to be more sensitive to these
      deficits than EEG. In addition, neurophysiological abnormalities found through testing can
      differentiate patients with MTBI and PTSD in some studies. Thus, we propose to explore the
      relationship between DTI and MEG findings which may lead to identification of more distinct,
      replicable patterns of brain abnormalities in subjects with PTSD and MTBI that may lead to
      better differentiation between these groups of patients and improve diagnostic precision, as
      well as from patients with a combination of both disorders.

      A separate analysis is designed to examine the incidence and effects of hypopituitarism after
      MTBI. The incidence of hypopituitarism after MTBI is not known. However, in patients who have
      persistent symptoms at one year post-injury, 35% have been found to have deficiency one or
      more pituitary hormones. The clinical characteristics, MRI imaging results, EEG and MEG
      results of the patients who have pituitary deficiency will be compared to those of patients
      with normal pituitary function. The relationship between pituitary dysfunction and functional
      outcome, cognitive recovery, and resolution of PCS will be examined as well.

      The final component of this protocol is a Phase II randomized clinical trial of the 200 MTBI
      subjects to evaluate atorvastatin (LipitorÂ®) as a neuroprotective agent for the treatment of
      MTBI. The primary endpoint for this trial is three months. This trial will examine the
      effects of atorvastatin, given orally in a dose of 1mg/kg (up to 80 mg) for seven days, on
      the development of post-concussive symptoms (PCS), PTSD symptoms, cognitive recovery, and
      functional outcome at 3 months post-injury, on recovery of EEG and MEG at 3 months
      post-injury, and on changes in DTI imaging, as well as any effects on liver function.

      In conclusion, traumatic brain injury has become the signature injury of the Iraq and
      Afghanistan wars, and many veterans with mild TBI find their injuries overlooked and
      misunderstood. The goal of the Mission Connect Mild TBI Translational Research Consortium is
      to find answers to the challenging questions associated with the diagnosis and treatment of
      MTBI. The four studies in this Integrated Clinical Protocol begin that process.

    <measure>Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, at 3 Months After Injury.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The Rivermead Post-Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) is a 16-item self-report measure of the presence and severity of the 16 most commonly reported post-concussive symptoms found in the literature. The scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury symptom levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to TBI. The range of scores is 0-64. Values for each of the 16 items include 0 (not experienced at all), 1 (no more of a problem than before the injury), 2 (mild problem), 3 (moderate problem), 4 (severe problem). The total score was a summation of symptoms that represented new symptom onset or an exacerbation of a symptom present pre-injury. (King, N.S., Crawford, S., Wenden, F.J., Moss, N.E., &amp; Wade, D.T. [1995].

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses functional health and well-being. There are 12 items in 8 subscales, including physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of the 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm with a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0.

    <time_frame>3 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The CES-D is a widely used screening scale for depression, assessing depressive feelings and behaviors occurring in the past week of a patient's life. The CES-D consists of 20 items, which make up six scales reflecting depressive symptomatology: depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely/none of the time) to 3 (most/all of the time). Scores for items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reversed before summing all items to yield a total score, which can range from 0-60. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. (Radloff, LS [1977].

    <measure>Brief Visuospatial Memory Test - Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months after injury</time_frame>
    <description>The BVMT-R is a measure of visuospatial memory. Six equivalent, alternate stimulus forms consist of six geometric figures printed in a 2 x 3 array on separate pages. In three Learning Trials, the subject views the stimulus page for 10 seconds and is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in their correct location. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Last, a Recognition Trial, in which the respondent is asked to identify which of 12 figures were included among the original geometric figures, is administered. Scoring of the immediate and delayed recall are based on the accuracy of the drawings and the location of the figures. For each figure, one point is awarded to each satisfactory domain resulting in a maximum of 12-points per trial.</description>

    <description>The SDMT is a measure of divided attention, visual scanning and motor speed. This measure involves a coding key consisting of 9 abstract symbols, each paired with a number ranging from 1 to 9. The subject is required to scan the key and write down the number corresponding to each symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct substitution within 90 seconds is recorded. In the written version of the test the subject fills in the numbers that correspond to the symbols. In the oral version the examiner records the numbers spoken by the subject. The score is the number of correctly coded items from 0-110 in 90 seconds. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>

          <title>Injury Severity Score</title>
          <description>ISS is a score that describes the overall injury severity and was determined at presentation to the hospital. There are 9 body regions where the injury severity is assessed on a scale from 1-6, with a higher score indicating a more severe injury. Is all body region scores are &lt; 6, then the ISS is calculated by summing the square of the 3 highest region scores. If any of the body region scores is 6 (unsurvivable) then the ISS is set to 75. The ISS score ranges from 1-75.</description>

        <title>Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire, at 3 Months After Injury.</title>
        <description>The Rivermead Post-Concussive Symptoms Questionnaire (RPQ) is a 16-item self-report measure of the presence and severity of the 16 most commonly reported post-concussive symptoms found in the literature. The scale compares any current symptoms to pre-injury symptom levels to account for potential symptom exacerbation due to TBI. The range of scores is 0-64. Values for each of the 16 items include 0 (not experienced at all), 1 (no more of a problem than before the injury), 2 (mild problem), 3 (moderate problem), 4 (severe problem). The total score was a summation of symptoms that represented new symptom onset or an exacerbation of a symptom present pre-injury. (King, N.S., Crawford, S., Wenden, F.J., Moss, N.E., &amp; Wade, D.T. [1995].

        <description>SF-12 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses functional health and well-being. There are 12 items in 8 subscales, including physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of the 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm with a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0.

          <title>Medical Outcome Study Short Form 12 - Physical Score</title>
          <description>SF-12 is a self-report questionnaire that assesses functional health and well-being. There are 12 items in 8 subscales, including physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. Physical and Mental Health Composite Scores are computed using the scores of the 12 questions and range from 0 to 100, where a zero score indicates the lowest level of health measured by the scales and 100 indicates the highest level of health. Both Physical and Mental Health Composite Scales combine the 12 items in such a way that they compare to a national norm with a mean score of 50.0 and a standard deviation of 10.0. (Ware, J.E., Jr., Kosinski, M., Turner-Bowker, D.M., Gandek, B. How to Score Version 2 of the SF-12v2Â® Health Survey [With a Supplement Documenting SF-12Â® Health Survey] Lincoln, RI: QualityMetric Incorporated, 2002.)</description>

        <description>The Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL) is a 17-item self report measure of the DSM-IV symptoms of PTSD. Respondents rate how much they were âbothered by a symptomâ on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (ânot at allâ) to 5 (âextremelyâ). The PCL was scored as a total score (range 17-85), with higher total scores indicating more symptoms. (Weathers, F., Litz, B., Herman, D., Huska, J., &amp; Keane, T. [October 1993].

        <title>Center for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale</title>
        <description>The CES-D is a widely used screening scale for depression, assessing depressive feelings and behaviors occurring in the past week of a patientâs life. The CES-D consists of 20 items, which make up six scales reflecting depressive symptomatology: depressed mood, feelings of guilt and worthlessness, feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, psychomotor retardation, loss of appetite, and sleep disturbance. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (rarely/none of the time) to 3 (most/all of the time). Scores for items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reversed before summing all items to yield a total score, which can range from 0-60. Higher scores indicate more depressive symptoms. (Radloff, LS [1977].

        <description>The BVMT-R is a measure of visuospatial memory. Six equivalent, alternate stimulus forms consist of six geometric figures printed in a 2 x 3 array on separate pages. In three Learning Trials, the subject views the stimulus page for 10 seconds and is asked to draw as many of the figures as possible in their correct location. A Delayed Recall Trial is administered after a 25-minute delay. Last, a Recognition Trial, in which the respondent is asked to identify which of 12 figures were included among the original geometric figures, is administered. Scoring of the immediate and delayed recall are based on the accuracy of the drawings and the location of the figures. For each figure, one point is awarded to each satisfactory domain resulting in a maximum of 12-points per trial.</description>

        <description>The SDMT is a measure of divided attention, visual scanning and motor speed. This measure involves a coding key consisting of 9 abstract symbols, each paired with a number ranging from 1 to 9. The subject is required to scan the key and write down the number corresponding to each symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct substitution within 90 seconds is recorded. In the written version of the test the subject fills in the numbers that correspond to the symbols. In the oral version the examiner records the numbers spoken by the subject. The score is the number of correctly coded items from 0-110 in 90 seconds. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>

This measure involves a coding key consisting of 9 abstract symbols, each paired with a number ranging from 1 to 9. The subject is required to scan the key and write down the number corresponding to each symbol as fast as possible. The number of correct substitution within 90 seconds is recorded. In the written version of the test the subject fills in the numbers that correspond to the symbols. In the oral version the examiner records the numbers spoken by the subject. The score is the number of correctly coded items from 0-110 in 90 seconds. A higher score indicates better performance.</description>
          <population>The analysis population includes all 27 patients in the atorvastatin group who completed the study and the 21 placebo group patients who completed the study plus one lost to follow-up at 6 months but had completed all of the outcome assessments for the primary and secondary outcomes at 3 months (for a total of 22 placebo group patients).</population>
