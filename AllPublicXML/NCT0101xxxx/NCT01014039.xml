    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy screening to reduce mortality and incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has been
      implemented in many western countries. The estimated effect is based on case-control and
      observational studies. There are no randomized trials quantifying the effect of colonoscopy
      screening on CRC incidence and mortality.

      The present study investigates the effect of a population-based once-only colonoscopy
      screening with polypectomy on the incidence of CRC in an average risk population.

      In 1983, 900 individuals 55 to 64 years of age were randomly drawn from the population
      registry of Telemark county, Norway. 400 of these were invited to a flexible sigmoidoscopy
      screening examination, and 400 individuals were not offered any screening. In 1996, the
      remainder, both cohorts from 1983 were invited to a colonoscopy screening examination. A new
      age and sex matched control group, not being offered screening, was randomly drawn from the
      same registry. Both groups are to be followed with regard to CRC incidence, CRC mortality and
      all-cause mortality through national Norwegian registries.

      This as a randomized study of once-only colonoscopy screening (n=685) vs/no screening(care as
      usual)(n=684). Men and women at 63-72 years of age are recruited from the population
      registry. The intervention group is invited for screening after a bowel cleansing regimen at
      home. Follow-up is restricted to trace events (colorectal cancer incidence and deaths)
      through national registries.
