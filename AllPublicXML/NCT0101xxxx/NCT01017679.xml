    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center phase II randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of
      Gefitinib 500mg in patients with IIIB/IV staged non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC) with stable
      disease after a month treatment of 250mg Gefitinib by DCR,also PFS and OS.The side effect is
      evaluated as well.
