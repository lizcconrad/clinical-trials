      Patient will choose to either receive the standard of care according to National
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or approved guidelines for their condition or to be
      treated according to one arm of the protocol that they could not be enrolled on. The
      selection of the arm will be at physician discretion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients failing to enroll in a specific therapeutic research protocol using FDA approved
      drugs or CTMS accepted therapies will be screened for this study. Patients will be randomized
      (Patient own choice) to either standard of care described in the NCCN guidelines and
      published as peer-reviewed phase II or III studies which show an efficacy or to one of the
      arms of the protocol they fail to enroll in, as determined by the treating physician.
