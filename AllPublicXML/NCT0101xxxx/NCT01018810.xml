  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will evaluate clinical activity, safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of 5 LY2525623 dosing groups compared to placebo in
      adults with plaque psoriasis.

    The trial was terminated for several reasons, including complexities in development of
    LY2525623, but not because of safety concerns

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scale by Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline through 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI combines extent of body-surface involvement assessments in 4 anatomical regions and severity of regional desquamation, erythema, and plaque induration/infiltration. Overall score: 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (severe disease). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Percent Improvement From Baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scale at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI combines body-surface assessments and severity of desquamation, erythema, and plaque induration/infiltration. Overall score:0(no psoriasis) to 72(severe disease). Percent(%) improvement=(baseline PASI-observed PASI)/baseline PASI*100. Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Least Squares (LS) Mean Values were adjusted for time, treatment, and baseline. Given small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Relative Physician's Global Assessment (rPGA) Scale at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The rPGA rates the subject's psoriasis relative to baseline as 1 (100% clearing), 2 (excellent; 75%-99% clearing), 3 (good; 50%-74% clearing), 4 (fair; 25%-49% clearing), 5 (poor; 0%-24% clearing), or 6 (worsening). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for Psoriatic Arthritis at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A global estimate of pain caused by joint disease on arising made by the subject by placing a vertical mark or tick on a 100-mm VAS from not present to worse, range from 0 to 100mm. Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Patient's Global Assessment of Psoriasis Scale at 12 Weeks and 24 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A scale measures patient perception of psoriatic condition with a continuous range of 0 (good) to 5 (severe). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Score at 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>10-item, validated questionnaire covers 6 domains. Responses range from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much); totals range from 0 to 30 (more impairment). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 16-item patient-rated measure of depressive symptomatology. The total score ranges from 0 to 27 with higher scores indicative of greater severity. Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

Scores of 11+ on either subscale (significant case of psychological morbidity); 8-10 (borderline); 0-7 (normal). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the curve of serum drug concentration, including absolute bioavailability. Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients.

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving 75% Improvement in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) Scale by Week 12</title>
        <description>PASI combines extent of body-surface involvement assessments in 4 anatomical regions and severity of regional desquamation, erythema, and plaque induration/infiltration. Overall score: 0 (no psoriasis) to 72 (severe disease). Study BDAD was terminated after enrolling only 8 patients. Given the small sample size overall and per treatment arm, numerical summaries and statistical comparisons are not appropriate and may be scientifically/clinically misleading; therefore, this outcome measure was not analyzed.</description>
