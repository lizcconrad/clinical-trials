  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators research group and others have found that patient-reported adherence to all
      aspects of the regimen is suboptimal and objective measures suggest even poorer adherence.
      There is little data, however that identifies and examines the reason for nonadherence in an
      adult Cystic Fibrosis (CF) population or identifies effective strategies for improving
      adherence.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the relative efficacy of a Motivational
      Interviewing-focused intervention (MI) in improving adherence and reducing CF-related
      morbidity compared to a CF education intervention (CFE; attention control group).
      Specifically, The investigators hypothesize that MI will result in improved regimen adherence
      and reduced CF morbidity compared to the CFE control group.

    <description>This intervention is designed to increase knowledge and enhance the skills needed to optimize CF-management. The strategies used to achieve improved adherence include providing didactic education and skills training, and proscriptively using behavioral modification strategies, such as positive reinforcement for desired behaviors, and problem-solving training to overcome barriers.</description>

    <description>The Counselor's overarching goal for the intervention is to motivate and assist the participant to improve his/her adherence to the CF pulmonary medications. The intervention will begin by providing the patient personal feedback on their adherence (using pharmacy refill data) and health outcomes (e.g., trajectory of lung function values, frequency of exacerbations) as well as clinic-level figures showing the association between adherence and health outcomes.</description>
