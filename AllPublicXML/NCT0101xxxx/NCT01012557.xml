  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pregnant women are at particular risk during the imminent H1N1v influenza pandemic. The new
      H1N1v virus requires urgent political and medical decisions on vaccination strategies in
      order to minimize severe disease and death from this pandemic. However, there is a lack of
      evidence to build such decisions upon. A vaccine will be provided in the fourth quarter of
      2009, but there is little knowledge on the immunogenicity. Particularly its clinical
      effectiveness and duration of immunity in pregnant women and their newborn infants is
      unknown. Therefore, it will be important to study the optimal vaccination regimens with
      respect to dosing and use of adjuvant to decide future health policies on vaccination of
      pregnant women. We have a unique possibility to study these aspects of H1N1v infection in
      pregnant women in our ongoing unselected, prospective, birth-cohort study recruiting 800
      pregnant mothers between Q1- 2009 and Q4-2010. Pregnant women from East-Denmark are being
      enrolled during the 2nd trimester and their infant will undergo a close clinical follow-up.
      The H1N1v pandemic is expected to reach Denmark Q4-2009. The timing of this enrollment and
      the imminent pandemic allows for an &quot;experiment of nature&quot; whereby the first half of the
      mothers completes pregnancy before the H1N1v pandemic. The other half of this cohort will be
      pregnant while H1N1v is prevalent in the community and will require H1N1v vaccination. The
      aim of this randomized, controlled, trial is to compare and evaluate the dose-related immune
      protection conferred by vaccine and adjuvant (Novartis vaccine Focetria) in pregnant women
      and non-pregnant women. In addition the protocol will assess the passive immunity conferred
      to the newborn from these vaccine regimes. The study will provide evidence-based guidance for
      health policies on vaccination for the population of pregnant women during future H1N1v
      pandemics.
