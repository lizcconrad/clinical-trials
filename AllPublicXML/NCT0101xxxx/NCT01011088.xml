    <textblock>
      A large number of studies have investigated the psychological disorders occurred in
      postpartum women, and found that postpartum psychosis is common in new mothers.

      However, the situation of paternal psychological status after they had their first baby is
      not assessed. The investigators hypothesized that they had a high occurrence of paternal
      psychosis after first baby born. In addition, different factors might influence its onset and
      development in new fathers.
