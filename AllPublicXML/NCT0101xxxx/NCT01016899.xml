      The objective of this study is to record recurrence in patients treated for nonmelanoma
      (basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) skin cancer using the Xoft Axxent Electronic
      Brachytherapy System. Additional objectives include evaluate the appearance of the treated
      area in patients treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer using the Xoft Axxent Electronic
      Brachytherapy System and record the occurrence of radiation therapy related skin changes in
      patients treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer.

      The objective of this study is to record local recurrence in patients treated for nonmelanoma
      (basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas) skin cancer using the Xoft Axxent Electronic
      Brachytherapy System. Additional objectives include evaluate the cosmetic outcomes in
      patients treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer using the Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy
      System and record the occurrence of radiation therapy related skin toxicities in patients
      treated for nonmelanoma skin cancer using the Xoft Axxent Electronic Brachytherapy System.
