  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if MRI techniques can be used for early evaluation of
      cardiac amyloidosis which is sometimes seen in individuals with multiple myeloma. Cardiac
      amyloidosis is a medical disorder that decreases heart function.

      The purpose is to investigate the use of multiple newer CMR techniques for early evaluation
      of cardiac amyloidosis in multiple myeloma.
