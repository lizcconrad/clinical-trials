  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will participate in each treatment separated by a minimum (=&gt; minimum) of 13
      days between dosing.

      In the two fasting periods, each subject will receive solifenacin succinate orally in each
      treatment period following a minimum 10 hour fast from food and beverages. In the fed
      condition, each subject will receive the suspension within 30 minutes of the start of
      breakfast.
