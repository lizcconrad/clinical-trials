  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunitinib shows anti-tumor activity in a variety of human non-small cell lung tumor ex vivo
      models. Many Phases II and III clinical trials of sunitinib in several solid tumors are
      completed or still ongoing. So far, the efficacy of sunitinb has been confirmed by the phase
      III trial for imatinib-resistance or intolerance advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor
      patients. And sutent was approved to effective by two phase II trials in advanced renal cell
      carcinoma patients after failure of immunotherapies, and one phase III trial in
      treatment-naive advanced renal carcinoma patients. Sunitinib (SUTENT ®) has been approved by
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced renal carcinoma
      patients and in gastrointestinal stromal tumor patients who are intolerant or progressed
      after imatinib mesylate. European Medicines Agency (EMEA) conditionally granted the marketing
      approval for the treatment of metastatic renal carcinoma patients after failure of
      immunotherapy.

      A phase II trial (A6181040 study) on non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with
      sunitinib alone showed anti-tumor activity. In 63 enrolled patients treated with 4/2 schedule
      (4 weeks treatment, then two weeks interruption), 7 patients are confirmed partial response
      (overall response rate, 11%), and median progress-free time is 14.3 weeks. Presently, a phase
      III study is underway on non-small cell lung cancer patients followed by and now is under
      recruiting.

      Non-small cell lung cancer cells often over-express vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      receptors. Besides, the expression of the VEGF ligands is also correlated with increased
      tumor angiogenesis, as well as shortened survival time. One study treated with VEGF-directed
      monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) and VEGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor
      (PDGFR) small molecule inhibitors (sunitinib) showed that some non-small cell lung cancer
      patients are with anti-tumor activity.

      The chemotherapy drugs, such as docetaxel and platinum-based compounds, were with evidence
      that they have direct cytotoxicity to cancer cells. Therefore, the investigators are paying
      attention to the efficacy of combining sunitinib and conventional chemotherapy in this study.

      The study is designed as first line of salvage therapy on metastatic or unresectable
      non-small cell lung cancer patients. The main goals of this study is to evaluate the overall
      response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DR) of sunitinib in combinational with
      docetaxel and cisplatin in chemotherapy-naive advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung
      cancer patients.

    <textblock>
      Study Design This is a single-center, open-label, phase II clinical trial. Simon two-stage
      analysis is adopted.The sample size in the first stage is 16 patients. The length of study is
      approximately 24 months. The targeted subject is patient with metastatic or unresectable
      non-small cell lung cancer.

      Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint Assess the response rate of sunitinib, docetaxel and
      cisplatin in the treatment of naïve chemotherapy metastatic or unresectable non-small cell
      lung cancer patients.

      Secondary Endpoint

        1. Time to disease progression (defined as the time period from the start of investigated
           medication to investigator assessed disease progression) at the end of study.

        2. Duration of survival (defined as the time period from the start of investigated
           medication to death).

        3. Safety profile of sunitinib in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin: cardiac
           toxicity assessed in accordance with National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
           (version 3.0). The incidence of serious adverse events related to the treatment and the
           incidence of specific adverse events (serious and non-serious) such as gastro-intestinal
           perforation, wound healing complication, bleeding, hypertension, arterial thromboembolic
           events and proteinuria will be investigated. NCI-CTCAE criteria (version 3.0) will be
           used.
