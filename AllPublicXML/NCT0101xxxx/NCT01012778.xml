  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multimodal intervention was rolled out at a large public school in Najibabad, Uttar Pradesh
      (UP). The program identified elementary school children with ADHD and Dyslexia using standard
      screening of all children who had performance impairment in at least one domain of the
      Vanderbilt questionnaire. The program consisted of play therapy, physical exercise, yoga and
      meditation. The program was established by High school volunteers from The US and UK over 6
      weeks. Once implemented during the morning of school, high school volunteers from the school
      were trained to continue the program. Vanderbilt questionnaires were completed at intervals
      to allow follow up.
