  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to pilot test a behavioral intervention for modifying the
      diet and physical activity patterns of overweight preschool children through improved
      parenting and nutritional education(LAUNCH). This intervention will be compared to standard
      of care for preschool overweight in the primary care setting using a randomized clinical
      trial design (RCT. The results of this pilot RCT will provide data integral to estimating the
      effect size for a more definitive RCT of the intervention in the future. The primary
      hypothesis is:

      H1: LAUNCH will result in a significantly greater decrease in BMI z score compared to the
      standard of care at 12 months post-treatment.

    <description>A 6-month intervention consisting of two phases: Phase I (Intensive Intervention), 12 weekly sessions that alternated between group-based clinic sessions (parent and child concurrent groups) and individual home visits and Phase II (Maintenance), 12 weeks of every other week sessions, alternating between group sessions in-clinic and home sessions. Targeted 3 components: 1) Dietary education with age-specific caloric targets, healthy eating recommendations for children following the AAP guidelines used in the PC session; 2) Physical Activity education with age-specific activities for children and families; and 3) Parenting skills to achieve the diet and physical activity goals using behavioral management skills and parent modeling of eating and activity.</description>
