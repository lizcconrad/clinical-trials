      The aim of the study is to compare patient outcome following standard of care (Hartmann's or
      resection with anastomosis and defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage
      alone) for the treatment of acute perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis in Irish hospitals.

      Perforated diverticulitis requires emergency surgery. This carries significant risks and
      mortality as high as 15% during the index admission has been reported. Our group has
      established the safety of laparoscopic lavage alone on the largest cohort to date in a
      prospective multi-institutional study of 100 patients, providing convincing evidence that
      laparoscopic lavage alone is a reasonable alternative to resection for non-faeculant
      perforated diverticulitis. Our aim now is to translate this well-established study design
      into a protocol for a multi-institutional randomised control trial as direct comparison is
      the only way to provide convincing evidence of one modality over another.

      All patients will be followed up for twelve months and primary (operative and in-hospital
      mortality) and secondary (in-hospital and post-discharge morbidity; rates of stoma formation;
      rates of re-presentation with diverticulitis with or without perforation.) end-points will be
      recorded.

      Sample size calculations reveal that a patient cohort of 100 in each arm will be sufficient
      to detect a difference in morbidity and mortality between groups The ratio between Hinchey 3
      and Hinchey 4 is estimated to be approximately 2:1. In order to guarantee sufficient sample
      size, therefore, 300 patients must fulfil the study criteria allowing for exclusion of 100 at
      time of operation

      Background and Current Knowledge:

      Until recently, the natural history of diverticular disease was poorly understood and
      evidence suggesting a link between recurrent presentations with diverticulitis and
      perforation is almost forty years old rendering its relevance to modern day practice
      questionable at best . More recently, these questions have been clarified and it seems that
      risk of perforation following a single (treated) episode of diverticulitis is in the order of
      2% per year with a risk of requiring an emergency Hartmann's procedure in this cohort being 1
      in 2000 patient years of follow-up . As with all surgical interventions, there is a certain
      risk profile associated with elective resection and morbidity is estimated at 25-50%
      (including stoma formation in 10-14%) and mortality at 1-2% . The current vogue (despite some
      dissention ) is towards a more conservative approach to management of non-perforated acute
      diverticulitis and away from elective sigmoid colectomy in the absence of perforation .

      Management of perforated diverticulitis continues to evolve. The last 50 years has seen
      standard of care shift from a three stage procedure (1.Drainage and defunctioning colostomy,
      2.Excision of diseased segment, 3.Colostomy reversal and restoration of continuity) , to
      Hartmann's procedure , to resection and primary anastomosis , to treatment with antimicrobial
      therapy alone in a carefully selected (Hinchey Grade 2) population . Since the learning curve
      for laparoscopic surgery has begun to plateau, resections for perforated diverticular disease
      have been shown to be as safe and effective as conventional open techniques .

      Irish surgeons have pioneered the institution of laparoscopic lavage for acute non-faeculant
      diverticulitis. The operative method described involves laparoscopy, copious washout, drain
      placement and treatment with antimicrobial therapy (intravenous for 72hours followed by oral
      for one week). Benefits include low mortality, stoma avoidance, minimal wound infection,
      shorter operative time and no difference in recurrence when compared to primary resection and
      anastomosis. Having demonstrated a clear clinical advantage of laparoscopic lavage over
      standard of care (Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis) for acute non
      faeculant perforated diverticulitis, we feel the time is ripe to formalise these findings
      through performance of a multicentre national randomised controlled trial- LapLAND
      (LAParoscopic Lavage for Acute Non-faeculant Diverticulitis).

      Relevance:

      Perforated diverticulitis requires emergency surgery . This carries significant risks and
      mortality as high as 15% during the index admission has been reported . It appears that
      morbidity and mortality related to resections in complicated and uncomplicated disease are
      reduced in laparoscopic intervention when compared to open . The real question, however, is
      whether or not there is necessity to perform any resection or whether lavage is sufficient.
      Our group has established the safety of this procedure on the largest cohort to date24 in a
      prospective multi-institutional study of 100 patients. We provided convincing evidence that
      laparoscopic lavage is a reasonable alternative to resection for non-faeculant perforated
      diverticulitis. We demonstrated a low mortality rate despite patient co-morbidity and disease
      severity. Benefits of lavage alone included stoma avoidance and decreased wound infection. At
      up to 36 months follow up it appeared that subsequent resection appeared unnecessary. These
      findings were confirmed by a similar French trial published this year which demonstrated no
      excess morbidity or mortality, a reduction in hospital stay and a lower rate of stoma
      formation. Having established the safety of the new intervention (laparoscopic lavage), our
      aim now is to translate this well established study design into a protocol for a
      multi-institutional randomised control trial as we believe that direct comparison is the only
      way to provide convincing evidence of one modality over another.

      Knowledge transfer/implementation/consolidation:

      Evidence to date regarding the management of perforated diverticulitis is based on a
      combination of eminence based opinion and outdated retrospective analysis. A true prospective
      analysis comparing standard of care (Hartmann's or resection with anastomosis and
      defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage alone) is yet to be published.
      Aims and Objective:

      To compare patient outcome following standard of care (Hartmann's or resection with
      anastomosis and defunctioning stoma) and a 'new therapy' (laparoscopic lavage alone) for the
      treatment of acute perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis in Irish hospitals. Specific
      research questions include:

        1. Which treatment modality confers least mortality and morbidity in patients with
           non-faeculant perforated diverticulitis?

        2. Does treatment influence length of hospital stay and return to activities of daily
           living?

        3. Do patients undergoing laparoscopic lavage alone require emergency sigmoidectomy at a
           later date (within a one year period)?

        4. Does laparoscopic lavage alone confer any advantage in terms of stoma-free survival?

      Strategy:

      An Irish multi-centre trial will be performed with the aim of comparing two treatment
      modalities for patients presenting acutely with perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis.
      Pre-operative details, intraoperative findings and post-operative course will be
      prospectively accrued by the operating surgeon. All patients will be followed up for twelve
      months and primary (operative and in-hospital mortality) and secondary (in-hospital and
      post-discharge morbidity; rates of stoma formation; rates of re-presentation with
      diverticulitis with or without perforation.) end-points will be recorded.

      Study Outline:

      All patients demonstrating clinical signs of generalised peritonitis and radiological
      evidence of intra-peritoneal free air (on erect chest radiograph or abdominal CT scan will be
      eligible for the study. Individual patient consent will be sought. They will be given
      intravenous fluids (standardised regime) and intravenous antibiotics (3rd generation
      cephalosporin and metronidazole). All patients will be given prophylaxis against deep vein
      thrombosis (compression stockings and low molecular weight heparin). When patients have
      received adequate fluid resuscitation they will proceed to theatre on an emergency basis.

      Pneumoperitoneum will be established via a blunt entry umbilical port. Two 5mm ports will be
      placed in the suprapubic and right lower quadrants to facilitate triangulation of instruments
      during manipulation and lavage. The peritoneal cavity will be thoroughly examined and stage
      classified according to Hinchey. All patients with faeculant peritonitis will undergo
      Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis according to local preference and
      excluded from the study on that basis. In the absence of faeculant peritonitis, patients will
      be randomised to undergo Hartmann's procedure or primary resection and anastomosis (depending
      on standard practice in the individual unit) or laparoscopic lavage alone. Peritoneal lavage
      will be performed in all four quadrants using at least 4 litres of warmed saline until the
      drainage is clear. Intravenous antibiotics will be continued for a minimum of 72hours and
      oral antibiotics will be continued for one week. Oral fluids will be commenced on the first
      postoperative day and diet will be introduced subsequently, depending on clinical status.
      Early mobilisation will be encouraged.

      Study Management:

      This multicentre surgical clinical trial will be coordinated by the R&amp;D unit of the Colles
      Institute at RCSI. The Colles Institute comprises of the National Surgical Training Centre,
      the Centre of R&amp;D and Centre for Innovation in Surgical Technology. The Project Manager for
      this trial will be Mr Kieran Ryan, who has over 10 years experience in running clinical
      trials along with many years experience in the Irish Health System, including his role as a
      former GCP inspector with the Irish Medicines Board. Kieran and his team will ensure that the
      trial is carried out in accordance with the relevant regulations, GCP standards and the
      requirements of the protocol. This will ensure the smooth running of the trial and the
      integrity of the research data and management of the patients.

      There will also be a DSMB (Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board) of external surgeons established
      to oversee the progress of the study and ensure that the safety of patients are to the
      forefront of this trial.

      Data Collection:

      Data collection will be performed by the operating surgeon or a designated member of the
      surgical team (present at time of operation) and recorded on an electronic pro-forma or
      electronic Case Report Form. It will include patient demographics (age, sex), previous
      diverticular history American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade and specific
      co-morbidities, intervention performed, operation performed, incidence of stoma formation,
      re-intervention during index admission (radiological or operative) in-hospital morbidity
      (myocardial infarction, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, wound infection, abscess
      requiring drainage, urosepsis, renal failure or respiratory insufficiency), mortality, time
      to return to diet, time to discharge. Further details will be recorded at post-operative
      visits- stoma-free survival at one year, number of days alive following discharge,
      reinterventions within 12 months, patient satisfaction.

      Standardisation of treatment within trial:

      Patients may withdraw from the trial at any time if they so wish. Re-laparotomy may be
      performed at the discretion of the operating surgeon but fixed indications include clinical
      deterioration or failure to improve within 48-72 hours post-operatively. Potential foci of
      concurrent sepsis should be out-ruled (respiratory, urinary) by clinical, biochemical or
      radiological investigations.

      Hospital Inclusion and Patient Accrual:

      All eligible patients (see exclusion criteria) presenting to participating hospitals with
      perforated diverticulitis will be recruited for the trial. They will be furnished with a
      patient information leaflet and will have the implications of inclusion in the trial
      explained to them by the operating surgeon. It will be explained that non-willingness to
      participate in the trial will not have any negative impact on their treatment. If the patient
      is willing to participate in the trial, verbal and written consent will be obtained prior to
      transfer to the operating theatre.

      Sample size Calculation:

      Having performed an extensive literature review of studies comparing treatment entities for
      perforated non-faeculant diverticulitis, sample size calculations reveal that a patient
      cohort of 100 in each arm will be sufficient to detect a difference in morbidity and
      mortality between groups (25% versus 10%; two sided significance 5% and a power of 80%). A
      significance level of 0.05 on the two sided Likelihood ratio test was used and the
      significance level achieved by this design is 0.04997.

      In order to guarantee sufficient sample size, therefore, 300 patients must fulfil the study
      criteria (allowing for exclusion of 100 at time of operation). Recruitment of patients is not
      expected to be difficult because evidence to date is convincing of at least equivalent
      outcome and we believe that most patients would hope to be assigned to the lavage group in
      the hope of avoiding a stoma. From a surgeon's perspective, laparoscopic lavage is
      technically less challenging and time consuming than traditional treatment modalities.
