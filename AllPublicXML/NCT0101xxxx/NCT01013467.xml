  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insufficient blood pressure control is a frequent problem despite the existence of effective
      treatment. One of the causes is insufficient self-monitoring and a lack of adherence to
      therapy. Blood pressure self-measurement at home (Home Blood Pressure Measurement, HBPM) has
      positive effects on treatment adherence and is helpful in achieving the target blood
      pressure.

      Only a few studies have investigated whether the adherence for HBPM can be improved through
      simple measures and better blood pressure monitoring can be achieved.

      Objective Improvement of self-monitoring by means of blood pressure self-measurement and
      improved blood pressure control by using a new colour-coded blood pressure diary

    <description>The patients in the intervention group will receive a colour-coded blood pressure record booklet. The corresponding colour coded areas are divided into three areas of green, yellow and red following a traffic light system. The green area covers blood pressure readings up to a maximum of 140/90 mmHg, the yellow area includes systolic readings over 140 to 180 mm Hg and diastolic readings over 90 to 110 mmHg. The red area covers systolic readings over 180 mmHg and diastolic readings over 110 mmHg.</description>
