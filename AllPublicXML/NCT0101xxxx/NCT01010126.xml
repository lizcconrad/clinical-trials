    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well temsirolimus and bevacizumab work in treating patients
      with advanced endometrial, ovarian, liver, carcinoid, or islet cell cancer. Temsirolimus may
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some
      block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill
      them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of
      cancer by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving temsirolimus together with bevacizumab may
      kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the response rate and progression-free survival at 6 months in patients with
      endometrial, ovarian, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoid or islet cell cancer.

      II. To determine the toxicity of the combination of temsirolimus and bevacizumab in patients
      with endometrial, ovarian, hepatocellular carcinoma, carcinoid or islet cell cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect blood and tumor specimens from all patients entered on the trial for possible
      future analysis.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 years.
