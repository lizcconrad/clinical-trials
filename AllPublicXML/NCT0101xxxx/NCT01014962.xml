      a Thorough QTc study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 5 days of albaconazole dosing at
      levels that exceed both the projected therapeutic dose and the projected therapeutic
      frequency, in order to identify an upper dose for administration in a TQTc study. It also
      aims to assess the pharmacokinetics of multiple escalating doses of albaconazole, and to
      assess the effects of multiple and sustained dosing of high doses of albaconazole on ECG
      parameters.

          -  Good physical and mental health.

          -  Vital signs .within the acceptable range.

          -  Electrocardiogram (12-lead) after at least 5 minutes in supine position considered as
             normal or with findings considered as not clinically significant by the investigator.
             .

          -  Non-smoker for at least 6 months before screening.

          -  Subject has screening laboratory parameters within the normal ranges unless considered
             to be not clinically relevant by the principal investigator. .

          -  Subject is able to review and understand an informed consent, and must sign the
             independent ethics committee (IEC)/IRB approved informed consent form before any
             trial-related procedures are performed.

                  pregnancy test result at screening. These subjects must use a medically
                  acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product, and
                  are expected to continue to use this method of contraception for up to 90 days
