  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary outcome of this study is to evaluate the effects of low frequency subthreshold
      repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation applied to the left temporoparietal cortex of
      patients with refractory schizophrenia on the severity of auditory hallucinations.

      The secondary outcome is to evaluate the effects of the same rTMS protocol on quality of
      life, functionality and general psychopathology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventeen patients with DSM-IV TR diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomized in two groups.
      First group received 20 sessions of 20 minutes each of low-frequency (1Hz) rTMS applied over
      the left temporoparietal cortex (LTPC).

      Second group received sham (placebo) stimulation over the LTPC for the same period of time.
      All patients were considered as having refractory schizophrenia and in use of at least
      400mg/day of clozapine and refering auditory hallucinations occuring at least 5 times a day.
