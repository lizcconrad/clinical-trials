  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines induce protective immunity against numerous infectious diseases. However, current
      vaccines have limited efficacy against challenging infections like tuberculosis, malaria and
      HIV. Protein vaccines are safe but, typically, they induce weak T cell immunity when
      administered alone. Therefore, special attention is being given to adjuvants, which are
      enhancers of immunity, that mature antigen presenting immunostimulatory dendritic cells
      (DCs). Our goal is to study in humans the mechanism whereby synthetic adjuvants, acting on
      defined pattern recognition receptors (PRR), enhance T and B cell immunity. In preclinical
      studies, the investigators' laboratory has found in mice that poly IC and its analog poly
      ICLC are superior adjuvants for T cell mediated immunity relative to other agonists for PRR.
      In this study the investigators propose to study the safety and the innate immune responses
      to poly ICLC in multiple blood cell types, including three different subsets of DCs when
      administered subcutaneously or intranasally to healthy volunteers. Poly ICLC is a stabilized
      double stranded RNA which has been extensively studied in humans with a favorable safety
      profile.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Healthy adult males and females, as assessed by a medical history, physical exam, and
             laboratory tests

          2. Age of at least 18 years on the day of screening and no greater than 60 years at time
             of drug/placebo administration

          3. Willing to comply with the requirements of the protocol and available for follow-up
             for the planned duration of the study (screening plus 4 weeks)

          4. In the opinion of the principal investigator or designee, has understood the
             information provided. Written informed consent needs to be given before any
             study-related procedures are performed

          5. Willing to undergo HIV testing and counseling, and receive HIV test results

          6. If a sexually active male, willing to use an effective method of contraception
             (condoms, anatomical sterility) throughout the study period and will be advised not to
