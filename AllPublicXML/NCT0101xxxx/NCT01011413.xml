  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical data suggests that the standard dose of the anti-HIV medication, efavirenz (EFV),
      could be reduced without compromising its effectiveness. Lower drug doses could have fewer
      side effects and would make EFV more affordable. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      safety and effectiveness, over 96 weeks, of standard (600mg) versus reduced dose (400mg) EFV
      in controlling HIV as part of initial combination antiretroviral therapy.

      In this international, multicenter trial, 630 HIV infected patients who have not received any
      previous treatment for their HIV-infection will be enrolled. Participants will be randomized
      equally (1:1) to receive truvada (tenofovir and emtricitabine) with either the standard or
      reduced dose of EFV. Neither the study doctor nor the participant will know which treatment
      the participant is receiving. Physical examinations, laboratory analyses and questionnaires
      will be performed at the 11 study visits at screening, baseline (Week 0), Weeks 4, 12, 24,
      36, 48, 60, 72, 84 and 96. The primary aim of this study is to compare between treatment
      groups the proportion of patients with undetectable HIV viral load (HIV RNA &lt; 200 copies/mL)
      after 48 weeks. Information on immune function, drug adherence, resistance to
      antiretrovirals, quality of life, mental state and HIV-related conditions will also be
      collected. Blood samples will be collected for future testing. Interim analyses will be
      performed when the first 125 participants in each treatment group reach week 24 and when all
      participants reach week 24. These interim analyses will provide an early check that the
      reduced dose of EFV suppresses HIV infection as effectively as the standard dose of EFV. A
      follow-up analysis will be performed when all participants reach week 96.
