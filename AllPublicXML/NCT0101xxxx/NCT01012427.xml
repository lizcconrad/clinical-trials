  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test how effective cryoablation is in killing cancer cells.
      Cryoablation uses freezing temperatures to treat cancer. Cryoablation works by creating
      freezing temperatures within a needle probe. When this probe is inserted into a cancer, the
      freezing temperatures are used to try and kill the cancer. Unfortunately, the investigators
      don't know how well cryoablation works at destroying the cancer. This study will allow us to
      check to see how well cryoablation works for kidney cancers. After the investigators destroy
      the kidney cancers using cryoablation, the investigators will followup with you every 5-7
      months to make sure the cryoablation worked and that the cancer was destroyed.

    <description>The interventions in this study are part of clinical care and include percutaneous image-guided biopsy, percutaneous renal tumor cryoablation, CT/MR imaging of the ablation bed, and repeat pathologic sampling of the tumor bed with percutaneous biopsy. The cryoablation is done as the therapeutic intervention in patients with small renal cancer. The CT/MR imaging is done to evaluate the treatment for residual disease after the ablation. The repeat biopsy (e.g. three cores) is done to confirm that the neoplasm has been eradicated. These patients have continued imaging, and if necessary, percutaneous biopsy to ensure no recurrent disease.</description>

    <description>All patients will have percutaneous image guided core biopsies of the treatment site and CT or MR imaging at approximately 5-7 months following the cryoablation. They will have repeat imaging every 5-7 months for a period of two years, and if there is evidence of recurrence (ablation zone increase &gt; 5 mm or increased enhancement 15 HU), then repeat biopsy will be obtained. Imaging follow-up past the two year point will be at the discretion of the patient's physicians.</description>

          -  Patient willing and able to undergo imaging and percutaneous biopsy at 5-7 month
             intervals for 2 years and then at the discretion of the patient's physicians.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Intercurrent medical condition that renders the patient ineligible for cryoablation

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Tumor less than 5 mm to the renal pelvis, main renal vessel, ureter, or other vital
             structure
