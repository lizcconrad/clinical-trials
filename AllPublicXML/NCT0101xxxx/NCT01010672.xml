    <description>Progression free rate at 6 months is defined as the proportion of participants who are a complete response (CR, disappearance of all target lesions), partial response (PR, at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions) or stable disease (does not qualify for PR or progressive disease) at 6 months from the date of the first study drug administration.</description>
