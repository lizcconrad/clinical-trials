    <textblock>
      For patients initially presenting with localized sarcoma the standard of care is surgery
      followed by with radiation therapy (if feasible). Subsequent or adjuvant cytotoxic based
      chemotherapy even for aggressive sarcoma histopathologies (as commonly done for colorectal
      cancer or breast cancer) is controversial since over 20 individual adjuvant randomized
      clinical trials have not been able to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant
      improvement in overall survival. Maturation or differentiation therapy provides an
      opportunity to fundamentally change the biology of the underlying cancer (and thus its
      overall prognosis) by promoting cellular maturation within that cancer. A change from a
      poorly 'differentiated/high grade' tumor to a well 'differentiated/low grade' tumor is
      attainable and can change an individual's median time of survival from months to decades. The
      investigators have significant preclinical data that differentiation therapy using a group of
      drugs referred to as histone deacetylase inhibitors (such as Valproate, also a commonly used
      and safe anti seizure medication) is feasible for sarcomas. This approach has not been
      clinically addressed in solid tumors. Since adjuvant therapy is controversial for sarcomas,
      and building on the investigators' preclinical data, adjuvant based differentiation therapy
      using valproate would be predicted to be both safe and potentially extremely beneficial in
      terms of a) increasing the time to disease recurrence, b) improving the histology upon
      recurrence; and c) improving overall survival in patients with sarcomas.

      Patients with high grade sarcomas will receive Valproate in the adjuvant setting daily and
      clinically/radiologically followed until recurrence. Relapse free survival, time to local
      failure, time to distant failure, overall survival, and comparative histopathology of primary
      and recurrence will be assessed.

      Adjuvant chemotherapy for high grade soft tissue sarcomas is controversial. Given the fact
      that approximately 50% of patients receiving optimum treatment will recur in three years and
      die of recurrence within five years, smarter adjuvant options are needed. One such treatment
      option would be to &quot;differentiate&quot; the high grade sarcoma into a low grade sarcoma upon
      recurrence. This differentiation effect will reduce the risk of subsequent death by 50% as
      determined by the overall survival difference between high grade/poorly differentiated and
      low grade/ well differentiated sarcomas. Given that differentiation takes place on a time
      scale that is significantly longer than cytotoxic effects, the optimum time to initiate
      differentiation therapy is in the adjuvant setting; when the time to disease recurrence is
      measured in months to years.

      The histone deacetylase inhibitor, Valproate, has been shown to promote differentiation in
      myeloid malignancies when administered in standard dosing regiments. We have recently shown
      that sarcomas are conceptually similar to hematopoietic malignancies, in that both represent
      diseases of aberrant development in which developing cells along their respective lineages
      arrest and transform at various points of differentiation. We have recently shown in vitro
      that, as for acute promyelocytic leukemia, sarcomas can be reprogrammed to reenter normal
      differentiation via epigenetic modulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors. It is
      therefore appealing to study Valproate based differentiation therapy in the adjuvant setting
      for sarcomas.

    <description>Subjects should initiate therapy at 10 to 15 mg/kg/day. The dosage should be increased by 5 to 10 mg/kg/week to achieve optimal clinical response. Optimal clinical response is achieved at daily doses below 60 mg/kg/day. If satisfactory clinical response has not been achieved, plasma levels should be measured to determine whether or not they are in the usually accepted therapeutic range (50 - 100 µg/mL).</description>
