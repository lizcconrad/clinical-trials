      Study 22001, &quot;A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Flexible-Dose Evaluation of the Efficacy,
      Safety, and Tolerability of STX209 in the Treatment of Irritability in Subjects with Fragile
      X Syndrome&quot; currently is evaluating the efficacy of STX209 (R-baclofen) for management of
      typical problem behaviors, such as irritability and aggression, in subjects with FXS. This
      study (22002) will enter subjects who complete Study 22001 into a long-term, open-label
      study.The open-label extension protocol will provide necessary data on the long-term safety
      and tolerability of STX209 among subjects with FXS who receive treatment under conditions
      more closely reflective of their general medical care.

    <description>A flexible dose titration will be utilized during the first four weeks to define the optimal titrated dose (OTD) for each subject. Investigators will use clinical judgment to adjust doses to the OTD. The starting dose will be 1 mg BID. The dose may be increased every four to five days to 2 mg BID, 3 mg BID, 5 mg BID and then 10 mg BID</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have completed all scheduled visits in protocol 22001 and have shown they can
             adequately follow the protocol, with sufficient medical justification to continue on
             open-label treatment with STX209, as assessed by the principal investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with a medical condition that might interfere with the conduct of the study,
             confound interpretation of the study results, or endanger their own well-being.

          -  The occurrence or continuation of any adverse event or condition during study 22001
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, should exclude the subject from
             participating in this open-label extension.
