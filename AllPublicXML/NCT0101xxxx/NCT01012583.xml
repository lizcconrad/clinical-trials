      BACKGROUND Treatment of coronary atherosclerotic disease has been significantly advanced by
      interventional cardiology, and the advent of coronary arterial stents. In comparison to
      angioplasty alone, stents have reduced the incidence of angiographic as well as clinical
      restenosis, the recurrence of angina, the need for coronary arterial bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery, repeat revascularization and the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events
      (MACE).However the long-term success of this therapy has been limited by the occurrence of
      in-stent restenosis. Despite the effectiveness of intracoronary stents in maintaining a
      larger luminal diameter, as compared to angioplasty alone, in-stent restenosis occurs within
      6 to 9 months after stent placement in 15% to 35% of patients. While stents can reduce
      restenosis by blocking vascular recoil and remodeling, mechanical intervention alone has been
      incapable of treating this biological problem of neointimal hyperplasia, particularly in the
      subset of patients with diabetes, long lesions or small vessel disease.Drug-eluting stents
      (DES) were developed as a viable method for focused delivery of anti-restenosis compounds to
      target lesions for the reduction of restenosis. Of the DES available and with the results of
      up to six (6) years clinical follow-up, the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) has become the
      current gold standard for stent implantation. With the advent of using DES to treat complex
      lesions such as longer lesions requiring the use of multiple stents and the use in
      bifurcation lesions, the risk of stent thrombosis has increase.Late stent thrombosis has also
      been reported following DES implantation.Long term treatment with dual anti-platelet therapy
      following stent implantation has become the solution used to counteract the risk of stent
      thrombosis, this solution does not come without it's own risks and is an expensive therapy.
      Another specific problem of DES is delayed endothelization, and this may be and attributing
      factor in prolonging the period of thrombotic risk as shown by pathological findings at
      autopsy following SES implantation. These examinations have shown that even after 16 months,
      neointimal healing is still incomplete with approximately 20% of stent struts being found
      uncovered. Questions have arose that the problems of late thrombosis and delayed
      endothelization of stent struts with DES could be the result of the permanent polymer that is
      used as the bonding agent for the anti-restenosis compounds to the stents.Intravascular
      Ultrasound (IVUS) along with angiography has been the techniques used to gain data on DES to
      this point. Angiography is a 2 dimensional tool that gives a view of the vessel and IVUS
      gives a more 3 dimensional view of the vessel. IVUS does have its limitations, as stent
      struts are reflectors of sonic waves, shadowing around and behind the struts occurs. IVUS is
      also limited in detecting malapposition of the struts to the vessel wall especially if the
      area between the vessel wall and the strut in very small.

      RATIONALE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of IVUS that uses an
      infrared light source and measures the backscatter of the light. With this technique a higher
      level of resolution compared with IVUS has been reported.OCT has been reported as being able
      to visualize and detect atherosclerotic plaques and assess more accurately strut
      malapposition and the presence or thickness of neointimal hyperplasia as compared to IVUS.
      With the question of delayed endothelization due to the permanent polymer being a probable
      risk for late stent thrombosis, it is felt that OCT post stent implantation may give a more
      accurate assessment of stent strut endothelial coverage.

      This study is designed to compare the intimal hyperplasia following implantation of the Excel
      DES with a biodegradable polymer vs. the Cypher DES with a permanent polymer using OCT.
