      The FORESEE HOME is intended for the early detection of central and paracentral
      irregularities (abnormalities) in the visual field, most commonly associated with AMD.
      However, the device has ability to detect the development of the lesion post treatment and
      therefore to asses in determination of the next treatment.

      The FORESEE HOME is intended for the early detection of central and paracentral
      irregularities (abnormalities) in the visual field, most commonly associated with AMD.
      However, the device has ability to detect the development of the lesion post treatment and
      therefore to asses in determination of the next treatment.

      The OCT May be use as well to identify choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Comparison between
      the two methods will allow better understanding of both devices.

      The FORESEE HOME can use as an assessment tool for the progression and success of the
      treatment given to AMD lesions. Therefore, evaluation the size and the location of the
      treated lesions may serve as an additional tool.
