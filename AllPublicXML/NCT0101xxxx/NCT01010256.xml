  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the level of a specific protein (PTEN) in the cancer
      cells of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients. This protein might be involved in
      the transformation from normal blood cells to leukemia cells. The PTEN protein has not been
      investigated in CMML specifically but it has been discovered in closely related cancers. If
      this study demonstrates an abnormality in this protein, future testing will be designed to
      evaluate the genetic abnormality that resulted in lack of the normal presence of this
      protein. The goal is that the results of this study will help to develop new drugs and
      strategies to treat the future patients with CMML by understanding the abnormality of the
      disease at the cellular and molecular levels. The results of this study can also be utilized
      by future studies to develop individualized treatment to patients who have abnormal levels of
      this protein.

    <description>Subjects ages 18 and older with a CMML diagnosis based on the WHO 2009 criteria, and who have signed an informed consent are eligible to participate in the study population of this clinical trial. A total of 12 patients will be consented.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control Group</arm_group_label>
    <description>The control group will consist of subjects ages 18 years or older who are healthy (i.e. no hematologic disorders) and have signed an informed consent. A total of 10 healthy control subjects will be consented.</description>

        During routine clinic visits, staff will present the option of participating in this
        clinical trial to eligible patients with a diagnosis of CMML. Also, healthy control
        patients will be asked to participate. The healthy control patients can be the subject's
        family members, friends, or volunteers.
