  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronically total occlusions (CTO) are difficult to treat and have high risk for restenosis.
      Although everolimus-eluting stents (EES) [(Xience, Abbott Vascular) or Promus (Boston
      Scientific)] are very promising for the treatment of CTOs due to their low late loss and
      excellent deliverability, there are currently no published data on EES implantation in CTOs.

      The specific aim of this proposal is to examine the 8-month incidence of binary angiographic
      in-stent restenosis (defined as a stenosis of &gt; 50% of the minimum lumen diameter of the
      target stent) after implantation of the EES in CTO.

      It is the investigators hypothesis that EES-treated CTO lesions will have â‰¤ 20% 8-month
      in-stent binary angiographic restenosis rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 18 years old

          2. Successful treatment of a native coronary artery CTO (defined as a lesion with 100%
             angiographic stenosis that is at least 3 months old as estimated by clinical
             information, sequential angiographic information, or both) using everolimus-eluting
             stents

          3. Able and willing to return for angiographic follow-up after 8 months and to be
             followed clinically for 12 months

          4. Agree to participate and provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Planned non-cardiac surgery within the following 12 months

          2. Recent positive pregnancy test, breast-feeding, or possibility of a future pregnancy

          3. Coexisting conditions that limit life expectancy to less than 12 months

          4. Patients who have a creatinine above 2.5 mg/dL (unless they require hemodialysis, in
             which case they are eligible to participate)

          5. History of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to everolimus
