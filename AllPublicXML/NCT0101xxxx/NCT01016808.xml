    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is male or female and at least 18 years of age.

          -  Females must be non-pregnant, non-lactating, and practicing an acceptable method of
             birth control, or be surgically sterile or postmenopausal (amenorrhea for ≥ 12
             months). Non-pregnancy will be confirmed by pregnancy tests conducted at Screening and
             Pre-treatment.

          -  Patient is scheduled for bunionectomy surgery, meets the criteria of an ASA Class I to
             III, and is willing to stay in the study center for at least 48 hours from the initial
             dose of study medication post surgery.

          -  To be randomized after surgery, the patient must report moderate to severe pain (a
             score of 2 or more on the 4 point Likert scale or at least 4 on the 11 point NPRS
             scale).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In the opinion of the Investigator, has a history of pulmonary, cardiovascular
             (including uncontrolled hypertension), neurologic, endocrine, hepatic,
             gastrointestinal, or kidney disease or therapy that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, would jeopardize the patient's well being by participation in this study
             or is mentally or emotionally unsuitable to participate, or unable/unwilling to comply
             with the study assessments.

          -  Used opiates continuously (including tramadol) for more than ten days in the past
             year.

          -  Hypersensitivity or poor tolerance to ibuprofen or short term opioids.

          -  Currently receiving any medications that are not at a stable dose (the same dose for &gt;
             4 weeks prior to date of surgery).

          -  Was dosed with another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the Screening
             Visit or has previously received treatment with Q8003.

          -  Current therapy with central nervous system depressant medications that might increase
             the risks of treatment with opioids (other than those used with surgical anesthesia).

          -  Current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than 4 units of alcohol per
             day; 1 unit = ½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit).
