  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has not been any systemic therapy approved in the United States or in Europe for
      treating advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer (EC). This study will evaluate the safety
      and preliminary efficacy of XL147 in advanced or recurrent EC.

      Constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/phosphatase and tensin homolog on
      chromosome 10 (PTEN) pathway signaling is common in EC and involved in the development and/or
      progression of the disease. PTEN deficiency and/or activating mutations/amplification in the
      PIK3CA gene that encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K have been frequently detected in
      EC patients. XL147 is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the Class I PI3K family of
      lipid kinases. In addition, in vivo preclinical data have demonstrated that XL147 targets
      both proximal and distal signaling in the PI3K/PTEN pathway. Therefore, XL147 may have
      utility in the treatment of subjects with advanced or recurrent EC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a histologically confirmed diagnosis of EC (endometrioid, serous,
             clear cell adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma, or mixed histology, any grade)
             that is advanced (ie, persistent, locally advanced) or recurrent, and is incurable by
             standard therapies and has received one platinum based chemotherapy regimen for EC.

          -  The subject is at least 18 years old.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0
             or 1.

          -  The subject has at least one measurable lesion

          -  Tissue samples from archival or fresh tissue, or a tissue block of the subject's tumor

          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function

          -  The subject is capable of understanding the informed consent and complying with the
             protocol and has signed the informed consent document before any study-specific
             screening procedures or evaluations are performed.

          -  Sexually active subjects of childbearing potential and their partners must agree to
             use medically accepted methods of contraception during the course of the study and for
             3 months after discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has previously been treated with a selective PI3K inhibitor, mTOR
             inhibitor, or AKT inhibitor.

          -  The subject has uterine sarcomas (leiomyosarcoma), mixed Mullerian tumors, squamous
             carcinoma of the uterus, and/or adenosarcomas of the uterus.

          -  Certain restrictions on prior treatments apply

          -  The subject has not recovered from toxicity due to prior therapy to Grade ≤ 1 or to
             pre-therapy baseline (excluding alopecia and peripheral neuropathy).

          -  The subject has a known primary brain tumor or brain metastasis.

          -  The subject has any other diagnosis of malignancy or evidence of malignancy (except

             thromboplastin time (PTT) test results at screening that are above 1.3 x the
             laboratory upper limit of normal.

          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent illness

          -  The subject has a baseline corrected QT interval ≥ 470 ms.

          -  The subject is known to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). (Note:
