  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test the hypothesis that, in patients with knee pain due to osteoarthritis
      (OA) who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but still have significant
      knee pain, duloxetine 60 to 120 milligrams (mg) daily for 10 weeks will provide additional
      reduction in pain.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duloxetine has been studied in pain due to osteoarthritis (OA) in 2 previous placebo
      controlled clinical trials. In clinical practice, when nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDs) are ineffective in reducing pain due to OA, clinicians often add a second agent
      without discontinuing NSAIDs. In this study, we will investigate whether adding duloxetine to
      NSAIDs provides additional pain relief and functional improvement in patients with knee pain
      due to OA.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Weekly Mean of the 24-Hour Average Pain Score at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (blinded endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>The weekly mean 24-hour average pain score was calculated from the participant's daily 24-hour average pain ratings using an 11-point numeric rating scale, with scores from 0 (indicating &quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (indicating &quot;the worst possible pain&quot;). The Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline, treatment, investigator (pooled), week, treatment*week, and baseline*week.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) at 8 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks (blinded endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>A scale that measures the participant's perception of improvement at the time of assessment compared with the start of treatment. The score ranges from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). The Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline value of Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S), treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, and treatment*visit.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (blinded endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-administered questionnaire captures elements of pain, stiffness, and physical disability in participants with osteoarthritis of the knee and/or hip. Index has 24 questions (5 on pain, 2 on stiffness, 17 on physical function). Each question uses a 5-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). Pain scores range: 0 to 20. Stiffness scores range: 0 to 8. Physical function scores range: 0 to 68. Higher scores=greater impairment. Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline value, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline value*visit.</description>

Mean interference is the average across the 7 interference items. The Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline value, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline*visit.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 weeks (blinded endpoint)</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S scale evaluates the severity of illness at the time of assessment. The scores range from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). The CGI-S must be administered by a study physician in the presence of the participant or after having been in the presence of the participant. The Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline*visit.</description>

Factor scores range: 0 to 20; high scores=negative mood (positive mood for vigor). Total score=sum of 5 negative factor scores minus vigor score; range: -20=least disturbed to 100=most disturbed. Least Squares Mean estimates adjusted for baseline value, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline value*visit.</description>

          <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index of Osteoarthritis Physical Function Score (WOMAC; Bellamy et al. 1988) is a self-administered, participant-centered health status questionnaire used to capture the elements of pain, stiffness, and physical disability in participants with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and/or hip. The physical function index has 17 questions. Each question uses a 5-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (no difficulty) to 4 (extreme difficulty). Physical function scores range from 0 to 68, where higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>

        <description>Self-administered questionnaire captures elements of pain, stiffness, and physical disability in participants with osteoarthritis of the knee and/or hip. Index has 24 questions (5 on pain, 2 on stiffness, 17 on physical function). Each question uses a 5-point numeric rating scale ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme). Pain scores range: 0 to 20. Stiffness scores range: 0 to 8. Physical function scores range: 0 to 68. Higher scores=greater impairment. Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline value, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline value*visit.</description>

        <description>Measures pain severity and pain interference with function. Severity scores: 0 (no pain) to 10 (severe pain) on each question. Interference scores: 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes) on each question assessing interference of pain in past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life. Mean interference is the average across the 7 interference items. The Least Squares Mean estimates were adjusted for baseline value, treatment, investigator (pooled), visit, treatment*visit, and baseline*visit.</description>
