    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that aspirin or clopidogrel taken twice daily will
      augment their antiplatelet efficacy in patients with an elevated platelet turnover (as
      measured by the proportion of reticulated (young) platelets) compared with once daily dosing.

      1. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily
           dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in inhibiting platelets compared with
           once a day aspirin 81 mg.

        2. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increased
           platelet turnover, a twice daily dosing of aspirin 81 mg will be more effective in
           inhibiting platelets compared with once a day aspirin 81 mg.

        3. To study whether in healthy subjects with an increased platelet turnover, a twice daily
           dosing of aspirin 81 mg and clopidogrel 75 mg will be more effective in inhibiting
           platelets compared with once daily of both aspirin and clopidogrel.

        4. To study whether in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD), increased
           platelet turnover and aspirin resistance, an oral fatty acid (docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
           and eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), 4 gm/day) supplementation will increase the efficacy of
           aspirin by modifying platelet function compared to once a day aspirin 81 mg.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Group A: Healthy subjects aged 18-64 years with no evidence of coronary artery disease
             or any major risk factors for CAD including smoking, diabetes mellitus,
             hyperlipidemia, hypertension and obesity.

          -  Group B: Patients with known CAD aged 18-64 years taking aspirin 81 mg daily as the
             only antiplatelet therapy. Patients should be in stable condition and at least one
             month post myocardial infarction.

          -  Group C: Patients with known stable CAD aged 18-64 years taking aspirin 81 mg and
             clopidogrel 75 mg daily. Patients should be in stable condition and at least one month
             post myocardial infarction.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded if they used NSAID's within one week prior to the study,
             have renal insufficiency, inflammatory disorders such as rheumatologic conditions,
             autoimmune disorders, active infections, malignancy or if they are undergoing
             chemotherapy.

          -  Other exclusion criteria include contraindications to aspirin including active
             bleeding, hypersensitivity, thrombocytopenia (platelet count &lt; 50,000) and anemia
             (hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 gm/dl).

          -  We will also exclude patients with unstable angina and recent (less than a month) CABG
             or PCTA.
