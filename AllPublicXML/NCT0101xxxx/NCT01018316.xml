      The UMOX is a device that has been designed as an alternative to the conventional face mask
      for preoxygenation to be used when an optimal preoxygenation with a facemask is difficult to
      achieve(i.e: when a leak is present. A previous study in our hospital (unpublished data) has
      shown that the UMOX was only as effective as the conventional mask when a nose clip was used
      to prevent the patients from breathing in some air through the nose, thus preventing the
      dilution/contamination of the 100% oxygen delivered.In that study, the verbal indication
      giving to the subjects to breathe through the mouth was better than no indication at all but
      still yielded unsatisfactory results.

      For this reason, the present study was designed to verify the hypothesis that while using the
      UMOX for preoxygenation, the verbal indication of breathing 8 vital capacity breaths added to
      the indication of breathing through the mouth would bring equivalent results -measured by the
      expired fraction of oxygen- as a preoxygenation of normal tidal breathing through a facemask
      during 3 to 5 minutes.

      Preoxygenation was performed with the 60 volunteers placed in the supine position with 100%
      oxygen. All volunteers went though preoxygenation with two techniques: 1) breathing normal
      tidal volumes at a normal respiratory rate for a period of 5 minutes through a tight fitting
      conventional face mask, and 2) eight deep breaths (i.e. vital capacity breaths) through the
      UMOX device with verbal indication to use only the mouth to breathe.
