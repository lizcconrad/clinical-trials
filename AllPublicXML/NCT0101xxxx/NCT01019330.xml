  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac catheterization has traditionally been performed via access to the arterial
      circulation from the femoral artery located in the groin. As an alternative to this approach,
      the radial artery, located in the arm, is gaining wider use in clinical practice. Multiple
      studies have demonstrated that cardiac catheterization via the radial approach has a very low
      complication rate, in the short term. This study is intended to determine if there are any
      differences in the long term complication rate between radial artery cardiac catheterization
      as compared with femoral artery cardiac catheterization.

    <description>The Allen's test checks to make sure that radial and ulnar arteries that supply blood to the hand are not blocked. A pulse oximeter is placed on the index finger of the hand. The subject is asked to make a fist for 10 seconds.At this time, pressure is applied over the ulnar and radial arteries as to occlude (block) both of them. The pulse oximeter reading will begin to fall. Radial arterial pressure is then released. If the artery is patent (working), the pulse oximeter reading will begin to rise.</description>
