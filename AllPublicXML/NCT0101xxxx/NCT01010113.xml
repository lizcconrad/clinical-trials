  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators want to evaluate the satiety of two infant formulas, one
      containing prebiotics and the other containing synbiotics. Rate of weight gain, a proxy
      measurement for the healthy development of an infant, will be assessed in both groups and
      compared to the growth observed in the WHO Child Growth Standards in order to demonstrate non
      inferiority.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growth studies continue to be a centrepiece of clinical evaluation of infant formulas. In
      order to standardize growth, the investigator proposes to calculate the weight-for-age
      Z-score related to the WHO Child Growth Standards. Z-scores express the difference between
      the measurement of an individual and the median value of the reference population as a
      proportion of the SD of the reference population taking into account age and gender.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that infants fed with starter formula with prebiotics and
      probiotics blend and those fed only with probiotics will grow as much as infants in the
      reference growth of WHO.

      Other parameters such as digestive tolerance, frequency of morbidity and microbiota pattern
      will also be investigated.
