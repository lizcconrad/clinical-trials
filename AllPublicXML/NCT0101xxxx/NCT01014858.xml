  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A diagnosis of Parkinson's disease according to UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain
             Bank Criteria. These criteria are in standard use throughout the NHS in the UK and
             were supported by the NICE guidelines.

          2. People with mild dementia associated with PD, where the patient and/or their family
             have become aware of cognitive with or without behavioural symptoms that are causing
             functional impairment. &quot;Dementia&quot; will be defined according to recently published
             Movement Disorder Society Task Force criteria for dementia associated with Parkinson's
             Disease and &quot;operationalised&quot; using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE-R).
             The ACE-R permits some description of the dementia profile and also quantifies global
             impairment. It is increasingly used by clinicians in the UK to identify demented
             subjects, is relatively quick to perform (15 minutes or so), requires no specific
             training and produces a total score (0-100), from which the MMSE (0-30) can also be
             extracted. Participants will have an ACE-R of 88 or less. If this criterion is met,
             subjects will be further assessed using the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2). An
             age- and education-corrected total DRS-2 score of less than 8 but greater than 4
             (corresponding to between the 6th and 28th percentile) will be used to define &quot;mild&quot;
             dementia&quot;.

          3. Community-living and a spouse, close relative or well established carer to accompany
             the subject to act as an informant.

          4. Where relevant, women of child bearing potential must be using adequate contraception
             for duration of study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Dementia that develops within one year of the onset of motor symptoms. The reason for
             this &quot;one year rule&quot; is to specifically exclude participants with Dementia with Lewy
             Bodies (DLB). This exclusion criterion is consistent with recommendations made in the
             Movement Disorder Society Dementia Task Force Diagnostic Criteria and the Third Report
             of the DLB Consortium.

          2. People with such severe motor disability, or who are so impaired in their activities
             of daily living from other aspects of their PD, that it would interfere with cognitive
             and global assessments.

          3. Severe current depressive episode. Low mood may impact upon accurate cognitive
             assessment and major depression is therefore listed as a feature which, when present,
             makes it impossible to reliably diagnose PDD in the Movement disorder Society Task
             Force PDD Criteria. This will be operationalised using the self-completed Beck
             Depression Inventory and a cut-off score of 13, as recommended by a recent Movement
             Disorder Society Task Force report. The BDI score is considered robust in the face of
             mild to moderate cognitive impairment.

          4. Unstable significant medical co-morbidity.

          5. Patient receiving an anticholinergic drug for control of parkinsonian motor symptoms.

          6. Previous exposure to a cholinesterase inhibitor

          7. Presence of a condition that is contraindicative to use of donepezil (including a
             clinically significant cardiac conduction defect found in patient history or from
             screening ECG); see SmPC (Appendix W) for details.

          8. Allergy/hypersensitivity to excipients of donepezil or placebo

          9. Patient receiving the N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist memantine.

         10. Previous neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease. This will apply to only a small
             minority of predominantly younger cases. The main reason for this exclusion relates to
             ongoing uncertainty over the potential confounding effects of deep brain stimulation
             upon both mood and cognition.
