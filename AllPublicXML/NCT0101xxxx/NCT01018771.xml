        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine as indicated by back pain of
             discogenic/degenerative origin with or without leg pain and has one or more of the
             following conditions as documented by Plain X-Rays, CT Scan or MRI Scan:

               -  Modic changes.

               -  High intensity changes in the annulus.

               -  Loss of disc height.

               -  Decreased hydration of the disc.

               -  Canal stenosis with or without Spondylotic slip.

               -  Gross facet joint changes requiring fusion for treatment.

               -  Have documented annular pathology by other means. (e.g. with discography).

          -  Have a preoperative Oswestry Back Disability Score of 30 or more.

          -  Aged 18 to 75 years and skeletally mature at time of surgery.

          -  Have not responded to non-operative treatment (e.g. bed rest, physical therapy,
             medications and/or spinal injections) for a period of six months.

          -  If of childbearing potential, patient is non-pregnant, non-nursing and agrees not to
             become pregnant for one year following surgery.
