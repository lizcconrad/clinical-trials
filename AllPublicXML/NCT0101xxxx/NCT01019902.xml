  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine how maternal Fe status influences placental and neonatal Fe
      status in pregnant adolescents and to assess the impact of the Fe endowment of birth on
      functional outcomes as assessed by auditory brainstem responses within 48 h of delivery in
      neonates born to these adolescents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescents (ages 11-18 y) and their newborns will be eligible to participate if the
             adolescent is carrying a singleton pregnancy, does not have any preexisting medical
             complications (such as HIV-infection, eating disorders, hemoglobinopathies,
             malabsorption diseases, steroid use, substance abuse history, or taking medications
             known to influence iron homeostasis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Individuals with pregnancy induced hypertension or elevated diastolic blood pressure
             (&gt;110) will not be eligible to participate in the study. In addition, adolescents who
             have been previously treated for lead exposure, or those that have been identified as
             having elevated blood lead concentrations during childhood, will be excluded from the
             study.

          -  Data from infants that experience perinatal asphyxia, pathologic neonatal
             hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory disease, antibiotic therapy (aminoglycosides), CNS
             infection, sepsis, congenital or middle or external ear lesions, craniofacial
             anomalies, chromosomal disorders, TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other infections, rubella,
             cytomegalovirus infection and herpes simplex infection) or those that were clinically
             unstable with the first 48 h post-delivery will be excluded from ABR studies. Infants
             born to mothers with positive drug abuse screens at delivery will also be excluded
             from further study (these screens are automatically run among this age group). Infants
             that are identified with hearing deficits at birth using the OAE screening will be
             excluded from the ABR measures.
