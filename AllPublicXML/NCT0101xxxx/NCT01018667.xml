  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ADOPT study is a prospective, nested case-controlled and open label clinical trial. About
      40 centers across China participate in this study with a planned 800 Chinese cases
      enrollment. All patients will receive optimal medical treatment. Patients who have successful
      CRT-P/D implant will be assigned to CRT group. According to the baseline evaluation, matched
      cases will be selected from the enrolled OPT(optimal medical treatment) alone group (Group
      for Selection). After successful match, the cases in Group for Selection enters into
      follow-up and become control group. The unmatched cases in the Group for Selection will be
      removed. If patients agree, after re-evaluation of the baseline situation, she or he may
      enter into Group for Selection again. Since patients know she/he already have a device
      implant and the examiners are aware of the grouping of the patients after seeing the incision
      scar and post-implant electrocardiogram, this study is open-label designed, however the
      executive committee will be kept blind when making event-adjudication. Prospectively defined
      primary end points for the study include combined all-cause mortality and hospitalizations. A
      variety of secondary end points will further define the efficacy and mechanism(s) of action
      of cardiac resynchronization in heart failure. The last date of the study shall be the day
      after 24 months of follow-up of the last enrolled patient. All cases collection complete in
      2010 and study result will be reported in 2012.

        About eight hundred patients will be enrolled in this study at more than 40 centers in the
        China. To participate in the study, patients must meet the Guideline for cardiac
        resynchronization therapy in patients with chronic heart failure in China.
