  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of laparoscopic (&quot;minimally invasive&quot; or &quot;keyhole&quot;) surgery for gallbladder
      removal (cholecystectomy) over open surgical procedures in terms of significant reductions in
      pain, scarring and recovery time are well accepted. In a conventional laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy however, the excised gallbladder still has to be extracted through the
      abdominal wall skin via a laparoscopic port site using an incision of 10mm or greater.
      Despite being much smaller than that required for open surgery, this incision is painful,
      leaves a scar and can result in a port site hernia to follow requiring further surgery to
      repair it. Recent attempts to further reduce the invasiveness of the surgical procedure have
      suggested performing the operation via an endoscope passed through the mouth and through an
      incision in the stomach wall - so called Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery
      (NOTES). Unlike a skin incision, an incision in the wall of the stomach (gastrotomy) should
      give no pain, visible scar or herniation risk yet still allow access to the peritoneal cavity
      for surgical procedures such as cholecystectomy. Against this, it has the potential risks of
      contamination and leakage of gastric contents into the peritoneal cavity. Whilst the
      limitations of present technology make it very difficult to perform an entire cholecystectomy
      through the stomach wall in patients, endoscopic methods for closing a gastrotomy are
      available that are approved for use in patients (CE marked) and it is hypothesised that
      removing the excised gallbladder through the stomach in this way would avoid the problems of
      extracting it through the abdominal wall described above. Data are required to determine
      whether the extraction of the gallbladder via a gastrotomy rather than through the skin is
      safe, producing smaller scars and a better cosmetic result. A secondary endpoint would be to
      assess possible reductions in pain and recovery from this less invasive approach.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Fit patients, avoiding extremes of age, with uncomplicated gallstone disease requiring
             elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Direct healthcare team deny permission to approach patient for trial.

          -  Patient request / preference.

          -  Age (&lt; 21 or &gt; 65 yrs old).

          -  Co-morbidity (ASA level 3 or above).

          -  BMI &gt; 32.

          -  Complicated gallstone disease (eg bile duct stones/ERCP/pancreatitis).

          -  Gallstones â‰¥ 18 mm size (too large to recover via oesophagus).

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Previous gastric or upper abdominal surgery (alterations in gastric anatomy or
             adhesions preventing safe gastrotomy).
