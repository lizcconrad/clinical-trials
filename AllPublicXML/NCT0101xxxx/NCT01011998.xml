      The aim of this study is to test the effect of the combination of valproate in combination
      with imatinib with an aim of achieving a maximal molecular response as the primary goal.
      Briefly, patients with CML who are taking imatinib and have been found to have a plateau in
      their level of the bcr-abl transcript will be eligible to participate in the study. Valproate
      will then be added to the imatinib, and subsequent bcr-abl transcripts will be monitored to
      see if the addition of valproate produced a further reduction. Patients will be monitored for
      efficacy and toxicity.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients, 18 years of age or older, with a diagnosis of CML.

          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Patients must sign an informed consent.

          -  Patients should have adequate hepatic function with a total bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl and
             SGOT or SGPT &lt; two times the upper limit of normal, and adequate renal function as
             defined by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients with CML in chronic phase on imatinib as first line therapy who fulfill the
             following criteria:

          -  The patient has at least two tests for quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase
             chain reaction (RT-PCR) for bcr-abl (peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate). The
             results of these tests should demonstrate a relative plateau in the effect of imatinib
             on the detected level of the transcript (i.e. there should less than a Â½ log
             difference between the last two values). Note: Patients will be eligible if the more
             recent study is greater than the previous study by any value.

          -  The last two quantitative RT-PCR studies should be at least 3 months apart.

          -  The patient should have received at least 9 months of imatinib since the diagnosis of
             CML.

          -  The patient is tolerating imatinib without any grade 3 or greater toxicity.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers are not eligible for this trial. Patients of child
             bearing potential must use adequate contraception.

          -  Patients may receive no other concurrent chemotherapy or radiation therapy during this
             trial.

          -  Patients with severe medical problems such as uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or
             cardiovascular disease or active infections are not eligible for this trial.

          -  Patients who have a hypersensitivity to valproic acid, derivatives, or any component
             of the formulation. Patients with hepatic disease or significant impairment, or urea
             cycle disorders
