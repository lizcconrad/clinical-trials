      RATIONALE: Specialized radiation therapy, such as proton beam radiotherapy, that delivers a
      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage
      to normal tissue. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving proton beam radiation therapy
      together with cisplatin works in treating patients with stage IB, stage II, stage III, or
      stage IVA cervical cancer and positive lymph nodes.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of proton beam radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer
      and FDG-positive para-aortic lymph nodes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the incidence of acute toxicity of concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy
      in addition to pelvic and para-aortic irradiation using proton radiotherapy with
      intracavitary brachytherapy in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix with pelvic and
      para-aortic nodal involvement as demonstrated by FDG-PET.

      II. To assess late complications from irradiation using proton beam therapy in place of
      conventional photon beam therapy.

      III. To compare the dose distribution to tumor and surrounding normal structures using DVHs
      (Dose Volume Histograms) generated from the proton plan used to treat the patient and the
      photon plan generated for comparison purposes.

      IV. To evaluate whether there is a benefit to concurrent weekly cisplatin chemotherapy in
      addition to pelvic and para-aortic proton beam radiotherapy with intracavitary brachytherapy
      as evidenced by time to local failure, time to distant failure, time to other failures and
      overall survival in patients with carcinoma of the uterine cervix with pelvic and para-aortic
      nodal involvement as demonstrated by FDG-PET.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo CT, MRI, or FDG-PET imaging scans for radiotherapy treatment planning.
      Patients then undergo external proton beam radiotherapy once daily, 5 times per week, for up
      to 9 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin IV once weekly for 6 weeks during radiotherapy.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually for 3 years.
