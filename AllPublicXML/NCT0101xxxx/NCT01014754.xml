  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine any causative or associated factors for
      the development of Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF), Nephrogenic Fibrosing Dermopathy
      (NFD), or related diagnosis. Our primary focus will be on the previous administration of
      gadolinium to these patients, but we will also look at other postulated causes and risk
      factors.

      The secondary objective of this study is to assess tissue gadolinium (Gd) levels in five
      groups of subjects:

        -  Those affected by NSF.

        -  Those with normal kidney function who have undergone a medical imaging procedure using
           Gd-based contrast agent (GBCA) in the 2 years prior to a skin biopsy.

        -  Those with normal kidney function who have never been exposed to GBCA and have had a
           skin biopsy.

        -  Those on dialysis or with eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 who have had a medical imaging
           procedure using GBCA in the 2 years prior to skin biopsy.

        -  Those on dialysis or with eGFR ≤ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 who have never been exposed to GBCA
           and have had skin biopsy.

      We hypothesize that there is a correlation between the administration of Gd-containing agents
      usually associated with MRI procedures and the development of NSF in those with renal failure
      and some other predisposing condition. We also hypothesize that tissue Gd levels in those
      with NSF will be higher than in those who have been exposed to GBCA but do not have NSF. Of
      the two groups without NSF but with exposure to GBCA, we hypothesize that those with kidney
      dysfunction will have higher tissue Gd levels than those with normal kidney function. We
      hypothesize that in the two groups of subjects without exposure to GBCA, there will be no
      detectable levels of Gd, regardless of kidney function status.

        Those with NSF (25). 40 subjects selected through Northwestern University Department of
        Dermatology's existing medical records and pathology specimens. Medical records will be
        reviewed to identify 10 subjects who have had a standard of care skin biopsy in the
        dermatology clinics at Northwestern University and who were exposed to Gadolinium in the 2
        years prior to skin biopsy. Another 10 subjects who have had skin biopsy and who have never
        been exposed to GBCA during a medical imaging procedure will also be identified. Another 10
        subjects on dialysis or with eGFR ≤30 exposed to GBCA in the 2 years prior to skin biopsy
        will be identified. Another group of 10 subjects on dialysis or with eGFR ≤30 who have had
        skin biopsy and who have never been exposed to GBCA during a medical imaging procedure will
        also be identified. Neonatal skin tissue of up to 10 subjects with existing skin tissue
        sample will be sent for analysis.
