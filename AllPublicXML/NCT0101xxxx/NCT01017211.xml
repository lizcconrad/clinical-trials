    <textblock>
      Needle Electromyography (EMG) is an important test used to assess muscle and nerve function,
      but the test can be uncomfortable. It is currently not standard practice to provide any
      pain-relieving intervention for this procedure. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine whether auricular (ear) acupuncture will make EMG testing less painful.
