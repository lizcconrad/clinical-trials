      The purpose of this study is to characterize the posture and respiratory function of
      mouth-breathing children.

      Mouth-breathing children presents changes in stomatognathic system, which results in head
      projection, tension augment in scapular belt muscles and postural adaptations. Although
      thoracic shape and posture can influence ventilatory dynamics, we didn't find studies
      addressing pulmonary function of mouth-breathing children. This was a transversal study,
      designed to analyze the posture of mouth-breathing children, and verify the existence of
      correlation between posture and pulmonary volumes.

        Mouth-breathing children were referred by Pediatrics Service (Federal University of Rio de
        Janeiro) and by School of Dentistry (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), after the
        diagnosis of mouth breathing was confirmed.

        Nasal breathing children were recruited from Tia Ciata Municipal School (Pra√ßa Onze-Rio de
        Janeiro, Brazil).
