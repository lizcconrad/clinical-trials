  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eighty parent-child dyads will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the experimental
      intervention or an active control condition. Subjects assigned to the experimental group will
      participate in 12 home-based intervention sessions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental intervention is manualized, follows an illustrated workbook for parents, and
      uses individualized video-feedback, modeling, and coaching strategies to help parents
      establish play interactions that promote communication. All participants take part in
      comprehensive baseline and post-intervention/post-active control assessments, as well as 6-
      and 12-month follow up assessments. Families in the active control group will also be invited
      to participate in an oral feedback session to discuss the results from these assessments.
      Children's involvement in other forms of intervention will be monitored using a validated
      intervention log so that the moderating effects of these treatments can be examined.

      By targeting parent-child interactions, the current intervention ensures that new child
      behaviors generalize beyond the immediate context of the intervention and are maintained over
      time (Schreibman, 2000). In addition, by involving parents in the treatment of their children
      (e.g., by establishing a daily playtime routine), the current intervention ensures that the
      intervention strategies are implemented with sufficient intensity for causing developmental
      change (National Research Council, 2001).

    <description>The active control involves three 90 minute in-home training sessions. These training sessions will be administered by trained graduate students or a postdoctoral student in a developmental psychology or related field. The active control will follow a standardized treatment manual (Kasari, 2008). This treatment manual was based upon the teacher training workshops created by the Center on the Social and Emotional Foundations for Early Learning. Over the course of the intervention, parent and interventionist cover a hierarchy of intervention topics, aiming to improve the parent's ability to successfully promote the child's social and emotional competency.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The child is between 15 and 30 months of age;

          -  The child scores at least one standard deviation below average on the Social Composite
             Score of the CSBS DP.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The child has been diagnosed with a known medical condition that has been linked to
             either autism or mental retardation (e.g., Fragile X, Tuberous Sclerosis, Cerebral
             Palsy, Hydrocephalus).

          -  The child has a severe visual, hearing, or motor impairment or fragile health
             condition that would prevent him/her from validly participating in the assessment
             procedures.
