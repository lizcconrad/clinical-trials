  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) is employed by the US FDA to categorize drug
      substances into 4 classes and to characterize drugs in terms of aqueous solubility and
      intestinal permeability. The four BCS categories for a drug substance are Class 1, Class 2,
      Class 3, and Class 4. Biopharmaceutical properties of aqueous solubility and intestinal
      permeability with drug product dissolution determine the rate and extent of drug absorption
      from immediate-release (IR) and solid oral dosages forms (e.g. tablets,capsules). Each class
      exhibits information regarding biopharmaceutic properties and bioequivalence. For example,
      Class 1 drugs have the most favorable oral biopharmaceutic properties (high solubility and
      high permeability). With these biopharmaceutic properties for class 1 drugs, results in vivo
      bioequivalence (BE) studies for rapidly dissolving IR solid oral dosage forms the FDA
      provided waivers. This approach alone has resulted in new and generic drugs approved based on
      vitro data alone (i.e. biowaived), with great savings in resources and reduction in
      unnecessary human testing.

      Objectives: 1) The primary objective of this study is to assess whether common excipients
      cause bioinequivalence of Class 3 drugs. 2) The secondary objective is the results of the
      study will contribute towards providing scientific evidence to the FDA for consideration of
      Class 3 drugs for BCS-based biowaivers.

      Hypotheses: The investigators anticipate that common excipients do not cause
      bioinequivalence. 1) Hence, the hypothesize of this study is commonly used excipients in oral
      medications (tablets, capsules) modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug absorption and
      result in bioinequivalence. 2) Alternative hypothesis is that commonly used excipients in
      oral medications (tablets, capsules) do not modulate the rate or extent of Class 3 drug
      absorption and do not result in bioinequivalence.
