        Inclusion Criteria:

        Part A and Part B:

          1. Males or females aged 60 years or older. Females must be surgically sterilized or
             postmenopausal for at least two years. Males must be actively practicing
             double-barrier contraception (condom plus spermicide), unless they have had a
             vasectomy, or their partner(s) meet the above criteria for females.

          2. Voluntarily consent to participate in this study and provide written informed consent
             prior to start of any study-specific procedures.

          3. Be prepared to adhere to the protocol requirements and be willing and able to remain
             in the study unit for the entire duration of the confinement period. They must also be
             willing to return for the End-of-Study Visit one week after the last dosing.

             Part A only:

          4. Subjects must be generally healthy, but may be enrolled with a stable, chronic
             illness, if it is well controlled and does not interfere with the primary objective of
             the study. Subjects may be included with clinical deviations from normal limits in
             medical history, physical examination, vital sign measurements, ECG, or laboratory
             test results that are associated with stable, well controlled chronic illness.
             Subjects with concomitant diseases or using concomitant medication will be allowed to
             participate provided a stable condition and stable treatment for 1 month (30 days)
             prior to administration of the first dose of study medication. Inclusion of each
             subject will be reviewed with the Link Medical Monitor prior to enrollment in the
             trial.

             Part B only:

          5. Subjects with Mild Alzheimer's Disease, as defined by DSM-IV.

          6. Subjects with a score of ≥ 18-26 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

          7. Subjects with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) total score of 0.5 or 1.0 (possible or
             mild dementia).

          8. Subjects with a Rosen-Modified Hachinski Ischemic score of ≤ 4.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Part A and Part B:

          1. Any significant unstable or uncontrolled cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic, hematologic, neurologic, or
             psychiatric disease, as determined by medical history, physical examination or
             laboratory tests.

          2. Subjects who have positive serologic findings for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             antibodies.

          3. Subjects who have received any experimental drugs or devices within 30 days prior to
             dosing or who wish to receive any experimental drug within 30 days after completing
             the study.

          4. Subjects unable to understand the protocol requirements, instructions and study
             related restrictions, the nature, scope and possible consequences of the clinical
             study.
