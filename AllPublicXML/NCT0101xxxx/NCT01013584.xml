    <textblock>
      Vitamin D3 is a vitamin that is an essential component of biological regulating systems in
      humans. Sun exposure is the predominant source of vitamin D3. Previous research has shown
      that vitamin D3 deficiency is common worldwide. It is especially common in northern countries
      with long winters due to inadequate sun exposure during winter. In the US, an estimated 36%
      to 57% of healthy middle-aged to elderly adults have vitamin D3 deficiency. Current research
      indicates that obesity is associated with a low vitamin D3 level.

      Obesity is a known risk factor for vitamin D deficiency. Adequate levels of vitamin D are
      important, not only for bone health, but appear to be important for prevention of certain
      autoimmune diseases, infections and cancers. Current FDA recommendations for vitamin D intake
      do not differentiate between lean and obese people. There are no published studies indicating
      if the 25(OH)D response to a given daily dose of vitamin D is any less in an obese person
      than a normal weight person. The purpose of this study is to characterize the quantitative
      relationship between steady state cholecalciferol input and the resulting serum 25 (OH)D
      concentration in obese subjects. Data obtained in this study will be compared to published
      normative data for non-obese subjects. Recommendations will be provided for optimal treatment
      of vitamin D deficiency in obese men and women.

          -  They will not be on hydrochlorothiazide medications which could cause hypercalcemia.

          -  They will not have diseases causing malabsorption of vitamin D, such as celiac sprue
