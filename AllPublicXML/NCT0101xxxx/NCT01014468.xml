      To report the short term anatomic and visual acuity response after intravitreal injection of
      bevacizumab and ranibizumab in patients with choroidal neovascularization secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration.

    <textblock>
      We conducted a retrospective study of 500 eyes with choroidal neovascularization secondary to
      age-related macular degeneration who were treated with at least two (initial and one month
      after) intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab or 0.5 mg ranibizumab and had a
      follow-up of at least 3 months. Patients underwent Snellen visual acuity testing, optical
      coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and ophthalmoscopic examination at baseline and follow-up
      visits.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 50 years

          -  Active primary or recurrent subfoveal lesion with CNV secondary to AMD

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with any intravitreal drug in the study eye

          -  Prior treatment with verteporfin photodynamic therapy in the study eye

          -  Prior treatment with systemic bevacizumab

          -  Prior treatment with any intravitreal drug or verteporfin photodynamic therapy in the
             nonstudy eye within the 3 moths before the study entry

          -  Laser photocoagulation within 1 month before study entry in the study eye

          -  Previous participation in any clinical trial within 1 month before the entry of the
             study

          -  Subfoveal fibrosis or atrophy in the study eye

          -  CNV in either of the two eye due to causes other than AMD such as histoplasmosis or
             pathological myopia

          -  Retinal pigment epithelial tear involving the macula in the study eye

          -  Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye that could either require
             medical or surgical intervention during the 12 month study period or that could
             contribute to a loss of best corrected visual acuity over the 12 months study period
             (e.g. diabetic retinopathy, cataract, uncontrolled glaucoma). The decision on
             exclusion is to be based on the opinion of the local principal investigator.

          -  Active intraocular inflammation

          -  Vitreous hemorrhage in the study eye
