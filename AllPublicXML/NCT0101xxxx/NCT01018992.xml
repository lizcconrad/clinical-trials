    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis of whether an antagonist at the corticotropin releasing
      factor type 1 (CRF1) receptor (i.e. GSK561679) is superior to placebo in reducing symptoms of
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and common anxiety disorder that follows
      exposure to an overwhelming traumatic event. The majority of patients with PTSD also meet
      criteria for other psychiatric disorders and PTSD is associated with an increased risk for
      suicide attempts.

      PTSD is responsive to psychological and pharmacological treatments, such as selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but response rates rarely exceed 60%, and even fewer
      patients (20-30%) achieve clinical remission. Thus, there is a clear need to develop novel
      and improved therapeutics for PTSD.

      The study is divided into 4 phases:

      Phase 1 (Screening): a 1 week no drug screening period to assess study eligibility.

      Phase 2 (Pre-Treatment Testing Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled into a 1 week
      Testing Phase, which will include neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing as well
      as blood draws and electrocardiogram.

      Phase 3 (Treatment Period): Eligible patients will be enrolled in a two-armed 6-week period
      of double-blind placebo-controlled acute treatment. All subjects who continue to meet
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of two groups: GSK561679 (at a fixed dose of
      350 mg/day) or placebo. Randomization will be performed at a 1:1 ratio into two treatment
      groups. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological testing will be repeated after 5 weeks of
      the double-blind treatment period.

      Phase 4 (Follow-up Period): Safety follow-up visits will be conducted 1 week and 1 month
      after the end of the treatment Phase 3.

    <measure>Efficacy, Measured by Change in the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The CAPS is a semi-structured clinical interview providing a measure of the severity of PTSD symptoms. A severity score is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores for each of the 17 DSM-IV criteria symptoms. The severity of symptoms is rated on a scale from 0-4, where, 0 = Absent, 1 = Mild/subthreshold; 2 = Moderate/ threshold, 3 = Severe/markedly elevated and 4 = Extreme/ incapacitating. Scores may range from 0 (no symptoms) to 136 (severe symptoms). Change is the difference in scores between baseline and 6 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy, Measured by Response Rate of at Least 50% Improvement in CAPS Score at the End of 6 Weeks as Compared to Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants that showed at least a 50% reduction in CAPS scores from their baseline visit at the end of 6 weeks were measured has having a response to the treatment. The CAPS is a semi-structured clinical interview providing a measure of the severity of PTSD symptoms. A severity score is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores for each of the 17 DSM-IV criteria symptoms. Scores may range from 0 (no symptoms) to 136 (severe symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Efficacy, Measured by Change in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 6</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten-item clinician-administered questionnaire used to measure the severity of depressive symptoms in patients with depressive disorders. Higher MADRS score indicates more severe depression, and each item yields a score of 0 to 6. The overall score ranges from 0 to 60. Change is the difference in scores between baseline and 6 weeks.</description>

        <description>The CAPS is a semi-structured clinical interview providing a measure of the severity of PTSD symptoms. A severity score is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores for each of the 17 DSM-IV criteria symptoms. The severity of symptoms is rated on a scale from 0-4, where, 0 = Absent, 1 = Mild/subthreshold; 2 = Moderate/ threshold, 3 = Severe/markedly elevated and 4 = Extreme/ incapacitating. Scores may range from 0 (no symptoms) to 136 (severe symptoms). Change is the difference in scores between baseline and 6 weeks.</description>
