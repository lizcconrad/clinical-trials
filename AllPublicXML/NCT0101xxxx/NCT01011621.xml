  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Topical corticosteroids are largely used in dermatology. The major problem related to their
      use is that the same mechanisms underlying their therapeutic effects (antiinflammatory and
      antiproliferative) may lead to adverse events. Conditions sensitive to corticosteroids
      require formulations with mild to moderate potency while high-potency corticosteroids era
      required in less responsive conditions. The aim of the present study is to compare the safety
      and efficacy of prednisolone acetate 0.5% cream (mild-potency non-fluoridated corticosteroid)
      versus betamethasone valerate 0.1% cream (high-potency fluoridated corticosteroid) in the
      treatment of mild to moderate cortisosensitive dermatosis (atopic dermatitis, contact
      dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis). The study hypothesis is that 0.5%
      prednisolone cream will be as effective as 0.1% betamethasone cream and will be an
      alternative option to treat corticosensitive dermatosis in body areas where the use of
      fluoridated corticosteroids is contraindicated, such as the face.
