      The purpose of this study is to determine whether HF10 is safe and effective in the treatment
      of head and neck cancer or solid tumors with cutaneous and/or superficial lesions.

      This is an open label, non-randomized, multicenter, two-stage, dose escalation Phase I study
      evaluating single and repeated intratumoral injections of the oncolytic virus, HF10, in
      patients with refractory head and neck cancer, or solid tumors with cutaneous and/or
      superficial lesions (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma of the breast, and
      malignant melanoma).

      Stage 1: Stage 1 of the study will investigate dose escalation of a single intratumoral
      injection over the following dose levels: 1 x 10^5 TCID50, 3 x 10^5 TCID50, 1 x 10^6 TCID50,
      and 1 x 10^7 TCID50. In Stage 1, it is planned that 3 patients will be enrolled per single
      dose cohort. Within each single dose cohort, accrual will temporarily be suspended after the
      first patient is entered and the patient will be followed for safety and for viral
      distribution and elimination. The patients in Stage 1 must be seropositive for HSV-1.

      Stage 2: Stage 2 will evaluate repeated intratumoral injections of HF10 at dose levels of 1 x
      10^6 TCID50/dose and 1 x 10^7 TCID50/dose. Three patients will be enrolled in each of the
      repeated dose cohorts. In Stage 2, the first patient treated in each repeated dose cohort
      must be seropositive for HSV-1. Patients in the repeated dose cohort will receive a total of
      four intratumoral injections in the same lesion.

      Following completion of dosing in the repeated dose cohorts, an expansion cohort of three
      additional patients will be treated at the highest tolerated dose level.

             method

          -  The tumor mass to be treated must be non-visceral and adequate for injection (i.e.,
             more than 2 cm away from major vascular structures) and measurement by RECIST.

          -  Patients in Stage 1 must be seropositive for HSV-1.

          -  The first patient enrolled into each cohort in Stage 2 must be seropositive for HSV-1.
