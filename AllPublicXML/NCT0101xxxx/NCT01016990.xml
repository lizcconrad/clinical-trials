      RATIONALE: Valproic acid may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. It may also help cancer cells become more like normal cells, and grow
      and spread more slowly.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well valproic acid works in treating patients
      with previously treated non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine if valproic acid has a response rate of ≥ 20% in patients with previously
           treated relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic
           lymphocytic leukemia.

        -  To determine if treatment with valproic acid leads to measurable levels of histone
           acetylation in peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease diagnosis (indolent non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma [NHL] vs. aggressive NHL and Hodgkin lymphoma). Valproic acid doses are adjusted
      until therapeutic level is achieved.

      Patients receive oral valproic acid daily for 3 weeks. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at
      least 2 courses and up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically. Samples are analyzed for valproic acid levels; and
      hyperacetylation (caused by the valproic acid N-terminals of the histones H3 and H4) via
      western blot.

        DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS:

          -  Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL),
             or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL )

          -  Patient must have evaluable or measurable disease

          -  Have failed prior treatment, as evidenced by 1 of the following:

               -  Aggressive NHL

                    -  Failed at least 1 regimen containing rituximab and CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
                       doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) (unless anthracyclines are
                       contraindicated) in addition to another salvage regimen (unless it is
                       determined by the treating physician that it is to the patient's best
                       interest to receive valproic acid after the first relapse)

               -  Hodgkin lymphoma

                    -  Failed ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) and
                       received salvage chemotherapy with at least 1 salvage combination regimen

                       intolerant to the available therapies or have contraindications for them are
                       eligible for the study)

          -  No CNS involvement by lymphoma
