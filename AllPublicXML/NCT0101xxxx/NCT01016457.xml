    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare glucose control, quality of life and number of
      hypoglycemias in preschool children before and after using a real-time glucosensor. Nocturnal
      hypoglycemia can be missed even when the parents check their children's blood glucose several
      times at night. The investigators hypothesise that nocturnal hypoglycemia can be prevented by
      using the sensor in this age group. As a consequence, quality of life of the families will
      improve. The investigators also hypothesise that diabetes control will improve at 3-6 months
      from the beginning of the study.
