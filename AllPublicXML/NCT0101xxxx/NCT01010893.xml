      To determine the tolerability and immunogenicity of FLUVAL P monovalent influenza vaccine in
      adults and elderly people, with the objective to verify efficacy and tolerability of the
      study drug.

      Primary Objective:

      To assess tolerability/safety (incidence of adverse events) of the study drug. To assess the
      efficacy (immunogenicity) of the study drug by serology testing of blood samples taken at Day
      21‑28 after immunization in groups and age groups.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To assess the long-term safety of the study drug 50-60 days after immunization. To determine
      the tolerability of simultaneous administration of FLUVAL P monovalent pandemic influenza
      vaccine and FLUVAL AB trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine in case of adults and elderly
      people.

      To assess the efficacy of the study drug by optional epidemiological follow-up of the
      participants until the end of the influenza season.

      To assess the immunogenicity of the study drug by optional cross-reactive immunity tests
      performed with non-homologous influenza A and B virus strains.

          -  Documented HIV, HBV or HCV infection;

          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the
             evaluation of the immunoresponse;

          -  Acute febrile respiratory illness within one week prior to vaccination;

          -  Vaccine therapy within 4 weeks prior to vaccination;

          -  Influenza vaccination within 6 months prior to vaccination;

          -  Experimental drug therapy within 1 month prior to vaccination;

          -  Past or current psychiatric disease of the volunteer that upon judgement of the
             investigator may have effect on the objective decision-making of the volunteer;
