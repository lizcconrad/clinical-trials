    <textblock>
      To investigate the effect of an anti-inflammatory therapy consisting of lenalidomide in
      combination with pioglitazone, dexamethasone and metronomic low-dose chemotherapy with
      treosulfan on the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory or progressive
      multiple myeloma(MM).

      Phase I: to determine the lenalidomide dse for the phase II part (5 mg or 10 mg or 15 mg) on
      the basis of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs') in the first 4 weeks of treatment.

      Phase II: to determine

        -  response rate (primary objective)

        -  time to progression (TTP)

        -  time to partial response (TPR)

        -  overall survival (OS)

        -  quality of life

        -  tolerability and safety

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential† must:

               -  Understand that the study medication has a teratogenic risk

                  interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
                  (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug
                  therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea.This applies unless the subject commits to
                  absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are
                  effective methods of contraception*

          -  Implant**

          -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

               -  Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple
                  myeloma, combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was
                  using combined oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above.
                  The increased risk of VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral
                  contraception.

                    -  prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion

             mIU/ml not more than 3 days from the start of study medication once the subject has
             been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This requirement also applies to
             women of childbearing potential who practice complete and continued abstinence.

          -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4 weeks
             after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilization.
             These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the start of next
             treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who
             practice complete and continued abstinence

          -  Male subjects must

               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is pregnant or
                  is of childbearing potential and has no contraception.

               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
                  study drug therapy.

          -  All subjects must

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator † A female subject or a female partner of a male
                  subject is considered to have childbearing potential unless she meets at least
                  one of the following criteria: Age ≥50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1
                  year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing

                  previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or hysterectomy, XY genotype, Turner's
