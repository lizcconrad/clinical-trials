      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracies and the capillary and venous
      comparabilities of five different home glucose monitors; Optium Xceed, Contour Ts, Accu-chek
      Go, One Touch Select and Ez Smart in an adult population.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>None of the subjects had diabetes mellitus or any other metabolic diseases. They were not taking any medicine and they did not have anemia or polycythemia. Also none of the patients had any condition causing hypoxia or any compromise in peripheral circulation.</description>

  <intervention>
    <intervention_type>Drug</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Human insulin</intervention_name>
    <description>The test was performed in the morning after an overnight fasting and the patients remained supine during the procedure. Two intravenous lines in both arms were established before the procedure. Venous blood was obtained for serum glucose before regular insulin (0.1 U/kg ) is injected and 30 and 45 minutes thereafter. If adequate hypoglycemia was not achieved at this period, a second dose of regular insulin (0.05U/kg) was injected intravenously. In subjects who had not reached the aimed hypoglycemia levels, the test was performed in another day with a higher initial insulin dosage (0.2U/kg).</description>
