    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate, in a controlled setting, the long-term
      (up to 24 months) outcome of the self-expanding nitinol rapid-exchange Misago (Terumo) stent
      in TASC A and B iliac lesions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient presenting with a stenotic or occlusive lesion at the iliac arteries suitable
