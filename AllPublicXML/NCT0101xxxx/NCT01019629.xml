      To determine if patients with a deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A are at-risk for cardiac
      complications that commonly occur in the general population

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fabry disease is an X-linked deficiency of alpha-galactosidase A resulting primarily in an
      accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in virtually all organs and systems. The main
      complications of Fabry disease are a 20-fold increased risk of ischemic stroke, cardiac
      disease including cardiomyopathy, atrio-ventricular conduction defects, a wide variety of
      arrhythmias, valvular dysfunction (insufficiency or stenosis) and cardiac vascular disease as
      well as progressive renal failure. Fabry disease cannot be easily diagnosed in patients with
      routine EKGs, echocardiograms or MRIs. Screening non-selected at-risk populations of patients
      with ischemic stroke or cardiac disease for urinary Gb3, alpha-galactosidase A activity and
      GLA gene mutations should enable the identification of patients previously undiagnosed with
      Fabry disease among the general population of patients with heart disease and stroke
