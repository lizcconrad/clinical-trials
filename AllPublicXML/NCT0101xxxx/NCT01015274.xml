  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to develop a non-invasive approach for early
      assessment of which patients are at high risk for future development of skeletal muscle
      atrophy. The investigators hypothesize that the rate constant for the terminal portion of the
      isotope decay curve following ingestion of a single oral dose of deuterated-3-methylhistidine
      (D-3MH) provides an accurate measure of this increased risk and that this rate constant can
      be measured non-invasively from timed spot urine samples.
