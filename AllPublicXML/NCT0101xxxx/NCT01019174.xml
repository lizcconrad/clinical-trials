      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of LEN/low-dose DEX
      and continuous low-dose CY administered orally compared to LEN in combination with low-dose
      DEX and single CY doses IV in patients with relapsed MM.

    <textblock>
      This is an open, randomized, multicenter, phase I/II study with a parallel group design
      investigating an intravenous and an oral CY dosing schedule in combination with LEN and
      low-dose DEX in patients with refractory or relapsed MM. In phase I MTD of CY will be
      determined using a common dose escalation scheme with 3 to 6 patients per dose level. In
      phase II, efficacy and safety of the treatment regimens at the MTD will be investigated in 20
      patients.

          2. Age at least 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent form.

          3. Able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements.

          4. Previously diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on standard criteria and requires
             therapy for primary refractory disease or 1st - 3rd relapse because of progressive
             disease (PD), defined as a 25% increase in M-protein, development of new or worsening
             of existing lytic bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytoma, or hypercalcemia (serum
             calcium &gt; 11.3 mg/dL), or clinical relapse from CR.

          5. At least one measurable disease manifestation defined as follows:

               -  For secretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is defined as any quantifiable
                  serum monoclonal protein value (generally, but not exclusively, &gt; 1g/dL IgG
                  M-protein or &gt; 0.5 g/dL IgA) and, where applicable, urine light-chain excretion
                  of ≥ 200 mg/24 h.

               -  For oligo- or non-secretory multiple myeloma, measurable disease is defined by
                  the presence of soft tissue (not bone) plasmacytomas as determined by clinical
                  examination or applicable radiographs (i.e. MRI, CT-Scan) or a quantifiable
                  plasma cell infiltration of the bone marrow as determined by bone marrow biopsy.

          6. ECOG performance status equal to or less than 2 at time of randomization/registration
             (see Appendix I).

          7. Laboratory test results within these ranges within 1 week prior to
             randomization/registration:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L without the use of colony stimulating
                  factors within 14 days before the laboratory test.

               -  Platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L without transfusion support within 14 days before the
                  laboratory test.

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL (regardless of transfusion support or prior medication with
                  erythropoietin).

               -  Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/minute.

               -  Corrected serum calcium &lt; 14 mg/dL (&lt; 3.5 mmol/L).

          8. Female subjects of childbearing potential must:

               -  Understand that the study medication could have a potential teratogenic risk

               -  Agree to use, and be able to comply with, effective contraception without
                  interruption, 4 weeks before starting study drug, throughout study drug therapy
                  (including dose interruptions) and for 4 weeks after the end of study drug
                  therapy, even if she has amenorrhoea. This applies unless the subject commits to
                  absolute and continued abstinence confirmed on a monthly basis. The following are
                  effective methods of contraception:

                    -  Implant

                    -  Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot

                    -  Tubal sterilisation

                    -  Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be
                       confirmed by two negative semen analyses

                    -  Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e., desogestrel)

             Combined oral contraceptive pills are not recommended. If a subject was using combined
             oral contraception, she must switch to one of the methods above. The increased risk of
             VTE continues for 4 to 6 weeks after stopping combined oral contraception

             Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered at the time of insertion particularly in
             patients with neutropenia due to risk of infection

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of
                  25 mIU/ml not more than 3 days from the start of study medication once the
                  subject has been on effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. This
                  requirement also applies to women of childbearing potential who practice complete
                  and continued abstinence.

               -  Agree to have a medically supervised pregnancy test every 4 weeks including 4
                  weeks after the end of study treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal
                  sterilization. These tests should be performed not more than 3 days before the
                  start of next treatment. This requirement also applies to women of childbearing
                  potential who practice complete and continued abstinence Male subjects must

               -  Agree to use condoms throughout study drug therapy, during any dose interruption
                  and for one week after cessation of study therapy if their partner is of
                  childbearing potential and has no contraception.

               -  Agree not to donate semen during study drug therapy and for one week after end of
                  study drug therapy.

             All subjects must

               -  Agree to abstain from donating blood while taking study drug therapy and for one
                  week following discontinuation of study drug therapy.

               -  Agree not to share study medication with another person and to return all unused
                  study drug to the investigator.

          9. Disease free of prior malignancies for ≥ 5 years with exception of currently treated
             basal cell, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or carcinoma &quot;in situ&quot; of the cervix
             or breast

         10. Able and willing to take heparin (usually low-molecular weight - LMWH) or low
             acetylsalicylic acid (100 mg) daily as prophylactic anticoagulation.

         11. Life-expectancy &gt; 3 months.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Any serious medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that
             would prevent the subject from signing the informed consent form.

          2. Females, who are pregnant, calculate to get pregnant or are breast feeding (Lactating
             females must agree not to breast feed while taking lenalidomide).

          3. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at an unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study.

          4. Patient currently is enrolled in another clinical research study or has been enrolled
             in such a study within 4 weeks before randomization/registration and/or is receiving
