  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine if treatment with ramucirumab causes
      prolongation of the QTc/QT interval in participants with advanced cancer, to assess the
      safety and tolerability of ramucirumab therapy, and to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      characteristics of ramucirumab

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Cycle 3 in QT/Corrected QT (QTc) Interval Prolongation in Participants</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycle 3 (1 cycle=21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>All electrocardiogram (ECG) tests were performed in triplicate prior to ramucirumab treatment. QT is the interval between the Q and T waves and QTc is the QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33 where RR is the interval between 2 R waves. Each participant's mean QT/QTc value was calculated for each ECG test during Cycle 3 and compared to his/her mean pretreatment QT/QTc value. The greatest change from baseline during Cycle 3 was reported. QTc prolongation is defined as a QTc exceeding 10 milliseconds (msec) with a lower 90% confidence interval (CI) exceeding 5 msec at any postdose time points per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines for non-thorough QT studies (ICH 2005; ICH 2008). Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and adjusted for serum concentration.</description>

    <description>Data presented are the number of participants who experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), Grade 3 or higher TEAEs, or adverse events (AEs) leading to discontinuation of treatment that were considered to be related to ramucirumab. A summary of SAEs and other non-serious AEs, regardless of causality, is located in the Reported Adverse Events section.</description>

    <description>Active-control participants (first 16 participants) will receive one dose of moxifloxacin orally 7 days before the first treatment with ramucirumab. All participants will undergo triplicate electrocardiogram (ECG) tests (consisting of three individual ECGs performed consecutively within a period of 4 minutes) and vital signs at various times over the trial period.
For Cycle 1, all participants will also receive 2 infusions of diphenhydramine before ramucirumab therapy (the first infusion is 1 day before therapy and the second infusion is 15 minutes before therapy). For Cycles 2, 3, and 4, all participants will receive diphenhydramine 15 minutes before ramucirumab therapy. For Cycle 5 and beyond, diphenhydramine infusions before ramucirumab therapy are at the investigator's discretion. Ramucirumab [10 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg)] intravenously over 60 minutes, once every 3 weeks for minimum of 9 weeks without a break in between.</description>

Diphenhydramine: For Cycle 1 only, 25 to 50 milligrams (mg) diphenhydramine infused intravenously 1 day before ramucirumab therapy. For Cycles 1, 2, 3, and 4, 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine infused intravenously 15 minutes before ramucirumab therapy. For Cycle 5 and beyond, premedication with diphenhydramine was at the discretion of the investigator. Each participant was administered the same dose of diphenhydramine at all time points.
Moxifloxacin: The first 16 participants enrolled received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg tablet orally by mouth) 1 week prior to being treated with ramucirumab.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline to Cycle 3 in QT/Corrected QT (QTc) Interval Prolongation in Participants</title>
        <description>All electrocardiogram (ECG) tests were performed in triplicate prior to ramucirumab treatment. QT is the interval between the Q and T waves and QTc is the QT corrected for heart rate using Fridericia's formula: QTc = QT/RR^0.33 where RR is the interval between 2 R waves. Each participant's mean QT/QTc value was calculated for each ECG test during Cycle 3 and compared to his/her mean pretreatment QT/QTc value. The greatest change from baseline during Cycle 3 was reported. QTc prolongation is defined as a QTc exceeding 10 milliseconds (msec) with a lower 90% confidence interval (CI) exceeding 5 msec at any postdose time points per the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E14 guidelines for non-thorough QT studies (ICH 2005; ICH 2008). Least squares (LS) mean was calculated using a linear mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) and adjusted for serum concentration.</description>

Diphenhydramine: For Cycle 1 only, 25 to 50 milligrams (mg) diphenhydramine infused intravenously 1 day before ramucirumab therapy.

Moxifloxacin: The first 16 participants enrolled received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg tablet orally by mouth) 1 week prior to being treated with ramucirumab.</description>
