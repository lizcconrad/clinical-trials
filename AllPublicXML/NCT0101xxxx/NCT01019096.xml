  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The three specific aims of this study are 1) to assess the impact of iron status on relative
      differences in absorption of heme and non-heme iron among pregnant women and non-pregnant
      women, 2) to assess the magnitude and the determinants of heme and non-heme iron transfer to
      the fetus over the last trimester of pregnancy, and 3) to characterize relationships between
      placental iron binding proteins with the enrichment of stable iron isotopes in the neonate at
      birth. The investigators hypothesize that there will be up regulation of heme and non-heme
      iron absorption and up regulation of placental iron transport proteins in response to low
      maternal iron stores.

      To measure the absorption of heme and non-heme iron in women, pregnant and non-pregnant women
      will consume a standardized meal of pork (intrinsically labeled with 58Fe) and a second meal
      of non-heme 57Fe (as ferrous sulfate). Two weeks after ingesting these test meals, a blood
      sample will be collected from each women and the amount of heme (58Fe) and non-heme (57Fe)
      iron incorporated into red blood cells will be measured with magnetic sector thermal
      ionization mass spectrometry. Cord blood samples and placental tissue will be obtained at
      delivery to measure how these two forms of dietary iron were transferred across the placenta
      to the fetus. Maternal and neonatal iron status and placental proteins involved in iron
      transport will also be measured. Data from this study will provide information that aims to
      improve human health by better understanding the iron requirements of a population at high
      risk of iron deficiency.

      For non-pregnant subjects 15 mL of blood are collected. For pregnant subjects two 15 mL blood
      samples are collected. The placenta and up to 30 mL of cord blood are also collected at
      delivery.
