      The purpose of this research study is to collect information on problems that patients with
      the novel H1N1 influenza and/or the seasonal influenza experience. Novel H1N1 flu is also
      called the swine flu. Seasonal influenza is also called the regular flu. The purpose of this
      study is to collect information from patients who are infected with either the novel H1N1 or
      the seasonal flu and to determine what makes patients critically ill with these infections.
      The goal is to develop a registry that will aid investigators in determining specific markers
      that lead to development of severe illness in these infections.
