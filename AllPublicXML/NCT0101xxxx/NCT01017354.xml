      This project was designed to optimizing vitamin D status in prefrail seniors age 70+ living
      at home and prevent their functional decline. We test 3 arms of monthly vitamin D
      supplementation. Intermittent dosing will improve adherence and simplify vitamin D
      supplementation.

      We propose a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a

        1. Active I (n=70): monthly high-dose vitamin D3 supplement dose (60'000 IU/month,
           equivalent to 2000 IU daily),

        2. Active II (n=70): or a monthly standard vitamin D3 supplement dose combined with 25(OH)D
           (24'000 IU/month, equivalent to 800 IU daily PLUS 300 mcg 25(OH)D, equivalent to 10 mcg
           per day)

        3. Control (n=70): compared to a standard vitamin D3 supplement dose (24'000 IU/month,
           equivalent to 800 IU daily)

      All individuals will be advised to consume calcium from natural food sources in a daily dose
      of 600-800 mgs a day, including milk products. Maximal intake of supplemental calcium is
      restricted to 250 mg per day.
