      The aim of this project is to investigate the impact of heart failure (HF) on calcium
      homeostasis, mitochondrial function and oxidative stress in human skeletal muscle, before and
      after exercise training. The role playing by circulating factors such as cytokines and
      catecholamines will also be evaluated.

      24 HF patients will be enrolled in the study: 12 class II NYHA HF volunteers with a fraction
      of ejection between 40% and 30 %, and 12 class III NYHA HF volunteers with a fraction of
      ejection lower than 30 %. They will be compared to 24 sedentary healthy volunteers, matched
      on age and physical activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is associated with a skeletal muscle dysfunction, characterized by an
      increased fatigue that does not correlate with impaired myocardial function and physical
      inactivity that is commonly associated with HF. We identified in skeletal muscle of HF rats,
      a dysfunction of type 1 ryanodine receptors (RyR1) similar to that observed on the cardiac
      channel (RyR2), due to an hyperphosphorylation of the RyR and a dissociation of the
      regulatory protein FKBP12. This dysfunction, in addition to mitochondrial impairment,
      contributes in this animal model to the reduced exercise capacity observed during HF. Our
      goal is to analyse the impact of HF on calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial function and
      oxidative stress in human skeletal muscle. This project, performed on muscle biopsies, will
      also allow us to correlate calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function (before and after
      exercise training) to circulating factors (cytokines, catecholamines) susceptible to trigger
      this muscle dysfunction.

      This project addresses two straightforward questions about physiopathological mechanisms
      involved in skeletal muscle dysfunction during HF. To this aim we have built locally a
      network of laboratories and clinical services, used to work together, composed of two
      services of the University Hospital of Montpellier (Dept. of Cardiology and Dept of Clinical
      Physiology), an Inserm unit (U637, team 2) all interfaced by an another Inserm facility: the
      Clinical Investigation Center (CIC) of Montpellier. In this project we will focus on the
      dilated post-ischemic cardiomyopathy and compare two groups of patients under similar
      treatments studied at different stages of HF defined by the NYHA. The first patients (class
      II of NYHA) with a fraction of ejection between 40% and 30 % will be compared with patients
      (class III) with an ejection fraction lower than 30% (12 males, 35-65 years old per HF). 24
      voluntary healthy sedentary individuals carefully selected for similar level of activity as
      for patients will be matched to the HF groups. All individuals will undergo cardiovascular
      explorations (ECG and echocardiography, blood test) at the inclusion. They will perform an
      exercise testing to evaluate their exercise capacity. A muscle biopsy will be performed 4
      days after the exercise testing to assess the mitochondrial function and the Ca2+
      homeostasis. After a rest period of 5 days, HF patients will perform a resistance-training
      program (3 times per week for 10 weeks). A 2nd cardiovascular explorations, exercise testing
      and muscle biopsy will then be performed to evaluate the beneficial effect of training.
      Mitochondrial function will be measured by oxygraphy and ATP production. Ca2+ homeostasis
      will be evaluated by confocal microscopy by recording spontaneous Ca2+ release events (i.e.
      RyR activity). Mitochondrial and RyR biochemical analysis will complete these functional
      studies as well as circulating factors (cytokines, catecholamine) and their associated
      receptors.

      This project will allow us to characterize the behaviour of RyR in relation with
      mitochondrial function in human skeletal muscle during HF and identify beneficial effects of
      exercise training routinely proposed to HF patients. The analysis of circulating factors will
      allow us to establish a relation of cause and effect between myocardial dysfunction and
      muscle dysfunction. This project could thus open important perspectives in therapeutic.
      Compounds analogues to JTV-519, acting in stabilizing RyR channels, could be prescribed as a
      potent medication for HF. This project could thus be determinant in the comprehension of the
      regulation of Ca2+ and energetic metabolism in human skeletal muscle which could be an
      appropriate model to evaluate the effects of new pharmacological agents.
