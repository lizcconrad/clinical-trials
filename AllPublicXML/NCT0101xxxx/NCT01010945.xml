  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1b study to evaluate the combination of gemcitabine and Tarceva (erlotinib)
      and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase 1b study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      combination of erlotinib (daily), gemcitabine (weekly), nab-paclitaxel (weekly) in patients
      with advanced pancreatic cancer.
