      The purpose of this study was to compare the reading film subtitles skills in students aged
      2nd and 4th grade of elementary school (EF) from a public school, and relate the performance
      of literacy in school with reading film subtitles.

      Proceedings: The study included 30 students from 2nd and 30 from 4th grade of a public school
      at Sao Paulo. The participants' ages ranged from 7 years and 8 months to 9 years and 3 months
      in the 2nd grade, and 9 years and 9 months to 11 years and one month in the 4th grade. The
      groups were matched for the genre.

      Inclusion criteria: sign a consent to search, be literate, do not have any sensory changes,
      and never repeated a grade. Each subject, individually, was rated about the level of literacy
      and reading through the protocol of school literacy; and about reading film subtitles
      skills.Each subject recounted what he understood and responded to five inferential questions
      about the movie.The recount was analyzed and scored on a specific protocol based on Castillo
      (1999).Students could score in four levels: decoding, literal comprehension, comprehension
      independent and critical reading.
