    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      medication), safety and tolerability of TMC207 and its N-monodesmethyl metabolite (M2) in
      healthy participants and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment after administration of
      a single 400 mg dose of TMC207.

      This is a Phase I, open label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study of
      TMC207. The study consists of a screening period and a 4-weeks treatment period. Sixteen
      participants will be enrolled in two panels. Panel A will include 8 patients of moderate
      hepatic impairment and Panel B will include 8 healthy participants. Safety evaluations
      including adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and
      physical examination will be monitored throughout the study. The entire study duration for
      each participant will be approximately 7 weeks.
