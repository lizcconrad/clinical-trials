      The purpose of this study is to confirm or confute the hypothesis that in patients treated
      with primary pci is not always possible to collect an adequate medical history, the
      investigators created a clinical registry in which the investigators collect current or
      previous medical history relevant to DES utilization , in two distinct times.

      GHOST Registry

      Use of drug-eluting stent (DES) in STEMI is sometimes limited, by the concern that adequate
      information, relating to the current or previous medical history, can not be obtained due to
      the patient's critical condition. A less than adequate medical history would expose patients
      treated with DES to a particular risk in case that an absolute or relative contraindication
      to the required long-term double antiplatelet therapy is not fully elucidated before DES
      implantation.

      To confirm or confute the hypothesis that in patients treated with primary pci is not always
      possible to collect an adequate medical history, we created a clinical registry in which we
      collect current or previous medical history relevant to DES utilization , in two distinct
      times:

      Time zero in which the medical history collection is taken in the cath-lab during the primary
      pci

      Time one in which the second medical history collection is taken 4 days after the index
      procedure when the patient clinical conditions no longer impede an adequate medical history
      collection.
