      Conventional treatments include the use of steroids applied locally, or injection in to the
      legion, or oral therapy.

      Treatment is determined by the severity of the disease.

      Injection in to the legion can be done in two methods

        1. Subcutaneous injection syringe Lower

        2. Using syringe DERMOJET - a syringe without a needle. So far there are no publications in
           the medical literature of studies comparing efficacy, safety, convenience of use for
           doctor-patient, of both methods.
