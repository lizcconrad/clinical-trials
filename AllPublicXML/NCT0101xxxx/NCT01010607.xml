  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb paralysis following stroke is a very common problem. Only 30% of stroke patients
      who suffer from upper limb paresis experience a full recovery of function. There is a need
      for the development of more efficient rehabilitation methods for the improvement of the
      paralysed upper limb function.

      It has been shown that the use of mirror therapy after a stroke induces the activation of
      motor, sensory and associative regions in the affected hemisphere and is associated with an
      improvement in the function of the affected limb. Mirror therapy is a treatment modality in
      which the affected arm is hidden from the patient's sight; the patient is instructed to watch
      the reflection of his healthy hand on a mirror while he performs movements with his healthy
      hand and tries to move simultaneously his affected hand. This induces the illusion that his
      affected hand moves well.

      It has also been shown that applying vibration to a muscle tendon at frequencies between
      50-100 Hz induces an illusion of elongation of the vibrated muscle, if visual feedback is
      prevented. For instance, vibrating the triceps will induce a strong illusion of elbow
      flexion.

      In the present study the investigators will couple the use of a mirror with the application
      of vibration to tendons, in order to obtain a multisensorial and strong illusion of movement
      in the paralyzed limb.

      The study hypothesis is that the administration of mirror therapy together with vibration
      will induce the activation of multiple motor, sensory and associative areas in the affected
      brain hemisphere, resulting in improvement of the affected upper limb function, compared to
      the administration of mirror therapy alone or sham therapy.

    <description>10 treatments of 30 minutes in which vibration of 50-100 Hz will be administrated to the elbow and wrist muscles together with the use of a mirror. The patient moves his healthy hand in a certain repetitive pattern and watches its reflection on a mirror. Meanwhile he receives vibration in his affected hand in a timing that induces the illusion of movements similar to the movements of his healthy hand, thereby inducing a strong illusion of movement of his affected hand.</description>
