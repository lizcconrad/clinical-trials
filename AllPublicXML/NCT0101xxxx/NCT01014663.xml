      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a non-traditional boxing
      training program to a traditional therapeutic exercise program on activity and participation
      outcomes in persons with Parkinson's disease. Thirty participants will be randomly assigned
      to participate in either non-contact boxing training or traditional therapeutic exercise for
      36 sessions over 12 weeks. Participants will be measured immediately before (pre-test) and
      after (post-test) the intervention.

      Physical therapists commonly treat patients with Parkinson's disease. Typical clinical
      interventions used by physical therapists including strengthening, stretching and aerobic
      training have been shown to improve function and quality of life of persons with Parkinson's
      disease. Alternative exercise interventions that incorporate non-traditional concepts, such
      as tango dance, tai chi and taiji have also been found to lead to improvements in function in
      persons with Parkinson's disease. It is important that comparisons between different types of
      exercise programs for persons with Parkinson's disease be explored in order to determine
      effective options for care.

      Here in Indianapolis, Indiana, individuals with Parkinson's disease have a unique opportunity
      for alternative exercise with the recent development of the popular non-contact boxing
      training program offered by the Rock Steady Boxing Foundation. Therefore, the purpose of this
      study is to compare the effects of the non-traditional boxing training program to a
      traditional therapeutic exercise program on activity and participation outcomes in persons
      with Parkinson's disease.

      Thirty participants with Parkinson's disease will be recruited from Central Indiana. All
      potential participants will be screened to determine eligibility for the study. Participants
      who are eligible and give consent will be randomly assigned to participate in either the
      non-contact boxing training or the traditional therapeutic exercise program for 36 sessions
      lasting over 12 weeks with 60-90 minutes of exercise each session. Participants will be
      measured immediately before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the intervention period.
