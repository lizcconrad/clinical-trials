      Objectives and perspective:

        1. To estimate the prevalence of hand eczema in a cohort of health care workers and assess
           exposures in the hospital environment that can lead to hand eczema . To investigate the
           knowledge of skin protection among health care workers.

        2. To classify subtypes of hand eczema, assess severity of hand eczema and quality of life
           in health care workers with hand eczema

        3. To evaluate the effect of a combination of classification of hand eczema and individual
           work-related counseling in skin protective behavior.

      The overall perspective of the trial is to develop new strategies for prevention of
      occupational hand eczema in health care workers.

      Hypotheses:

        -  Irritant contact dermatitis is more common than allergic contact dermatitis.

        -  The combination of precise classification (subtyping of HE) and individual counseling
           will have a positive impact on the prognosis of hand eczema.

        -  The positive impact on the prognosis of hand eczema will have a positive impact on
           quality of life (QoL).

        -  The knowledge of protective behavior will increase.

        -  Education in a skin care program will have a positive impact on skin protective
           behavior.

    <description>The trial to be conducted is a randomised single-blinded parallel study. It is divided in two stages, T = 0 and follow-up at T = 6 months. All included participants will have a clinical examination at the beginning and at follow-up in the trial. Half of the participants will be randomised to intervention, the other half to control. The participants in the intervention group will, after the first clinical examination, pass on directly to the intervention which includes an allergological examination (patch and prick testing). Three days later they will be examined by a physician who will interpret the patch test and give a thorough, individual guidance in skin protection and occupational safety. The clinical examination of all participants at follow-up will reveal the difference in outcomes in the intervention and the control group.</description>

             who have answered &quot;yes&quot; to the validated question &quot;Have you had hand eczema within the
             past twelve months?&quot; will be invited to take part in the clinical trial.

          -  Informed written consent must be present in order to participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy
