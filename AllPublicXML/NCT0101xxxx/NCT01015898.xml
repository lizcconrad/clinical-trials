      Background and Aim: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer .Photodynamic
      therapy _as a novel , non-invasive therapeutic approach _may be considered a valuable
      strategy. This study was designed with the aim of the evaluation of efficacy of PDT in
      treatment of BCC and factors that may affect response rate.

      Materials and Methods: This was a clinical trial which was done on 28 BCCs. Patients were
      treated with ALA-PDT monthly for 1-6 sessions and evaluated for clinical response,cosmetic
      results and probable side effects.
