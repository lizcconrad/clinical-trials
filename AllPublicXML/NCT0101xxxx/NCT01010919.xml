  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracts of chicory root have anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal models of
      arthritis. The primary objective of this investigator-initiated, Phase 1, placebo-controlled,
      double blind, dose-escalating trial is to determine the safety and tolerability of a
      proprietary bioactive extract of chicory root in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Secondary
      objectives are to assess effects on the signs and symptoms of this disorder. Individuals
      greater than 50 years of age with OA of the hip or knee will be eligible for trial entry.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must be 50 years of age or older and may be of either gender.

          2. Patients must have have an imaging-confirmed (radiograph or MRI) diagnosis of OA of
             the hip or knee.

          3. Patients must not have taken a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication for at least
             7 days prior to the baseline visit (a single daily aspirin 325 mg or less is allowed
             throughout the study).

          4. Patients must be able and willing to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any unstable comorbid medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator could
             interfere with the ability of the patient to complete the study.

          2. Patients who are unable to ambulate and require a wheelchair due to the severity of
             the arthritis are excluded. Ambulatory aids such as canes and walkers are acceptable.

          3. Patients requiring continuing therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are
             excluded.

          4. Patients requiring any dose of glucocorticoids within the past 30 days are excluded.
