  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several recent trials (1,2) suggest that all STEMI patients receiving fibrinolysis in non-PCI
      centres should be routinely transferred for elective early PCI within 24 hours from
      hospitalization, with no additive risk of major bleeding complications or other severe
      adverse events compared standard therapy. These results in favour of a routine invasive
      strategy in STEMI patients suggest a potential change to the current approach of awaiting the
      response to treatment in patients receiving fibrinolysis, and draw the attention to the
      potential need for an appropriate network organization with adequate first hospitalization
      treatment (spoke) and prompt transfer to centres with 24/7 PCI capabilities (hub). The recent
      ESC (3) and ACC (4) guidelines on STEMI are consistent with the early ESC PCI Guidelines,
      recommending that angioplasty after fibrinolysis should be performed within a time-window
      ranging between 3 and 24 hours after successful lytic administration (level evidence IIA).
      The reason for the weighting of the recommendation is due to the heterogeneity of trial
      results with different planned-revascularization strategies, variable primary end-points
      definitions, and small individual trial sample sizes. Therefore, a consistent analysis of
      single patient dataset from all published randomized trials would be of value to better
      define the magnitude and duration of clinical benefit of the routine invasive strategy after
      lytic treatment as well as the potential optimal timing of such a strategy.

      The main aim of the OTTER meta-analysis is to define the benefits of immediate PCI after
      fibrinolysis for STEMI patients. Moreover, the OTTER meta-analysis will investigate the
      optimal timing of post-fibrinolysis elective revascularization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All published randomized controlled trials that compared a routine invasive strategy with
      early PCI and a standard therapy in STEMI patients after fibrinolysis will be included in
      this analysis.

      We will exclude all non-randomized trials, randomized studies if the individual patient data
      will not be available for analysis, randomized studies in which angioplasty was mainly
      performed without stenting (&lt;80% stenting population) and in which the type of lytic therapy
      was different from modern fibrin-specific agents. Two investigators independently will
      evaluate studies for possible inclusion. The quality of searched trials will be evaluated
      based on the 5-point scale outlined by Jadad et al (5), with criteria for randomization with
      proper concealment of the allocation sequence, blinding of the patient and investigators to
      treatment allocation with description of the blinding method, and completeness of follow-up.

      Recruitment:

      An electronic database will be compiled consisting of data from each single patient of all
      enrolled trials, according to the guidelines for the performance of individual patient
      meta-analysis.(6-7-8). The database will include demographic data and baseline
      characteristics. Attention will be paid to clinical complications during transfer for early
      PCI and to the precise calculation of the following times-window: from symptoms onset to
      lytic therapy, from lytic therapy to early or rescue PCI, from randomization to all adverse
      events as defined below. Data will be checked for completeness and for consistency with
      published reports. Two investigators independently will extract all data, with disagreements
      resolved in consultation with a third investigator.

      End-points

      The following end-points will be investigated:

      Primary End Point: Combined death/reinfarction at 30 days.

      Secondary end-points:

        -  Death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia and urgent revascularization at 30 days.

        -  Combined death/reinfarction/recurrent ischemia/urgent revascularization and new
           presentation CHF and shock at 30 days.

        -  Major bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke at 30 days.

        -  Combined death/reinfarction and combined revascularization/recurrent ischemia at 6-12
           months.

      Secondary analysis will also investigate the influence of the timing of post-thrombolysis
      early revascularization on the above considered events.

      Investigators: The study is coordinated by Prof. C. Di Mario. An executive committee composed
      of the Principle Investigators of the enrolled trials will overview the quality of data
      collected (OTTER Investigators). No publication will be sent without written consent of all
      the PIs of the individual trials. Statistical analysis will be performed at the Royal
      Brompton Hospital (London) and the Canadian Heart Research Centre (Toronto, Ontario, Canada).
