    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerance by comparing pharmacokinetic
      characteristics between the CKD-4101 tablet and Mycophenolate mofetil capsule when
      administered alone to healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated single-dose over the period I and II (Crossover) of
      CKD-4101 1000mg and Mycophenolate mofetil capsule 1000mg.

      Every time before and after each medication, PK parameters and safety of CKD-4101 tablet and
      Mycophenolate mofetil capsule is performed using a blood sample and conducting some tests
      respectively.
