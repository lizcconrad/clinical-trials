  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid tumours contain varying degrees of hypoxia. Studies show hypoxia to be associated with
      poor local control and survival, as hypoxia is a cause of resistance to radio- and
      chemotherapy and the development of a more aggressive tumour.

      Previous attempts to measure hypoxia have been biased because the techniques have been
      invasive, not repeatable or difficult to apply on a routine basis. There is great interest in
      trying to measure hypoxia in tumours as this could lead to individualized hypoxia-modifying
      therapy and prediction of treatment response. Additionally the investigators' knowledge of
      change in hypoxia over time is limited, but of great interest as individualised treatment,
      such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is emerging.

      18F-FAZA, appears promising. It is a nitroimidazole, which gets trapped in hypoxic cells and
      can be detected by a positron emission therapy (PET) scan. Compared to other nitroimidazoles,
      18F-FAZA has superior biokinetics and thereby is believed to provide a faster and clearer
      image of hypoxia.

      The investigators' hypothesis is that 18F-FAZA can be used as a prognostic marker in HNSCC.
