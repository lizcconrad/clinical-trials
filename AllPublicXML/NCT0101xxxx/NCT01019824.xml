    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to determine if an experimental drug, ralfinamide, relieves your
      neuropathic low back pain, and if it demonstrates superiority to placebo, a &quot;dummy&quot; or sugar
      pill that contains no active medication. Ralfinamide, given as either 160 mg/day or 320
      mg/day, taken in a divided dose twice-a-day, will be compared with placebo. If you are
      randomly (by chance) selected to receive placebo, you will receive this medication throughout
      the treatment period of the study. Data from this study will provide essential information
      for choosing the doses of ralfinamide to be used in the treatment of this type of pain and
      potentially other types of pain.

      Ralfinamide has been shown to be an effective analgesic in a number of animal models of
      neuropathic pain. These observed effects of ralfinamide may have been achieved by targeting
      both hyperactivity of peripheral sensory neurons, through voltage-dependent, Na+-channel
      blockade [Stummann et al., 2005] and Ca++-channel blockade, and sensitization of central
      neurons, through NMDA-receptor modulation.

      Evidence of efficacy in mixed peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes has been demonstrated in
      Study 001 [Anand et al., 2008]. In particular patients with neuropathic pain due to nerve
      compression (e.g., compression radiculopathy, lumbar spinal stenosis, sciatic nerve
      compression, spinal root compression, intercostal neuralgia) showed response to ralfinamide
      treatment. In this sub-population, statistically significant improvements in severity of
      pain, as measured on the VAS and 11-point Likert scales, as well as a greater proportion of
      patients meeting &quot;responder&quot; criteria, compared to the placebo group, were noted with
      ralfinamide treatment. Similarly, patients in the study classified as having neuropathic low
      back pain also showed significant benefit from treatment with ralfinamide; therefore, the
      focus of the current study is on this indication.

      The current study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and analgesic efficacy of
      ralfinamide in patients with chronic neuropathic low back pain due to nerve compression,
      i.e., compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical lumbar radiculopathy. It
      should also be noted that no current drug therapy has global regulatory approval for treating
      this type of chronic neuropathic low back pain; therefore, should ralfinamide prove effective
      in this patient population, it would be satisfying an unmet medical need.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             enrolment into the study:

               1. Patient presents in the physical/neurological examination with low back pain with
                  or without radiation into the lower limb that must display a topography
                  compatible with the L1 to S1 territory and/or respective sensory or motoric
                  impairments.

               2. Patient must have chronic neuropathic low back pain with a minimum intensity of
                  &quot;40 mm&quot; (moderate) or greater on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS; 100-mm) at
                  screening, and an average of &quot;40 mm&quot; or more at baseline (based on prior 7 days).

               3. The onset of pain has occurred at least three months, but not longer than 3
                  years, prior to the screening visit, as assessed by the investigator in the
                  patient's medical history.

               4. Patient is affected by current neuropathic pain (pain provoked by a lesion of the
                  peripheral nervous system). The diagnosis should be made by a
                  neurologist/anaesthesiologist/pain specialist and based on history, clinical
                  evaluation and/or laboratory findings (rule out systemic cause, e.g.,
                  hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, nephropathy, diabetes [MNSI score &gt;2]) in
                  accordance with the taxonomy of the diagnostic criteria documented in the
                  International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Classification of Chronic
                  Pain. A neurological disease must be directly correlated with pain, including
                  pain due to spinal root compression.

                  If radiologic data supporting the diagnosis had been obtained previously it
                  should be documented in the patient's records. In case radiologic examinations
                  are not available, the Investigator should consider performing these
                  examinations, if necessary to support the diagnosis, during the screening phase.

               5. Patient has one of the following causes of neuropathic low back pain: Non-cancer
                  lumbar pain due to compression radiculopathy or post-traumatic/post-surgical
                  lumbar radiculopathy.

               6. Patient's low back pain has a clear neuropathic component, as indicated by a
                  rating on the Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q) of greater than 18.

               7. Patient is 18-85 years of age, inclusive.

               8. Patient is willing and able to understand and sign an approved Informed Consent
                  Form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Females who are pregnant or lactating, or of childbearing potential, defined as
             follows: surgically sterilized for less than one year; aged ≥ 50 years and
             post-menopausal condition started less than 24 months prior to the screening visit; or
             aged &lt; 50 years and post-menopausal condition started less than 24 months prior,
             and/or post-menopausal status has not been confirmed by determination of the serum
             levels of FSH and 17-β estradiol; or fecund and not practicing double contraception
             method (e.g., hormonal contraceptive plus barrier method).

             2. Patients with any other cause of peripheral or central neuropathic pain (including
             psychogenic and nociceptive pain), pain due to metabolic (including diabetes; MNSI
             score &gt; 2) infectious or proliferative diseases, or pain due to any condition that is
             as severe as the neuropathic pain.

             3. Patients with a history of migrating pain and former mononeuropathy or neuralgias
             in other anatomical territories.

             4. Patients with severe trophic changes, severe swelling, joint deformities or stiff
             joint with limited passive movement, or patients who may be candidates for back
             surgery within 52 weeks after baseline.

             5. History or current diagnosis of positive test for Hepatitis B or C (unless
             vaccinated).

             6. Clinically significant, uncontrolled gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine,
             pulmonary or cardiovascular disease (including non well-controlled hypertension),
