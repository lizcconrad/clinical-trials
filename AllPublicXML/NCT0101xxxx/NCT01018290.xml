    <textblock>
      Maximizing surgical removal of brain tumors while minimizing neurologic deficits is
      challenging. Functional brain tissue may reside close to or even within the abnormality, and
      inadvertent removal or disturbance of such areas can result in neurologic deficits. At
      present, the gold standard for identifying critical motor areas in tumor surgery is
      intraoperative invasive direct current stimulation (DCS) through a handpiece. More recently,
      new non-invasive preoperative method for brain mapping, functional magnetic resonance imaging
      (fMRI), may be used to identify the eloquent motor areas. fMRI signals used in localization
      of the motor areas are generated when the brain is activated during the performance of
      specific motor tasks. However, as fMRI signals are also generated by sensory input, the
      resulting fMRI map may include sensory as well as motor areas.

      Nexstim has developed a Navigated Brain Stimulation (NBS) system that uses TMS with a
      software based Navigational System that together may have more specific spatial accuracy.

      This study aims to determine whether navigated TMS is able to identify the eloquent motor
      cortical areas in patients with brain tumors and to determine the clinical accuracy of the
      procedure by comparing it to results obtained by intraoperative DCS and fMRI.
