    <textblock>
      The purpose of study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of lacrimal silicone
      intubation for the management of epiphora.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epiphora is an overflow of tears,usually caused by insufficient drainage of the tear film
      from the eye.The most common cause is a blockage of the lacrimal ducts located next to the
      nose, but the condition may also result from the excessive production of tears. Epiphora is a
      symptom rather than a disease and may be caused by a variety of conditions.

      30 subjects will be recruited for this study, informed consent will be taken from the willing
      subjects. Complete ophthalmic evaluation would be performed including visual acuity.
      Diagnosis would be made on history of epiphora, regurgitation test, lids examination, nasal
      examination, probing and syringing. Standard procedure of Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) would
      be adopted in all cases with lacrimal intubation.

      Syringing will be done on first follow up visit and skin sutures will also be removed.
      Tightness and mobility of the silicone tube will be checked. The tube is kept in place for
      3-6 months according to need and then finally removed. The patency of lacrimal passage will
      be investigated by irrigation. A successful outcome will be defined as resolution of symptoms
      like epiphora and discharge and a patent lacrimal system on irrigation.
