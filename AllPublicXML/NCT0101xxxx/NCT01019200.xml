  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis patients are known to be at increased risk for heart disease. This may be due to
      the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors in this population, including
      high blood pressure, diabetes, obesity, and high cholesterol. Although cholesterol levels are
      known to be altered in psoriasis, most studies have used standard lipid profiles to measure
      cholesterol. These tests indirectly measure LDL (bad cholesterol) and become less accurate
      when triglyceride levels are high, as often see in individuals with psoriasis. We have
      designed a case-control study that uses a more specific and detailed cholesterol test to
      measure serum lipid levels in psoriasis patients, allowing for more accurate determination of
      LDL and better assessment of the lipid-contribution to cardiovascular risk. We will also
      measure other markers of inflammation that may contribute to cardiovascular disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults of both sexes from our dermatology clinic, between the age 18 and 80 years who
             wish to participate voluntarily in the study and who have signed a written informed
             consent form to participate. Cases will have a diagnosis of psoriasis as diagnosed by
             our principal investigator, while controls will be selected from the same dermatology
             clinic.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or past use (within 6-8 weeks) of anti-hyperlipidemic agents (statins,
             fibrates, neomycin, niacin, ezetimibe) and/or any other medications significantly
             affecting lipid metabolism, including cyclosporine, acitretin, protease inhibitors,
             tamoxifen, clozapine, and estrogen replacement therapy.

          -  Presence of secondary causes of hyperlipidemia including diabetes mellitus, smoking,
             untreated hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and cholestatic
             liver disease (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis).

          -  History of cardiovascular disease (e.g. previous myocardial infarction, stroke, or
             angioplasty performed secondary to atherosclerosis).

          -  History of alcohol intake &gt;30 g/day in males and &gt;20 g/day in females.

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Subjects with conditions or diseases hindering data collection and follow up, such as
             incapacitating diseases, cognitive deterioration, institutionalized patients.
