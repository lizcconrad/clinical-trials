      This study aims is to evaluate, two hours after a single administration, the rate of
      sustained response produced by the association Geolab consisting of acetylsalicylic acid,
      sodium bicarbonate and anhydrous citric acid - oral powder, with the active comparator
      acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin ® -- Bayer) - a simple tablet for the treatment of acute pain
      in patients with mild to moderate CTTE, using for both the visual analog scale pain - VAS.

      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate:

        -  Modification of gastric pH after administration of drugs by measuring with
           gastroesophageal pH Monitor, comparing the results between the groups;

        -  The incidence of administration of rescue medications, through the accounts of patients
           and researchers, comparing the results between the groups;

        -  The percentage of improvement in time 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after administration,
           using the visual analog scale (VAS), comparing the results between the groups;

        -  Evaluate the gastric symptoms before and after treatment by clinical investigation of
           patients, comparing the results between the groups;

        -  Evaluate the change in associated symptoms (photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting),
           using 4-point scale (0 - absent 1 - mild 2 - moderate 3 - severe), comparing the results
           between the groups;

        -  Assess the quantitative and qualitative parameters related to adverse reactions,
           comparing the results between the groups.
