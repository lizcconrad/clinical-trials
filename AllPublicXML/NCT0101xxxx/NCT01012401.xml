  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the potential for an Interactive Cancer Communication System (ICCS)
      to impact not only psychosocial outcomes such as quality of life but also length of survival
      in an advanced stage lung cancer population. Two hypotheses will be tested: the Comprehensive
      Health Enhancement Support System- Lung Cancer (CHESS- LC) will significantly improve patient
      quality of life and length of overall survival as compared to a usual care control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients remains poor despite recent advances in
      anti-cancer therapies. A lung cancer diagnosis often inflicts fear, despair, and hopelessness
      on patients and loved ones. For lung cancer patients in particular, a population where
      palliation rather than cure is often the focus, interventions addressing communication about
      various types of suffering are crucial to quality of life (QOL). Our Center has done
      extensive research testing CHESS (Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System), a
      non-commercial, web-based information and support system. The recent Clinician Integration
      Project tested the impact of CHESS versus an Internet only Control group on QOL for
      caregivers of advanced stage lung cancer patients. This study yielded an unanticipated
      finding that CHESS may have a survival benefit for patients as one year survival was
      significantly increased in the CHESS group (50%) compared to Internet (34.2%). As this
      project did not focus on patient outcomes, follow-up with a well-formulated study designed
      and powered to address specific hypotheses of the nature of this effect is critical. The
      proposed study will specifically test QOL and survival effects of CHESS on lung cancer
      patients. Using sites in Wisconsin, Connecticut,Houston, and Chicago, we will randomly assign
      376 advanced lung cancer patients to two study arms: a patient control group receiving Usual
      Care (including access to a computer and Internet) and a group given access to the CHESS
      website. Patients may invite a caregiver to participate. Patients will be followed for 18
      months or until patient death.

    <description>The Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System (CHESS), a non-commercial, home-based system created by clinical, communication, and decision scientists at the University of Wisconsin, is distinguished by its quality, depth, and ease of use. It employs data on user health status to help users monitor their condition, guide them to tailored information and social support, make and implement important health decisions, and learn coping skills. Our tests and clinical trials demonstrate that an ICCS such as CHESS can be widely accepted and used, improve quality of life, information competence, and in some cases lead to more efficient use of health services. An Internet-based system, CHESS-LC integrates over 14 services to provide tailored cancer information, support, interactive tools, and communication with the clinical team.</description>
