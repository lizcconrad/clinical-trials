  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by muscle rigidity,
      tremor, a slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and, in extreme cases, a loss of
      physical movement. The primary symptoms are the results of decreased stimulation of the motor
      cortex arising from the basal ganglia normally caused by the insufficient formation and
      action of dopamine, which is produced in the dopaminergic neurons of the brain. Secondary
      symptoms may include high level cognitive dysfunction and subtle language problems. Included
      in the symptomatology experienced by patients with PD, visual abnormalities are not uncommon.
      Visual changes among patients with PD appear not only dynamic in nature, but differentially
      affected based on the course of the disease and, perhaps more importantly, its treatment.
      Parkinson's disease has significant ramifications not only in observation of irregularities
      in vision, but how vision interacts with entrainment of the circadian clock. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the relationship between PD and operation of a unique set of retinal
      cells known to regulate the circadian clock and sleep-wake cycles in human subjects.
