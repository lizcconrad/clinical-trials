    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate non-inferiority clinical
      development of pancreatic enzymes from Laboratory Bergamo (Norzyme ®) in relation to
      pancreatic enzymes from Solvay Pharmaceuticals (Creon ®), by comparing the average amount of
      lipids in the feces of 72 hours after 14 days of treatment with each drug.

      As a secondary objective will be assessed the following parameters:

        -  Incidence of abdominal pain;

        -  Frequency of flatus;

        -  Frequency of bowel movements during the treatment;

        -  Consistency of stools during treatment;

        -  Amount of medication used among the treatments. All these parameters will be measured
           based on reports of patients in a specific diary.
