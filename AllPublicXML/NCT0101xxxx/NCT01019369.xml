  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DepoProvera) is an acceptable form of contraception for
      many women. However, difficulty in access may cause many women to discontinue use, often
      without the use of another effective method of contraception, thereby leaving them vulnerable
      to unintended pregnancy. This study will randomly assign women who present for contraceptive
      services to two groups: self or clinic administered SC DMPA. The participants will be
      followed for one year to compare continuation rates, acceptability, cost effectiveness,
      evidence of skin changes, and need for continued support between the two groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Unintended pregnancy remains a worldwide problem in both developed and developing countries.
      In 2001, 49% of pregnancies in the United States were unintended. Moreover, more than 6
      million women annually are at high risk of becoming unintentionally pregnant because of a gap
      in contraceptive use, and disadvantaged women are more likely to have more difficulty than
      others with continuous method use. Multiple strategies have been explored and implemented to
      increase the effective usage of contraception, including promoting the use of longer acting
      reversible contraceptives.

      Difficulty in access to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) remains a problem. With the
      advent of a subcutaneous formulation of DMPA, administration outside of the clinical setting
      is possible. The acceptability of self administered DMPA has also been reviewed, with
      favorable outcomesÍ¾ however, the actual intervention has not been studied.

      This study will recruit women presenting for abortion or contraceptive services at the
      Columbia University and New York Presbyterian affiliated Family Planning Clinic and Special
      Gynecology Services who desire DMPA for contraception. Women will be randomized to two
      groups: self administration of SC DMPA or clinic administration of SC DMPA. The primary
      objective of this study is to compare the continuation rates of SC DMPA between the self and
      clinic administration groups at 6 months. Secondary outcomes include participant
      satisfaction, cost effectiveness of self-injected use of DMPA, baseline predictors of method
      continuation or discontinuation, evidence of persistent skin changes following administration
      of SC DMPA, and need for continued clinical support.
