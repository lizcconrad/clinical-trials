      The purpose of this study is to assess palliative care physicians' attitudes, beliefs and
      practice patterns related to parenteral hydration at the end of life in Latin America and
      Spain.

      Objectives:

        1. To assess palliative care physicians' attitudes, beliefs and practice patterns related
           to parenteral hydration at the end of life in Latin America and Spain.

        2. To assess cross-national differences in practice patterns related to parenteral
           hydration at the end of life. (Latin America vs. Spain).

        3. To determine the percentage of physicians who practice parenteral hydration at the
           end-of-life in the hospital setting and the home setting.

        4. To examine the association between providers' parenteral hydration practice patterns
           and:

             -  1. provider demographic characteristics;

             -  2. specific characteristics of their practice settings; and

             -  3. training and experience in end of life care;

        5. To determine which factors most predict the practice of parenteral hydration at the end
           of life among palliative care physicians.
