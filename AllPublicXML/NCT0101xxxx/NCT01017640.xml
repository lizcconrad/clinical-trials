    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given with or
      without mitomycin C in treating patients with solid tumors that have spread to other places
      in the body, cannot be removed by surgery or have come back. Veliparib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as mitomycin C, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving veliparib together with mitomycin C may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To screen cancer patients across different histological sites to identify those with
      functional defects in the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway in their tumors.

      II. To establish the safety and practicality of treating patients with FA deficient tumors
      with the poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor ABT-888
      (veliparib) as protracted monotherapy.

      III. To establish the safety and practicality of treating patients with FA deficient tumors
      with the combination of mitomycin C (MMC) and ABT-888.

      IV. To select a dose of ABT-888 protracted monotherapy and a dose-schedule of the combination
      of mitomycin C and ABT-888 in patients with FA deficient tumors for phase 2 trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for germ-line FA repair deficiency and BRCA mutations in peripheral blood
      mononuclear (PBMC) in patients receiving ABT-888 treatment.

      II. To evaluate in PBMC samples for foci produced by the histone variant gamma-H2A histone
      family, member X (H2AX) in patients receiving mitomycin C with or without ABT-888 in order to
      assess any possible effect of ABT-888 in the cellular sensing and processing of mitomycin
      C-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double strand breaks.

      III. Quantify the number of patients with antitumor responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive veliparib PO BID on days 1-7, 1-14, or 1-21. Patients also receive
      mitomycin C intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a histologically confirmed solid malignancy that is metastatic, or
             unresectable, or recurrent, for which no curative or standard of care exist, or this
             standard of care is no longer effective

          -  Tumors have been shown to be deficient for the FA pathway, based on Fanconi anemia
             triple stain immunofluorescence (FATSI) screening

          -  Patients will be consented to have their existing, or about to be obtained, paraffin
             embedded tumor tissue screened for FA deficiency; screening will be performed on an
             ongoing basis on the breast, thoracic, gastrointestinal (GI), Georgetown University
             (GU), and gynecologic (GYN) Ohio State University (OSU) clinics, anteceding and
             concurrently with the clinical trial; it will continue until the numbers of patients
             required for the clinical trial are identified and enrolled; based on the estimation
             from our preliminary data of 15 to 30% of patients, depending on the primary organ
             site, having tumors deficient for the FA pathway we will need to screen around 300
             patients' samples to identify 40-50 patients; none of the eligibility criteria defined
             above or below will need to be met for the screening portion, since FA deficient
             patients identified by screening may meet eligibility criteria for the clinical trial
             at a later time; (e.g., patient is undergoing standard of care treatment at the time
             of the screening); separate written consents for screening and for the clinical trial
             will be obtained from patients

          -  Up to two chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease are allowed; in addition, prior
             adjuvant/neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, molecular targeted therapy or
             estrogen receptor B (Erb) inhibitor treatments (e.g., erlotinib, Herceptin, sorafenib,
             sunitinib) will be allowed and will not count towards eligibility; at least 4 weeks
             must elapse since prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy (two weeks for erlotinib,
             hormonal therapy, or limited field palliative radiation to bone, brain, or
             radiosurgery), 6 weeks if the last regimen included nitrosoureas or mitomycin C;
             previous use of mitomycin C would be restricted to topical applications (bladder
             cancer) or chemoembolization (e.g., liver tumors)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2 (Karnofsky &gt;= 60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/mcL

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 9 g/dL

          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/mcL

          -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase

             mL/min/1.73 m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician

               -  Same eligibility as above, except that they will have no limitations related
                  prior number of chemotherapy regimens given; patients could have received prior
                  treatment with PARP inhibitors if used as single agent
