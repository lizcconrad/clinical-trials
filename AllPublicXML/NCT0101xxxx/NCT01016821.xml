  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childbirth is one of the most painful events that a woman is likely to experience, and thus
      is a major concern for most parturient. Severe pain releases stress mediators and may thus
      compromise fetus well-being if placental perfusion is decreased. Epidural analgesia is the
      golden standard for the management of severe labor pain. However, it could not always be used
      both due the parturient related factors and the organizational reasons.However, the knowledge
      on safety and efficacy of oxycodone involving mother, fetus and newborn is limited.

      Aim of the study is firstly, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxycodone in labor pain
      healthy parturients. Secondly, to measure parturient's blood oxycodone concentration during
      labour and fetal concentration from placental umbilical vein and artery right after birth.
