  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal incontinence affects 18.4% adults in the community and greatly impacts quality of life.
      There's a problem like inconvenience, pain or allergic response in many therapeutic methods
      such as a surgical operation or material injection. ANT-SM is autologous adipose-derived stem
      cell, and so, expect of no immune responses. In this study, patients are given injection of
      ANT-AM in anal sphincter and followed for 4 weeks to test the safety.
