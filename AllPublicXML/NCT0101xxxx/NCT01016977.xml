      A single-blind (investigator-blinded), randomized, parallel group, single center study to
      evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy with Duac Gel / 0.1% Tazorac
      Cream and Acanya Gel / 0.1% Tazorac Cream for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-blind (investigator-blinded), randomized, parallel group, single center
      study to evaluate the tolerability and efficacy of combination therapy with Duac Gel/Tazorac
      Cream and Acanya Gel/Tazorac Cream for the treatment of facial acne vulgaris. Approximately
      40 male and female subjects will be enrolled (20 per study group).

      Subjects will participate in the study for 12 weeks; visits will be scheduled at baseline and
      at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 (total of 6 visits). Eligible subjects will be randomized at
      baseline to 1 of the 2 study groups in a 1:1 ratio (Duac Gel/Tazorac Cream to Acanya
      Gel/Tazorac Cream). Subjects will apply either Duac Gel or Acanya Gel to the face each
      morning and apply Tazorac Cream to the face each evening.

      Tolerability will be evaluated through subject assessments of burning/stinging, itching, and
      oiliness and through investigator assessments of peeling, erythema, and dryness. In addition,
      subjects will evaluate their overall skin comfort and record the usage of moisturizer and
      sunscreen, if needed. Efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (total, inflammatory
      and noninflammatory) and ISGA. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs),
      concomitant medication use, and withdrawals from the study.

      This is an investigator-blinded study; therefore, subjects and study-center staff will not be
      blinded to study treatment allocation. Subjects (and parents or legal guardians) and
      study-center staff will be instructed not to reveal study product allocation to the
      investigator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Documented diagnosis of acne vulgaris.

          -  Lesion count: 20 to 50 inflammatory (papules and pustules) and 30 to 100
             noninflammatory (open and closed - comedones) facial lesions excluding nose, and ≤ 1
             small nodular lesion. Cystic lesions are not allowed at baseline.

          -  Investigator Static Global Assessment of 3 or 4 at Baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically relevant finding at baseline or medical history of severe systemic diseases
             or diseases of the facial skin, other than acne vulgaris.

          -  Subjects with cystic acne lesions.

          -  Facial hair that may obscure the accurate assessment of acne grade.

          -  History or presence of regional enteritis or inflammatory bowel disease (eg,
             ulcerative colitis, pseudomembranous colitis, chronic diarrhea, celiac disease or a
             history of antibiotic-associated colitis) or similar symptoms.

          -  Concurrent use of medications known to be photosensitizers (eg, thiazides,
             tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, phenothiazines, and sulfonamides) because of the
             possibility of increased phototoxicity.

          -  Concomitant use of neuromuscular blocking agents. Clindamycin has neuromuscular
             blocking activities, which may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking
             agents.

          -  Use of topical anti-acne medications (eg, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, azelaic acid,
             resorcinol, salicylates, sulfacetamide sodium and derivatives, and glycolic acid)
             within the past 2 weeks.

          -  Use of topical antibiotics on the face within the past 2 weeks or systemic antibiotics
             within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Use of topical corticosteroids on the face or systemic corticosteroids within the past
             2 to 4 weeks, respectively. Use of inhaled, intra-articular or intra lesional (other
             than for facial acne lesions) steroids is acceptable.

          -  Use of systemic retinoids, such as Isotretinoin, within the past 6 months.

          -  Concomitant use of the following types of facial products: astringents, toners,
             abradants, hair removal wax, facials, peels containing glycolic or other acids, masks,
             washes or soaps containing benzoyl peroxide, sulfacetamide sodium or salicylic acid,
             non-mild facial cleansers, or moisturizers that contain retinol, salicylic acid, or α-
             or β hydroxy acids.

          -  Concomitant use of medications that are reported to exacerbate acne, (eg, vitamins
             such as vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamins B2, B6, B12; haloperidol, halogens such as
             iodide and bromide, lithium, cyclosporine, psoralen, sirolimus, imatinib,
             aripiprazole, isoniazid, valproate acid, hydantoin, and phenobarbital) as these may
             impact efficacy assessments. Iron supplements and folate are acceptable.

          -  Facial procedures (eg, chemical peel, lasers/lights, photodynamic therapy,
             microdermabrasion, artificial ultraviolet therapy) performed by an esthetician,
             beautician, physician, nurse, or other practitioner, within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Known hypersensitivity or previous allergic reaction to any component(s) or
             excipient(s) of the study products.

          -  Use of any investigational medications or treatments within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Treatment with estrogens, including oral, implanted and topical contraceptives,
             androgens, or anti-androgenic agents for 12 weeks or less immediately prior to
             starting study product and have not been prescribed for the treatment of Acne
             Vulgaris. Subjects that have been treated with estrogens, as described above,
             androgens, or anti androgenic agents for more than 12 consecutive weeks prior to start
             of study treatment are allowed to enroll as long as they do not expect to change dose,
             medication, or discontinue use during the study.

          -  Evidence of recent alcohol or drug abuse (in the opinion of the investigator).

          -  Live in the same household as currently enrolled subjects.

          -  Employee of the investigator, a clinical research organization, or Stiefel
             Laboratories who is involved in the study or an immediate family member (eg, partner,
             offspring, parents, siblings or sibling's offspring) of an employee involved in the
             study.

        <description>Inflammation is defined as a localized protective reaction of tissue to irritation, injury, or infection, characterized by pain, redness, swelling, and sometimes loss of function. The investigator counted inflammatory (papules, pustules, and nodules) and non-inflammatory (open and closed comedones) lesions on a participant's face at each study visit. The face is defined as the hairline edge to the mandibular line and should include the forehead, cheeks, and chin. W, Week.</description>

        <description>Skindex-29 is a 3-component (symptomatic, emotional, and functional) self-administered questionnaire (comprised of 30 questions) used to comprehensively measure the complex effects of skin diseases on a participant's quality of life. Participants were asked to answer questions based on a 5-point scale concerning their feelings over the past 4 weeks about the skin condition that has bothered them the most: 1, never; 2, rarely; 3, sometimes; 4, often; 5, all the time. The Global Score is the sum of the 30 question scores; total score ranges from 30 to 150.</description>
