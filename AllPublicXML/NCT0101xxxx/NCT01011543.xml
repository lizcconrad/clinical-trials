  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised study that compares different diagnostic approaches for diagnosing
      pulmonary tuberculosis in patients suspected of pulmonary tuberculosis in whom the three
      classic (non-induced) sputum samples didn't show tuberculous bacillus on direct examination.

      The investigators compare the sensibility of induced sputum technique with an endoscopic
      approach (CT-scan followed by BAL and fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsies and
      eventually sputum collection immediately after the bronchoscopy).

      People in high risk population for tuberculosis undergoing screening by chest X-ray or
      symptomatic patients will be admitted to the hospital if their chest X-ray shows a suspicion
      of active tuberculosis.

      According good clinical practice: (non-induced) sputum samples will be taken at admission and
      every following morning. If direct examination and PCR of the first three classic sputum
      samples are negative: patients will be randomised in two groups with a different diagnostic
      approach (induced sputum versus endoscopic approach) The aim of our study is to proof that a
      thoroughgoing endoscopic approach has a higher sensibility than an induced sputum in the
      diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in patients with a high suspicion of active tuberculosis
      on the chest X-ray but with a negative direct examination and/or PCR on three consecutive
      normal sputum samples.

      The investigators will include 154 patients (based on a statistical analysis for a hypothesis
      that the endoscopic approach has a sensibility that's twice the sensibility of the induced
      sputum).

        -  first arm: 2 consecutive induced sputum using an ultrasonic nebulizer.

        -  second arm: CT thorax to evaluate the exact anatomic localisation of the disease
           followed by fluoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy for BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) and
           transbronchial biopsies. A sputum sample immediately after the endoscopy will be
           collected if possible.
