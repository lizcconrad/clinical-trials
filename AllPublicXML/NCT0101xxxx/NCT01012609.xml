  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for patients with diffuse pontine tumors is radiation therapy, but less
      than 10% of patients are cured. Adding standard chemotherapy has not improved the cure rate.

      Standard treatment for high-grade astrocytomas is surgery and radiation. The surgeon removes
      as much of the tumor as she or he can. Radiation after that tries to kill any cancer cells
      that are left. Some patients also get chemotherapy. These are anti-cancer drugs. They can be
      given during or after radiation. Current standard treatments do not cure many patients.

      In this study the doctors are adding a new medication called cetuximab to the treatment and
      will also use a chemotherapy medication (irinotecan) that has been promising for patients
      treated for recurrent disease.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have either (1) histologic proof of a high-grade astrocytoma reviewed by
             a POETIC institutional pathologist or (2) a radiological diagnosis via MRI scan of a
             typical diffuse pontine tumor made by a POETIC institutional neuroradiologist.
             Patients with a radiological diagnosis via MRI scan of a typical diffuse pontine tumor
             will be enrolled on the diffuse pontine tumor arm of the study regardless of histology
             in cases that are biopsied. Note: For collaborating non-POETIC institutions, the
             reviews may be done by an institutional pathologist/neuroradiologist.

          -  Patients must begin study prescribed therapy within 42 days of neurosurgical resection
             or biopsy of the tumor (high-grade astrocytoma patients) or radiological diagnosis
             (diffuse pontine tumor patients).

          -  Age ≥ 3-years and &lt; 22-years-old.

          -  Brain MRI (and any other studies done according to clinical indications) must not show

          -  The patient, or for minors, a parent or legal guardian, must give informed written
             consent indicating they are aware of the investigational nature of this study.

          -  Prior therapy which specifically and directly targets the EGFR pathway.

          -  Prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.

          -  Significant history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months), uncontrolled
