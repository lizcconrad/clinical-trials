  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sevoflurane inhalational anesthetic has got pulmonary effects such as bronchodilatation.
      These effects could be of interest in intensive care patients ventilated in pressure support
      ventilation mode. The purpose of this study is to evaluate mechanical respiratory effects of
      sevoflurane administered through a new specific heat and moister exchanger called the
      Anesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa®) in pressure support ventilation in intensive care
      patients. In fact, dead space and resistance generated by the device could cancel and even
      deteriorate the potential positive effects of sevoflurane on ventilation.

    <textblock>
      Pharmacological sedation is often necessary in mechanical ventilated intubated patient. Since
      a little time, sevoflurane can be used in the intensive care unit via a specific heat and
      moister exchanger called the Anesthetic Conserving Device (AnaConDa®, SedanaMedical AB,
      Uppsala, Sweden) placed between the Y piece of the ventilatory circuit and the endotracheal
      tube. Sevoflurane is known to have ventilatory interesting effects such as bronchodilatation
      that can be useful in the treatment of severe asthma. These effects could be of interest in
      the intensive care ventilated patients. On the other hand, the AnaConDa® device could have
      negative influence on ventilatory mechanics caused by the increased dead space and the
      resistance to air flow. This negative effect with worsening of work of breathing (WOB) was
      demonstrated with classic heat and moister exchanger compared to heated humidifiers in
      pressure support ventilation (PSV). In this way, we would like to study the mechanical
      effects of the sevoflurane administered with the AnaConDa® compared to a classic management
      with a heated humidifier and sedation with intravenous remifentanil in PSV consecutive
      intensive care patients.
