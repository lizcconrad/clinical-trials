  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the second administration of GSK1362885 in humans. GSK1362885 is a novel,
      potent inhibitor of human glycogen phosphorylase (GP) under development for the treatment of
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study will investigate the compound's safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics in subjects with Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is the first administration of single doses of GSK1362885 to the target population with
      T2DM. Based on the mechanism of action which involves reducing hepatic glucose output, it is
      possible that day time (AM) or night time (PM) dosing of GSK1362885 could produce different
      plasma glucose lowering effects, acting either on prandial or post-absorptive elevations of
      HGO. This study is designed to compare glucose profiles following AM and PM doses to
      determine if there is any advantage to either one. This study will compare glucose profiles
      following a single dose of GSK1362885 in the morning before breakfast (AM) to a single dose
      administered at night (PM). These two dosing periods will be randomized and each subject will
      receive both dosing regimens. A third dosing period (BID) is not randomized, but is included
      to explore the effects of GSK1362885 on glucose profiles when administered twice daily in a
      24 hour timeframe.
