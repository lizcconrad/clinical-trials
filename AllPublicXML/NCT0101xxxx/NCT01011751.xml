  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of three drugs (cyproterone acetate,
      medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine) in the treatment of hot flushes caused by
      leuprorelin LP 11.25 milligram (mg) in participants suffering from prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three drugs will be tested in this study: cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate
      and venlafaxine. Cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate and venlafaxine are being
      tested to treat men who suffer from hot flushes due to androgen suppression treatment for
      prostate cancer. This study will look at the frequency and severity of hot flushes caused by
      leuprorelin in participants who will take cyproterone acetate, medroxyprogesterone acetate or
      venlafaxine. The study will randomize approximately 311 participants. All participants will
      receive 2 injections of leuprorelin 11.35 mg at Months 0 and 3 along with flutamide tablets
      in the first month of treatment to prevent flare-up. After 6 months, eligible participants
      will receive third injection of leuprorelin and will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      treatment groups—which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the
      study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Cyproterone acetate (Androcur® 50 mg)

        -  Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Gestoral® 10 mg)

        -  Venlafaxine (Effexor® LP 37.5 mg) All participants will be asked to take 2 capsules in
           the morning and 1 capsule in the evening for 10 weeks. All participants will be asked to
           complete the self-evaluation hot-flushes (HF) questionnaire daily for 12 weeks from the
           start of treatment for hot flushes.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 9 months. Participants will make 5 visits to the clinic during the
      study.

    <measure>Percent Change from Randomization in Hot Flushes (HF) Score at Week 4 of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Month 6) and Week 4 of treatment (Month 7)</time_frame>
    <description>The change is calculated as follows: [(HF score at Week 4 of treatment - HF score at randomization)/HF score at randomization]*100. The calculation of the HF score will be done as follows: a coefficient is allocated to each severity grade, it varies from 1 to 4 (1: slight; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe), and the calculation of the daily score is equal to the sum of the daily instances of hot flushes multiplied by their severity coefficient. The score calculated at randomization and Week 4 of treatment will be the average of the scores recorded in the preceding week. The score range will depend upon the frequency of hot flushes, and higher score signifies higher severity of hot flushes.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization (Month 6), Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment (Months 7 and 8, respectively) and last available value (Month 7 or 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The change is calculated as follows: [(HF frequency at specified Week of treatment - HF frequency at randomization)/HF score at randomization]*100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With More Than 50 percent (%) Decrease in HF Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 4 of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with at least 50 % improvement in HF score after 4 weeks of treatment compared to randomization will be calculated. The calculation of the HF score will be done as follows: a coefficient is allocated to each severity grade, it varies from 1 to 4 (1: slight; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe), and the calculation of the daily score is equal to the sum of the daily instances of hot flushes multiplied by their severity coefficient. The score range will depend upon the frequency of hot flushes, and higher score signifies higher severity of hot flushes. The score calculated at randomization and Week 4 of treatment will be the average of the scores recorded in the preceding week.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Complete Regression of hot flushes</measure>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With A Decrease in the Level of HF Complaint</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment and Week 12 after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Decrease (improvement) in the level of complaint regarding hot flushes will be assessed compared to randomization. Participants' level of complaints about hot flushes was recorded at each visit of the study. The change in the level of complaints will be classified as degradation, non-change or improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization, Week 8 of treatment, and last available value (Month 7 or 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The change is calculated as follows: [(HF score at specified Week of treatment - HF score at randomization)/HF score at randomization]*100. The calculation of the HF score will be done as follows: a coefficient is allocated to each severity grade, it varies from 1 to 4 (1: slight; 2: moderate; 3: severe; 4: very severe), and the calculation of the daily score is equal to the sum of the daily instances of hot flushes multiplied by their severity coefficient.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Month 0), randomization (Month 6), Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment, Week 12 after the start of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC QLQ-C30: includes functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), global health status, symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea/vomiting) and single items (dyspnoea, appetite loss, insomnia, constipation/diarrhea and financial difficulties). Most questions uses 4 point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions uses 7-point scale (1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent'). Scores are averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale; for the 5 functional scales and the global quality-of-life scale, a higher score represents a better level of functioning. For the symptom-oriented scales and items, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptoms.</description>
