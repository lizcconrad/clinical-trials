  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CT of the abdomen is a very common examination performed for various indications.One of the
      common findings is vascular calcifications including calcifications of the renal
      arteries.Calcifications in the carotid arteries and coronary arteries are good predictor for
      obstructive atherosclerotic disease.Stenosis of the renal arteries can cause symptomatic or
      asymptomatic hypertension with subsequent clinical sequelae. Therefore early diagnosis of
      this condition is imperative.

      The goal of our study is to investigate the correlation between incidental calcifications of
      the renal arteries in CT examinations and the presence of actual stenosis of these vessels in
      patients with and without hypertension.

      Every patient aged 30-100 referred for abdominal CT examination with IV contrast injection
      will be included in this study (total 300 patients.Prior to the examination relevant clinical
      data including history of hypertension and predisposing conditions for atherosclerotic
      disease, will be investigated. The patient will undergo conventional CT with no special
      procedures. The images will be review by the radiologist for the presence of renal arteries
      calcifications, renal arteries stenosis,plaque location, plaque burden and characterization
      and secondary renal pathology.

      This study will not change the examination technique and is not associated with any
      inconvenience to the patients.
