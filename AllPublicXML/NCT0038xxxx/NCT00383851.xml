    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral
      ATN-224 plus temozolomide in patients with advanced melanoma. Patients will be randomized
      (1:1) between temozolomide and ATN-224 and temozolomide followed by ATN-224. Patients
      assigned to the sequential treatment group will receive temozolomide until progression of
      disease is documented and then receive ATN-224 as a single agent until documentation of
      progression of disease using the last tumor assessment on temozolomide therapy as the
      baseline assessment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to the National Cancer Institute PDQ database, advanced melanoma is refractory to
      most standard systemic therapy, and all newly diagnosed patients should be considered
      candidates for clinical trials. Although advanced melanoma is relatively resistant to
      therapy, several biologic response modifiers and cytotoxic agents have been reported to
      produce objective responses. Once melanoma is metastatic, treatments are palliative rather
      than curative. In spite of many attempts at multimodality therapy, the prognosis in this
      disease remains poor. Further agents are needed if progress is to be made with melanoma
      treatment.

      ATN-224 is an orally active, small molecule that has been shown in cellular and animal models
      to be antiangiogenic and to have activity against melanoma cell lines. Clinical studies with
      a similar agent (ammonium tetrathiomolybdate) indicate that the agent can be administered
      continuously on a daily basis for years in some patients. ATN-224 has the potential to affect
      the progression of melanoma by mechanisms that include both antiangiogenic and antitumor
      pathways. Temozolomide, a commonly used agent for melanoma, also has a tolerable profile.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced cutaneous melanoma. Advanced melanoma
             is defined as locally advanced disease that is not amenable to surgery or radiation
             therapy and metastatic disease. Patients may have had adjuvant treatment for prior
             early disease as long as it was given at least 6 months before the first dose of study
             medication, and the treatment did not contain temozolomide or dacarbazine. Previous
             treatment for advanced disease is acceptable as long as the patient did not receive
             temozolomide or dacarbazine. There is no restriction on the number of prior regimens.

          -  Age ≥18 years

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥50%; see
             Appendix A)

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/uL

               -  platelets ≥100,000/uL

               -  hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL

               -  total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

               -  AST(SGOT) and ALT(SGPT) ≤2 X ULN

               -  creatinine clearance (measured or calculated) ≥30 mL/min

        Patients are allowed to receive erythropoietin or blood transfusions before receiving their
        first dose of ATN-224 to bring the hemoglobin level to &gt;9 g/dL to meet eligibility
        criteria.

          -  Use of adequate contraception. Temozolomide has the potential to cause fetal harm. The
             effects of ATN 224 on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose
             are unknown, but antiangiogenic agents are known to be teratogenic. For these reasons
             women of child-bearing potential and men with partners of child-bearing potential must
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal and/or barrier method of birth control;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation through
             the follow up visit 28 days after the last dose of ATN 224 or temozolomide.

          -  Willingness to forgo taking copper- or zinc-containing vitamins or supplements

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Uveal (ocular) melanoma

          -  Brain metastasis that has not been treated and remained stable for at least 4 weeks
             (In other words, patients are eligible if they have no metastases or if brain
             metastases have been treated and remain stable for at least 4 weeks)

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to ATN-224 or omeprazole

          -  History of malabsorption syndromes or other gastrointestinal disorders that may affect
             ATN-224 or temozolomide absorption, including bowel obstruction, celiac disease,
             sprue, cystic fibrosis

          -  Ineligible to receive either temozolomide (Temodar®), omeprazole (Prilosec®),
             lansoprazole (Prevacid®), pantoprazole (Protonix®), or ranitidine (Zantac®)

          -  Inability to swallow study medication capsules

          -  Other serious medical or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent or with the
             potential to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of ATN-224 treatment

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients known to be positive for HIV or infectious hepatitis type A, B or C

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years
