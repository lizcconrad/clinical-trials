  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic disease is characterised by enhanced brain excitability. Low frequency repetitive
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can be an effective treatment for refractory frontal
      epilepsy. Thought, physiological mechanisms of its effectivity are still unknown. It is yet
      possible to evaluate cortical excitability and inhibition with TMS-coupled electromyography
      before and after rTMS sessions ; this could provide clues for basic mechanisms of rTMS
      effects on the epileptic brain. We assume that rTMS decrease brain excitability by improving
      brain inhibition. Such an information could help for treating patients with both
      pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods.
