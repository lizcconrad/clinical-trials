  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that Botulinum toxin B (Myobloc®) treatment reduces pain
      and disability in subjects suffering from acute low back pain due to an identifiable muscle
      strain or back trauma occurring 3 to 6 weeks prior to enrollment. The study will also
      delineate the duration of medication effect and control for any placebo or mechanical
      trigger-point injection effect by employing a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      design.

      This study will assess the efficacy of Botulinum Toxin B (Myobloc®) injected into the lumbar
      paravertebral muscles for reducing pain and disability in subjects suffering from acute low
      back pain (duration 3 to 6 weeks) arising from an identifiable muscle strain injury or back
      trauma. The treatment modality and techniques used are based upon three successful prior
      open-labeled pilot studies done by this research group investigating the effect of Botulinum
      Toxin A (BOTOX®) on relief of chronic low back pain. This study, however, will employ a
      prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial to control for any placebo or
      mechanical trigger-point injection effects. Subjects will also be assessed for 3 months to
      define the duration of efficacy of Myobloc®. Sixty subjects will be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups and will then receive either Myobloc® or placebo injection into the lumbar
      paravertebral muscles. The subjects will be assessed using validated scales for pain and
      disability prior to injection and weekly to monthly thereafter for three months. All subjects
      will continue to receive any medication or physiotherapy per standard of care but those
      treatments will be recorded and controlled for in the data analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects, 18 to 60 years of age, active duty military, retired military
             or other DOD beneficiaries eligible for care at military treatment facilities.

             research study information.

          -  Clear history of an identifiable muscle strain or trauma preceding the onset of low
             back pain.

          -  No prior history of vertebral disk disease/condition, sciatica or radiculopathy.

          -  Normal neurological examination without evidence of radiculopathy.

          -  Evidence of trigger point tenderness or muscle spasm upon palpation or EMG findings of
             muscle spasm.

          -  History of low back pain lasting 3 to 6 weeks from the time of injury or strain.

          -  VAS score minimum of 5 cm at time of entry into study.

          -  Ability to follow study instructions and likely to complete all required visits.

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test prior to the administration of study medication (for
             females of childbearing potential) (if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria:
