      To Investigate the safety and immunologic activity of AGS-004, an autologous HIV
      Immunotherapeutic, in HIV-infected adults currently on stable antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      with durable viral suppression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although an HIV infection can induce weak immune responses, current HIV immunotherapy using
      consensus antigens has not shown consistent clinical activity. The absence of clinical
      activity is associated with an inability to raise cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HIV
      antigens and a failure to induce T cell memory. While strong immune responses may be
      generated to a consensus antigen, those responses do not offer antiviral protection against a
      patient's individual viral burden. The infecting virus' antigen variability likely prevents
      the establishment of effective CD4+ T cell memory and a strong CD8+ T cell effector arm.

      We are investigating the induction of CTL responses in HIV-infected subjects by a novel HIV
      immunotherapeutic agent (AGS-004) in an effort to overcome the lack of polyvalent specificity
      of the immune response for autologous HIV antigens which has been one of the primary reasons
      for the failure of HIV immunotherapy to date.

      This pilot study will investigate the safety and immunologic activity of AGS-004 an
      autologous HIV immunotherapeutic agent.
