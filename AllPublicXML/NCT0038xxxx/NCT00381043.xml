  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of a medication, acamprosate, which is an FDA approved medication for alcohol
      problems. We will be examining whether acamprosate compared to a sugar pill (placebo) is more
      effective for helping with drinking in a Family Medicine clinic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acamprosate has been shown to reduce drinking days in alcohol dependent patients and promote
      abstinence, with few reported side effects. A limitation of these studies, however, has been
      their lack of generalizability due to restrictive inclusion and exclusion criteria.
      Furthermore, most of the previous studies of acamprosate have been conducted in Europe, in a
      different treatment setting from the typical American Family Medicine center, where alcohol
      dependent patients are most likely to be first identified in the U.S.

      The present study is designed to determine the efficacy of acamprosatefor alcohol dependence
      in a Family Medicine setting using minimal psychotherapeutic interventions—as would also
      likely occur in a primary care setting. The study will be a 12-week, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized trial comparing 666 mg acamprosate t.i.d. to placebo in
      patients at the UNC Family Medicine Center with alcohol dependence. Subjects will be seen by
      Family Medicine physicians and receive brief motivational interventions. Primary efficacy
      will be determined by measuring % days abstinent and secondary outcomes include rates of
      complete abstinence, % heavy drinking days, CGI and GGT in the acamprosate group compared to
      the placebo group.
