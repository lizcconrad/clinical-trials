    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D17 Total Score at Week 8 or Final On-therapy (FOT) Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D17: a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0 = none/absent and 4 = most severe, for a maximum total score of 50.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Categorical Scores on CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-I: 7-point clinician rated scale ranging from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). Improvement is defined as a score of 1 (very much improved), 2 (much improved), or 3 (minimally improved) on the scale relative to the baseline assessment. Higher score = more affected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean CGI-S Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>CGI-S: 7-point clinician rated scale to assess severity of participant's current illness state; range: 1 (normal - not ill at all) to 7 (among the most extremely ill participants). Higher score = more affected.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>MADRS measures the overall severity of depressive symptoms. The MADRS has a 10-item checklist. Items are rated on a scale of 0-6, for a total score range of 0 (low severity of depressive symptoms) to 60 (high severity of depressive symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Lassitude Item of the MADRS Scale at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>Lassitude item of MADRS represents a difficulty in getting started or slowness in initiating and performing everyday activities. It is rated on a scale of 0-6: 0 = hardly any difficulty in getting started/no sluggishness; 2 = difficulties in starting activities; 4 = difficulties in starting simple routine activities which are carried out with effort; 6 = complete lassitude/unable to do anything without help.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in HAM-D6 Total Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D6: a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 6 items characteristically associated with major depression and is a subset of HAM-D17. HAM-D6 score ranges from 0-22. The scale uses HAM-D17 items: 1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 13. Item 13 is scored 0-2 (0=none and 2=severe) and all others are scored 0-4 (0=none/absent and 4=most severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the HAM-D Energy Subscale Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>HAM-D energy subscale is a subset of the HAM-D17 that assesses 4 items associated with major depression. The scale uses HAM- D17 items 1, 7, 8 and 14. Item 14 is scored 0 to 2 (0=none/absent to 2=most severe) and all others are scored 0 to 4 (0=none/absent to 4=most severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Covi Anxiety Scale at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>COVI anxiety scale measures the severity of anxiety symptoms on 3 items: verbal report, behavior and somatic complaints. Each dimension is assessed using a 5-point scale: 1 = not at all, 2 = somewhat, 3 = moderately, 4 = considerably, to 5 = Very much. Worst value is 15 and best value is 3.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Visual Analog Scale-Pain Intensity (VAS-PI) Overall and Subcomponent Score at Week 8 or FOT Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 8 or FOT</time_frame>
    <description>VAS-PI scale assesses intensity of back pain, chest pain, arms, legs or joint pain as well as overall pain intensity where 100 mm line (VAS) is marked by participant and intensity of pain ranges from 0 millimetre (mm) = no pain to 100 mm = worst possible pain. There were separate 0 to 100 mm VAS lines for each subcomponent of VAS-PI.</description>

          <description>HAM-D17: a standardized, clinician-administered rating scale that assesses 17 items characteristically associated with major depression. Items are scored on either a 3 point (0 to 2) or a 5 point scale (0 to 4), with 0 = none/absent and 4 = most severe, for a maximum total score of 50.</description>
          <population>Intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants who had a baseline primary efficacy evaluation, had taken at least 1 dose of double-blind study medication, and had at least 1 primary efficacy evaluation after the first dose of double-blind study medication.</population>
