  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect lung washing samples and small pieces of tissue (biopsies)
      from the lungs of people who do not have any allergies or asthma. These samples will be used
      by researchers in the future as control samples to compare to samples from people with
      chronic lung diseases such as allergic asthma or emphysema. Control samples are samples are
      very important in laboratory experiments so that the researchers can tell what may be labeled
      as different or abnormal in samples from people with lung disease.

      Participants in this study must be between the ages of 18 and 45 years and have no general
      health concerns and do not have allergies or asthma. If qualified, participants will come to
      the study site up to 3 times over about a 3-week period. This study involves answering
      questions about your medical history, having a physical exam, urine pregnancy tests for
      females who might be able to have children, and breathing tests. You will also have a blood
      draw to test for bleeding problems and an allergy skin test to see if you are allergic to
      common things. If it is safe for you, you will have a bronchoscopy. A bronchoscopy is a
      medical procedure to get samples of cells and small pieces of tissue (biopsies) from your
      lungs.

      The study has some risks. The breathing tests may cause you to feel short of breath or dizzy.
      The allergy skin test will itch and cause a reaction like a mosquito bite.

      There are some risks involved with the bronchoscopy. Most people get a sore throat and feel
      tired after the procedure. You may need to feel a little short of breath. There is a very
      rare risk of serious problems.

      Women are able to join this study only if they are not pregnant or breast-feeding. If you
      have plans to become pregnant during the time period in which the study takes place, you
      should not join this study. For women, a urine pregnancy test will be done at the first visit
      and you will be asked to be on birth control. The study staff can talk to you about the type
      of birth control that is all right to use in this study.
