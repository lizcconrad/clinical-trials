      The purpose of this study will permit to determine the role of FDG PET/CT to diagnose Crohn
      Disease and recurrence of Crohn disease after having compared results of PET/CT's with
      results of exams routinely performed(colonoscopy and bowel follow through).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn disease is an inflammatory disease of the digestive system that may affect the small
      and large intestines. Remission and recurrence clinically characterized its development. When
      recurrence occurs, a careful examination is necessary in order to determine the extent and
      the severity of the disease. Actual exams performed are invasive and
      uncomfortable(colonoscopy and bowel follow through). Compare to these exams, PET/CT is less
      fierce to undergo and has less risks. Two groups are proposed in this project: 15 patients
      will be enroll in the active disease group and 15 patients will be enroll in the remission
      group. In regards of the area and the extent of the disease,PET/CT exams shall provide
      similar information than what usual tests provide. PET/CT exams shall also provide more
      information in order to better differentiate inflammatory stenosis from scars stenosis
      especially located in the small intestine.
