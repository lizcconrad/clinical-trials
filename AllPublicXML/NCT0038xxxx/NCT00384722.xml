             national law

          -  Willing and capable of providing informed consent, undergoing a device implant,

          -  Geographically stable residents who are available for follow-up

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to a 0.5 mg nominal dose of dexamethasone acetate

          -  Have or had previous cardiac resynchronization therapy, a coronary venous pace/sense
             lead or attempted LV lead placement

          -  Have pre-existing cardioversion/defibrillation leads or right ventricular pacing leads
             other than those specified in the investigational plan (unless the investigator

          -  Currently requiring dialysis

          -  Have had a myocardial infarct, unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention, or
             coronary artery bypass graft during the preceding 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Documented life expectancy of less than six months or expected to undergo heart
             transplant within the next six months

          -  Enrolled or participating in any concurrent study, including drug investigations,
             without Guidant written approval, that may confound the results of this study
