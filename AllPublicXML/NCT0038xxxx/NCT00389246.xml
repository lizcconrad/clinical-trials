  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 1,000 obese people are screened for genetic mutations (MC4R). Those with positive
      screenings as well as 320 randomly selected people without MC4R mutations are randomized to 2
      consultation types: one including recommendations for eating and physical activity behavior,
      the other with an additional part on genetic determinants and actions in obesity. It is
      hypothesized that obese people with obesity-specific genetic mutations, and obese people with
      a family history of obesity, benefit more if the consultation includes additional elements on
      genetic determinants.

      More than 1,000 obese people are screened for genetic mutations (MC4R). Those with positive
      screenings as well as 320 randomly selected people without MC4R mutations are randomized to 2
      consultation types: one including recommendations for eating and physical activity behavior,
      the other with an additional part on genetic determinants and actions in obesity. Their
      results are compared to a control group (n&gt;100). It is hypothesized that obese people with
      obesity-specific genetic mutations, and obese people with a family history of obesity,
      benefit more if the consultation includes additional elements on genetic determinants.

      The following variables are used: BMI, SCID interview for mental disorders, Stunkard's body
      silhouttes for participants and their parents and siblings, Restraint Eating Scale, PANAS,
      Well-being scale, body acceptance, shame and guilt, coping with obesity, participant's
      satisfaction with consultation.

      Assessment Points: before consultation, after consultation, 6 months later.
