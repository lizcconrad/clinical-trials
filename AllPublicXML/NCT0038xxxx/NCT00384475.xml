  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of ciclesonide nasal
      spray as compared with placebo (inactive substance) nasal spray in relieving symptoms of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by pollen. Ciclesonide will be administered once during the
      exposure to ragweed pollen in a controlled environment. The study duration consists of a
      baseline period (up to 5 days) and a treatment period (1 day). The study will provide further
      data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.
