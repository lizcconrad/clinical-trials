      1. Primary objectives

           a. To evaluate the Effects of intravitreal Bevacizumab on polypoidal choroidal
           vasculopathy(PCV)

        2. Secondary objectives

             1. To assess the changes in visual acuity

             2. To assess the change in lesion characteristics of PCV

                  -  size of PCV

                  -  fluorescein leakage

                  -  foveal thickness

             3. To investigate the safety of intravitreal Bevacizumab in patients with PCV

             4. To assess the effect of intravitreal Bevacizumab on the recurrence rate and the the
                incidence of submacular hemorrhage in patients with PCV

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, CNV secondary to PCV

          -  BCVA of 20/40 to 20/320 (Snellen equivalent)

          -  Evidence of presumed recent disease progression (blood, growth by FA, or recent VA
             loss)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma or any other ocular condition that would prevent an improvement
             in visual acuity

          -  Media opacity in the study eye that precludes clinical and photographic evaluation

          -  Intraocular surgery &lt; 1 month before day 0

          -  Use of heparin/warfarin within 1 month prior to injection

          -  Known allergy or hypersensitivity to fluorescein, indocyanine green or povidone iodine

          -  Contraindication to pupil dilation in either eye

          -  Any condition which precludes patientsâ€™ ability to comply with study requirements
             including completion of the study
