      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate the equivalence, in terms of
      immunogenicity, of three different industrial lots of the investigational vaccine thereby
      supporting consistency of the manufacturing process.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Immunogenicity

      To demonstrate that the investigational vaccine induces an immune response at least as good
      as the one induced by the reference vaccine, in terms of antibody titers.

      To assess the immunogenicity of the investigational vaccine using parameters defined in the
      European Medicines Agency (EMEA) Note for Guidance (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

      Safety:

      To demonstrate that the investigational vaccine is at least as well tolerated as the
      reference vaccine, in terms of defined safety profile.

      To describe the safety profile after vaccination.

      Comfort of the vaccination assessment:

      To assess the pain immediately after the injection using a Verbal Rating Scale. To describe
      the vaccination comfort after the injection using a -Patient-Reported Outcome questionnaire:
      the Vaccination Comfort Questionnaire.
