      The purpose of this study is to determine whether special reading glasses improve children's
      ability to learn to read.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many children are believed to under accommodate (have a lag of accommodation) when looking at
      near targets. If this occurs, the retinal image is out of focus. Children who have a lag of
      accommodation may have difficulty in focusing their eyes at near for long periods of time.
      This difficulty could reduce their ability to read fluently. Children with above average lags
      of accommodation will be randomly assigned to a group which receives special reading glasses
      or a group which does not. The groups will be assessed using a standard test for reading
      fluency.
