  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with sorafenib works in
      treating patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or
      carry tumor-killing substances to them. Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Bevacizumab and sorafenib may also stop
      the growth of melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving bevacizumab together with
      sorafenib may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the clinical biologic activity of sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab, defined as
      the sum of complete response, partial response, and prolonged stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks,
      in patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV malignant melanoma previously treated
      with at least 2 regimens of immunotherapy, cytokines, biologic therapy, or vaccine therapy or
      in previously untreated patients who are not appropriate candidates to receive
      aldesleukin-based treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab in these
      patients.

      II. Evaluate the biologic activity of this regimen, in terms of time to progression,
      progression-free survival at 6 months, and overall survival, in these patients.

      III. Describe significant pharmacokinetic interactions between bevacizumab and sorafenib
      tosylate.

      IV. Characterize the pharmacodynamic relationships between the plasma concentration of
      sorafenib tosylate and bevacizumab and the effects of treatment on normal organ function and
      tumor tissue in these patients.

      V. Identify predictive biomarkers of response to this regimen in these patients.

      VI. Correlate changes in biological measurements with patient outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26 and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Blood samples and tumor biopsies are obtained
      periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. Samples are examined by liquid
      chromatography, mass spectrometry, immunohistochemistry, gene expression analysis, DNA
      mutation analysis, and genomic analysis for biological markers.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.

    <description>Clinical biologic activity of treatment, defined as the sum of complete response, partial response, and prolonged stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks, upon treatment with the combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab, in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma previously treated with immunotherapy or in previously untreated patients who are not appropriate candidates to receive IL-2-based treatment.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started of the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        <title>Response</title>
        <description>Clinical biologic activity of treatment, defined as the sum of complete response, partial response, and prolonged stable disease for ≥ 16 weeks, upon treatment with the combination of sorafenib and bevacizumab, in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma previously treated with immunotherapy or in previously untreated patients who are not appropriate candidates to receive IL-2-based treatment.
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started of the appearance of one or more new lesions. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to quality for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

            <description>Bevacizumab was administered as a 5 mg/kg intravenous dose every 2 weeks. The dose was based on the patient's actual body weight; the dose recalculated if there was a weight change of &gt;10% from baseline.
Sorafenib was administered as a 200 mg oral dose twice daily, for 5 days every 7 days. Courses will be defined as 28-day treatment periods and will be repeated without interruption until development of progressive disease or development of serious drug related toxicities.</description>
