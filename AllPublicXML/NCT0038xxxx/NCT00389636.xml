    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to receive TheraGauze alone or with Regranex to treat diabetic
      foot ulcer condition. The purpose of the study is provide the sponsor with pilot information
      regarding the ability of TheraGauze to promote wound healing on its own and to examine
      synergy with Regranex in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.

      This study will evaluate the use of TheraGauzeT (Soluble Systems, LLC) wound dressing, a
      polymer hydrogel chemically impregnated into a rayon/polyester formed fabric, forming a
      pliable, conforming solid matrix. TheraGauze is FDA Class I exempt (regulation #21CFR,
      product code 5878.4022). It is hypothesized that this material will be useful for the
      treatment of full-thickness diabetic ulcers. It is further hypothesized that this material
      will enhance the action of Regranex (becaplermin) gel by providing an optimal environment for
      this growth factor to function. This study will observe patient outcomes following diabetic
      foot ulcer treatment with TheraGauze and with or without the use of Regranex.
