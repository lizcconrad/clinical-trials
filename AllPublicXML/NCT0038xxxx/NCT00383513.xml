  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epratuzumab is an investigational antibody designed to help treat Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE). The purpose of the study is to obtain additional long-term information
      regarding the safety and efficacy of continued maintenance-cycle administrations of
      Epratuzumab.

      Due to the logistical considerations, UCB has decided to consolidate the Phase II and Phase
      III open-label extension trials. Subjects completing this study will be offered the option of
      continuing to receive epratuzumab through participation in Phase III open-label extension
      study SL0012 (NCT01408576).
