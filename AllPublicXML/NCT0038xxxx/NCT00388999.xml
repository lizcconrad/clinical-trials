  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MBL deficient patients enrolled in this protocol are scheduled to be treated with
      melphalan-based high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) for their multiple myeloma. Patients are randomized to 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0
      mg/kg, or no rhMBL.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MBL deficient patients will be randomized in a ratio of 2:2:1 to receive up to 4 weekly i.v.
      infusions of rhMBL at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg or 1.0 mg/kg, or standard anti-infectious
      prophylactic therapy alone. A total of 20 patients will be treated in each of the rhMBL arms,
      and 10 patients will receive best standard supportive prophylactic therapy but not rhMBL. All
      patients are to receive anti-infectious prophylactic supportive therapy as per institutional
      standards.
