      Persistence of anti-HBs antibodies at Month 24, 30 and 36 in subjects who had completed
      primary vaccination was evaluated. The anamnestic response to a booster dose was evaluated in
      subjects with anti-HBs antibody titres &lt; 10 mIU/ml at previous timepoint. The study also
      evaluated the effect of a booster dose of the vaccine (Month 42) after primary vaccination.
