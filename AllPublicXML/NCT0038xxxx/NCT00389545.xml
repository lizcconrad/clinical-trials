  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the widespread use of effective reperfusion therapies, the patients presenting late
      with large myocardial infarction have poor outcomes. The aim of the study was to investigate
      the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of autologous bone marrow-derived
      mononuclear cells (BMNCs) in patients with large myocardial infarction

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the current era, up to 30% of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction,
      usually those presenting late, show ongoing left ventricular (LV) remodeling and poor
      clinical outcome despite primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Cardiac transfer
      of bone marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells has been investigated as an adjunctive
      therapy to promote regeneration of infarcted myocardium. Therefore, we designed a
      multicenter, randomized study to test the safety and efficacy of intracoronary injection of
      autologous BMNCs in patients with large acute anterior myocardial infarction and late
      presentation, who were treated with successful primary PCI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with the first ST-segment elevation acute anterior myocardial infarction due
             to occlusion of the proximal left anterior ascending coronary artery (LAD), who will
             underwent successful primary stented PCI. Patients are eligible if they have primary
             PCI from 4 to 12 hours after symptoms onset and show reduced LV ejection fraction ≤
             45% with at least 3 akinetic segments in the LAD perfusion territory at echocardiogram
             performed 24 hours after PCI.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria are age ≥ 80 years, cardiogenic shock (Killip IV), multivessel
             coronary artery disease, serious renal or hepatic disease, blood cells disorders,
             documented cancer or terminal illness.
