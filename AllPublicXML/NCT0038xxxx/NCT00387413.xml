  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK189254 is a highly potent histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonist which has demonstrated
      efficacy in the reduction of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia in the chronic
      constriction injury pre-clinical model of neuropathic pain (NP). The mechanism of action of
      GSK 189254 in the pain model is hypothesised to be via enhanced release of monoamines in the
      central nervous system (CNS). A similar mechanism of action has also been shown for
      duloxetine. In this phase I study, the safety and efficacy of GSK189254 will be investigated
      in the electrical hyperalgesia (EH) model in healthy volunteers to build confidence that the
      preclinical efficacy demonstrated by this compound will translate into patients.

      This study will be conducted as a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, incomplete
      block, two period crossover study. Up to 40 healthy male or female volunteers, aged 18-45
      years old, will be randomised into the study in order to achieve 32 evaluable subjects.
      Subjects will undergo two 3-week treatment periods and will be randomised to receive placebo
      and either GSK189254 (up to 100Âµg once daily) or duloxetine (up to 60mg daily). There will be
      a one week washout between treatment periods. The effects of repeated oral dosing of
      GSK189254 and duloxetine on secondary hyperalgesia in the EH model will be determined.

      hyperalgesia, Phase I, Healthy volunteers, Double blind, Safety, tolerability.
