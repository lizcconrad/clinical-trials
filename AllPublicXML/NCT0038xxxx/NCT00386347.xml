    <textblock>
      This study is a two-part study. Part one is designed to see how different formulations of
      GSK364735 are absorbed in the body and To see how food affects how GSK364735 is absorbed in
      the body. Part two is designed to see how repeat dosing affects how GSK364735 is absorbed in
      the body.
