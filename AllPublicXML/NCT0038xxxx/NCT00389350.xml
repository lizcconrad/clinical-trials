      months could improve glucose control in adults with diabetes.

      Background: Recent evidence suggests that tea from Camellia Senensis (e.g., green, oolong and
      black tea) may have a hypoglycemic effect.

      Objective: We evaluated the ability of an extract of green and black tea to improve glucose
      control over a three month period using a double blinded randomized multiple dose (either
      placebo, 375mg or 750mg) study in adults in with Type 2 Diabetes.

      Patients: The 49 subjects who completed this study were predominantly whites with an average
      age of 65, a median duration of Diabetes of 6 years, and 80% reported using hypoglycemic
      medication.

      Measurements: HbA1c at three months was the primary endpoint. Results: After three months the
      mean changes in HbA1c were +0.4, +0.3 and +0.5, in the placebo, 375mg and 750mg arms,
      respectively. The changes were not significantly different between study arms.

      Limitations: Evaluation of a particular extract that contained components of black teas as
      well as green tea. Power insufficient to detect changes in HbA1c &lt; 0.5.

      Conclusions: We did not find a hypoglycemic effect of extract of green tea in adults with
      Type 2 Diabetes, but cannot rule out the possibility that tea may have a small beneficial
      effect.
