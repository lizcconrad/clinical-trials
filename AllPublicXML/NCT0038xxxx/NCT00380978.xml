  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in nulliparous women undergoing induction of labor is to determine
      whether initiation of neuraxial analgesia compared to systemic opioid analgesia early in
      labor (&lt; 4 cm cervical dilation)affects the cesarean delivery rate.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women in early labor frequently request pain medication. Obstetricians may prescribe
      narcotics (administered as an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection). However, IV
      or IM narcotics provide incomplete pain relief and have maternal and fetal/neonatal side
      effects, e.g., maternal drowsiness, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and neonatal
      respiratory depression. Other obstetricians allow their patients to request early neuraxial
      (spinal or epidural) analgesia. The results of several studies comparing patients who
      received epidural versus IV/IM narcotic labor analgesia (not specifically in early
      labor)suggest that initiation of early neuraxial analgesia may be associated with higher
      Cesarean delivery rates. It has been hypothesized that epidural/spinal local anesthetics may
      induce pelvic musculature relaxation leading to failure of fetal descent and rotation.
      However, early pain may be a marker for other factors that increase the risk of Cesarean
      delivery, e.g., large or malpositioned baby, or dysfunctional labor. Whether or not early
      neuraxial analgesia (particularly if narcotic based, which would not cause pelvic muscle
      paralysis) compared to IV/IM narcotics, adversely affects the outcome of labor has not been
      studied in a randomized, prospective fashion. The purpose of this study is to compare
      Cesarean and forcep delivery rates, and quality of pain relief, in first-time mothers
      undergoing induction of labor who receive neuraxial versus IV/IM analgesia for early labor
      (cervical dilation &lt; 4 cm).

    <description>Labor was induced by initiating an oxytocin infusion or by infusing extra-amniotic saline followed by oxytocin. All participants had continuous external electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring and tocodynamometry. Internal fetal scalp electrodes were placed when the external tracing was not interpretable, and intrauterine pressure catheters were used to measure the intensity of contractions when deemed necessary by the obstetricians. Artificial rupture of membranes was performed, and nurses titrated oxytocin infusions according to institutional protocol.</description>

    <description>Infant's Apgar scores measured at 5 minutes of life and were assigned by nurses and pediatricians responsible for neonatal assessment. The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing the five values. The categories are skin color, pulse, reflex to stimulation, muscle tome, and breathing. The test was done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 7 to 10 generally normal.</description>

    <description>Analgesia was initiated in the early group using a standard needle-through-needle technique with intrathecal fentanyl 25 mcg and an epidural test dose of lidocaine 15 mg/ml and epinephrine 5 mcg/ml in 3ml. At the second analgesia request, the cervix was examined. Epidural analgesia was initiated with a dilute bupivicaine/fentanyl solution if the cervix was less than 4 cm. If the cervix was 4 cm or more, epidural analgesia was initiated with bupivicaine 1.25 mg/ml. If no cervical exam was performed at the second request for analgesia, the cervix was assumed to be at least 4 cm dilated. Thereafter, analgesia was maintained in all participants in the early group with patient-controlled epidural analgesia.</description>

    <description>Analgesia was initiated in the late group with hydromorphone 1mg intramuscularly (IM) and 1 mg intravenously (IV). If the cervix was less than 4 cm at the second analgesia request, hydromorphone analgesia was repeated. Epidural analgesia was initiated with bupivicaine 1.25 mg/ml if the cervix was 4 cm or more. At the third analgesia request, epidural analgesia was initiated regardless of cervical dilation. Thereafter, epidural analgesia was maintained with patient controlled analgesia until delivery.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Between October 2001 and December 2006, women presenting at Prentice Women's Hospital for induction of labor and who desired neuraxial analgesia were eligible to participate. Patients were asked to participate by study personnel after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit and gave written informed consent before request for analgesia.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 1,026 women consented to participate. 208 women were excluded because cervical dilation was 4 cm or more at the first analgesia request. Twelve participants were excluded after randomization because they did not receive the allocated intervention and outcome data were not available. The remaining 806 women were included in the analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

All participants had continuous external electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring and tocodynamometry. Internal fetal scalp electrodes were placed when the external tracing was not interpretable, and intrauterine pressure catheters were used to measure the intensity of contractions when deemed necessary by the obstetricians. Artificial rupture of membranes was performed, and nurses titrated oxytocin infusions according to institutional protocol.</description>

        <title>Neonatal Outcome (APGAR Score &lt; 7 at 5 Minutes)</title>
        <description>Infant's Apgar scores measured at 5 minutes of life and were assigned by nurses and pediatricians responsible for neonatal assessment. The Apgar score is determined by evaluating the newborn baby on five simple criteria on a scale from zero to two, then summing the five values. The categories are skin color, pulse, reflex to stimulation, muscle tome, and breathing. The test was done at one and five minutes after birth, and may be repeated later if the score is and remains low. Scores 3 and below are generally regarded as critically low, 4 to 6 fairly low, and 7 to 10 generally normal.</description>
