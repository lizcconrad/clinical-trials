  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if detectable changes in permeability of the lining
      of the colon are caused by either application of HIV microbicide gels or medical procedures,
      such as flexible sigmoidoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is not currently known if procedures used to observe the lining of the distal colon, such
      as endoscopy with or without pinch biopsy, may cause mucosal trauma and thus alter colonic
      permeability. Additionally, the application of topical HIV microbicides (to prevent HIV
      transmission) and shearing forces associated with rectal intercourse might also adversely
      affect the epithelial layer, and thus alter colonic permeability. In order to appropriately
      interpret testing of the effects of topical HIV microbicides on the mucosal lining of the
      distal colon, it is essential to understand whether these procedures themselves, adversely
      affect the epithelial layer. If changes in permeability can be detected, this method may be
      developed to help determine microbicide distribution/toxicity in early phase studies, thus
      improving the selection of candidate microbicides for study in larger scale clinical trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Greater than or equal to 21 years of age

          -  Prior history of receptive anal intercourse (RAI)

          -  Subjects must have a history of using commercially-available personal lubricants for
             RAI.

          -  Ability to provide signed informed consent.

          -  Willingness to abstain from lubricant use and anal receptive intercourse for 48 hours
             prior to and 48 hours after Phases A and B.

          -  Willingness to use a single dose of rectally-applied N-9.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Mental handicap or impaired cognitive performance status as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  Coagulation abnormality which would put the subject at risk for bleeding as judged by
             the Principal Investigator.

          -  History of anorectal surgery within the last month or the presence of any anorectal
             disease or condition that in the judgment of the investigator could affect
             permeability of the rectal mucosa.

          -  Presence of any painful anorectal conditions or anorectal lesions that would be tender
             to manipulation.
