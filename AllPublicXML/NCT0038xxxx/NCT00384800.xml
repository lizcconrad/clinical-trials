      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the overall response rate of tegafur/uracil (UFUR®) and thalidomide in the
      treatment of advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the disease stabilization rate;

        2. To assess the progression-free survival and overall survival;

        3. To establish the safety profile;

        4. To evaluate the changes of circulating factors indicating the angiogenesis activity and
           their correlation with objective tumor response.

      Thalidomide is a glutamic acid derivative first developed in 1950s, was marketed as a
      sedative, tranquilizer, and antiemetic for morning sickness.

      It was withdrawn from the European and Canadian markets in early 1960s because of its
      teratogenic effects . It was not until 1998 when FDA approved thalidomide in the US for the
      treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum , ENL.

      In recent years, thalidomide is emerging as a novel treatment for cancer because of its
      anti-angiogenic properties. The clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in various types of
      human cancers, such as myeloma, hormone-refractory prostate cancer, high-grade glioma, renal
      cell carcinoma, and melanoma.

      UFUR® is a composite drug composed of 100mg tegafur and 224mg uracil (molar ratio:1:4). It
      was marketed as UFT® in Japan and marketed as UFUR® in Taiwan.

      Tegafur, a prodrug of 5-FU, is easily absorbed though the gastro-intestinal tract slowly
      metabolized to 5-FU mainly in liver . Uracil is an inhibitor of dihydro-pyrimidine
      dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate-limiting enzyme of 5-FU degradation.

      Tegafur/urail is expected to maintain a stably high concentration in liver and in
      circulation. Tegafur/uracil has been approved for the indications of advanced gastric cancer
      and colorectal cancer, which are traditionally indicated for the therapy of 5-FU-based
      chemotherapy, in Japan and Taiwan.

      We hypothesize that combination of tegafur/uracil (UFUR®) and thalidomide, both of which have
      been shown to be active in some HCC patients, may be a highly useful regimen for the
      treatment of advanced HCC. There are several rationales underlying this combination. First,
      anti-angiogenesis therapy may improve the efficacy of chemotherapy by normalizing the
      abnormal vasculature in tumors, and thus improving the delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to
      the tumor cells. Second, chemotherapeutic drugs given in a low-dose, un-interrupted, and
      protracted way can induce anti-neoplasm effect through the anti-angiogenesis activity. What
      so-called &quot;metronomic chemotherapy&quot; is based on direct targeting of the activation, growth,
      and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The
      anti-angiogenesis effect of metronomic chemotherapy is suppressed by VEGF/VEGFR signaling
      pathways and thus can be further potentiated by agents blocking those survival signals of
      endothelial cells. In this regard, UFUR appears to be a good candidate for metronomic
      chemotherapy because UFUR and its metabolites have already been shown to inhibit angiogenesis
      in several pre-clinical models.

      The combination of tegafur/uracil (UFUR®) and thalidomide has clinical advantages for
      patients with HCC. Both drugs are orally active, thus are convenient to be given on an
      out-patient basis. More importantly, the low and non-overlapping toxicity profiles of the two
      drugs make the combination relatively safe in patients of HCC.
