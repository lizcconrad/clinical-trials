  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open-label study of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion in patients with advanced
      solid malignancies. The study is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and
      dose-limiting toxicity of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion, and to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of SN2310 and SN-38 following intravenous administration of SN2310
      Injectable Emulsion. Additionally, evaluation of side effects as a function of dose, and
      observation of any anti-tumor effects of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion will be made.

      This is a Phase 1 open-label study of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion in patients with advanced
      solid malignancies who have failed conventional therapy. SN2310 Injectable Emulsion will be
      administered intravenously every 21 days. The study is designed to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion; to characterize the
      pharmacokinetics of SN2310 and SN-38 following intravenous administration of SN2310
      Injectable Emulsion; to evaluate side effects as a function of dose level; and, to observe
      any anti-tumor effects of SN2310 Injectable Emulsion.
