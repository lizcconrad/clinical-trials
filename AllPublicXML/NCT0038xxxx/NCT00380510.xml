      This study used a card study design to allow volunteer physicians to record research data in
      the context of providing clinical care. The method was brief, simple, and convenient for busy
      practicing clinicians.

      Volunteer resident physicians and faculty carried data collection checklists in their pockets
      and completed one for every adolescent patient seen during a randomly selected two week
      period. Physicians attempted to collect data on ten consecutive encounters with teen patients
      aged 11-21 years. The checklist documented patient characteristics (age, gender and
      ethnicity), reason for visit, parent presence, and types of prevention issues discussed
      during the visit. Patient and visit information was collected to assess its influence on
      physician prevention discussions. Finally, the checklist asked open-ended questions related
      to barriers to and facilitators to teen prevention discussions.

      The study involved five clinical sites comprising approximately 140 faculty and resident
      family physicians. The investigators sought 10-15 volunteer physicians from each site (60-90
      physicians), and asked them to complete data checklists on 10 consecutive adolescent patients
      (600-900 visits). After a training session, each site randomly selected data collection
      periods.

      Physicians provided usual care for adolescent patients and recorded on the checklists any
      prevention discussions during the visit.
