  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a stepped-care intervention makes pain symptoms
      better and reduces activity limitations because of pain. Our two primary hypotheses are that
      in OIF/OEF veterans with chronic pain:

        1. Stepped care is more effective than usual care in reducing pain-related disability

        2. Stepped care is more effective than usual care in reducing psychological distress
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial we aim to develop and
      test a stepped-care intervention to improve functional and work-related outcomes in Operation
      Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
      Stepped-care involves starting with lower intensity, less costly treatments initially (Step
      1) and &quot;stepping up&quot; to more intensive, costly, or complex treatments in patients with
      inadequate response (Step 2). The study design will be a randomized controlled trial. The
      stepped care approach will involve 12 weeks of a pain self-management program in Step 1
      followed by 12 weeks of brief cognitive behavioral therapy in participants with inadequate
      improvement in pain-related disability (Step 2). Patients treated in usual care will be the
      control group. Thus, the primary objective of the ESCAPE trial is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of a stepped care intervention vs. usual care
      in OIF/OEF veterans with chronic and disabling musculoskeletal pain and evaluate the impact
      of this intervention on pain-related disability, work function, psychological distress, and
      secondary outcomes.

    <measure>Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 24-item pain specific disability questionnaire consisting of 24 questions which are related specifically to physical functions that are likely to be affected by back pain. The questionnaire is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the subject (0-24 range). Greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory (Interference)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is an 7-item measure that provides scores for pain-related functional impairment. The seven (7) pain interference items are rated on a simple numeric rating scale from 0-10. On the scale 0 represents &quot;no interference&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot;. The pain interference score is achieved by taking the total of all seven (7) scores and dividing it by the number of items (7).</description>

        <description>This is a 24-item pain specific disability questionnaire consisting of 24 questions which are related specifically to physical functions that are likely to be affected by back pain. The questionnaire is scored by adding up the number of items checked by the subject (0-24 range). Greater levels of disability are reflected by higher numbers.</description>

Pain self-management program : The pain self-management program is delivered by a nurse care-manager during a 12-week period. Sessions are each 45 minutes long and phone-based. They occur at baseline, week 1, week 3, week 6, week 9, and week 12.
Cognitive behavioral therapy : Cognitive behavioral therapy is delivered by phone by a nurse care-manager 6 times over a 12-week period. Sessions last approximately 45 minutes and occur at weeks 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 of the study.

        <description>This is an 7-item measure that provides scores for pain-related functional impairment. The seven (7) pain interference items are rated on a simple numeric rating scale from 0-10. On the scale 0 represents &quot;no interference&quot; and 10 is &quot;completely interferes&quot;. The pain interference score is achieved by taking the total of all seven (7) scores and dividing it by the number of items (7).</description>
