  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study analyzes the virological response in plasma and non-plasma compartments, as well as
      the degree and kinetics of immune reconstitution in 70 treatment-naive patients with CD4 &lt;
      100/mm3, when they receive treatment with two nucleoside analogs (NRTI) plus one protease
      inhibitor (PI) compared with 2 NRTI plus one non-nucleoside (NNRTI).
