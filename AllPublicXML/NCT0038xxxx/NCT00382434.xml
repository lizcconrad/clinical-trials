  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Emergency Department (ED) is a unique environment in medicine, and many safety mechanisms
      used in other hospital settings cannot be applied in the ED. For example, clinical
      pharmacists have traditionally provided extra layers of protection to hospital inpatients by
      cross-checking provider orders for appropriate dosing, contraindications, and interactions.
      Because medications in the ED must be accessed immediately and are often one-time doses, the
      use of central pharmacy services would introduce an unacceptable delay to the administration
      of medication. Although some hospitals have programs in place in which a pharmacist responds
      to the ED for cardiac arrests or trauma team activations, few have reported programs which
      involve a clinical pharmacist assigned exclusively to the emergency department. Nonetheless,
      published reports have asserted that ED-based pharmacists can increase patient safety.
      Although this concept appears logical, no study has attempted to show that these programs
      reduce potential adverse drug events in the ED. We propose to implement and optimize an ED
      Pharmacist (EDP) program as a safe practice intervention in a large ED. The hospital has
      provided funding for two permanent full time positions starting at the beginning of the award
      period. In the initial phase interviews of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and patients will
      be conducted and the results will be used to optimize the EDP role. A large-scale chart
      review study will then be conducted to evaluate whether there is a reduction in frequency of
      potential and adverse drug events during times that the EDP is on duty. Staff perceptions of
      the effectiveness of this program will also be evaluated. The overall goal of this initiative
      is to create an effective EDP program that will decrease the rate of adverse drug events in
      ED patients, and to create a &quot;toolkit&quot; to facilitate the introduction of similar programs
      into other EDs. This toolkit will include a description of the formal, optimized role of the
      EDP, challenges and solutions in implementation, and evidence to support the efficacy of such
      a program.
