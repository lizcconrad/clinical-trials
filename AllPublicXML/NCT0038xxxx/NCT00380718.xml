      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of pemetrexed dosing that is
      tailored to individual patient tolerance in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC).

    <measure>Proportion of Participants With a Complete or Partial Response (Objective Response Rate [ORR])</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to measured progressive disease (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of participants who achieved a best response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) (responders) based on the RECIST criteria. ORR=(CR+PR)/Number of Participants. The RECIST define when cancer patients improve (&quot;respond&quot;), stay the same (&quot;stabilize&quot;), or worsen (&quot;progression&quot;) during treatments.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants With a Best Overall Response of Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), and Stable Disease (SD) (Disease Control Rate [DCR])</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to measured progressive disease (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>DCR was defined as the proportion of best overall response of CR, PR, and SD. DCR=(CR+PR+SD)/Number of participants. Response was evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Complete Response=disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response=30% decrease in sum of longest diameter of target lesions; Stable Disease=small changes that do not meet above criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to date of death from any cause (includes post-treatment follow-up of up to 18 months post-Last Patient Entered Treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is the duration from enrollment to death from any cause. For patients who are alive, overall survival is censored at the last follow-up visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to measured progressive disease or death from any cause (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to PFS was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of the first of the following events: objective disease progression or death due to any cause. Survival time frame includes post-treatment follow-up of up to 18 months post-Last Patient Entered Treatment. Patients were censored if their disease had not progressed, treatment was discontinued due to an undocumented progression or toxicity/other reason, onset of new anti-tumor therapy or otherwise experienced death/progression after more than one missed (assessment) visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response</measure>
    <time_frame>time of response to measured progressive disease or death from any cause (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of overall tumor response was measured from the time of first documentation of complete response or partial response (whichever status was first recorded) until the date of progression-free survival, with censoring defined as: disease had not progressed, treatment was discontinued due to undocumented progression or toxicity/other reason, onset of new anti-tumor therapy or otherwise experienced death/progression after more than one missed (assessment) visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to early treatment discontinuation or measured progressive disease or death from any cause (assessments every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure was define as the time from the date of enrollment to the date of the first of the following events: objective disease progression, death due to any cause, treatment discontinuation for undocumented progression, early treatment discontinuation for toxicity or other reason, or new anticancer treatment started. Time to treatment failure for participants who were still participating in the study without treatment failure at the time of analysis were treated as censored at the date of the last tumor assessment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Tumor Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to measured progressive disease (Tumor assessments were performed every 2 cycles during therapy and 6-8 weeks during post-therapy until documented disease progression, or up to 18 months after enrollment)</time_frame>
    <description>Time to documented tumor progression was defined as the time from the date of enrollment to the first date of documented disease progression. Time to documented disease progression was censored at the date of death for participants who had not had documented disease progression. Otherwise, the censoring rules were the same as for Progression-Free Survival.</description>
