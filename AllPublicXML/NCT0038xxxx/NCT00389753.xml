      Comparison between use of Aruba Aloë formula F-BC-096 and control.

    <textblock>
      Patients with two equal donor sites will be selected for inclusion. After wound healing one
      donor site will be treated with Aruba Aloë Formula F-BC-096 while a control product will be
      applied to the second site.

      If pressure garments are applied they must be equal for both donor sites. During follow-ups
      objective methods will be used to evaluate elasticity and colour of the scar.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have two similar donor sites, identical in depth and wound treatment.

          -  Healing time of both donor sites may differ by 3 days maximum.

          -  Flux values determined by Laser Doppler Imaging before commencement of the therapy
             must be approximately similar.

          -  If possible, the donor sites to be compared must have the same location.

          -  Patient compliance with therapy in relation to the protocol is necessary. In case of
             pediatric patiënts this depends on collaboration of the parents.

          -  For the two donor sites to be compared, the entire after-treatment concerning pressure
             garments or eventual silicone sheets must be equal for both donor sites.

          -  Patients must be available for regular and necessary follow-up.

          -  Possibility to finish all measurements during follow-up visits.

          -  Written authorisation of the patient, family or parents is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Donor sites are not similar (not identical in: depth, wound treatment, healing time
             and flux values)

          -  Children requiring sedation for LDI of donor sites

          -  Not following the complete treatment schedule or missing some evaluations during the
             follow-up period

          -  Patient has any condition(s) that seriously compromises the patient's ability to
             complete this study.

          -  Patient has participated in another study utilizing an investigational drug or device
             within the previous 30 days

          -  Patient has one or more medical condition(s), diabetes, including renal, hepatic,
             hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the investigator
             would make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this study

          -  Patients wish to terminate the study

          -  No informed consent before start of the trial
