  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether the combination of the established
      chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil(5-FU) and the large carbohydrate molecule GM-CT-01 is
      beneficial in treating advanced gall bladder and bile duct cancer.

      Determine the overall response rate (ORR) defined as complete response (CR)rate plus partial
      response (PR) rate using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), as well as
      the stable disease (SD) rate in subjects with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic
      cholangiocarcinoma or other biliary tract tumors treated with GM-CT-01 plus 5-Fluorouracil
      (DAVFU) at doses of 280 mg/m2 and 600 mg/m2, respectively, during cycles of 4 consecutive
      days of treatment followed by a 24-day follow-up period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older.

          2. Histologically or cytologically documented carcinoma primary to the intra- or
             extra-hepatic biliary system or gall bladder with clinical and/or radiologic evidence
             of unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease.

          3. Prior neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy (including radiation therapy) is allowed
             provided it was completed at least 4 weeks before documented disease recurrence or
             metastasis.

          4. Discontinuation of radiation therapy at least 3 weeks prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.
             Radiation therapy will not be allowed while a subject is on study except for
             palliative radiation therapy to non-target lesions administered following consultation
             with the Medical Monitor.

          5. Prior surgery must have been completed at least 14 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1.

          6. Nne or more measurable target lesion(s) according to RECIST. Measurable lesion(s) must
             be outside of previous radiation field or demonstrate clear radiographic progression
             on serial imaging if within previous treatment field.

          7. ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.

          8. Life expectancy greater or equal to 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Central nervous system metastasis.

          2. Bony metastasis as the sole metastasis.

          3. Received prior chemotherapy or anti-angiogenesis agents including bevacizumab or
             erbitux or radiation therapy other than in a neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting. No
             concomitant chemotherapy, anti-tumor biologic therapy, or radiation therapy is
             allowed.

          4. If nitrosoureas or mitomycin C were used as neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy, then at
             least 6 weeks should have elapsed prior to treatment with DAVFU.

          5. Active infection that requires treatment with systemic antibiotic, anti- fungal. or
             anti-viral therapy.

          6. Congestive heart failure (Class III or IV in the NYHA functional classification
             system) or any other medical condition that would preclude the IV administration of up
             to approximately 200 mL of fluid over 30-60 minutes.

          7. Unresolved biliary tract obstruction.

          8. Known or clinically suspected infection with HIV.

          9. Subject has a known intolerance to 5- FU.
