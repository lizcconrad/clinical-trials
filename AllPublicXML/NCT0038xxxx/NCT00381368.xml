  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy and safety of a three time repeated
      loading dose of intravenous ibandronate (ibandronic acid), 6 mg, in breast cancer patients
      with painful skeletal metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Painful skeletal metastases are a common site of advanced disease. For instance, in breast
      cancer, and despite cancer treatments (radiotherapy, cytotoxic treatment and adequate
      treatment of pain), the patients often need additional treatments that may relieve their
      symptoms. Bisphosphonates, such as ibandronic acid, have in pilot studies shown a significant
      decrease in pain scores, both after loading dose and after long-term treatment. In this study
      the safety and efficacy of an intravenous loading dose of three times 6 mg ibandronate during
      three consecutive days in breast cancer patients with painful skeletal metastases will be
      studied.
