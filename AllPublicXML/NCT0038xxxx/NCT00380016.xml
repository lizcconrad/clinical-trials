      This study offers catheter-based treatment of heart or artery disease. This protocol permits
      treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who may not be eligible to participate in
      current research protocols. The treatment offered in this protocol is not experimental, but
      rather standard treatment provided in most large referral hospitals in the United States.

      Patients 18 years of age and older who are candidates for catheter-based treatment of
      obstructive artery disease, including blocked blood flow in a coronary artery (artery to the
      heart) or in an artery of the arm, leg, brain or kidney may be eligible for this study.
      Candidates are screened with a general medical evaluation that may include blood tests,
      magnetic resonance imaging, and monitoring of heart rate and rhythm.

      Participants undergo angioplasty or stenting for blockage in an artery to the heart or an
      artery of the arm, leg, brain or kidney. The procedure uses a balloon-tipped catheter to open
      the blocked artery and likely requires permanent implantation of a metal tube (stent) to
      improve blood flow through the vessel. During the procedure, the patient is given a sedative
      and pain medication, if needed.

    <textblock>
      The NHLBI is developing novel minimally invasive catheter-based treatments for cardiovascular
      disease. These investigational treatments require that physicians, nurses and technical staff
      maintain and expand their technical skills in the conduct of conventional catheter-based
      treatments.

      This protocol permits treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who are not
      necessarily eligible to participate in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of
      medical interest for the purpose of training professional staff, or who may be eligible for
      adjunctive investigational imaging during clinical treatment. Efforts will be made to offer
      treatment to patients with limited financial resources or with limited access to specialty
      health care.

      This protocol also provides a mechanism to offer catheter-based treatment of cardiovascular
      disease to patients, so that they may participate in technical development protocols in
      cardiovascular intervention or in cardiovascular imaging.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adult men and women with cardiovascular disease will be eligible to participate in this
        training protocol.

          1. Adult men and women, age 18 years or older

          2. Eligible for catheter-based treatment. A representative list of diseases and
             catheter-based treatments includes:

               -  Obstructive coronary artery disease manifest as myocardial infarction, angina
                  pectoris, angina-equivalent, ischemic dysrhythmia, or evidence of ischemia or
                  viability on non-invasive cardiovascular testing

               -  Obstructive peripheral artery disease manifest as intermittent claudication,
                  limb-threatening ischemia, visceral ischemia, or obstructive extracranial
                  cerebrovascular disease

               -  Structural heart disease including patent foramen ovale, atrial septal defect,
                  ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, and valvular heart disease

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Subjects are excluded if catheter-based therapy is unsuitable, in the opinion of the
        operating cardiologist.

          1. Pregnant women

          2. Inability of patient or surrogate to provide informed consent.
