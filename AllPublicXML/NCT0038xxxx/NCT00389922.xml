    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Lapatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vinorelbine, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving lapatinib together with vinorelbine may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of lapatinib when
      given together with vinorelbine in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of 2 different schedules of lapatinib ditosylate
           when administered with vinorelbine ditartrate in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Examine tissue and blood specimens from these patients to investigate potential
           predictors of response.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of lapatinib ditosylate and vinorelbine ditartrate in
           patients treated at the MTD.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I study comprising 2 separate, sequential dose-escalation studies of
      lapatinib ditosylate. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group A (daily dosing): Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days
           1-28 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of lapatinib ditosylate until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity during course 1. At least 6
      patients are treated at the MTD. Once the MTD of lapatinib has been determined, patients may
      be accrued to group B or to a separate pharmacokinetics cohort in group A.

        -  Pharmacokinetics (PK) cohort*: Patients in the PK cohort receive vinorelbine ditartrate
           IV as in group A and oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily at the MTD on days 3-28
           (course 1 only) and on days 1-28 in all subsequent courses. Patients undergo PK sampling
           during course 1.

      NOTE: *Accrual to group B and to the PK cohort of group A may occur simultaneously.

        -  Group B (intermittent dosing): Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily at
           the MTD on days 2-5, 9-12, and 16-25 and vinorelbine ditartrate IV, on days 1, 8, and
           15.

      In both groups and in the PK cohort, treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have completed 6
      courses of combined therapy may receive additional courses with lapatinib ditosylate alone.

      Patients undergo blood collection and buccal brushings periodically for pharmacokinetic and
      biomarker correlative studies. Archival tumor tissue is also evaluated for biomarkers,
      including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2/neu expression levels, EGFR
      polymorphisms and gene mutations (including RAS), levels of cellular proliferation and
      apoptosis, and RAS mutations by immunohistochemistry, mutation analysis, TUNEL assay, and
      polymerase chain reaction.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.

             this protocol and all side effects (except alopecia) resolved to grade 1 or less. Any
             prior radiation must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior to start of therapy.
             For prior mitomycin chemotherapy a 6-week interval is required. Patients must have

             echocardiogram or MUGA scan.

          -  Asymptomatic treated brain metastasis may be included if they are neurologically
             stable and have been off steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks.

          -  Able to take and retain oral medication.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive method

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have previously received lapatinib, vinorelbine or any other EGFR-1

          -  Symptomatic brain metastasis or still requiring steroids and anticonvulsants may not
             participate.

          -  Pre-existing neuropathy &gt; grade 2 may not participate.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements, will be excluded.

          -  History of other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding or
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect the
             interpretation of the results of the study or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          -  Gastrointestinal tract disease resulting in an inability to take oral medication or a
             requirement for IV alimentation, or prior surgical procedures affecting absorption.

          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with lapatinib.

          -  Patients requiring oral anticoagulants are eligible provided there is appropriate
             close INR monitoring is in place. If medically appropriate and treatment available,
             the investigator may also consider switching these patients to LMW heparin, where an
             interaction with lapatinib is not expected.

          -  Adherence to the requirements for concomitant medications classified as CYP3A4
             inducers or inhibitors, or gastric pH modifiers
