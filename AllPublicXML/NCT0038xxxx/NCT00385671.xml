          <description>The LSEQ assesses the effects of psychoactive compounds on sleep and early morning behavior. Participants mark a series of 100 mm line analogue scales, indicating the direction and magnitude of any changes in behavioral state they experience following administration of the drug. Scores are represented in millimeters, higher scores indicate better sleep and better early morning behvior. Subscale score ranges: going to sleep=0-300, quality of sleep=0-200, awakening=0-200, behavior following wakefullness=0-300.</description>

The CSFQ is a structured interview/questionnaire, which is designed to measure medication related changes in sexual functioning. The CSFQ measures five dimensions of sexual behavior: pleasure; desire/frequency; desire/interest; arousal; and orgasm. The CSFQ total score is also obtained across all 5 dimensions and ranges from 14 to 70. Subscale score ranges: desire/frequency=2-10; desire/interest=3-15; pleasure=1-5; arousal=3-15; orgasm=3-15. Higher scores indicate greater changes.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks in Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) Subscales of Ease of Going to Sleep (GTS), Awakening (AFS), and Behavior Following Wakefulness (BFW), Quality of Sleep (QOS)</title>
        <description>The LSEQ assesses the effects of psychoactive compounds on sleep and early morning behavior. Participants mark a series of 100 mm line analogue scales, indicating the direction and magnitude of any changes in behavioral state they experience following administration of the drug. Scores are represented in millimeters, higher scores indicate better sleep and better early morning behavior. Subscale score ranges: GTS=0-300, QOS=0-200, AFS=0-200, BFW=0-300. Least-squares means represent adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>

        <description>The SDS is completed by the patient and is used to assess the effect of the patient's symptoms on their work/social/family life. Total scores range from 0 to 30, higher values indicate greater disruption in the patient's life. Item 1 assesses the effect of the patient's symptoms on their work/school schedule, Item 2 on their social life/leisure activities, and Item 3 on their family life/home responsibilities. Subscales scores range: 0-10, higher values indicate greater disruption in the patient's life. Least-squares means represent adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire (CSFQ) Total Score and Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>14-item subject-rated scale assessing medication related changes in sexual activity + functioning. Structured interview/questionnaire. It measures five dimensions of sexual behavior: pleasure; desire/frequency; desire/interest; arousal; and orgasm. The total score is obtained across all 5 dimensions, ranging from 14 to 70. Subscale score ranges: desire/frequency=2-10; desire/interest=3-15; pleasure=1-5; arousal=3-15; orgasm=3-15. Higher scores = better sexual functioning. Least-squares means: adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>

          <description>14-item subject-rated scale assessing medication related changes in sexual activity + functioning. Structured interview/questionnaire.

        <description>14-item subject-rated scale assessing changes in sexual activity and functioning; structured interview/questionnaire, designed to measure medication related changes in sexual functioning. 5 dimensions of sexual behavior: pleasure; desire/frequency; desire/interest; arousal; orgasm. Total score: obtained across all 5 dimensions, ranges from 14 to 70. Subscale scores: desire/frequency=2-10; desire/interest=3-15; pleasure=1-5; arousal=3-15; orgasm=3-15. Higher scores = better sexual functioning. Categories: better=positive change in score; same=no change in score; worse=negative change in score.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to 12 Weeks in Portland Neurotoxicity Scale - Total Score and Subscale Scores</title>
        <description>The Portland Neurotoxicity Scale is a 15-item, patient-completed questionnaire designed to assess the degree of impact of anti-epileptic drug therapy on a number of cognitive and somatomotor parameters. The total score ranges from 15-135 with higher scores indicating more toxicity. The cognitive toxicity score ranges from 10-90 and the somatomotor toxicity score ranges from 5-45, for both higher scores indicate more toxicity. Least-squares means represent adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>

        <description>A 21-item, patient-completed questionnaire to assess characteristics of depression. Each of the 21 items corresponding to a symptom of depression is summed to give a single score. There is a four-point scale for each item ranging from 0 to 3. Total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe. Least-squares means represent adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>

        <title>Weekly Mean Change in 24 Hour Average Pain Severity by Week by Gabapentin Exposure Subgroup (de Novo Versus Prior Use)</title>
        <description>This is an ordinal scale with scores from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain). Data presented represent the weekly mean of the scores of the average pain severity over the last 24 hours. Scores are based on daily assessments recorded by patients in their diaries. De novo: use of gabapentin for &lt;56 contiguous days prior to randomization. Prior use: use of gabapentin for &gt;=56 contiguous days prior to randomization. Least-squares means represent adjustment due to baseline severity and investigative site.</description>
