  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A preliminary study has shown that the hormone-similar, growth-retarding drug octreotide can
      prolong survival time in patients with primary liver cancer. Due to methodological
      deficiencies of the preliminary study the results will be re-checked by the comparison of
      octreotide with an pseudo-drug (so-called placebo) primarily regarding to the survival time
      and secondarily concerning costs, side effects, patient cooperation and quality of life as
      well as specific conditions in the tumor tissue in both groups with 108 patients with primary
      liver cancer.

      A pilot study showed that octreotide can prolong survival time of patients with HCC. Due to
      methodological deficiencies the results of this pilot study will be re-evaluated by
      comparison of octreotide versus placebo primarily regarding to the global survival time and
      secondarily concerning the costs, side effects, patient compliance and quality of life as
      well as the Somatostatin receptors in the tumor tissue and its prognostic relevance in both
      groups with 108 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

      An interim analysis was done after occurrence of the half of the events (deaths). No
      significant effect could be shown.

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the last 4 weeks.

          -  Simultaneous participation in another clinical examination.

          -  Legally incapacitated patient, who is not able, to understand nature, meaning and

          -  Preliminary or current therapy with tamoxifen

          -  Pretreatment of the HCC.

          -  First-time diagnosis &gt; 6 months before inclusion into the study.
