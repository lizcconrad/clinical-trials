      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response.
      Incomplete Freund's adjuvant may stimulate the immune system in different ways and may help
      the vaccine work better. Colony-stimulating factors, such as GM-CSF, may increase the number
      of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Giving vaccine therapy together
      with incomplete Freund's adjuvant and GM-CSF may be an effective treatment for patients with
      HIV.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with
      incomplete Freund's adjuvant and GM-CSF works in treating patients with HIV.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the safety of vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide with incomplete Freund's
           adjuvant in combination with sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with HIV who are HLA-A2
           positive.

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic
           T-cell response, defined by ELISPOT assay, in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on HIV viral load and CD4 count in
           these patients.

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the development of lamivudine or emtricitabine resistance in
           patients who subsequently receive lamivudine or emtricitabine.

        -  Explore, preliminarily, the ability of E1M184V peptide vaccine to induce a cytotoxic
           T-cell response as assessed by HLA-A2 class I tetramers and intracellular interferon
           gamma production after stimulation with E1M184V.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive vaccination comprising E1M184V peptide and incomplete Freund's adjuvant
      subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 in weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Patients also receive sargramostim
      (GM-CSF) SC immediately after vaccination and once daily on days 1-4. Some patients do not
      receive GM-CSF after the first 2 doses of vaccine. Treatment continues in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection at baseline and at 4, 12, 20, 36, and 52 weeks for
      biomarker/laboratory analysis. Assays may include immunoenzyme techniques and viral
      genotyping.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
