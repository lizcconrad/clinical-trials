      To compare the efficacy of tegafur/uracil (UFT) plus folinate calcium (leucovorin: LV)
      administered orally and UFT plus Krestin (PSK) administered orally enrolling patients with
      pTNM stage IIB or III colorectal cancer as subjects in a multicenter collaborative randomized
      open-label comparative controlled study and consequently to determine the usefulness of the
      above regimens as adjuvant therapy after surgery.
