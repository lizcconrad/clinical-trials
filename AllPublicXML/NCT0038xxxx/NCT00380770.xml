  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)is the commonest malignancy associated with HIV/AIDS. Therapy for this
      cancer, which causes substantial morbidity, is suboptimal in resource poor settings. The
      reasons for this are: advanced state of immunosuppression when patients present for clinical
      care, concomitant opportunistic infections, non- availability of antiretroviral therapy
      (ART), non-availability and toxicity of chemotherapy (CXT), when available, in patients with
      full blown AIDS, prohibitive costs of bone marrow support and fiscal constraints in resource
      poor settings.

      A recent Cochrane Review assessed the effectiveness of current therapeutic regimens for HIV
      KS, with a focus on options available in resource poor settings. The major selection criteria
      for this review were randomized controlled trials for HIV KS in adults. The main conclusions
      were that data from randomized controlled trials on effective treatments for HIV KS are
      sparse, particularly among people who are also taking highly active antiretroviral therapy
      (HAART). Alitretinoin gel is effective for therapy of cutaneous lesions, pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin is effective for advanced KS and radiotherapy is effective for treating cutaneous
      lesions. Apart from the randomized trial of radiotherapy, no trials applicable to developing
      settings were identified. Therapy of HIV KS in developing countries thus remains unanswered.

      The authors concluded that therapies discussed in the review are unlikely to be available or
      affordable in developing countries where the bulk of HIV infection and KS occur, apart from
      radiotherapy at a few tertiary centers. However, recent changes in pricing due to the global
      alliance and access initiatives mean that HAART is likely to be more available and accessible
      to developing countries in the near future. South Africa now has committed to this at cabinet
      level and had a task force to address this issue.

      HAART has been proposed as therapy for HIV KS on the basis of restoring immune competence and
      minimizing the HIV tat drive to KS formation. It also improves immunologic control of HHV 8
      possibly through interrupting the HIV-1- HHV-8 interaction.

      There has been only one randomised trial conducted in Spain which compared HAART to the
      combination of HAART and CXT. There is to date no prospective, randomised controlled trial
      which compares the efficacy of HAART to the standard of care in HIV KS in Africa.

      DETAILED METHODOLOGY

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      1.To compare the clinical response of HIV KS at month 12 in patients treated with HAART alone
      with those treated with the combination of HAART and chemotherapy (CXT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To monitor safety, tolerance and adverse events associated with each regimen.

        2. To compare the impact of each regimen at baseline and months 12 on:

             1. CD4 count

             2. HIV1 viral load in blood

             3. HIV disease progression

        3. To compare the impact of each regimen on the patients Quality of life (QOL).

        4. To compare the impact of each regimen on the patients adherence to HAART. 5 To measure
           and compare HHV8 viral load and HHV8 specific CTL responses at baseline and month 12 to
           each regimen.(in blood and tissue specimens )

      DESIGN Prospective, randomized, open- labeled trial

      RANDOMISATION Patients first staged into GOOD risk and POOR risk groups according to ACTG
      criteria. Thereafter 4 digit computer generated numbers after staging which assign patients
      to HAART alone or HAART plus CXT to ensure that equal numbers of GOOD and POOR risk patients
      are assigned to each group.

      INTERVENTION Arm 1. HAART These patients will be given one tablet twice daily of Triomune®
      (Cipla, Mumbai) Stavudine 40mg b.d &gt; 60 kg , 30mg bd &lt;60kg Lamivudine 150mg b.d &gt; 50 kg
      2mg/kg &lt; 50 kg Nevirapine 200mg b.d ( 200mg daily for first 2 weeks)

      Arm 2. CTX PLUS HAART HAART will be given as above. In addition, CTX will be administered at
      2 weekly intervals in the Oncology Dept at KEH VIII Hospital and will consist of:-
      Intramuscular Bleomycin 10 U/m2 ; Intravenous Vincristine 1.4mg/m2 maximum 2mg and
      Intravenous Doxorubicin 20mg/m2.

      This regimen will be given at 2 weekly intervals. This will be supplied by the Department of
      Oncology, KwaZulu Natal Province.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINTS

        1. Clinical response of KS

             -  Clinical photographs taken of marker lesions (5 according to AMC criteria) will be
                taken at baseline, month 6 and 12.

             -  Lesion measurement of 5 marker lesions (as per AMC RKS 02 )(www.amc.uab.edu) will
                be done at baseline, month 3, month 6, month 9 and month 12. Responses will be
                categorized as complete response(only with biopsy confirmation), complete clinical
                response, partial response, stable disease and disease progression according to
                ACTG criteria.

             -  The patients will be assessed by a specialist dermatologist, trained to use the
                above instruments, and will be the same individual so as to decrease bias
                introduced with inter-observer variability. We recognize that there is the
                potential for bias as the study is not blinded and dermatologist will know patient
                assignment. For that reason, we are using established objective criteria to
                evaluate response.

             -  Biopsies will be performed at baseline, month 6 and month 12 to assist in
                confirming response and to evaluate HIV and HHV8 tissue viral loads

        2. Safety and toxicity by DAIDS Toxicity criteria

        3. QOL by EORTC QLQ C30

        4. Adherence by 7 day adherence questionnaire Adherence will be measured using a
           standardized validated self administered questionnaire, which enables review of each
           medication during previous 7 days and a medication specific and overall adherence score.
