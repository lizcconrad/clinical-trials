  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition and altered protein catabolism are serious problems in renal failure and
      hemodialysis (HD) patients. The purpose of this study is to characterize the safety of
      GHRP-1/AG in subjects with ESRD on HD; to characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of GHRP-1/AG
      in subjects with ESRD on HD by following GH and IGF-1; to describe the relationship between
      GHRP-1 PD and plasma concentrations of GHRP-1 and des-Ala-GHRP-1; and to evaluate the
      preliminary efficacy of GHRP-1/AG on nutritional status of subjects with ESRD on HD using
      subjective global assessment of malnutrition inflammation scores (MIS) and changes in caloric
      intake.

      This is a randomized, cross-over, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study. Subjects will
      receive single subcutaneous injections of the active GHRP-1/AG study treatment and vehicle
      control (ATRIGEL delivery system) in a randomized sequence. Each injection will be followed
      by a 4-week period of treatment exposure and a 2-week period of washout/follow-up. Treatments
      will be administered on the 2nd dialysis day of a 3x/week dialysis schedule. The total
      duration of study participation will be 12 weeks. Safety will be followed throughtout the
      study with vital signs, electrocardiogram, clinical chemistry and hematology parameters,
      endocrine parameters, adverse events, and concomitant medications. PD effects of GHRP-1/AG
      will be evaluated by measuring GH, ICF-1, IGF-BP3, prolactin, and cortisol. Efficacy will be
      evaluated throughout the study with MIS, caloric intake, nPCR, dry weight, BMI, and albumin,
      BUN, creatinine, calcium, potassium, HGB, HCT, and CBC.
