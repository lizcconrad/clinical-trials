  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the drug levels of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine
      found when given to pregnant women for the prevention of malaria to those found in pregnant
      women given the same drug with artesunate for the treatment of malaria, and also with those
      drug levels found in non-pregnant women in other malaria treatment studies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pregnancy increases the risk of malaria progression and complications with up to a 10-fold
      increase in the malaria case fatality rate in areas of low transmission.
      Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is used widely in Africa for the systematic intermittent
      presumptive, or preventive, treatment (IPTp) during the second and third trimester of
      pregnancy and a national program of IPTp with SP has been implemented recently in Mozambique.
      There is evidence that the kinetics of several other antimalarial drugs are altered in
      pregnancy to the extent that doses are not adequate in pregnancy, however no published study
      has included a pharmacokinetic component to confirm that standard doses of SP are optimal in
      this vulnerable patient group. This study therefore creates the opportunity to study whether
      the pharmacokinetic properties of SP are altered by physiological changes that occur during
      pregnancy.
