    <measure>Titers for Serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>Titers are presented as geometric mean titers (GMTs). The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/New Caledonia, A/Wisconsin and B/Malaysia. The seropositivity cut-off assay was 1:10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Seroconverted Subjects Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/New Caledonia, A/Wisconsin and B/Malaysia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Seroprotected Subjects Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 0 and Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>A seroprotected subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had a serum HI titer ≥ 1:40. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/New Caledonia, A/Wisconsin and B/Malaysia.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seroconversion Factor for Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) Antibodies Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 21</time_frame>
    <description>The seroconversion factor (SCF) was defined as the fold increase in serum Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) geometric mean titers (GMTs) post vaccination compared to Day 0. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/New Caledonia, A/Wisconsin and B/Malaysia.</description>

          <title>Number of Seroconverted Subjects Against 3 Strains of Influenza Disease.</title>
          <description>A seroconverted subject was defined as a vaccinated subject who had either a pre-vaccination titer &lt;1:10 and a post-vaccination titer ≥1:40 or a pre-vaccination titer ≥1:10 and at least a four-fold increase in post-vaccination titer. The 3 influenza strains assessed were A/New Caledonia, A/Wisconsin and B/Malaysia.</description>
          <population>The analysis was performed on the According-To-Protocol (ATP) cohort, which included all evaluable subjects for whom data concerning immunogenicity outcome measures were available and for whom results were available for antibodies against at least one study vaccine antigen component.</population>
