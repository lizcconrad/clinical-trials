  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PTK is an investigational new drug that has been shown in early laboratory studies to prevent
      the formation of new blood vessels that allow the tumor to grow. These studies have shown
      that the study drug can potentially improve the effectiveness of additional radiation and
      chemotherapy. With this study, we would like to examine the effects of PTK when used in
      combination with radiation therapy and the anti-cancer drug temozolomide, the standard
      treatment for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. We would also like to learn how the
      study drug is absorbed, distributed, and cleared from the body.

      -  Since we are looking for the highest dose of PTK that can be administered safely without
           severe or unmanageable side effects, not everyone who participates will get the same
           dose of PTK. A small group will be enrolled onto the study and given a certain dose. If
           they tolerate it well, the next small group enrolled will receive a higher dose. This
           will continue until the highest dose that can be given without severe or unmanageable
           side effects is found.

        -  Participants will receive PTK twice daily along with temozolomide daily during each
           treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days.

        -  PTK will start on Day 0 of the first cycle and will be given twice daily for the 7 weeks
           the participant receives radiation therapy.

        -  Daily doses of temozolomide will begin on Day of the first cycle and continue until the
           last dose of radiation therapy in cycle 1.

        -  Each participant will receive 7 weeks of radiation therapy. Radiation therapy will start
           on Day 5 of the first cycle and will be administered monday through friday, except on
           holidays.

        -  When radiation stops, temozolomide and PTK will be given for a maximum of 6
           post-radiation cycles of study treatment. During these cycles, PTK and temozolomide will
           be given for 5 consecutive days followed by 23 days of no drugs.

        -  Tests will be performed routinely throughout the study treatment and include; chest
           x-rays, blood tests, physical exams, urine tests and ECG.

        -  The following procedures will be performed at the end of the study or after the
           participants last dose of study medication; tumor assessment by MRI, routine blood
           draws, neurological/physical exam and, medical history review.
