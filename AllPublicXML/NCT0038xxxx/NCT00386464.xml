  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation or BiPAPÂ®, which is a form of breathing support delivered through a
      facemask, is a successful treatment for the respiratory complications of amyotrophic lateral
      sclerosis (ALS). It has been shown to prolong survival, improve quality of life, and improve
      cognitive function. It is widely used among patients with ALS who have advanced breathing
      difficulties. It is not known whether there is benefit to using non-invasive ventilation
      earlier in the disease course.

      There is evidence that non-invasive ventilation may slow down the decline in breathing
      function. If this were true then it would make sense to start non-invasive ventilation use
      earlier than the current clinically accepted practices.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether using non-invasive ventilation early in the
      course of disease can slow the decline in breathing function.

      Patients remain in the study for 6 months and are asked to make 7 clinic visits during which
      time they will undergo pulmonary function tests and complete questionnaires.

      This is a randomized, crossover trial for patient with ALS and mild respiratory involvement.
      Patients with forced vital capacity above 60% of the predicted value can join. Patients will
      be assigned to either start using non-invasive ventilation at night or continue their usual
      care. After three months, patients will switch over to the other treatment group. For
      example, a patient who was initially assigned to continue their usual care would begin using
      non-invasive ventilation after three months.
