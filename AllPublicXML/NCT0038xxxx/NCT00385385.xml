      The objective of this study is to evaluate an antibiotic therapy called Rifalazil to
      determine its effect on hardening of the carotid arteries.

      To evaluate the effect of treatment with rifalazil versus placebo taken once weekly for 12
      weeks on carotid atherosclerotic disease progression in patients who test positive for
      Chlamydia pneumoniae. Measurements of the carotid artery wall (intima-media thickness) and
      plaque characteristics will be evaluated with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) and carotid ultrasound. at Baseline and at 6,12 and 18 months following initiation of
      drug treatment in Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositive patients with a history of
      atherosclerotic disease. Biomarkers will be collected throughout the study. Safety will be
      evaluated by the collection and analysis of laboratory parameters, vital signs,
      electrocardiograms, physical examination and adverse events. Seventy two patients will be
      enrolled in this study. There will be a total of approximately 7-9 visits which will occur
      over an 18 month period.

               1. Diagnosis of PAD: i. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) of &lt;0.90 at rest in either leg,
                  or toe brachial index of &lt; 0.7 if ankle pressure is calcified. ii. Known PAD on
                  the basis of history or symptoms of intermittent claudication, prior endovascular
                  or surgical revascularization.

                  ultrasound or asymptomatic carotid artery disease defined by a total plaque area
                  &gt;100 mm2and carotid stenosis of ≤ 80%by Doppler ultrasound.

                  for myocardial ischemia, or history of a prior myocardial infarction (greater
                  than 6 months), or prior percutaneous coronary intervention and/or surgical
                  revascularization (greater that 6 months).

          -  Patient has a maximal IMT measurement by ultrasound in either the left or right common

             treatment of PAD and/or intermittent claudication or taking a statin, patient has to
