      RATIONALE: Pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pemetrexed disodium together with
      erlotinib may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of two different
      schedules of pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer or other solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of combining pemetrexed disodium with erlotinib
           hydrochloride in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) or other solid
           tumors. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with NSCLC treated with pemetrexed disodium in
           combination with erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Compare toxicity differences between different schedules of pemetrexed disodium and
           erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 2 different schedules of pemetrexed
           disodium and erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase I)

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of the combination of pemetrexed disodium and
           erlotinib hydrochloride in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Phase I)

        -  Assess the overall survival and progression-free survival. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with the administration of
           pemetrexed disodium and erlotinib hydrochloride. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II
      open-label study.

        -  Phase I: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups in an alternating fashion.
           Once accrual to the first dose level in group 1 is complete, group 2 will open for
           accrual to its first dose level.

             -  Group 1: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once on days 2, 9, and 16
                and pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
                days for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

             -  Group 2: Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 2-16 and
                pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days
                for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      In both groups, patients may continue to receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone after
      completion of 6 courses of erlotinib hydrochloride in combination with pemetrexed disodium.

      In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib hydrochloride
      and pemetrexed disodium until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive pemetrexed disodium at the MTD and erlotinib hydrochloride at
           the MTD as in group 1 or 2 (whichever is more favorable).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For the phase I portion of the study patients must have cytologically or
             histologically proven advanced solid tumors for which there is no standard effective
             therapy available. For the phase II portion patients must have cytologically or
             histologically proven selected stage IIIB (pleural effusion) or IV NSCLC. Patients
             with NSCLC that have progressed or recurred after first-line therapy for stage IIIA or
             IIIB may also be considered.

          -  For the phase II portion patients must have disease that has progressed or recurred
             after treatment with platinum-based therapy.

          -  Any number of prior chemotherapy regimens are allowed for the phase I portion and no
             more than 1 previous treatment for advanced NSCLC is allowed for the phase II portion.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease by RECIST criteria. Disease in previously
             irradiated sites is considered measurable if there is clear disease progression
             following radiation therapy. Patients with evaluable disease (bone metastases, pleural
             fluid, ascites, etc.) may be included in the phase I portion of the trial.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0-2 for phase I portion of study and a
             performance status of 0 -1 for the phase II portion of the trial.

          -  Patients must have an estimated survival of at least 3 months.

          -  Any prior chemotherapy that patients have received has to have been completed at least
             4 weeks prior to start of treatment. For prior mitomycin chemotherapy a 6-week
             interval is required. Prior radiation must have been completed at least 2 weeks prior
             to start of therapy. Patients must have recovered from acute reversible side effects
             of prior chemotherapy regimens or radiotherapy to NCI-CTC &lt; grade 1 (excluding
             alopecia).

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as documented by a serum creatinine &lt; 1.5
             mg/dl or a calculated creatinine clearance of &gt; 45 ml/min (see appendix for formula
             for calculating creatinine clearance).

          -  Patients must have adequate liver function as documented by serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x
             ULN. AST must be &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal.

          -  Patients must have a pretreatment granulocyte count of &gt;1500/mm3 and platelet count of
             &gt;100 000/mm3.

          -  Patients with asymptomatic treated brain metastasis (surgical resection or
             radiotherapy) may be included if they are neurologically stable and have been off
             steroids and anticonvulsants for at least 4 weeks. Because of the possibility of
             treatment related neurological toxicity it is difficult to evaluate for toxicity in
             the presence of symptomatic brain metastasis.

          -  All patients must give voluntary written informed consent.

          -  Patients must be able to take and retain oral medication.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraceptive method
             while on treatment and for 3 months afterwards as the effects of these drugs on the
             unborn fetus are unknown.

          -  Patients on coumadin should have their INR monitored at least once per week or more
             frequently depending on the investigators judgement. There have been some case reports
             of increased INR when coumadin is co-administered with OSI-774/placebo.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients may not have previously received Pemetrexed or an EGFR-directed therapy.

          -  Females can not be pregnant or breastfeeding as the effects of these drugs on the
             unborn fetus are unknown. Documentation of a negative serum pregnancy test is required
             for all women of reproductive potential.

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis or still requiring steroids and
             anti-convulsants may not be included.

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed for the phase II portion except for the
             following: adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ
             cervical cancer, adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is
             currently in complete remission, or any other cancer from which the patient has been
             disease-free for over five years.

          -  Patients cannot take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) or salicylates 2
             days prior and 2 days following (5 days pre and post for long-acting NSAIDS)
             administration of pemetrexed due to concerns of increased risk of renal toxicity.

          -  Patients with clinically significant ophthalmologic abnormalities will be excluded.
             This includes severe dry eye syndrome, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Sjogren's syndrome,
             severe exposure keratopathy, or other disorders that might increase the risk of
             corneal epithelial injury.
