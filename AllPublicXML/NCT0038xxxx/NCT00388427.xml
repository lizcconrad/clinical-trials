  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, safety study of cetuximab and differing dose levels of dasatinib in
      adult patients with advanced solid malignancies. Cetuximab will be administered as an
      intravenous infusion weekly. Dasatinib will be taken orally, once a day, on a continuous
      schedule at differing dose levels. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      toxicities and the maximum tolerated doses of dasatinib when combined with cetuximab for the
      treatment of advanced solid tumors.

      This is an open-label, phase I study of cetuximab and differing dose levels of dasatinib in
      adult patients with advanced solid malignancies. Cetuximab will be administered as an
      intravenous infusion on a standard dose and schedule (weekly, with the first dose at 400
      mg/m2 and all subsequent weekly doses at 250 mg/m2). Dasatinib will be administered orally on
      a continuous schedule at the following dose levels: 100 mg QD (once a day), 150 mg QD, and
      200 mg QD. Three to six patients will be enrolled at each dose level, and the final
      recommended phase II cohort will be expanded to include up to 12 additional patients. The
      doses will be escalated in successive cohorts of patients. On cycle 1, dasatinib
      administration will start one day prior to cetuximab administration. One cycle will be
      defined as 21 days, and cycles will continue until progression of disease or intolerable
      toxicities occur. Peripheral blood samples and pharmacokinetic blood samples will be taken on
      days 0, 1, 15, and 16 of Cycle 1 only. In patients with accessible tumor that give consent,
      patients will undergo a baseline tumor biopsy and a repeat biopsy after 14-21 days of the
      first cycle.
