  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib and bortezomib in
      treating patients with acute leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase.
      Tipifarnib and bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Giving tipifarnib together with bortezomib may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of tipifarnib and
      bortezomib in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia, or chronic myeloid leukemia in blast phase.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of this regimen on farnesyltransferase and proteasome inhibition in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells in these patients.

      II. Determine the clinical efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and oral tipifarnib
      twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with partial response or stable
      disease may continue therapy beyond 6 courses at the discretion of the investigator.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib and tipifarnib until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood is collected periodically for protein expression studies. Bone marrow aspirates
      obtained at baseline are examined by immunohistochemistry for Ki-67 activity.
