    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the Quadrivalent
      Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine in healthy females 9 to 15 years of age in India.
      Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine is composed of L1 virus-like particles (VLPs) from HPV types 6, 11,
      16, and 18.

    <time_frame>One month post-dose 3 (Month 7)</time_frame>
    <description>Month 7 HPV competitive Luminex Immunoassay (cLIA) seroconversion rates among participants who received Quadrivalent HPV (Types 6, 11, 16, 18) Late 1 (L1) capsid protein VLP vaccine were reported. The quadrivalent HPV competitive cLIA (v2.0) was used to detect antibody to HPV VLPs serotypes 6, 11, 16, 18 before and after vaccination with the HPV quadrivalent vaccine. Seropositivity cutoffs of the HPV cLIAs were assessed using a panel of sera from participants highly likely to be HPV naïve (children), and from participants who were highly likely to be seropositive. Any sample with a value less than the cutoffs was considered serostatus negative. Samples with values equal to or greater than the cutoff were considered serostatus positive. The cutoffs for the HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 cLIAs were 20 milli‐Merck units per milli liter (mMU/mL), 16 mMU/mL, 20 mMU/mL, and 24 mMU/mL, respectively.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs), Injection-site AEs, Systemic AEs, or Vaccine-related AEs During the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 months</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR's product, was also an AE. Pre-specified injection site AEs included pain, tenderness, erythema, and swelling. A vaccine-related AE was an AE considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the vaccine. All AEs collected on participant's Vaccination Report Card daily for 14 days after each vaccination (Days 1-15).
The number of participants who experienced ≥1 AE, the number of participants who experienced ≥1 injection site AE, the number of participants who experienced ≥1 systemic AE, and the number of participants who experienced ≥1 vaccine-related AE were reported for the Safety Cohort.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs), Injection-site AEs, Systemic AEs, or Vaccine-related AEs During the Study</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended change in the structure, function, or chemistry of the body temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, whether or not considered related to the use of the product. Any worsening of a preexisting condition which is temporally associated with the use of the SPONSOR’s product, was also an AE. Pre-specified injection site AEs included pain, tenderness, erythema, and swelling. A vaccine-related AE was an AE considered by the investigator to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the vaccine. All AEs collected on participant’s Vaccination Report Card daily for 14 days after each vaccination (Days 1-15).
The number of participants who experienced ≥1 AE, the number of participants who experienced ≥1 injection site AE, the number of participants who experienced ≥1 systemic AE, and the number of participants who experienced ≥1 vaccine-related AE were reported for the Safety Cohort.</description>
