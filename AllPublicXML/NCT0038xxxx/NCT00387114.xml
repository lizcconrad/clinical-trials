      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an in vivo treatment with an antioxidant
      vitamin (vitamin C) might substantially affect serum levels of resistin, a recently described
      adipokine, whose clinical significance is still controversial in humans.

      INTRODUCTION

      Background

      Resistin, a recently described adipokine, belonging to the cysteine-rich secretory protein
      family, was originally described as an adipocyte-derived polypeptide, that provides the link
      between obesity and insulin resistance in mice1-2. However, resistin is expressed at very low
      concentrations in human adipose cells, whereas at high levels in mononuclear leukocytes,
      macrophages, spleen, bone marrow cells. The striking differences in the genomic organization
      and cellular source of resistin in rodents make the biological effects found in the mouse not
      readily transferable to humans3-5. Accordingly, an increasing number of reports raised doubts
      regarding the possibility of an important relationship between human resistin and various
      metabolic disturbances, characteristic of obesity and type 2 diabetes4-5. Resistin was
      originally found to be related to proteins induced during lung inflammation6, and the high
      expression levels of resistin in leukocytes, the associations between this protein and
      inflammatory markers, the property to stimulate in vivo inflammatory cytokines suggest the
      possibility that resistin may be involved in the inflammation process6.

      Data supporting the participation of resistin in oxidative processes have been sporadically
      published. A significant interaction among a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter
      of the human resistin gene and a marker of oxidative stress (NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase
      I) has been found7. Retinoic acid, the acid form of vitamin A, inhibited the expression of
      resistin in mice and reduced the higher resistin levels of ten males affected by psoriasis8.
      Resistin serum levels were inversely associated with nitrotyrosine (NT), a product of free
      radical activity9.

      A pilot-analysis performed in five healthy volunteers showed that oral administration of
      vitamin C for 15 days determined a slight reduction in resistin serum levels.

      Aim

      The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an in vivo treatment with an antioxidant
      vitamin (vitamin C) might substantially affect resistin serum levels. For this purpose, serum
      resistin values were evaluated in a group of healthy subjects, randomized to receive orally 2
      g ascorbic acid for two weeks. Values of fasting glucose, insulin, total and HDL-cholesterol,
      triglycerides, C-reactive protein (CRP), and markers of oxidative stress were measured.

      STUDY DESIGN

      Two-arms open prospective randomized study.

      Subjects

      Healthy volunteers aged 20-50 years were recruited from the staff of the S.Giovanni Battista
      Hospital of Turin.

      Inclusion criteria were: age 20-50 years, absence of known hyperglycemia, hypertension,
      cardiovascular disease, impaired renal function, liver disease, or any other systemic
      conditions, no use of any drug -estrogen included-, not being on a particular diet and/or
      vitamin or other nutrient supplementation

      Exclusion criteria were: actual pregnancy, known hyperglycemia, hypertension, cardiovascular
      disease, impaired renal function, liver disease, or any other systemic conditions, use of any
      drug -estrogen included-, being on a particular diet and/or vitamin or other nutrient
      supplementation; history of renal calculi.

      Randomization

      After a full baseline evaluation of all included subjects, they were stratified according to:

        1. age,

        2. sex,

        3. smoking habits,

        4. body mass index (BMI),

        5. fasting blood levels of glucose, hs-CRP, vitamin C, and resistin.

      The randomization procedure was automatically performed by a statistician, using a SAS
      program developed to minimize the differences between the two groups for all the stratifying
      variables.

      Treatments

      Subjects were randomly allocated, within each stratum, to receive either daily 2 g ascorbic
      acid (Cebionâ 1000 per 2/die) supplementation or no supplementation for 14 days. The final
      distribution was: 40 subjects on vitamin C supplementation (experimental group) and 40 not
      supplemented (control group). These dosages were demonstrated to be safe also for prolonged
      treatments10

      Endpoints

      Main endpoints: mean resistin serum level reduction, after vitamin C treatment, of at least
      0.50 standardized units.

      Secondary endpoints: the within- and between-group variations in the other inflammatory and
      oxidative variables measured.

      Sample size

      On the basis of our previous data21, a sample of at least 34 subjects per group was required
      to detect a standardized difference of 0.5 DS resistin reduction in the experimental group,
      with a statistical power of 80% and two-tailed 0.05 a-value. Taking into account the
      limitations of these assumptions and the possibility of missing some individuals, the total
      sample size was increased to 40 subjects per group.

      Statistics

      The t-Student test for paired data will be used to investigate variations in the
      concentrations of several blood variables in the experimental group and in the control group.
      To assess whether these changes are different between the two groups, t-tests for independent
      samples, assuming either equal or unequal variances, will be performed.

      Measurements

      All the subjects will be submitted in the morning, at fasting, before and after the
      treatment, to measurements of weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and to
      determinations of serum glucose, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin,
      high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP), vitamin A, C, E, oxidized and reduced
      glutathione, NT, and resistin levels. Data about smoking habits, physical activity and mean
      daily nutrient intakes will be collected, respectively, by an interview, and a validated
      3-day food record.
