  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed as a prospective, multi-center, randomized, double blinded clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Thrombin VSI. An immunological sub-study to
      assess antibody and coagulation changes in the subjects following exposure to the Vascular
      Solutions Diagnostic Duett Pro manufactured with Thrombin VSI and Thrombin JMI will be
      conducted as a component of this trial with a subset of the enrolled study subjects.

      Two hundred seventy (270) subjects will be enrolled in this trial. A minimum of 50% of the
      subjects will be interventional subjects and up to 50% will be diagnostic subjects. All 270
      subjects will provide blood specimens at baseline and at the 30 day follow-up visit for
      evaluation in the immunologic sub-study. Within the 270 subjects enrolled, a minimum of 45
      subjects treated with the Thrombin VSI and a minimum of 45 subjects treated with the Thrombin
      JMI will provide blood specimens at the 60 day follow-up visit to be evaluated in the
      immunologic sub-study.

      The primary efficacy objective is to demonstrate that the device time-to-hemostasis for the
      study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin VSI is non-inferior to
      the study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin JMI.

      The primary safety objective is to demonstrate a device-related major complication rate for
      the study group treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin VSI that is
      non-inferior to the device-related major complication rate observed for the study group
      treated with the sealing device manufactured with Thrombin JMI.
