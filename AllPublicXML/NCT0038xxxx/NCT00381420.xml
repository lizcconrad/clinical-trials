  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY™ stent in maintaining minimum lumen diameter in de novo native
      coronary artery lesions as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITY™ balloon-expandable stent.
      Both stents are mounted on the Raptor® Stent Delivery Systems.

      The secondary objective is to assess cost-effectiveness expressed in incremental cost/life
      year gained or cost/quality adjusted life year gained at different time points (8 months, 1
      year, 3 and 5 years).

      This is a multicenter ,prospective, randomized double blind study. This study has a 2-arm
      design assessing the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY™ stent to
      the uncoated Bx VELOCITY™ stent, both mounted on Raptor® Stent Delivery Systems. A total of
      100 patients will be entered in the study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients who
      meet the eligibility criteria will be either randomized to Treatment A or Treatment B.
      Neither the investigator nor the patient will know which stent will be implanted. Patients
      will be followed at 30 days, 6, 9, and 12 months, and at 2, 3, 4 and 5 years post-procedure,
      with all patients undergoing repeat angiography at 8 months. Additionally, medical costs
      associated with the index hospitalization and length of stay, and repeat hospitalizations and
      costs associated with other relevant medical resource use during the 5 years follow-up period
      will be collected and analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          -  Single treatment of de novo lesion in a major coronary artery in patients with single
             or multi-vessel disease; patients with multiple lesions can be included only if the
             other lesions do not require treatment;

          -  Target vessel diameter at the lesion site is &gt;=2.50mm and &lt;=3.0mm in diameter (visual
             estimate);

          -  Target lesion is &gt;=15mm and &lt;=32mm in length (visual estimate);

          -  Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             total CK &gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CK-MB enzymes
             remains above normal at the time of treatment;

          -  Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald III B or C and A I-II-III, or is having a
             peri infarction;

          -  Unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;=50% stenosis;

          -  Significant (&gt;50%) stenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that might require
             revascularization or impede runoff;

          -  Have an ostial target lesion;

          -  Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion;

          -  Heavily calcified lesion which cannot be successfully predilated;
