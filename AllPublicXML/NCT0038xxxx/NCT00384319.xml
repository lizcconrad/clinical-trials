  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Life Recovery Systems Thermosuit(R) System
      is able to quickly and conveniently cool patients who are comatose after resuscitation from
      cardiac arrest.

      The primary purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the use of a new cooling device
      (the LRS ThermoSuit(R) System) to cool patients who are comatose following resuscitation from
      cardiac arrest. This device cools by circulating cold water directly against the skin of the
      patient. Cooling to a state of mild hypothermia (32 to 34 degrees C, maintained for 12 to 24
      hours) is recognized by the American Heart Association, European Resuscitation Council, and
      the Canadian Association of Emergency Care Physicians as a promising therapy for such
      patients, and is likely to be most effective if administered quickly following resuscitation.
      It is hypothesized that this new device will cool patients much more quickly than by
      historical means. Patients will be monitored for physiologic parameters such as body
      temperature during the cooling therapy, and will be tracked for neurological outcomes
      following treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Cardiac arrest prior to or during hospital admission, with restoration/return of
             spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

          -  Initial (pre-resuscitation) cardiac rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, non-perfusing
             ventricular tachycardia, pulseless electrical activity, or asystole.

          -  Estimated or known age &gt; 18 years.

          -  Intubation, ventilation and placement of esophageal probe.

          -  Persistent neurologic dysfunction i.e. comatose upon enrollment [GCS ≤ 8].

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Height greater than 188 cm.

          -  Elbow-to-elbow width greater than 60 cm (as measured above the supine patient).

          -  Core temperature less than 35°C after ROSC (as measured at the tympanic membrane,
             esophagus, sub-lingual space,nasopharynx, or central blood vessel).

          -  Comatose state before the cardiac arrest due to the administration of drugs that
             depress the central nervous system.

          -  Known enrollment in another study of a device, drug, or biologic.

          -  Major trauma or other co-morbidity requiring urgent surgery.

          -  Improving neurologic status.

          -  &gt; 4 hours since return of spontaneous circulation.

          -  Unknown time of arrest.

          -  Severe or known coagulopathy (with active bleeding).

          -  Hemodynamic instability despite vasopressors (SBP &lt; 90 mmHg or MAP &lt; 60 mmHg for &gt; 30
