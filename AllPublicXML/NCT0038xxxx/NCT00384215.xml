    <textblock>
      This trial will explore the various advantages and possible disadvantages of pioglitazone and
      insulin glargine when added to monotherapy. Glycemic control, hypoglycemia, weight, lipid
      profiles, quality of life and cost will be studied given a comprehensive set of data that may
      help future treatment decisions.
