  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, two-attack, out-patient,
      early-intervention evaluation of subjects who have migraine with or without aura and who
      discontinued use of short acting triptan(s) within the past year due to non-response or
      intolerance. Subjects will treat 2 separate migraine attacks during the mild phase of each
      attack; one attack will be treated with one tablet of the Combination Product (sumatriptan
      succinate and naproxen sodium) and the other attack with one tablet of placebo (crossover
      design). [Study 2 of 2]

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, two-attack, out-patient,
      early-intervention evaluation of subjects who have migraine with or without aura and who
      discontinued use of short acting triptan(s) within the past year due to non-response or
      intolerance. Subjects will treat 2 separate migraine attacks during the mild phase of each
      attack; one attack will be treated with one tablet of the Combination Product (sumatriptan
      succinate and naproxen sodium) and the other attack with one tablet of placebo (crossover
      design); however, the order of these treatments will be randomized. A minimum 1-week washout
      period is required between study medication treatment of the first and second migraine
      attacks.

      Each subject will have two visits: (1) a Screening visit at study entry and (2) a Final visit
      4-10 days after the second (or last) attack. A telephone contact will also be required 1-3
      days after the first attack, and then once per month until the Final visit.

      The primary study objective is to assess efficacy as measured by sustained pain-free (SPF)
      relief of Combination Product compared to placebo in treating migraine subjects who have
      previously discontinued treatment with short acting triptans (rizatriptan, sumatriptan,
      almotriptan, zolmitriptan, and eletriptan).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female between 18 and 65 years old.

          -  Subject has migraine with or without aura (2004 ICHD-II criteria).

          -  Subject has 1-8 migraines per month over the previous 3 months and less than 15 total
             headache days per month.

          -  Subject has recently (within 1 year) discontinued the use of eletriptan, rizatriptan,
             sumatriptan, almotriptan, or zolmitriptan, due to nonresponse or intolerable adverse
             events. Non-response is defined as documented discontinuation of treatment with
             eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, almotriptan, or zolmitriptan for reasons related
             to response, including (but not limited to): slow onset of efficacy, inconsistent
             efficacy, inadequate overall efficacy, or inadequate sustained efficacy through 24
             hours. Intolerance is defined as documented discontinuation of treatment with
             eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan, almotriptan, or zolmitriptan for other reasons,
             attributable to the triptan, outside of non-response.

        A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          -  non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant); or,

          -  child-bearing potential, has a negative urine pregnancy test at screen, and agrees to
             one of the following acceptable measures of contraception:

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the
             investigational product, throughout the study, and for a time interval after
             completion or premature discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of
             the investigational drug (a minimum of 5 days); subjects utilizing this method must
             agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually
             active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2
             weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit; or,

          -  Female sterilization; or,

          -  Sterilization of male partner; or,

          -  Implants of levonorgestrel; or,

          -  Injectable progestogen; or,

          -  Oral contraceptive (combined or progestogen only); or,

          -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the highest expected
             failure rate is less than 1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion); or,

          -  Spermicide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermicide plus a male condom or a female
             diaphragm); or,

          -  Any other methods with published data showing that the highest expected failure rate
             for that method is less than 1% per year; or,

          -  Any other barrier methods only if used in combination with any of the above acceptable
             methods.

          -  Subject taking oral contraceptives has been on a stable regimen for at least 2 months
             prior to screening.

             treatment phase of the study.
