      subjects referred to a physician-based high-risk breast clinic; 2) the ability of physician
      counseling to improve patient risk perception and reduce psychological distress; 3) to
      identify factors relevant in clinical practice associated with increased distress and risk
      perception.

      Patients referred to the Baystate Comprehensive Breast Center High-Risk Clinic wil, after
      giving consent, complete an intake evaluation of breast cancer risk, the patient's
      perceptions of breast cancer development risk, and the Brief Symptom Inventory-18. Physician
      history, physical and counseling then takes place, with sharing of risk estimates based on
      modified Gail model and Myriad tables regarding breast cancer risk and probability of BRCA1/2
      mutation. After counseling, patients complete another assessment of risk perception and
      BSI-18, and again 2 months and 1 year post counseling. Recommendations for hormonal
      management and referral for formal genetic evaluation and testing will be tracked.
