  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib will be given with TAXOL in one part, in another part pazopanib will be given with
      TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, and in a third part pazopanib will be given with TAXOL and lapatinib
      (patients separated in each part). Toxicity monitoring will enable us to find the largest
      dose of pazopanib daily that can be safely given in combination with the chemotherapy agents
      TAXOL and PARAPLATIN, and with lapatinib, as well as what side effects are likely to manifest
      when these agents are given together and whether the combination of pazopanib with
      chemotherapy, helps to treat different types of cancer. Another objective is to find out how
      much pazopanib, TAXOL, PARAPLATIN and lapatinib are in the blood at specific times after the
      agents are given. Collecting the blood samples requires that the patients remain in the
      vicinity of the clinic overnight on 2 occasions.
