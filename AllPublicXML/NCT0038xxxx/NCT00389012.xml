  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if treadmill training with body weight-support
      (BWST) is more effective at improving walking in individuals post-stroke than a resisted
      leg-cycling exercise program. In addition, we want to determine if training programs that
      combine leg strength training to treadmill walking provide an additional benefit to
      post-stroke walking outcomes.

      Impaired walking ability is a hallmark residual deficit that contributes to post-stroke
      walking disability . Impairment in lower extremity muscle strength is a significant
      contributor to decreased walking speed after stroke. No studies have combined task-specific
      locomotor training in combination with lower extremity strength training programs designed to
      improve post-stroke walking outcomes.

      Participants will include individuals who are ambulatory, but walk slower than 1.0 m/sec and
      are at least 6 months post unilateral stroke.

      Participants are stratified by initial comfortable walking speed (moderate &gt;0.5 m/sec; severe
      &lt;= 0.5 m/sec) and randomized to one of four exercise pairs: 1) body-weight supported
      treadmill training (BWST) and locomotor-based strength training (resistive cycling task,
      LBST), 2) BWST and LE muscle-specific strength training (MSST), 3) BWST and upper extremity
      ergometry (SHAM), and 4) LBST and SHAM. Training will occur 4 times per week for 6 weeks (24
      total sessions). Exercise type in each exercise pair is alternated daily.

      Primary outcomes include comfortable and fast overground walking speed, and distance walked
      in 6-minutes measured at baseline, after 12 and 24 treatment sessions and at a 6-month
      follow-up.
