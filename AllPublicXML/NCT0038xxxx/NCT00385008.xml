    <time_frame>Day 1 of each treatment administration (For 30 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Scintigraphic images were analyzed in a time-lapse format and regions of interest were drawn to include the stomach and small intestine. Images were recorded in a supine position and a series of 3 to 60 consecutive anterior scintigraphic images, each 1 minute in duration, were recorded using a clinical grade gamma camera. After this initial continuous imaging sequence, additional images were recorded to coincide with pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling times as necessary to monitor the tablet disintegration and transit time through the intestines. Prior to ingesting the radiolabeled dosage forms, two external markers (2-3 microcuries of indium-111 or technetium-99m) were placed on each participant to facilitate consistent positioning underneath the gamma camera. The first marker was placed on the right side of the participant's chest (approximately at the fifth intercostal rib) and a second marker was placed on the hip bone (approximately the left anterior superior ileac spine).</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was conducted at a single site in the United States during 13 September 2006 to 24 November 2006. TREXIMA® tablet was a fixed dose combination of sumatriptan succinate 119 milligrams (mg) (equivalent to 85 mg of sumatriptan) and naproxen sodium 500 mg.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>First ten participants enrolled received TREXIMA and the next ten enrolled received Relpax. In each group, the first 5 participants who had a migraine and who were able to attend the clinic received the extra dose of the respective treatment.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Time to 10%, 50%, 90% and Complete Gastric Empting of the Radioactive Markers Representing Sumatriptan, Naproxen and Eletriptan</title>
        <description>Scintigraphic images were analyzed in a time-lapse format and regions of interest were drawn to include the stomach and small intestine. Images were recorded in a supine position and a series of 3 to 60 consecutive anterior scintigraphic images, each 1 minute in duration, were recorded using a clinical grade gamma camera. After this initial continuous imaging sequence, additional images were recorded to coincide with pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling times as necessary to monitor the tablet disintegration and transit time through the intestines. Prior to ingesting the radiolabeled dosage forms, two external markers (2-3 microcuries of indium-111 or technetium-99m) were placed on each participant to facilitate consistent positioning underneath the gamma camera. The first marker was placed on the right side of the participant’s chest (approximately at the fifth intercostal rib) and a second marker was placed on the hip bone (approximately the left anterior superior ileac spine).</description>

            <description>Ten participants received single dose of radio labeled TREXIMA tablet (fixed dose combination of sumatriptan succinate 119 mg [equivalent to 85 mg of sumatriptan] and naproxen sodium 500 mg), orally, in absence of migraine. Five participants out of these participants visited clinic when they were experiencing an acute migraine attack and received TREXIMA during migraine attack at clinic. Dosing was repeated up to 2 additional times for up to 4 total doses. Each treatment administration were separated by at least 7 days. Each dose was administered with 240 mL of water.</description>

        <description>Scintigraphic images were analyzed in a time-lapse format and regions of interest were to be drawn to include the stomach and small intestine. Images were recorded in a supine position and a series of 3 to 60 consecutive anterior scintigraphic images, each 1 minute in duration, were recorded using a clinical grade gamma camera. After this initial continuous imaging sequence, additional images were recorded to coincide with PK blood sampling times as necessary to monitor the tablet disintegration and transit time through the intestines. Prior to ingesting the radiolabeled dosage forms, two external markers (2-3 microcuries of indium-111 or technetium-99m) were placed on each participant to facilitate consistent positioning underneath the gamma camera. The first marker was placed on the right side of the participant’s chest (approximately at the fifth intercostal rib) and a second marker was placed on the hip bone (approximately the left anterior superior ileac spine).</description>

        <description>Scintigraphic images were analyzed in a time-lapse format and regions of interest were to be drawn to include the stomach and small intestine. Images were recorded in a supine position and a series of 3 to 60 consecutive anterior scintigraphic images, each 1 minute in duration, were recorded using a clinical grade gamma camera. After this initial continuous imaging sequence, additional images were recorded to coincide with PK blood sampling times as necessary to monitor the tablet disintegration and transit time through the intestines. Prior to ingesting the radiolabeled dosage forms, two external markers (2-3 microcuries of indium-111 or technetium-99m) were placed on each participant to facilitate consistent positioning underneath the gamma camera. The first marker was placed on the right side of the participant’s chest (approximately at the fifth intercostal rib) and a second marker was placed on the hip bone (approximately the left anterior superior ileac spine).</description>
