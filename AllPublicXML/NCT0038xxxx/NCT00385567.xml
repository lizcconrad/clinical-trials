  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HRG2 is a Phase 2 randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-dose trial to determine the
      efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetic profile of PEHRG214 in HIV-infected
      patients, treated three times weekly for up to 16 weeks.

      All patients are receiving optimized standard of care HAART.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the effect of PEHRG214 in decreasing the
      viral load (&gt;=1.0 log10), as compared to a Control group. The primary hypothesis is that
      treatment with PEHRG214 will result in clinically meaningful and sustained viral load
      suppression.

      The total sample size is 70-74 patients from approximately 8-10 participating study centers.
      The first 16-20 patients are enrolled in the non-randomized &quot;pilot arm&quot; and 54 subsequent
      patients are randomized (2:1 within center) to Treatment or Control group. The total study
      duration is 7-12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a randomized, controlled, open-label multi-dose trial of PEHRG214
      administered intravenously three times weekly, with the potential for dose escalation in
      selected patients. Patients with HIV infection, viral load at least 10 times greater than the
      site laboratory's lower limit of detection and CD4 count of &lt;220 cells/mm3, will be entered
      into the trial. All patients must be taking an optimized background regimen (OBR) of
      antiretroviral agents, as confirmed by the Principal Investigator, in accordance with the
      U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents
      in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents, May 4, 2006.

      A non-randomized &quot;pilot arm&quot; of 16-20 patients will first receive 2.0 mg/kg three times
      weekly for 12 doses. After a &quot;pilot arm&quot; patient has received at least 12 doses of PEHRG214
      at 2.0 mg/kg, dose escalation to 4.0 mg/kg three times weekly will follow a scheme based on
      adverse event, HAGAR, and viral load assessments for each individual patient, and in certain
      cases, further review by the DSMB. After the &quot;pilot arm&quot; patients have received 12 doses at
      4.0 mg/kg, all subsequent patients will enter the protocol at the 4.0 mg PEHRG214/kg level.
      The subsequent 54 patients will be randomized, in 2:1 ratio within center, to the Treatment
      group and Control group, respectively. The treatment group will receive PEHRG214 at a dose of
      4.0 mg/kg three times weekly for up to 48 doses (16 weeks). The Control group will not
      receive the investigational drug, but will undergo observation while receiving standard of
      care HAART.

      After at least 12 doses of PEHRG214 at 4.0 mg/kg, dose escalation to 8.0 mg/kg three times
      weekly will follow a scheme based on adverse event, HAGAR, and viral load assessments for
      each individual patient, and in certain cases, further review by the DSMB.

      The Control patients will be evaluated every 4 weeks for 16 weeks according to the Schedule
      of Assessments in Appendix 1F. After 16 weeks, these patients will have the option of being
      enrolled in an extension protocol where they can receive PEHRG214.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Serological documentation of HIV infection at any time prior to study entry.

          -  CD4 cells count of &lt;220 cells/mm3 within 35 days of study drug administration.

          -  Viral load at least 10 times greater than the site laboratory's lower limit of
             detection within 35 days of study drug administration.

          -  The patient must be taking an optimized background regimen (OBR) of antiretroviral
             agents, as confirmed by the Principal Investigator, in accordance with the US
             Department of Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral
             Agents in HIV-1 Infected Adults and Adolescents, May 4, 2006;
             (http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/guidelines/) or comparable standard of care guidelines.

          -  OBR has been individually selected for the patient based on prior viral resistance
             testing and antiretroviral treatment history.

          -  OBR has been stable for at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and is expected to remain
             stable for the duration of the trial.

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt;=60%.

          -  Adequate laboratory parameters: absolute neutrophil count &gt;1000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin

             indinavir or atazanavir will be allowed on this trial if their bilirubin is &gt;3.0 mg/dL
             and if it is deemed by both the Principal Investigator and patient's physician that
             the elevated bilirubin is solely related to indinavir or atazanavir.

             test.

          -  Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia using aerosolized pentamidine,

          -  Patients who have received an HIV vaccine.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to animal proteins, including red meats, milk, or milk
             products, or previous treatment with a caprine antibody and HAGAR (Human anti-goat
             antibody response) or the presence of HAGAR at screening.

          -  As this is an experimental regimen, patients will not be permitted to enroll if they
             had been on an effective antiretroviral regimen, which they tolerated well and which
             they discontinued for the sake of enrolling in this protocol.
