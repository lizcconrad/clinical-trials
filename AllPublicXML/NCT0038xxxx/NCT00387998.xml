      RATIONALE: Understanding the risk of disease and prevention and screening activities to lower
      disease risk may help individuals make informed medical decisions.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well health education materials help
      participants understand medical information.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare medical data interpretation skills in participants of low or high socioeconomic
           status who receive a general education primer (entitled &quot;Know Your Chances:
           Understanding Health Statistics&quot;) vs a health education booklet (entitled &quot;The Pocket
           Guide to Good Heath for Adults&quot;).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Participants are stratified according to
      socioeconomic status (low vs high). Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I (control): Participants receive a health education booklet entitled &quot;The Pocket
           Guide to Good Health for Adults,&quot; published by the Agency for Health Care Research and
           Quality, which contains general information about disease risk and reducing risk by
           following recommended prevention or screening activities.

        -  Arm II (primer): Participants receive a general education primer entitled &quot;Know your
           chances: Understanding health statistics,&quot; which teaches how to understand disease risk
           and the benefits and risks of intervention.

      Within 2 weeks after receiving the education material, participants in both arms complete a
      survey, including a medical data interpretation test, STAT-interest, STAT-confidence, and
      user ratings of the education materials.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 555 participants were accrued for this study.
