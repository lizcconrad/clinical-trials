    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject is 18 years old or older.

          2. Male subjects or non-lactating female subjects, who are either surgically sterile (has
             had a documented bilateral oophorectomy and/or documented hysterectomy),
             postmenopausal (cessation of menses for more than 1 year), or for women of
             childbearing potential, the results of a serum or urine human chorionic gonadotropin
             pregnancy test, performed at screening within 24 hours before dosing (with the result
             known before investigational medicinal product administration) must be negative.

          3. The subject is able and willing to comply with study procedures (i.e., 1 SPECT imaging
             at Stress, 2 SPECT imagings at Rest) and signed and dated informed consent is
             obtained.

          4. The subject is suspected of or known of having CAD based on the subject's clinical
             signs, symptoms, or examinations .

          5. The subject is referred for Rest/Stress (exercise or pharmacological) MPS-SPECT for
             known or suspected CAD (as clinically required).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject was previously included in this study.

          2. The subject received an IMP within 30 days before or is scheduled to receive one
             during or in the next 30 days after IMP administration.

          3. The subject has known allergies to any product used in this study or its constituents,
             including subjects who are not able to exercise and have contraindications to
             Adenosine (e.g., Asthmatics).

          4. The subject presents any clinically active, serious, life-threatening disease, with a
             life expectancy of less than 1 month.

          5. The subject has no contraindications to any of the study procedures (e.g. physical
             exercise) or the involved drugs (Myoview, Thallium-201, Adenosine or Dipyridamole)
             such as e.g. 2nd or 3rd degree AV-block, SS syndrome, bradycardia, bronchoconstrictive
             or bronchospastic lung disease.
