  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial aims to evaluate the utility of 18FDG-PET/CT in SBRT planning for NSCLC with
      particular emphasis on the definition of macroscopic and microscopic boundaries of malignant
      growth. Studies indicate that the definition of the gross tumor volume may gain in quality
      when CT and 18FDG-PET are combined. In about 30-60% of NSCLC patients considered for
      radiotherapy, alteration of CT-based treatment volumes is the consequence of a supplementary
      18FDG-PET scan. Studies examining the effect of combined PET/CT scans on the delineation of
      the GTV generally show reduced intra- and inter-clinician variability. Whether this higher
      degree of consistency is an actual improvement remains to be proven. Pathological specimens
      from operated NSCLC patients may serve as a gold standard in this respect. To meet the need
      for tight margins, the clinical target volume in SBRT planning is generally presumed to
      correspond to the GTV. Whether this clinical practice rests on firm ground is also an issue
      that can be addressed in a PET-CT-pathology correlation study.
