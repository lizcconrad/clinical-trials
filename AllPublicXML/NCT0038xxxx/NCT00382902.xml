        -  Successful daily wear of Night &amp; Day® or Acuvue® Advance™ silicone hydrogel contact
             for at least two weeks.

          -  Use of AOSEPT® ClearCare™ only as the pre-study care regimen for at least two weeks
             (rewetting drops use is also acceptable).

          -  Successful lens wear for at least 8 hours per day.

          -  Vision correctable to 20/30.

          -  Normal eyes - no current ocular abnormalities that prevent successful contact lens
             wear.

          -  No corneal surgery within the past 12 months.

          -  No systemic disease that affects that eye or that could be worsened by the use of
             contact lenses or solutions.

          -  No over-the-counter or prescription ocular medication.

          -  No enrollment in another clinical study within 30 days prior to enrollment.
