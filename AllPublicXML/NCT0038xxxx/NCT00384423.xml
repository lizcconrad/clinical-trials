      This is a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics
      of PRX-03140 administered orally once daily for 14 days in subjects with mild Alzheimer's
      Disease who are using a stable, well-tolerated 10 mg dose of Aricept (donepezil) but continue
      to experience worsening AD symptoms.
