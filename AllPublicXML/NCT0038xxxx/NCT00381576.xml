    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present investigation is to determine whether MS patients can tolerate and
      benefit from heavy progressive resistance training. A second purpose is to determine both
      neural and muscle morphological adaptations to heavy progressive resistance training.

    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are characterized by reduced muscle strength and functional
      capacity. For MS patients, improvements in muscle strength and thereby functional capacity,
      would have the potential to make both the daily living easier and to extend the time living
      independently. Attempts to improve muscle strength and function include the application of
      physical training, although the general advice to MS patients for many years has been to
      avoid participation in physical training. It has now been demonstrated that endurance
      training at low to moderate intensity is well tolerated by MS patients, but it only induces
      modest improvements in both muscle strength and functional capacity. Heavy progressive
      resistance training (HPRT) has proven to be the most effective means to improve muscle
      strength and functional capacity during daily activities in healthy older people. However,
      the effects of HPRT have not been investigated in randomised control trials in MS patients.
