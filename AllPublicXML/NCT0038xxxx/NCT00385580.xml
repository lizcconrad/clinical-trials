  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn if men with metastatic prostate cancer and rising
      Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), who have been surgically castrated or are undergoing
      androgen deprivation with Luteinizing Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) treatment, respond to
      dasatinib. The safety of this treatment will also be studied.

    <time_frame>Data was collected prior treatment with the study drug, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, every 4 weeks thereafter and at the end of the treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>LDH is a laboratory safety parameter. Normal ranges for LD vary with both age and disease status, and another reason for variation in upper limit of normal (ULN) and lower limit of normal (LLN) is that LD was measured via a local (versus a standardized) laboratory. It is therefore not possible to provide one ULN and LLN for the population.</description>

        <description>The FAPSI-8 is a symptom index comprised of the most important clinician-rated symptoms or concerns to monitor when assessing the value of treatment for advanced prostate cancer. It includes 8 items developed to measure symptoms/concerns specific to prostate cancer such as fatigue, pain (3-items), weight loss, difficulty with urination (2-items) and concerns about the condition becoming worse. Participants respond to each item on a 5-point Likert-type scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much).</description>
