  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During a clinical study of people with severe West Nile virus infections, it was determined
      that the drug AVI-4020 crossed the blood-brain barrier. This study will assess the amount of
      drug that goes across the blood-brain barrier and the drug levels measured in both the blood
      and urine.

      The objective of this study is to find out how much and how fast this drug crosses this
      barrier.

    <textblock>
      AVI-4020 was designed to interfere with West Nile virus translation, and has been shown to
      cross the blood-brain barrier in both normal and inflamed meninges in a clinical study in
      patients with severe West Nile virus disease.

      At issue, is whether this observation is limited to AVI-4020 PMO drug, or is observed with
      other PMO drugs. This study is one of three to assess the specific ability of PMO drugs to
      cross the blood-brain barrier, using similar dosing, and PK assessment time points. In order
      to rigorously assess the pharmacokinetics, this study is being performed in healthy
      volunteers at a single point in time.

      The ability of other PMO drugs to cross the blood-brain barrier will set the stage for future
      studies that exploit this product characteristic.
