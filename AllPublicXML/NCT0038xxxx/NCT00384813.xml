      Stress and anxiety can negatively affect children with asthma. Reducing the stress of
      asthmatic children and their families may lead to improved asthma care and fewer asthma
      symptoms in the children. The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate a
      family-focused asthma education program aimed at reducing stress levels and improving asthma
      care for urban children with asthma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a serious, chronic illness that affects 9 million children in the United States.
      Common asthma symptoms include wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.
      Asthma attacks can be triggered by a variety of irritants, including mold, pollen, tobacco
      smoke, or allergies. Stress can also cause asthma attacks, and children who experience high
      levels of stress and anxiety tend to have poor asthma management skills and health outcomes.
      Additionally, family stress can affect the ability of families and caregivers to provide
      adequate care to children with asthma. Currently, few asthma education programs are aimed at
      helping both children and parents manage stress. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the
      effectiveness of a stress-reduction family intervention on improving health outcomes in
      asthmatic children.

      Study researchers will first conduct focus groups with children who have asthma, their
      parents, and community health organizations to identify barriers to effective asthma
      management and sources of stress for caregivers; a family-focused intervention will then be
      developed. Fifty families with an asthmatic child will be enrolled and randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. Group 1 participants will partake in four to six home-based, family
      educational sessions over a 4-month period. Sessions will focus on asthma education and
      stress management techniques for the entire family. One of these sessions may take place at
      the child's doctor's office as a way to focus on improving parent-doctor communication. Group
      2 participants will partake in a single home-based asthma education session. Study visits for
      all participants will occur at baseline, Month 4, and 6 months post-intervention. At these
      timepoints, asthma self-management will be assessed through family interviews and observation
      of the child's inhaler use; tobacco exposure levels will be measured with a urine test; and
      family functioning and stress levels will be assessed with questionnaires.

    <description>Family Asthma Management System Scale is semi-structured clinical interview that includes open-ended questions assessing family management of pediatric asthma. The interview is recorded and rated using a standard manual on seven core subscales and two optional subscales.The interview is recorded and rated on seven to nine 9-point subscales that tap the various domains of asthma management, with higher scores indicating better management (1 being the worse asthma management and 9 being the best asthma management). Mean of all of the subscales used to compute a total score.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Families were recruited from an urban hospital and a residential camp for children with asthma. Initial eligibility criteria : (a) residence in one of two urban counties, (b) child age 8 to 13, (c) Medicaid or State Children’s Health Insurance Program, (d) current prescription of a daily controller agent, and (e) poorly controlled asthma.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Caregivers of children meeting initial eligibility criteria were interviewed briefly by phone; those answering affirmatively to either of two stress questions were invited to participate in a Screening Assessment. Caregivers with an elevated score on a stress measure were invited to participate in the trial.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Mean Score on the Family Asthma Management System Scale (FAMSS)</title>
        <description>Family Asthma Management System Scale is semi-structured clinical interview that includes open-ended questions assessing family management of pediatric asthma. The interview is recorded and rated using a standard manual on seven core subscales and two optional subscales.The interview is recorded and rated on seven to nine 9-point subscales that tap the various domains of asthma management, with higher scores indicating better management (1 being the worse asthma management and 9 being the best asthma management). Mean of all of the subscales used to compute a total score.</description>
