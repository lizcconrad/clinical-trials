  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether supplementation of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid
      conjugated to phosphatidylserine rather than triglycerides (fish oil) could affect
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms in children.

      BACKGROUND Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) encompasses a broad constellation
      of behavioral and learning problems, clinically describes inattentive, impulsive, and/or
      hyperactive children. These patients are characterized by low blood LC-PUFA (LC-PUFA) levels;
      however the LC-PUFA supplementation effect on ADHD symptoms is not clear.

      METHODS Eighty-three ADHD children (3:1 boys:girls), 8-13 years old, were assigned in a
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel design to receive 250 mg/d of
      eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid provided as phosphatidylserine (300 mg/d
      PS-Omega3), or fish oil or placebo for 3 months. Stimulant medication or other dietary
      supplements were prohibited. The measured outcomes were inattention and impulsivity,
      evaluated by Test of Variables of Attention (TOVA) and blood lipids profile.
