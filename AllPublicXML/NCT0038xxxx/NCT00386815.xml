        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma

          -  Not candidates for curative surgery. Patients will be clinically staged using the IMIG
             TNM staging criteria

          -  Not receive prior systemic chemotherapy

          -  Patients must have measurable lesions, which are diagnosed by CT, or MRI scan within
             28 days before administration

          -  More than 20 years and less than 75 years of age

          -  ECOG Performance status score: 0 - 1

          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed to &lt; 25% of the bone marrow. Prior radiotherapy
             must be completed at least 21 days before study enrollment, and the patients must have
             recovered from the toxic effects of the treatment prior to study enrollment.

          -  Prior surgeries must be completed at least 21 days before study enrollment, and the
             patients must have recovered from the effects of the operation.However, regarding
             examination of thoracotomy or celiotomy, etc. if the investigator or sub-investigator
             judges that there are no influences of surgery and no problems for participation of
             patients in this study, e.g. safety security, there should be at least 14 days from
             the surgery day to patient registration date

          -  Patients who have adequate organ function Hemoglobin: no less than 9g/dl, Absolute
             neutrophil count: no less than 2,000/mm3, Platelet count: no less than
             100,000/mm3,Serum albumin: no less than 2.5g/dL,AST (GOT) and ALT (GPT): no more than
             2.5 x the upper limit of reference values at each site (no more than 5 x the upper
             limit of reference values at each site is acceptable if liver has tumor involvement),
             Total bilirubin: no more than 1.5 x the upper limit of reference values at each
             site,Serum creatinine: no more than the upper limit of reference values at each site,
             SpO2: no less than 92%, ECG: normal (In the case of the ECG was marked abnormal
             waveshape, when the investigator or sub-investigator judges that there is no safety
             issue for the patient, administration can be done), 24hr-creatinine clearance or
             calculated creatinine clearance: no less than 45mL/min

          -  Estimated life expectancy of at least 90 days from the registration date

          -  Patients must be hospitalized from the start of the first cycle until the start of the
             second cycle of the combination therapy, in principle (Only in case investigator or
             sub-investigator judges that there are no safety issues, patients can receive the
             therapy as outpatients from the middle of Cycle 1)

          -  Male and female patients with reproductive potential must use an approved
             contraceptive method if appropriate (eg, intrauterine device [IUD], birth control
             pills, or barrier device) during and for 90 days after study therapy. Females with
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Signed informed consent from patient

             cancers with non-disease period of no more than 5 years)(except in situ carcinoma of
             the cervix or adequately treated basal cell carcinoma of the skin)

          -  Patients who have symptomatic brain metastases or those who have brain metastases
             which require treatment

          -  Presence of clinically detectable third-space fluid collections, for example, ascites
             or pleural effusions that cannot be controlled by drainage.

          -  Have received treatment within the last 30 days with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication at the time of study entry.

          -  Having a history of sensitivity to platinum agent, folic acid or vitamin B12

          -  Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or could be pregnant or women who hope to get
             pregnant during or within 90 days after the study.

             study.

          -  Patients who have neurotoxicity which is no less than CTC grade 2 at study entry.

          -  Inability to interrupt salicylates of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for
             a 5-day period(8-day period for long-acting agents such as piroxicam).
