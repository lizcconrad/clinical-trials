  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is a comparison of efficacy and side effects of Q-switched Ruby
      laser treatment for solar lentigines in two different skin types II and IV.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been widely accepted that dark colored individuals are prone to develop laser induced
      side effects especially post inflammatory hyperpigmentation(PIH) and it could be a limiting
      issue in selecting dark colored individuals.

      We designed this study to evaluate the difference of efficacy and side effects in light and
      dark skinned individuals.
