      The vascularization and perfusion of conjunctival autografts and amniotic membrane grafts
      after surgery may have significance in terms of pterygium recurrence and progression.
      Fluorescein angiography of the anterior ocular segment has been used to evaluate ocular
      inflammation in scleral inflammation. However, when fluorescein is used, the quality of the
      angiograms is limited by rapid extravasation of the dye due to diffusion through the
      fenestrated capillaries of the conjunctiva and episclera. Because fluorescein has a low
      molecular weight and is not a protein bound molecule, patchy leakage during the first transit
      of the dye, which obscures the angiographic details even before the late phases of the
      angiogram, can be seen.

      In contrast, indocyanine green (ICG) is a larger molecule than fluorescein and is more highly
      found in protein bound form. Therefore, it remains within the fenestrated vessels and shows
      negligible extravasation, which makes it ideal for use in anterior segment angiography.

      Tan and coworkers have shown that the morphology of pterygium recurrence inevitably reflects
      a high degree of vascularity.

      In this prospective study, we evaluated the anterior segment indocyanine green angiography
      (ICGA) findings for graft vascularization after primary pterygium excision with LCAT or AMT.
