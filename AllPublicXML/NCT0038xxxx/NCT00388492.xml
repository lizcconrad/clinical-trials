  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the proportion of subjects both antiretroviral
      experienced and virologically suppressed on lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)400/100mg twice daily
      who maintain viral suppression after switching to lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg once
      daily.

      The hypothesis for this study is that the majority of subjects will remain virologically
      suppressed with once daily dosing versus twice daily dosing and therefore quality of life
      will be improved with the once daily dosing of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)800/200mg.

          -  Currently virologically controlled (VL&lt;50 copies/mL) on a LPV/r containing regimen â‰¥ 3
             months

          -  Any CD4+ cell count

             infection (OI) consistent with CDC definition (Appendix B) within 30 days of screening

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

               -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
                  including any female who is post-menopausal) or

               -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screen, and
                  agrees to one of the following:

                    -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of
                       the study drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after
                       completion or premature discontinuation of the study to account for
                       elimination of the investigational drug. Should a patient decide to become
                       sexually active during the course of the study, she must be counseled and be
                       willing to use one of the birth control methods below:

                    -  Double barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,
                       diaphragm/spermicide)

                    -  Any intrauterine device(IUD) with published data showing that the expected
                       failure rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUD's meet this criterion)

                    -  Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient)

                    -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected
                       failure rate for that method is &lt;1% per year NOTE: Data are insufficient to
                       exclude a clinically important interaction of LPV/r with drugs, such as
                       hormonal contraceptives, that are highly metabolized by the cytochrome P450
                       enzyme system. As a result, hormonal contraception is not considered
                       adequate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding

          -  Patients unable to provide written informed consent

          -  Use of concurrent medications known to affect lopinavir and/or ritonavir
             concentrations (as listed in the attached Kaletra package insert)

          -  Patient with active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or disease according to the
             1993 CDC AIDS surveillance definition (Clinical Category C) that, in the opinion of
             the investigator, would prelude the patient from participating in the study (See
             Appendix B)

          -  History of active substance abuse, excluding cannabis, or psychiatric illness that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance with the protocol, dosing
             schedule and assessments.

          -  Patient is either pregnant at the time of screening evaluation or breast-feeding

          -  Patient, in the opinion of the investigator, is unlikely to be able to complete the
             48-week dosing period and protocol evaluations and assessments or adhere to the study
             drug regimen

          -  Patient suffers from a serious medical condition, such as diabetes, congestive heart
             failure, cardiomyopathy or other cardiac dysfunction, which in the opinion of the
             investigator would compromise the safety of the patient

          -  Patient has malabsorption syndrome or other gastrointestinal dysfunction, which may
             interfere with drug absorption or render the patient unable to take oral medication

          -  Patient has required treatment with radiation therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapeutic
             agents within 4 weeks prior to entry, or has an anticipated need for these agents
             within the study period

          -  Patient requires treatment with immunomodulating agents, such as systemic
             corticosteroids, interleukins, or interferon's within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or
             patients who have received an HIV immunotherapeutic vaccine within 3 months prior to

             rifampin or ergot derivatives (see section 5.5 Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug
             Therapies and Appendix C

          -  Patient has a history of allergy to any of the study drugs or any excipients therein.

          -  In addition, patients non-compliant with study medication during 2-4 week study
             periods despite adherence counseling will not be retained in the study due to
             increased risk for selective pressure and potential development of protease
             resistance.

          -  Patient requires inhaled or intranasal fluticasone
