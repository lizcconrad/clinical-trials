    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the treatment of Yt90 Zevalin in
      combination with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone)are
      effective as first line treatment in patients with bulky stage II or stage III or IV diffuse
      large B-cell lymphoma

    <textblock>
      Radioimmunotherapy represents a significant advance over unlabeled immunotherapy for the
      treatment of patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The radiobiological effects
      associated with Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) include the induction of
      apoptosis and cell-cycle redistribution.

      The response rate tend to be higher in patients who have been treated with fewer prior
      therapies and Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan may be suitable for use early in the course
      of therapy.

      Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan has less non hematologic toxicity than chemotherapy, with
      only minimal alopecia, mucositis, nausea, or vomiting, and a lower incidence of infections.

      Yt90-labelled ibritumomab tiuxetan regimen is routinely and safely given in an outpatient
      setting and is completed in 7-9 days and is thus more convenient to be used.
