      Atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits build up along the inner walls of
      arteries, can occur throughout the body. The purpose of this study is to examine the possible
      genetic differences that may influence where atherosclerosis occurs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plaque build-up caused by atherosclerosis increases the risk of blood clots, heart attack,
      and stroke. Blockages of plaque can occur in different areas of the body. PAD, a circulatory
      disorder in which blockages occur in the peripheral arteries, is one manifestation of
      atherosclerosis. Individuals with PAD experience reduced blood flow to the legs, which may
      cause leg pain while walking. Coronary artery disease (CAD), in which plaque builds up in
      arteries leading to the heart, is another atherosclerosis-related condition. Individuals with
      PAD and CAD have similar atherosclerosis risk factors, but it remains unknown why some
      individuals develop one disease and not the other. Genetic differences may influence where
      atherosclerosis develops. The goal of the study is to identify genetic variations that may
      cause inherited differences in plaque distribution.

      This study will enroll individuals with PAD who have been referred by their doctor for a
      coronary angiogram to confirm the presence of CAD. A control group composed of individuals
      who do not have PAD, but have similar risk factors for atherosclerosis, will also be
      enrolled. All participants will attend one study visit. They will undergo a coronary
      angiogram, a procedure in which a special dye is inserted intravenously into an artery of the
      heart. X-rays will be taken to document how blood flows through the artery. Questionnaires
      assessing quality of life, exercise habits, tobacco exposure, and family medical history will
      be completed. Participants will also undergo blood pressure measurements and blood collection
      for genetic analysis. Yearly follow-up phone calls will occur for 5 years to document any
      hospitalizations.
