      This open-label, multicenter, phase II trial will assess the antitumor activity and safety of
      temozolomide in combination with O6-BG in patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic
      glioma.

      Forty-one to 104 evaluable patients with temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma will be
      enrolled in this study. Total accrual on this study will not exceed 116 patients. The
      patients will receive daily temozolomide on 5 consecutive days (days 1-5) along with bolus
      infusions of O6-BG on days 1, 3, and 5 and a continuous infusion of O6-BG beginning
      immediately after the first bolus infusion and continuing until immediately prior to the last
      bolus injection. Patients will be evaluated for AEs during the course of therapy. Patients
      may receive treatment at the same dose level until appearance of significant
      treatment-related toxicities, disease progression or withdrawal of consent.

      Tumor response will be evaluated at the end of cycle 1, cycle 2 and then every two cycles for
      the duration of therapy, using physical and neurological examinations and diagnostic imaging.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with histologically documented anaplastic glioma (anaplastic astrocytoma,
             anaplastic oligodendroglioma or mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma).

          2. Temozolomide-resistant defined as patients who have progressed while receiving or
             within 8 weeks of completing the last dose of temozolomide.

          3. Disease progression &gt;= 12 weeks after the completion of any radiotherapy.

          4. If patient received chemotherapy or an investigational agent as part of their prior
             therapy, the patient must recover from all toxicities (&lt;= Grade 1) prior to enrollment
             on this protocol.

          5. Bi-dimensionally measurable disease on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
             study (MRI) performed within two weeks of study drug administration.

          6. If patient received intratumoral chemotherapy or immunotherapy as part of their prior
             therapy then histological confirmation of recurrence is mandated.

          7. KPS &gt;= 70%.

          8. The following laboratory results:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1500 cells/microliter

               -  Platelet count &gt;= 100,000 cells/microliter

               -  SGOT &lt;= 2.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5 x ULN

          9. Signed informed consent approved by Institutional Review Board.

         10. If sexually active, patients will take contraceptive measures for the duration of the
             treatment.

         11. For patients on corticosteroids, they must have been on a stable dose 1 week prior to
             baseline MRI and the dose should not be escalated over entry dose level, if clinically
             possible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or breast feeding women.

          2. Prior treatment with O6-BG plus temozolomide in combination.

          3. Active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics.

          4. Known diagnosis of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (HIV testing is not
             mandatory).

          5. Patients with a history of another primary malignancy that is currently clinically
             significant or currently requires active intervention.

          6. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          7. Patients who have received stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy as part of their
             prior therapy.

          8. Comedication that may interfere with study results; eg. immunosuppressive agents other
             than corticosteroids.
