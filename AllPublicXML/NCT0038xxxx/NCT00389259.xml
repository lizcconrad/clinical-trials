  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organophosphate (OP) compounds are a major threat as chemical warfare agents or in terrorist
      act. OPs are also the active ingredient of many insecticides. Ingestion of insecticides is a
      common cause of death among people who commit suicide in developing countries. OPs poisoning
      also frequently occurs after accidental exposure to agricultural OPs and in children as a
      result of unintentional ingestion.

      The use of competitive inhibitors of acetylcholine other than atropine for patient with
      organophosphate (OP) poisoning is controversial. Because scopolamines' ability to cross the
      blood brain barrier is better than atropine, it has been suggested that scopolamine should be
      used OP poisoned patients who have central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. However there
      is controversy regarding its potential benefit in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning
      in humans. To the best of our knowledge there are no randomised controlled studies on the use
      of scopolamine in humans. This prospective randomised controlled study is aimed to determine
      whether adding scopolamine to the standard treatment of atropine and oximes in patients with
      CNS symptoms of OP poisoning improve the outcome.

      Objective: to determine whether adding scopolamine to the standard treatment of atropine and
      oximes improve the outcome of patients with OP poisoning and CNS manifestations. Design: A
      multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study. Setting: Emergency
      Departments &amp; Intensive Care Units in Israel. Participants: Patients 2 -60 years old with
      acute OP poisoning and CNS manifestations. Interventions: In addition to standard treatment
      with atropine and obidoxime, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two
      treatment groups, scopolamine group, and placebo group (both given in the same volume).
      Scopolamine will be given IM or IV in a dose of 0.25mg for adults and 0.006mg/kg for children
      every 4 hours. At least three doses of scopolamine (or placebo) will be given. The medical
      staff will be blinded to the treatment given. Main outcome measures: Improvement in
      neurological status, duration of seizures and number of days on ventilator. Data analysis:
      The main outcome measures, will be compared using the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney
      tests as appropriate. The *2 or Fisher Exact tests, as appropriate, will be used for
      comparisons of categorical variables. We will use multiple logistic regression to examine the
      extent to which variables predict success or failure of the treatment.
