  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to quantify the amount of corneal staining observed with various
      marketed contact lens/multipurpose solution combinations. The hypothesis is that there are
      measurable differences in the amount of corneal staining between the various combinations.

    <textblock>
      A series of clinical studies is being conducted at one research site using a double-masked,
      randomized cross-over design. Each study consists of asymptomatic daily wear soft contact
      lens wearers observed at baseline and at two and four hours post lens insertion. Corneal
      staining is being assessed using sodium fluorescein, a cobalt filter and a yellow filter.
      Subjective comfort assessments are obtained at each visit.
