    <textblock>
      This study will explore the effect of pre-medication with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and
      topical lidocaine gel (Topicaine) on the perception of discomfort and overall satisfaction
      with the mammography experience.

      The research questions are:

        1. What is the relationship between the use of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and Topicaine
           prior to screening mammography and the perception of discomfort during the procedure?

        2. What is the relationship between perception of discomfort and overall satisfaction with
           the mammography experience?

        3. What is the relationship between the perception of discomfort and plans for future
           mammograms?

        4. What other factors are associated with the perception of discomfort and satisfaction?

      Breast cancer is prevalent, deadly, costly, and has low cure rates unless detected in its
      early stages. Mammography is the key component to early detection, yet it remains
      underutilized due to cost, access, and factors such as fear of pain.

      Multiple studies have shown that most women find mammography uncomfortable, even painful.
      Yet, little research has been done to find methods to reduce mammography-related discomfort.
      In an unpublished Masterâ€™s thesis, this investigator found that women who expected discomfort
      &gt; 40 on a visual analog scale (VAS) who were pre-medicated with 1000 mg of acetaminophen
      reported lower discomfort scores than those pre-medicated with placebo, but the sample size
      was too small to reach statistical significance. Further study on the effects of
      pre-medication is needed.

      Pain should not be associated with a potentially lifesaving procedure. A more comfortable and
      positive experience with mammography may increase the number of women who participate in
      regular mammography screening, and, thereby, increase early detection and reduce the
      mortality rate, costs, and emotional trauma associated with breast cancer.
