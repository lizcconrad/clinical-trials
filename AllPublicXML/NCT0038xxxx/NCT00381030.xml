  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study was to determine if a strategy of starting a heart medication
      (Beta-blocker) before patients leave the hospital and then being seen by a nurse manager
      would reduce subsequent hospitalizations compared to usual care.

      Hypothesis: A nurse-directed heart failure management program with inpatient initiation of
      beta blockers will improve health outcomes in a vulnerable, predominantly Hispanic and
      African American population.

      Heart failure is a leading cause of death and hospitalization in the US. Designing practical
      approaches to improving heart failure care is therefore a national health priority. One
      retrospective study suggested that patients taking beta-blockers while hospitalized for heart
      failure had a lower risk of rehospitalization at 6-months. One prospective study suggested
      that starting beta blockers among hospitalized heart failure patients is safe and improves
      compliance. However, improved outcomes of this approach have not been prospectively
      demonstrated.

      Comparison: Inpatient initiation of the beta-blocker carvedilol coupled with outpatient
      follow-up with a nurse manager was compared to usual care by internists and cardiologists.
