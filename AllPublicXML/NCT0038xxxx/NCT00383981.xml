  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether exposure to Al, Ga, In, As, and Sb induces lipid peroxidation in
      humans. Whole blood and urine levels of 170 workers were analysed by use of ICP-MS. MDA, the
      product of lipid peroxidation was determined by HPLC
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If MDA as an index of lipid peroxidation can be induced by these metals. We will suggest
      reducing exposure to these metals
