  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bright light therapy has been used to safely and effectively treat conditions such as
      Seasonal Affective Disorder and to regularize sleep in patients with circadian rhythm
      disorder. Based on evidence of the link between bright light, serotonin, mood and
      carbohydrate metabolism, it has been suggested that bright light therapy can improve weight
      loss but the literature on the subject is sparse. Further, the literature suggests that apart
      from any changes in mood and carbohydrate metabolism, bright light may reduce the unpleasant
      side-effects of exercise and increase compliance to an exercise program.

      Objective: Increased physical activity is important given the concern over the growing rates
      of obesity. Bright light therapy has the potential to enhancing serotonin levels, impact on
      carbohydrate metabolism and reducing soreness and hyperthermia associated with physical
      activity. The aim of this study is to conduct a controlled investigation of the effects of
      bright light therapy and exercise on weight loss and body composition in overweight
      individuals.

      Research Methods and Procedures: Twenty-five overweight male and female subjects will be
      assigned to 6 weeks of moderate exercise with or without bright light treatment. Outcome
      measure included changes in body mass and body composition and ratings of mood, seasonality
      and sleep.
