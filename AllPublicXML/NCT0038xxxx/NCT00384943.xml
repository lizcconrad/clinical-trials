      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of an aerobic home-based exercise
      program for the treatment of postpartum depression.

    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression occurs in 10-16% of women, with depressive symptoms lasting up to one
      year post delivery. Women affected by depression in the postpartum have been shown to be at
      higher risk for developing a recurrent depressive disorder. While the direct and indirect
      costs associated with postpartum depression are unknown, those associated with depression
      have been found to exceed 43 billion dollars in the United States alone. Moreover, maternal
      depression can negatively impact the mother-infant relationship and infant development.
      Despite the high prevalence of postpartum depression, the condition often goes undiagnosed
      and untreated by primary care providers. Alternative non-medical interventions for treating
      postpartum depression have not been widely investigated, leaving women and health care
      providers with few evidence-based options for treatment. If this exercise program is shown to
      be effective, then this intervention can be an alternate treatment option for alleviating
      depressed mood for women in the postpartum period. This nonpharmacological approach may be
      particularly attractive as many women are reluctant to take medication in the postpartum.
