      Nursing home patients admitted to the hospital pose a significant challenge for health care
      providers. Geriatric teaching pays particular attention to these admissions and related
      problems. However, it is yet to be proven, whether geriatric training helps to overcome any
      of these issues in a better way than through non-geriatric education. The study aims to prove
      that geriatric training provides advantages over non-geriatric training in caring for nursing
      home patients admitted to the hospital.

      Context: Nursing home patients admitted to the hospital pose a significant challenge for
      health care providers. Geriatric age, frailty, multiple readmissions, prolonged length of
      stay, and high mortality are just a few attributes of nursing home patients in the hospital.
      Geriatric teaching pays particular attention to these challenging problems. However, it is
      yet to be proven, whether geriatric training helps to overcome any of these issues in a
      better way than through non-geriatric education.

      Objective: To test the hypothesis that geriatric care provides advantages over non-geriatric
      training in caring for nursing home patients admitted to the hospital in regards to length of
      stay, rate of expirations and rate of readmissions. The secondary objective is to compare
      expirations and readmissions among patients cared for by geriatricians and non-geriatricians.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of patients admitted from
      Metropolitan Jewish Geriatric Nursing Home (MJGNH) to Maimonides Medical Center (MMC) over a
      certain period of time and under the care of geriatricians, non-geriatric internists, and
      surgeons. Comparison of the three study groups by age, sex, expiration rate, length of
      hospital stay (LOS) and readmission rate. Comparison of expired patients by age, sex and
      average LOS. Comparison of readmissions, expiration rate, by preservation of continuity of
      care, and by emergency room visits without admission.
