      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor
      cells. Diagnostic procedures, such as PET scan and CT scan, may help doctors measure the
      patient's response to treatment.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying PET scan and CT scan to see how well they work in
      evaluating response to treatment in patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for lung
      metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scan in measuring
           response at 3 months after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with lung
           metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the agreement between observers analyzing PET/CT scan results.

        -  Determine the outcome of these patients.

        -  Determine the false-positive rate and false-negative rate of PET/CT scan at 1 and 3
           months in these patients.

        -  Determine the optimal time for obtaining a negative PET scan.

        -  Determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
           predictive value of PET/CT scan at 1 and 3 months.

        -  Determine the morbidity associated with RFA.

        -  Determine the disease-free survival after RFA and the factors predicting recurrent
           disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scan at baseline. Patients then
      undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for lung metastases. PET/CT scan is repeated at 1 week,
      1 month, and 3 months after RFA.

      After completion of RFA, patients are followed by clinical examination and conventional
      scanning at 6, 9, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
