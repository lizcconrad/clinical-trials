    <textblock>
      One of the objectives of the C2P coalition is the successful delivery of a CDC-endorsed
      community-level HIV prevention program aimed at changing the risk profiles of youth. This
      protocol (ATN 041) describes the program, Community PROMISE (Peers Reaching Out and Modeling
      Intervention Strategies) or MPowerment, and plans for adapting and implementing it. There are
      a total of 4 interventions that a community can implement.

      Community Promise: Role model stories comprise the &quot;heart&quot; of printed materials distributed
      throughout the target community. The role model stories are brief publications that depict
      personal accounts from individuals in the population of focus who have made or are planning
      to make a risk-reducing behavioral change. The messages in the role model stories are
      reinforced by interpersonal communication with trained peer advocates.

      MPowerment: is a community level HIV/STD prevention program that relies on peer advocates
      from the community to lead outreach activities including discussion groups (M-groups),
      venue-based outreach, social events and a publicity campaign. Sites will adapt MPowerment for
      local use remaining faithful to the core elements.
