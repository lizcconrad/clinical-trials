    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Transtec(R) PRO 70 µg/h and a new
      buprenorphine patch formulation lead to same plasma levels of buprenorphine after multiple
      dose application.

      Main: To demonstrate the bioequivalence of the new buprenorphine transdermal patch T2rev
      formulation containing 13 mg buprenorphine (Test) as compared to Transtec(R) PRO 70 µg/h
      patch transdermal patch containing 40 mg buprenorphine as reference after multiple patch
      application. Pharmacokinetic target parameters are AUCss,Tau and Css,max.

      Further: To assess the safety, tolerability, skin tolerability and adhesiveness of the patch
      applications. To evaluate the following further Pharmacokinetic parameters: Css,min, Css,ave,
      PTF, Swing, tss,max, and t1/2,z
