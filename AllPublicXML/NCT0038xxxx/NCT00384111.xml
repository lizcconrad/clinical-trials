  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat follicular lymphoma patients who have not received previous treatment
      with R-CVP. Half of the patients will receive Zevalin after R-CVP and the other half will
      receive only R-CVP. The two patient groups will be compared to determine if Zevalin given
      after R-CVP therapy provides greater benefits than receiving no additional anti-cancer
      therapy after R-CVP.
