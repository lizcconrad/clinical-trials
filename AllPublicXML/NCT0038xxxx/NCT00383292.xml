  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the objective response rate (complete and
      partial response) for patients who receive LY573636 after one prior systemic treatment for
      unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will receive a 2-hour intravenous infusion of study drug (LY573636) once every 28
      days. Radiological imaging scans will be performed before the first dose of study drug and
      then after every other treatment. Patients will be assessed for clinical progression at every
      visit and for response approximately every 56 days (every other cycle).

    <description>LY573636 dose is dependent on patient's height, weight, and gender and is adjusted to target a specific Cmax based on patient laboratory parameters. LY573636 is administered intravenously every 28 days until disease progression or other criteria for patient discontinuation are met.</description>

          -  Have received 1 previous systemic treatment regimen for unresectable or metastatic
             melanoma. An immunotherapy or antibody-based regimen (including vaccination-based
             treatments) is not counted as a prior treatment regimen for determining study
             eligibility, unless it was combined with a chemotherapeutic or targeted anti-cancer
             drug.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer, including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or other investigational therapy for at least 30 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Serious pre-existing medical conditions

          -  Have received two or more previous treatment regimens for unresectable or metastatic
             melanoma

          -  Have a second primary cancer (unless disease-free to more than 2 years)

          -  Active treatment with Warfarin (Coumadin)

          -  Primary ocular or mucosal melanoma
