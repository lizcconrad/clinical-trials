  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, asthma is responsible for 1 million emergency room visits, 400,000
      hospitalizations, and 5000 deaths according to the NHLBI. In addition, 10 million missed
      school-days per year and 100 million days of restricted activity are attributed to this
      disease. While there is no known cause or cure for asthma, recent studies have shown that
      hospitalizations and emergency room visits can be reduced by as much as 78% and 73%,
      respectively, when the disease is properly managed. According to the EPA, the occurance of
      children with asthma more than doubled the rate of two decades ago; in 2001 the percentage of
      asthmatic children was 8.7% (6.3 million children).

      Properly managing asthma is nontrivial and can often require an asthma specialist. The
      difficulty in diagnosing and managing asthma lies primarily in the lack of available clinical
      technologies capable of assessing airway inflammation, an early and persistent component of
      asthma. Accordingly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines for the diagnosis and
      management of asthma strongly recommend long term anti-inflammatory therapies, such as oral
      or inhaled corticosteroids, to reverse airway inflammation in an effort to prevent
      irreversible airway damage, termed “airway remodeling”. The medical community has expressed
      the need for more objective and noninvasive measures of airway inflammation for diagnosing
      asthma and monitoring the effectiveness and compliance of anti-inflammatory therapies.

      The clinical research plan is designed to evaluate airway inflammation associated with
      asthma. In this human subjects study, a non-invasive exhaled breath analysis sensor, called
      the Breathmeter, will be used to measure eNO concentrations in children and adults (ages
      4-65) with a broad range of respiratory disorders as well as those with no known respiratory
      disorders. Breath donations will be simple and straightforward presenting little to no
      discomfort to volunteers.

      The study plan is divided into two sections: in-clinic studies and large-scale outreach
      screening.

      (A). Clinical Studies The clinical study is intended to obtain data characterizing eNO
      concentrations within individual groups of subjects listed in the inclusion criteria. The
      type of this study is “non-invasive”, and the study design is “diagnosis/ treatment
      monitoring, and efficacy”. The study will seek to recruit subjects who fall into one of the
      categories listed in the inclusion criteria below. The number of subjects (n) to be recruited
      for each category is given and is estimated based on the past number of subjects mainly at
      the Ekips Technologies, The Oklahoma Allergy &amp; Asthma Clinic, and the Norman Lung Center
      sites.

      Inclusion Criteria (Total Number of Subjects, n = 700)

      Both genders are eligible for this study:

        1. Healthy subjects (n=120)

        2. Asthma (Total n=450) [diagnosed according to NHLBI/ NAEPP Guidelines (1998)]

             1. Non-treated or B2-agonist treated asthmatics (n=150),

             2. Glucocorticoid treated asthmatics, (n=150),

             3. Leukotriene Antagonist treated asthmatics, (n=75),

             4. Glucocorticoid and Leukotriene Antagonists treated asthmatics, (n= 75).

        3. Acute respiratory illnesses (n=65

           a) Sinusitis (Acute and Chronic), b) Influenza, c) Common cold, d)Pneumonia, e)Related
           symptoms, but no diagnosis.

        4. Allergies (n=65) a) Atopic dermatitis, b) Allergic rhinitis, c) Seasonal allergies.

      Healthy Subjects Recruiting

      Healthy subjects will be recruited from visitors and patients at the study sites. Visitors
      may include relatives or friends accompanying patients. Healthy employees at the study sites
      may be asked to participate in the study. Patients, visitors, and employees will be told that
      do not have to participate if they do not want to.

      Exclusion Criteria

      Subjects younger than 4 and older than 65 will be excluded from the study. Pregnant women
      will also be excluded from the study.

      Duration of Participation

      For each visit, the participant in the study will be asked to donate up to 3 breath samples
      for the first visit. The total time required for breath donations and measurements will be
      about 5 minutes. An additional five minutes of a subject’s time are needed to complete a
      short interview if the information needed is not already available.

      Asthmatic or suspected asthmatic patients, both treated and non-treated will be asked to
      donate breath during additional visits if convenient. Follow-up measurements may be performed
      during regularly scheduled office visits.
