      The purpose of this study is to determine whether 2 investigational malaria vaccines are safe
      as well as protective against malaria in adults living in the United States
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      35 volunteers aged 18 to 50 years will be enrolled to receive one of 2 investigational
      malaria vaccines. The vaccines are made of a malaria protein FMP2.1 mixed in 2 different
      adjuvants (AS01B and AS02A). Five volunteers will get a small (10 µg) dose of FMP2.1/AS01B
      since this vaccine has not yet been in humans. If it is safe, then 15 volunteers will get 50
      µg FMP2.1 in AS02A and 15 will get 50 µg FMP2.1 in AS01B. All vaccines are given IM in the
      deltoid of the non-dominant arm, every 1 month for 3 months. After vaccination, the subjects
      will follow up at clinical trials for evaluation of any adverse events.

      20 vaccinees (10 from each 50 µg vaccine group) will undergo primary sporozoite challenge
      14-30 days after dose 3 via bite of 5 malaria-infected mosquitoes. All subjects will have a
      blood slide prepared and read to check for asexual P. falciparum parasitemia at least once
      daily beginning day 5 post challenge. Beginning on day 10 post challenge, subjects will check
      into a designated hotel, where 24 hour evaluation and care will be available for 10 nights.
      After this hotel phase, there will be follow-up visits to ensure there are no late
      developments of malaria in those who have not fallen ill (and thus are considered protected).

      Any subject who tests positive for malaria will be treated with chloroquine. Efficacy
      readouts are complete protection or significant delay in patency defined as &gt;2 days than the
      median prepatent period for the 6 infectivity controls. These 6 controls receive no vaccine
      and are enrolled for malaria-challenge only in order to provide comparison group for
      vaccinated individuals.

             clinical examination before entering into the study*

          -  Available to participate for duration of study (approximately five months, not
             including screening)

          -  If the participant is female, she must be of non-childbearing potential, i.e., either
             surgically sterilized or one year post-menopausal; or, if of childbearing potential,
             she must be abstinent or have used adequate contraceptive precautions (e.g.,
             intrauterine contraceptive device; oral contraceptives; diaphragm or condom in
             combination with contraceptive jelly, cream or foam; Norplant® or Depo-Provera®)
             during this study, have a negative pregnancy test at the time of each immunization,

             immunization series and the malaria challenge.

          -  Prior to entry into this study, participants must score at least 80% correct on a
             short multiple-choice quiz that assesses their understanding of this study. If they do
             not score 80% on the initial quiz, the protocol information will be reviewed with them
             to ensure comprehension and they will have the opportunity to retest. Participants who
             fail the Comprehension Assessment for the second time will not be enrolled.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior receipt of an investigational malaria vaccine

             dermatologic patients, sulfa for recurrent urinary tract infections, etc.)

          -  Planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol 30 days prior
             to or after the first immunization

          -  History of malaria chemoprophylaxis within 60 days prior to immunization

          -  Any history of malaria

          -  Known exposure to malaria within the previous 12 months

          -  Planned travel to malarious areas during the study period

             persons with a minor illness such as diarrhea, mild upper respiratory infection with
             or without low-grade febrile illness, i.e., oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C/99.5°F).

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
