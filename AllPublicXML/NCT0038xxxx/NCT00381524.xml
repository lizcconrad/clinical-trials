  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the third decade of the HIV pandemic, what was once a uniformly and rapidly fatal disease
      has been transformed into a chronic illness by advances in the understanding of HIV
      pathogenesis and therapeutics. As a result, HIV-infected individuals are living longer and
      better lives. This phenomenon, coupled with a continued steady rate of new HIV infections in
      this country, has led to the highest U.S. HIV prevalence rates since the beginning of the
      epidemic. In the past, HIV prevention efforts were separate from routine primary care
      delivery due to multiple factors including stigma and time constraints. Recent events,
      including increases in sexually transmitted disease (STD) rates among HIV-infected persons
      and evidence that infected individuals can be super-infected by HIV strains resistant to
      antiretroviral therapy, have inspired the SPNS program initiative to develop demonstration
      projects for interventions to reduce risky sexual exposures among HIV-infected patients
      receiving primary care.

      Goals of the Demonstration Project. The goals of this project are as follows:

      Goal 1: To utilize recent technological advances and refine a theory-based, computerized
      intervention system currently being evaluated in a Birmingham STD clinic. Our proposed
      interventions will target men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) and will be designed to: increase
      condom use for specific sexual activities with both main and casual (other) partners;
      decrease numbers of sexual partners among those reporting multiple partners; and increase the
      frequency of HIV serostatus disclosure to sexual partners.

      Goal 2: To evaluate a computer-guided, theory-based, provider-delivered intervention in the
      context of standard care in an HIV primary care facility in collaboration with the Center for
      AIDS Prevention Studies (CAPS). We will test the following hypotheses after 18 months of
      follow-up:

      Hypothesis 1: That the proportion of HIV-positive MSM reporting 100% condom use with main
      partners will be significantly increased in the intervention group compared to the usual care
      group.

      Hypothesis 2: That the proportion of patients reporting 100% condom use with casual partners
      will be significantly increased among patients in the intervention group compared to the
      usual care group.

      Hypothesis 3: That the proportion of patients with multiple sexual partners will be
      significantly reduced among intervention group participants compared with the usual care
      group.

      Hypothesis 4: That the proportion of HIV-positive MSM who disclose their HIV status to sex
      partners who are HIV-negative or are of unknown HIV status will be significantly increased
      among the patients receiving the intervention compared to the patients in the usual care
      group.

      Goal 3: In collaboration with the Center and SPNS program, to conduct a holistic evaluation
      of the intervention program.

      Goal 4: To compare the cumulative incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic treatable STDs
      (gonococcal and chlamydial infections) between patients in the intervention and usual care
      groups.

             the past year

          -  Willingness to follow-up for at least 18 months

          -  Ability to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patient

          -  Male patient who is unwilling to follow-up for at least 18 months
