  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the clinical application of a new device that
      records pH changes in the hypopharynx. The investigators also aim to compare the consistency
      of distal esophageal pH with hypopharyngeal pH using both the &quot;short&quot; and the &quot;long&quot;
      catheters in patients.

    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has been linked to many disorders and can be diagnosed
      through a variety of modalities utilizing 24 hour ambulatory pH monitoring which can register
      the duration, pattern and symptom correlation of distal esophageal acid exposure. This can be
      accomplished via a catheter probe connected from outside the body and placed through a
      nostril, advanced past the hypopharynx and down into the distal esophagus. Or, a small pH
      detector temporarily implanted in the distal esophagus during endoscopy can record reflux
      events. However, despite available technologies, there has long been a deficiency in
      detecting extra-esophageal reflux in the upper esophagus/ hypopharynx. This is of interest
      for gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, and pulmonologists in the evaluation of
      extra-esophageal reflux as a potential culprit for asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis, globus,
      and non-cardiac chest pain. Until now, there has not been a device sensitive enough for
      accurately detecting extra-esophageal reflux (EERD) and clinicians have relied upon
      subjective response to empiric treatment with acid reducing medications to determine whether
      acid reflux was at the root of the symptoms. There are currently no well designed published
      studies with this device to assess its role in this group of difficult to treat patients.

    <description>The three study groups underwent dual pH measurements of the oropharyngeal as well as esophageal acid exposure employing the regular length probe for the oropharynx and the custom-designed long probe for the distal esophagus. The reason for the custom-designed esophageal measurement was to ensure that events noted in the oropharynx originated distally and were of gastric source. Measurements for the two locations were time synchronized to ensure accuracy. Calculations were based on length of time spent in upright and supine positions, and a combination of the two positions.</description>

        <description>The three study groups underwent dual pH measurements of the oropharyngeal as well as esophageal acid exposure employing the regular length probe for the oropharynx and the custom-designed long probe for the distal esophagus. The reason for the custom-designed esophageal measurement was to ensure that events noted in the oropharynx originated distally and were of gastric source. Measurements for the two locations were time synchronized to ensure accuracy. Calculations were based on length of time spent in upright and supine positions, and a combination of the two positions.</description>
