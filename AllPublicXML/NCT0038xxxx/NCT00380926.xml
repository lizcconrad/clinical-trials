  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Native populations consuming high amounts of fish suffer less from allergic diseases. The
      purpose of this study is to determine whether polyunsaturated fatty acids (fish oil) might
      have a disease modifying influence on asthmatics sensitized to house dust mite.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most asthmatics suffer from mild disease and non pharmacologic intervention would be
      beneficial for the majority of these subjects. We investigated the anti-inflammatory
      potential of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in allergic asthma.

      In our parallel, double-blinded study, 23 patients allergic to house dust mite were randomly
      assigned to dietary supplementation with a PUFA enriched fat blend or placebo for five weeks.
      The verum contained eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 450 mg/day, docosahexaenoic acid 180 mg/day,
      stearidonic acid 60mg/day, and gamma-linolenic acid 60 mg/day; the placebo consisted of
      mainly unsaturated and monosaturated fatty acids. After three weeks, the patients were
      challenged with low doses of inhalative house dust mite allergen for two weeks.

      Following parameters were determined during low-dose allergen exposure in both groups:
      exhaled NO (eNO) as a marker of bronchial inflammation, clinical symptoms, FEV1, beta-agonist
      usage, and bronchial hyperreactivity, sputum eosinophils and sulfoleucotrienes. Compliance
      with the study protocol was controlled by the determination of PUFAs in plasma and
      erythrocytes.
