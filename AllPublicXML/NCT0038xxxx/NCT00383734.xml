  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of facial lipoatrophy with dermal injections polylactic acid (Newfill TM) is a safe
      procedure and has been now widely used with a good efficacy. However, this therapy is not
      effective in all treated patients and the benefit of the injections may decrease with time
      necessitating re-injections several months after the first sets of injections. In this study
      we would like to compare the efficacy and safety of Eutrophill(polyacrylamid gel), a
      resorbable filler compound versus Newfill in a comparative, randomised, multicenter trial.
      Primary endpoint will be the self-perception by the patient with a visual analogue scale (VAS
      index). Secondary endpoints are a quality of life questionnaire (MOS-HIV), the a-NBC
      questionnaire (perception by the patient and by the doctor of the severity of the
      lipoatrophy), the measure of the dermal thickness and cheek skin fold as assessed by the
      Skinfold Caliper, the ordering of digital photographs and the evaluation of the dermal
      thickness by CT scan.

      The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Eutrophill (polyacrylamid gel),
      a resorbable filler compound versus Newfill( polylactic acid) in a comparative, randomised,
      multicenter trial and patient-blinded study, in the treatment of facial lipoatrophy in
      HIV-infected patients, one year after the first injection (week 48). The efficacy will be
      assessed by measuring the median self-perception index of the patients with a visual analogue
      scale (VAS index).The study will compare between treatments, at week 48, week 72 and week 96
      versus baseline :the median increase of the VAS index, the rate of treatment failure, the
      scores of 2 patients-questionnaires (a-NBC and MOS-HIV),the ordering of digital
      photographs,the median increase of the facial dermal thickness of the cheek and the dermal
      skin fold as assessed by a Skinfold Caliper.

      The study will compare at week 48 and week 96 versus baseline:

      the median increase of dermal thickness as assessed by CT scan of the face. Safety will be
      assessed by the frequency and nature of immediate and delayed side effects.
