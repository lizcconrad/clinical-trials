      RATIONALE: Radiofrequency ablation uses a high-frequency, electric current to kill tumor
      cells. Giving radiofrequency ablation before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce
      the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well radiofrequency ablation followed by surgery
      works in treating patients with early invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effectiveness of radiofrequency ablation (RFA), in terms of amount of
           tumor coagulated and viable cell count, in patients with early invasive breast cancer or
           low- or intermediate-grade ductal carcinoma in situ.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the size, configuration, and pathological features of human breast tumors
           after treatment with RFA.

        -  Determine whether RFA energy applied to breast cancer will result in cancer cell death.

        -  Determine whether tumor-free margins are achieved by RFA in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of acute toxicities to skin after surgery in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

        -  Pre-radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedures: Patients undergo staging by MRI assessment
           to determine the size of their tumor. Patients with nonpalpable lesions must undergo
           placement of a metallic clip in the center of their tumor and a hook wire to guide
           surgical excision by intraoperative ultrasound imaging. Patients with invasive breast
           cancer undergo axillary lymph node dissection or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for
           axillary lymph node staging. Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ proceed directly to
           RFA/resection since they do not require axillary staging.

        -  RFA: Patients undergo RFA comprising insertion of a multiple-needle electrode into the
           breast tumor under direct guidance of ultrasonography and the metallic clip placed
           preoperatively in the lesion.

        -  Surgical resection of RFA area: After RFA is completed, the electrode is removed and
           patients undergo wide local excision of the residual tumor or mastectomy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <description>A small diameter needle is inserted through the skin and directly into the tumor for the purpose of supplying RF current. Initial power of the RF generator will start at 5-10 watts. The power will increase by 5-10 watts every minute until impedance of the system automatically stops the RF treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females of ages â‰¥18 years.

          -  Core biopsy proven invasive breast cancer OR

          -  Core biopsy proven low or intermediate grade DCIS.

          -  Tumor less than or equal to 2.0 cm in diameter.

          -  No prior surgical treatment for breast cancer within 30 days.

          -  Life expectancy of &gt; 10 years, not including the diagnosis of cancer.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  Informed consent given.

          -  Multifocal invasive breast cancer patients are eligible. All tumors that are palpable
             or visualized by USS can be treated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subjects.

          -  Ages &lt; 18 years.

          -  Breast tumor &gt; 2.0 cm in diameter.

          -  Evidence of distant metastatic disease.

          -  Evidence of diffuse calcification suggestive of extensive or multifocal DCIS.

          -  High grade DCIS or presence of comedo-necrosis because these lesions can be associated
             with invasive breast cancer, which would go undetected if the lesion is entirely
             destroyed by the RF ablation.
