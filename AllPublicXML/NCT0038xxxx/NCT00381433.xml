      AVI-4020 Injection, a phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO), was found to cross the
      blood-brain barrier during a study of patients with presumptive West Nile virus disease.
      AVI-4065, which was designed to target HCV, is also a PMO; its ability to cross the
      blood-brain barrier is unknown. In this study, a single dose of AVI-4065 will be
      subcutaneously injected, and samples collected to determine if this drug crosses the
      blood-brain barrier. If it does, then additional investigations could be performed in people
      with severe forms of HCV disease in which the brain is affected.

      AVI-4020 Injection, a phosphorodiamidate Morpholino oligomer (PMO), was found to cross the
      blood-brain barrier during a study of patients with presumptive West Nile virus disease.
      AVI-4065, which was designed to target HCV, is also a PMO; its ability to cross the
      blood-brain barrier is unknown. As the incidence of HCV disease has grown, the knowledge base
      of this disease has likewise increased.

      Encephalopathy is a recognized consequence in some patients with HCV infection. In this
      study, a single dose of AVI-4065 will be subcutaneously injected, and samples collected to
      determine if this drug crosses the blood-brain barrier. If it does, then additional
      investigations could be performed in people with HCV disease in which the brain is affected.
