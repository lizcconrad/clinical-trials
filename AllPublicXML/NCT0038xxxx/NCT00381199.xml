    <textblock>
      Most chronic pain patients with insomnia are currently not well-managed using existing
      medications. If found to safely improve sleep with chronic pain patients, nabilone could be
      added to the treatment options available in the management of fibromyalgia and associated
      symptoms.

      The principle hypothesis of this study is that nabilone at a dose of 0.5-1mg is as
      efficacious as amitriptyline at a dose of 10-20mg, in improving sleep quality in patients
      with fibromyalgia.
