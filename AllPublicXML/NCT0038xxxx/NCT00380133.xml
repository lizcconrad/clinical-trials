    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Subject is current smoker or ex-smoker with a smoking history of at least 10 pack
             years (number of pack years = [number of cigarettes per day/20] x number of years
             smoked).

          -  The patient has serum CRP ≥ 3 mg/L at screening

          -  Subjects able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and
             protocol-stated restrictions.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any clinically relevant abnormality identified on medical assessment, laboratory
             examination, or 12-lead ECG which in the opinion of the investigator, will lead to an
             unacceptable increase in the risk of study participation or will call into question
             the validity of the outcome measures.

          -  Subjects who are obese, defined as having a BMI &gt; 40

          -  Subject has a diagnosis of asthma that is confirmed by the investigator.

          -  Subject has poorly controlled COPD, defined as the occurrence of any of the following
             in the 2 weeks prior to visit 1: acute worsening of COPD that is managed by the
             subject at home by self-treatment with corticosteroids or antibiotics, or that
             requires treatment by a physician.

          -  Subject has active tuberculosis, lung cancer or clinically overt bronchiectasis.

          -  Symptoms of &quot;cold or flu&quot; or any respiratory infection/symptoms at the start of the
             study

          -  Subject has cardiac, gastrointestinal, neurological, renal, endocrine or psychiatric
             disease that is uncontrolled on permitted medication

          -  Subject has history of allergic rhinitis.

          -  Subjects with a history of any type of malignancy with the exception of successfully
             treated basal cell cancer of the skin.

          -  Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, connective tissue disorders and other conditions
             known to be associated with chronic inflammation (e.g. Inflammatory Bowel Disease).

          -  Subjects with chronic infections such as gingivitis, periodontitis, prostatitis,
             gastritis, and urinary tract infections.

          -  Subjects with history of hepatic disease.

          -  History of increased liver function tests (ALT, AST) above upper limit of normal in
             the past 6 months and/or liver function tests (bilirubin, ALT, AST) above upper limit
             of normal at screening.

          -  History of positive HIV, Hepatitis B /C antibody test result, a positive Hep B/C
             result at screen or a risk factor for these diseases.

          -  History of drug or other allergy, which, in the opinion of the Investigator precludes
             participation in the study.
