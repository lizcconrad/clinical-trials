  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sitamaquine is an 8-aminoquinoline which is being developed as an oral treatment for visceral
      leishmaniasis (VL). Pre-clinical and subsequent clinical investigations have demonstrated
      oral efficacy against Leishmania donovani. The purposes of this study are to characterise the
      pharmacokinetic profile of sitamaquine, administered orally, and to determine if the
      pharmacokinetic profile is affected by administration with food. The study is also designed
      to further characterise the safety and tolerability of sitamaquine compared with amphotericin
      B, particularly in reference to renal, hepatic and cardiac adverse events, prior to
      initiation of phase III studies. Finally the study will investigate the efficacy of a 21 day
      treatment course. Previous studies have used 28 days dosing, but parasitological evidence
      from one study suggests that shorter courses may be effective.

    <measure>Area under the concentration-time curve over the dosing interval AUC(0-tau) for sitamaquine</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is defined as the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to last quantifiable concentration (AUC 0-tau). AUC is a measure of exposure. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of sitamaquine was obtained at the following time points on days 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose. An additional sample was taken on Day 23 and Day 24 to approximate 48 hours and 72 hours post last dose on Day 21. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for sitamaquine</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was defined as the maximum concentration of sitamaquine. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of sitamaquine was obtained at the following time points on days 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours. An additional sample was taken on Day 23 and Day 24 to approximate 48 hours and 72 hours post last dose on Day 21.</description>

    <measure>Time to maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) for sitamaquine</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose.</time_frame>
    <description>Tmax is defined as the time to peak concentration from initiation of sitamaquine dosing. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of sitamaquine was obtained at the following time points on days 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose. An additional sample was taken on Day 23 and Day 24 to approximate 48 hours and 72 hours post last dose on Day 21.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Accumulation ratio for sitamaquine</measure>
    <time_frame>At Day 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Point estimate was the ratio of adjusted geometric means between repeat dosing days (Day 21 or Day 10) and single dose day (Day 1). An evaluation on the accumulation rate was based upon the comparison of AUC(0-24) values after repeated dosing to the values from the first dose on day 1. Blood samples for determination of plasma concentrations of sitamaquine was obtained at the following time points on days 1, 10 and 21: immediately pre-dose, and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 16 hours post dose. An additional sample was taken on Day 23 and Day 24 to approximate 48 hours and 72 hours post last dose on Day 21. Individual observed accumulation ratios on Day 10 were calculated by dividing AUC (0-tau) on Day 10 by AUC (0-tau) on Day 1. A similar formula was applied to the accumulation ratio on Day 21.</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Data for on-treatment AEs have been reported,</description>
