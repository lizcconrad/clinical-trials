  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tree MATAMPL has been developed to provide pre-seasonal specific immunotherapy for patients
      with hypersensitivity to Tree (birch, alder, hazel) pollen (hay fever). This novel
      formulation is designed to provide a vaccine that will be efficacious with only four
      escalating dose injections administered before the start of the pollen season. In this Study
      the Efficacy will be assessed by exposing allergic subjects to birch pollen in an
      environmental exposure chamber EEC. Patient symptomatic response to birch pollen and patient
      quality of life in the EEC will be determined.

             and positive skin prick test for tree pollen allergen (wheals of ≥ 5 mm (birch) and ≥
             3 mm (hazel and alder) greater than the negative control after skin prick testing) at
             Visit 1. Patients who will be skin tested at Visit 1 must adhere to the washout time
             for antihistamines.

             birch pollen exposure sessions (Visits 4 and 5) to be enrolled into the study. Minimum
             qualifying symptom scores are defined as a TSS of at least 12 out of a possible 24 and
             a NSS of at least 7 out of a possible 12 on at least one symptom diary card on each of
             Visits 4 and 5. Furthermore, a minimum priming criteria for NSS of 7 out of a possible
             12, including a score of at least 2 for runny nose, on two diary cards during each of
             Visits 4 and 5, must be obtained.

          -  Patients must observe the drug washout times prior to Screening (Visit 1). The use of
             other medications will be permitted if they are not expected to interfere with the
             ability of the patient to participate in the study and provided they have been on a
             stable regimen (i.e., the same dosage and administration) for six weeks prior to
             Screening.

          -  Males or non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are post-menopausal or naturally or
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy; bilateral oophorectomy; bilateral tubal ligation
             with surgery at least 6 weeks prior to study initiation). Postmenopausal is defined as
             at least 12 months natural spontaneous amenorrhea, or at least six weeks following
             surgical menopause (bilateral oophorectomy). Females of childbearing potential should
             be using one of the following acceptable birth control methods:Intrauterine device
             (IUD) in place for at least 3 months;Barrier method (condom or diaphragm) with
             spermicide; Stable hormonal contraceptive for at least 3 months prior to study and
             through study completion;Abstinence; Non-heterosexual lifestyle.

          -  Patients who are normally active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the
             basis of medical history, physical examination and routine laboratory tests.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to give written informed consent and must provide
             this consent.

          -  Patients must be willing and able to attend required study visits. 11.Patients must be
             able to follow instructions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A patient will not be included in this study if one or more of the following criteria
        apply:

          -  Have a positive skin prick test [wheal (longest diameter) ≥ 3 mm greater than the
             negative control] at Visit 1 to any of the following perennial allergens: house dust
             mites (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides farinae), molds
             (Cladosporium cladosporioides, Alternaria alternata, Penicillium chyrsogenum
             (notatum), and Aspergillus fumigatus), or epithelia (cat, dog, and horse). In these
             cases, a careful history is to be taken and if moderate or severe symptoms are
             reported when exposed to the aforementioned allergens, the subject is to be excluded.
             Exception: the source of the allergen (cat, dog, horse) can be avoided for the entire
             study. Subjects with mild or no symptoms when exposed to the aforementioned allergens
             during the 3 years prior to Visit 1 will be allowed to enroll. Mild symptoms are
             defined as: sign/symptom clearly present, but minimal awareness, easily tolerated.
