      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing
      pyelonephritis and in avoiding the appearance of new scars in a sample of children under 36
      months with vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the effectiveness of continuous antibiotic prophylaxis in children with
      vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) has been intensely discussed. The question is not only whether
      antibiotics are effective in preventing recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI), but also
      whether they alter the natural history of disease and help to prevent the appearance of new
      kidneys scars. The evidence on the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis is scanty:
      randomised controlled trials (RCT) published until now are poorly designed and carried out in
      very heterogeneous samples of children, i.e. spanning from 6 months to 14-18 years of age and
      pooling patients with and without VUR. A recently updated Cochrane Systematic Review
      concludes that high quality RCTs are needed to determine the effectiveness of long-term
      antibiotics for the prevention of UTIs in susceptible children. Moreover, the presence of VUR
      has not been firmly shown to be a risk factor for recurrence of pyelonephritis, and a direct
      association between VUR and the presence of scars or the appearance of new scars has not been
      demonstrated; there is just an association between VUR of grade IV-V and prenatal renal
      dysplasia, almost exclusively in male infants. In spite of this uncertainty, several practice
      guidelines recommend long term antibiotic prophylaxis in children with different degrees of
      VUR.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing
      pyelonephritis and in avoiding the appearance of new scars in a sample of children under 36
      months with VUR.

      Comparison: In a multicentre trial, 100 patients with VUR diagnosed with cystourethrography
      after a first episode of acute pyelonephritis or for prenatal evidence of pyelectasia will be
      assigned randomly to receive prophylaxis or not. Randomization will be carried out using a
      centralized minimization procedure to balance for sex, age group and VUR grade.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presence of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR) grade II, III or IV, based on the
             International Classification, mono or bilateral, diagnosed between one day and 30
             months of age after a first episode of acute pyelonephritis, or after birth during
             diagnostic procedures planned as a consequence of prenatal ultrasonographic evidence
             of pyelectasia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  previous episodes of urinary tract infection (UTI), even if only suspected (e.g. an
             episode of fever treated with antibiotics without performing urine culture);

          -  VUR grade I, because of the high probability of rapid spontaneous resolution;

          -  VUR grade V, as requested by the Technical Scientific Committee, concerned by the high
             incidence of associated renal dysplasia;

          -  recurrence of acute pyelonephritis before the first dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
             renal scan, if this was positive for scars.
