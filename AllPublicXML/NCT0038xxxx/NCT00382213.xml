    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of treatment with olmesartan
      medoxomil, an Angiotensin Receptor Blocker, compared to placebo on the blood levels of
      surrogate markers of vascular inflammation for atherosclerotic disease. Patients will be
      randomized to receive either olmesartan medoxomil or placebo for one year.

          -  Males or Females age less than or equal to 18

          -  TEE-defined Grade III or IV atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta documented
             within the previous 90 days, or established atherosclerotic disease of the lower
             extremities as demonstrated by:

               -  a history of lower extremity peripheral vascular surgery for obstructive
                  atherosclerotic disease, or

               -  a history of lower extremity peripheral arterial angioplasty for obstructive
                  atherosclerotic disease, or

               -  a history of lower extremity amputation secondary to atherosclerotic disease, or

               -  an ABI &lt;0.90 within the previous 90 days, or

               -  a history of claudication in patients with documented coronary artery disease
                  (i.e., history of myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or coronary
                  angiography demonstrating at least one obstructive coronary lesion with a 50% or
                  greater stenosis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing age who do not agree to utilize protocol approved contraceptive
             methods.

          -  Average pre-dose SBP &lt; 100 or DBP &lt; 60.

          -  Patients with any serious disorder including cardiovascular (ventricular arrhythmias,

             gastrointestinal, endocrine/metabolic (excluding patients with controlled diabetes
             mellitus), hematologic/oncologic (including an active malignancy other than basal cell
             carcinoma or non-metastatic prostate cancer), neurologic, and psychiatric diseases.

          -  Patients with a history of MI, PTCA, CABG, heart failure, CVA or TIA within the last
             30 days.
