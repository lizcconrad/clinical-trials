      CLIN1001-002 was a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to determine
      the safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of
      larazotide acetate in subjects with celiac disease subjects. Study subjects were randomized
      (2:1) to receive single oral doses of larazotide acetate 12 mg or matching placebo once daily
      for 3 days. Subjects received a single-blinded gluten challenge (5 mg amygluten) on Day 2.
      Intestinal permeability was measured each day following dosing. Intestinal permeability was
      measured by administration of an oral sucrose, lactulose and mannitol solution followed by a
      6-hour urine collection. Serial blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic
      determinations at baseline and 2 and 3 hours post dose; for zonulin determinations at
      baseline (prior to first dose) and 3 hours post dose; and for cytokine determination at
      baseline and 3 hours post dose (Days 2 and 3 only) and on Day 7. Sucrose, lactulose,
      mannitol, zonulin and larazotide acetate concentrations were determined by validated
      analytical methods.

    <measure>Demonstrate the safety and tolerance of single doses of larazotide acetate in patients with controlled celiac disease on a gluten-free diet.</measure>
    <time_frame>AEs were monitored throughout the study. Clinical laboratory testing was performed at scheduled times throughout the study. ECGs were measured at baseline, 3 hours post-dose on all study days and at the follow-up visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety assessments included scheduled monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital sign measurements, 12-lead ECG measurements, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory testing (chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine whether quantifiable concentrations of larazotide acetate are present in plasma following single oral doses and to characterize the pharmacokinetic behavior of larazotide acetate in celiac disease subjects that are gluten-free and in remission</measure>

    <measure>Evaluate the effects of single doses of larazotide acetate on intestinal permeability ratios and zonulin levels</measure>
    <time_frame>Intestinal permeability was measured each day following dosing. A gluten challenge was administered on Day 2.</time_frame>
    <description>Intestinal permeability was measured by administration of an oral sucrose, lactulose and mannitol solution followed by urine and serum collection to measure urinary lactulose and mannitol, and serum zonulin concentrations as biomarkers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported measures of GI discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>Once daily on dosing days</time_frame>
    <description>GI discomfort was reported by marking an &quot;X&quot; on a 10 cm linear line. Other GI Symptoms were assessed by subjects answering three questions related to bowel function.</description>
