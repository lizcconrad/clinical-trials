  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COLOR trial is a randomized, international, multi center study comparing the outcomes of
      laparoscopic and conventional resection of colon carcinoma with curative intent. Clinical and
      operative data will be collected centrally in the coordinating centre in Rotterdam, The
      Netherlands. Quality of life and costs will be assessed on a national basis.

      The design involves allocation of all suitable consecutive patients with colon carcinoma to
      either of the two procedures at a randomization ratio of 1:1. The trial will be stratified
      according to participating centre, resection type and gender.

      Disease free survival for all TNM stages after 3 years is currently about 70%. To detect a
      difference of 7% in disease free survival rate after 3 years between open and laparoscopic
      resection of colon cancer, 1200 patients will have to be included (60 vs 67%, two-sided
      analysis; alfa=0.05, beta=0.20, power=80% and p=0.05). All analyses will be performed on an
      intention to treat basis.
