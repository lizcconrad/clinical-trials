  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an integrated intervention addressing active
      smoking, environmental tobacco smoke exposure, depression and intimate partner violence,
      would improve pregnancy outcome among African American women.

      This study recruited pregnant, English speaking women from the District of Columbia who were
      African American or Latina and had one or more of the following risk factors: active smoking,
      environmental tobacco smoke exposure, depression and intimate partner violence. Women were
      randomized to receive either an integrated intervention or usual prenatal care. Women
      randomized to the intervention arm received a cognitive behavioral intervention delivered
      during the prenatal period in four to eight sessions. Up to two postpartum booster sessions
      were provided. Sessions were delivered coincident with prenatal care visits. Careful
      attention was paid to individualizing counseling to provide an integrated approach to each
      participantâ€™s multiple risk factors. The outcomes of interest were primarily behavior change
      with regard to the risk factors and secondarily to improved birth outcomes, specifically
      birthweight and gestation.
