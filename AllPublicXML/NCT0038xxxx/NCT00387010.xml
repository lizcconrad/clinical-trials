    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the impact of treatment with fentanyl buccal
      tablets on the anxiety symptoms commonly associated with chronic pain in patients with
      breakthrough pain (BTP). Other purposes are to assess the management of BTP, to evaluate
      patient functioning, and to determine any influences on the successful dose achieved.

    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), approximately week 5</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to approximately week 5 in the PASS subscale scores. PASS asks participants to indicate how often they engage in each of the 40 thoughts or activities that represent anxiety symptoms on a scale of 0=never to 5=always. Those 40 questions are organized into four subscales: fear, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and escape/avoidance. Each subscale score is obtained by summing the answers to the ten items in the subscore resulting in a range of 0-50.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Beck Depression Inventory at Approximately Week 5</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 (baseline), approximately week 5</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to endpoint (week 4 of Treatment period or last post baseline visit) in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a self-reporting instrument that asks 21 questions regarding how the participant felt in the past few days. Answers are in sentence form, and offer a scale where the first answer (worth 0 points) indicates no depression and the fourth answer (worth 3 points) indicates significant depression. Totals (0-63) are grouped so that totals of 1-10 are interpreted as 'These ups and downs are considered normal' and scores &gt;40 indicate extreme depression.</description>

    <measure>Summary of Participants' Successful Dosing Levels of Fentanyl Buccal Tablets to Control Episodes of Breakthrough Pain (BTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 10 days</time_frame>
    <description>During the dose titration period, participants self-administered FBT, starting at 100, 200 or 400 mcg (depending on analgesic used pre-study) and titrated to 600 and 800 mcg if needed. For each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode, participants took a dose, and did not take further study drug if adequate pain relief was achieved. If pain was not controlled within 30 minutes, the same dose level was repeated. If pain relief was inadequate 30 minutes after the second dose, usual rescue medication was taken for that BTP episode. Doses were adjusted until pain relief was adequate and side effects were tolerated. This outcome summarizes the successful dose levels identified during the titration period.</description>

    <description>Fentanyl buccal tablets (FBT) placed in the buccal cavity above a rear molar until disintegrated, approximately 14-25 minutes.
Dose titration: Participants self-administered FBT, starting at 100, 200 or 400 mcg (depending on analgesic used pre-study) and titrated to 600 and 800 mcg as needed. For each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode, participants took a dose, and did not take further study drug if adequate pain relief was achieved. If pain was not controlled within 30 minutes, the same dose level was repeated. If pain relief was inadequate 30 minutes after the second dose, usual rescue medication was taken for that BTP episode. Doses were adjusted until pain relief was adequate and side effects were tolerated.
Open-label: Once the successful dose of FBT was identified (100, 200, 400, 600, or 800 mcg), participants were dispensed a 4-week supply at the successful dose. Participants were not to use FBT for more than 6 BTP episodes or take more than 8 FBT daily.</description>

        <description>The change from baseline to approximately week 5 in the PASS subscale scores. PASS asks participants to indicate how often they engage in each of the 40 thoughts or activities that represent anxiety symptoms on a scale of 0=never to 5=always. Those 40 questions are organized into four subscales: fear, cognitive anxiety, somatic anxiety, and escape/avoidance. Each subscale score is obtained by summing the answers to the ten items in the subscore resulting in a range of 0-50.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline to endpoint (week 4 of Treatment period or last post baseline visit) in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). The BDI is a self-reporting instrument that asks 21 questions regarding how the participant felt in the past few days. Answers are in sentence form, and offer a scale where the first answer (worth 0 points) indicates no depression and the fourth answer (worth 3 points) indicates significant depression. Totals (0-63) are grouped so that totals of 1-10 are interpreted as 'These ups and downs are considered normal' and scores &gt;40 indicate extreme depression.</description>

        <description>Change from baseline to endpoint (week 4 of Treatment period or last post baseline visit) in the Multidimensional Pain Inventory Subscales. Answers to questions in the MPI are captured on a 7-point scale, with 0=most positive answer and 6= least positive answer. Twenty questions focus on pain, fourteen on a significant other's response when participant is in pain, and eighteen questions about daily activities. There are a total of 13 subscales with variable ranges. Subscales and corresponding ranges are listed in the results table. The General Activity category combines the Household Chores, Outdoor Work, Activities Away from Home, and Social Activities categories.</description>

        <title>Summary of Participants' Successful Dosing Levels of Fentanyl Buccal Tablets to Control Episodes of Breakthrough Pain (BTP)</title>
        <description>During the dose titration period, participants self-administered FBT, starting at 100, 200 or 400 mcg (depending on analgesic used pre-study) and titrated to 600 and 800 mcg if needed. For each breakthrough pain (BTP) episode, participants took a dose, and did not take further study drug if adequate pain relief was achieved. If pain was not controlled within 30 minutes, the same dose level was repeated. If pain relief was inadequate 30 minutes after the second dose, usual rescue medication was taken for that BTP episode. Doses were adjusted until pain relief was adequate and side effects were tolerated. This outcome summarizes the successful dose levels identified during the titration period.</description>
