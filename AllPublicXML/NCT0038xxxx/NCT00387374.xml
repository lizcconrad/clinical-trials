    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving radiation therapy
      together with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin works in treating patients with
      unresectable stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer at high risk for hemoptysis
      caused by bevacizumab. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It may
      also prevent hemoptysis caused by bevacizumab. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab,
      can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.
      Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of non-small cell lung cancer by blocking blood flow to
      the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving radiation therapy together with bevacizumab and chemotherapy may kill more
      tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety of prophylactic chest radiotherapy, bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and
      carboplatin in patients with unresectable stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer at high
      risk for bevacizumab-associated hemoptysis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. II. Assess the
      rate of objective response, overall survival, time to response, and response duration in
      irradiated lesions and non-irradiated lesions in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, multicenter study. Patients are assigned sequentially
      to 1 of 2 treatment strata.

      Stratum I: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy on days 1-5 and 8-12. Patients receive
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on day 15. Patients also
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours or carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes and bevacizumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes on day 36 (course 2).

      Stratum II: Patients undergo prophylactic radiotherapy and receive paclitaxel and carboplatin
      as in stratum I. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 15 (course
      1). In both strata, treatment with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and bevacizumab repeats every 21
      days for 5-6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with complete or partial response or stable disease may continue to receive single-agent
      bevacizumab every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study.
