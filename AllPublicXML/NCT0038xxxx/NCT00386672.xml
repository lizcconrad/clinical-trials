      Recent studies suggest that calcium may be important for weight loss, but other studies have
      not had the same results. The purpose of the study is to find out if taking calcium and
      vitamin D supplements, while following a low-calorie diet, can help people lose weight.

      We will use special orange juice with less calories than regular orange juice. Half of the
      subjects in this study will drink the study juice (reduced-calorie orange juice) containing
      extra calcium and vitamin D. The other subjects will drink reduced-calorie orange juice
      without any extra calcium or vitamin D in it.

      Comparisons: We will compare subjects who follow the diet and take calcium and vitamin D
      supplements to those who only follow the diet.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men or women, between 18 and 65 years of age, who are capable of providing informed
             consent.

          -  BMI of 25 to 35 kg/m2.

          -  Non-smoker (for at least 6 months).

          -  In good health, as determined by the principal investigator based on medical history
             and physical examination.

          -  Clinical laboratory evaluations (including Biochemistry, Hematology, Endocrinology)
             within the reference range for the test laboratory, unless deemed not clinically
             significant by the Investigator.

          -  Because of the calorie-restricted diet and radiation exposure from the CT scan,
             females will be non-pregnant, non-lactating, and either post-menopausal for at least 1
             year, surgically sterile for at least 3 months, or be willing to use an approved
             method of contraception (which may include use of abstinence; intrauterine device;
             female condom with spermicide; diaphragm with spermicide; cervical cap with
             spermicide; oral or transdermal hormonal contraceptives; a condom with spermicide by
             the sexual partner; or a sterile sexual partner) from 35 days prior to study entry
             (i.e., Day -1) until 30 days following Study Completion. For all females, the
             pregnancy test result must be negative at the screening visit and at visits when a CT
             scan will be done.

          -  Ability to comprehend and willingness to sign the Informed Consent Form for this
             study.

          -  Ability to comply with study restrictions regarding diet and exercise.

          -  History or clinical manifestations of significant metabolic, hepatic, renal,
             hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urological, neurological,
             or psychiatric disorders which in the opinion of the investigator would be expected to
             interfere with the study or increase risk to the subject.

          -  Participation in any other investigational diet study within 90 days prior to study
             entry.

          -  History of a medical or psychological condition or social circumstances that would
             impair the subject's ability to participate reliably in the study.

          -  Use within the last six months of medications that can result in significant weight
             gain or weight loss, including antipsychotics, selective serotonin reuptake
             inhibitors, anti-epileptic drugs, appetite-suppressants such as phentermine and
             sibutramine, and the lipase-inhibitor orlistat. (see Appendix 1 for detailed list)

          -  Active eating disorder.

          -  History of alcoholism or substance abuse within 5 years prior to study entry.

             kidney stones or other medical condition.

          -  History of hyperparathyroidism or sarcoidosis.

          -  Osteoporosis or other medical condition for which a physician has recommended taking a
             multivitamin or calcium supplementation.

          -  High calcium intake (more than 2 servings of dairy products per day or taking calcium
             supplements &gt; 3x/wk ) for 1 month prior to study start date and for duration of study.
             (If participant is taking calcium supplement &gt; 3x/wk or more than 2 servings of dairy
             products per day, they are eligible to participate if they agree to stop for 1 month
             prior to study start date and for the duration of the study. Participants will
             similarly be asked to stop multivitamins as the majority of these supplements contain
             calcium.)

          -  General medical conditions that are well-controlled will not be a basis for exclusion
             in the study. Subjects with uncontrolled conditions that are not adequately controlled
             or that might pose an unacceptable risk for participation, as clinically determined by
             the investigators, will be excluded.
