  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this long-term observational study is designed to collect additional
      information on incidence of cancer and cause of death among patients who have participated in
      clinical trials of infliximab in the treatment of COPD. Patients must have received at least
      1 dose of study agent (ie, placebo or infliximab) in the primary studies to be eligible for
      participation in this long-term follow-up study. Information on deaths and cancers will be
      collected twice yearly for a period of 5 years from each patient's last safety visit in the
      primary study.

    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect long-term safety information on infliximab, from patients
      with COPD who participated in research studies using this drug. The primary COPD studies
      include C0168T54 (in the U.S.) and two small studies in Europe (EU0016 C0168X09 and EU0073
      C0168X57). All patients who had at least one dose of study drug in those studies are being
      asked to participate in this long-term safety follow-up study which will provide important
      information about the study drug. The long-term effect of the study drug on new cancers and
      survival will be evaluated from data collected over a 5-year period which begins from each
      patient's last safety visit in the primary study. Data for this study will be collected at
      study entry and twice yearly thereafter up to a maximum of 5 years from each patient's last
      safety visit in the primary study. The last safety visit in the primary study is defined as
      the last visit for each subject during which adverse events (AEs)s are recorded in the
      primary study.Twice yearly, all participating study sites will be reminded to complete the
      electronic charts for each participating patient. At study entry, the following will be
      performed: (1) Medical history and physical examination, including ear, nose, and throat
      (ENT) examination performed by a qualified physician; (2) Chest x-ray(posterior and lateral),
      unless performed within 3 months prior to enrollment and (3) CT (computer imaging) scan of
      the chest (spiral preferred), unless performed within 6 months prior to enrollment. In
      addition, data will be collected at study entry on the use of commercial infliximab or any
      other anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agent subsequent to the last safety visit in the
      primary study. At each patient's subsequent visit, data will be collected by either direct
      contact with the patient (office visit or telephone call), review of patient's medical
      records, contact with the patient's primary care physician or oncologist. At the final visit
      (5 years from each patient's last safety visit in the primary study), the following will be
      performed: (1) Medical history and physical examination, including ENT examination performed
      by a qualified physician; (2) Chest x-ray, unless performed within the previous 3 months, and
      (3) CT scan of the chest (spiral preferred), unless performed within the previous 6 months.

      The primary outcome of this study is Number of patients with each of the following safety
      events: malignancy or death. The secondary outcome of this study is the number of patients
      with malignancies by malignancy type (ie, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, head
      and neck cancers, lung cancer, other malignancies). No drug is provided

        The study population consists of patients who had at least one dose of study drug in
        clinical studies of infliximab in the treatment of COPD, that are targeted for long-term
        safety follow-up and were asked to participate in this long-term safety follow-up study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have been enrolled in previously completed clinical studies of
             infliximab in the treatment of COPD that are targeted for long term safety follow-up
             (ie, primary studies). Primary studies are defined as studies that have evaluated
             infliximab on an investigational basis and that have been identified by Centocor or
             health authorities as requiring long-term safety follow-up. These include Centocor
             protocol C0168T54, conducted in the USA, and 2 smaller studies conducted in the
             Netherlands (EU0016 C0168X09 and EU0073 C0168X57). Patients must have received at
             least one dose of study agent to be eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are unwilling to respond to requests for long-term safety information
             will be excluded.
