  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from other countries have suggested that oral mifepristone used as a cervical ripening
      agent may decrease induction to delivery time in midtrimester inductions. To our knowledge,
      there are no trials comparing mifepristone to laminaria in a standard clinical setting with
      standardized misoprostol induction protocol to examine the issue of induction to delivery
      time. We hypothesize that mifepristone will work at least as well as laminaria for
      midtrimester cervical ripening prior to induction of labor with misoprostol.
