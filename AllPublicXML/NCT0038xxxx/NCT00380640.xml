      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of trimethoprim in promoting wound
      healing and decreasing blister formation in patients with Epidermolysis Bullosa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) comprises a series of hereditary disorders characterized by
      fragility of the skin and mucous membranes and the tendency of the skin to blister in
      response to minor friction or trauma. The care of patients with EB is a complex task that has
      to be carried out by a multi-professional team. In the absence of a cure, the goal of therapy
      is the prevention and healing of chronic wounds.

      In patients with EB, chronic inflammation interferes with proper wound healing. One treatment
      option is the use of anti-inflammatory antimicrobial agents, such as trimethoprim, to hasten
      wound healing and decrease blister formation. This treatment may lead to decreased pain and
      improvement of the quality of life for these patients.
