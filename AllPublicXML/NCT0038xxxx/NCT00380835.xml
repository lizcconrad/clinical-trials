        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological diagnosis of breast cancer.

          -  Metastatic or recurrent disease, either HER2+ (FISH+ or 3+ IHC) or HER2-.

          -  Maximal dose of prior adjuvant anthracycline: 300 mg/meters squared doxorubicin or
             equivalent. Relapse greater than one year after trastuzumab adjuvantly; two years
             following adjuvant anthracycline therapy (without trastuzumab).

          -  One prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer allowed (may include trastuzumab
             for HER2+ patients), but no prior Doxil, adriamycin or epirubicin for metastatic
             breast cancer.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2.

          -  Adequate organ function including the following:

               -  Adequate bone marrow reserve.

               -  Cardiac: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 55%
                  by MUGA.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at the time of enrollment for women of child-bearing
             potential.

          -  Ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed consent
             and authorization of use and disclosure of protected health information, and agree to
             abide by the study restrictions and to return for the required assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Concurrent anticancer therapy.

          -  Participation in any investigational drug study within 28 days prior to study entry.

          -  Concurrent severe or uncontrolled medical disease (i.e., active systemic infection,
             diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart
             failure, severe arrhythmia) that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise
             the safety of the patient or compromise the ability of the patient to complete the
             study.

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system metastases. Patients with asymptomatic brain
             metastases are allowed. The patient must be stable after radiotherapy for greater than
             or equal to 2 weeks and off corticosteroids for greater than or equal to 1 week.

          -  History of interstitial lung disease or pulmonary fibrosis.
