      The purpose of this study is to compare the demographic, metabolic, and genomic
      characteristics of patients who develop severe hyperbilirubinemia (serum bilirubin level in
      the &quot;high risk zone of greater than the 95th percentile based on the Bhutani nomogram) to
      patients who never developed significant hyperbilirubinemia (bilirubin level in &quot;low risk
      zone of less than the 40th percentile&quot; on Bhutani nomogram and who did not require any
      treatment for hyperbilirubinemia). Our primary goal is to determine if common gene mutations
      occur at a greater frequency in patients with severe hyperbilirubinemia than in neonates
      without significant hyperbilirubinemia.

      The gene mutations we will test for are:

        -  Glucose-6-phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency [G6PD] gene mutations

        -  African A- mutation (G202A;A376G)

        -  The common Mediterranean mutation (C563T)

        -  Two common Chinese mutations (G1376T and G1388A)

        -  UGT1A1 polymorphism. The UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms refer to those genetic defects found
           to be associated with Gilbert's Syndrome, including a promoter defect (T-3263G) that
           disrupts a transcription regulatory site, the TA repeats promoter polymorphism, and four
           mutations within the coding region (G211A, C686A, C1091T, and T1456G).

        -  Gene polymorphism for the organic anion transporting protein (OATP-2)

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Case

          -  Documentation of informed consent.

          -  Gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks.

          -  Birth weight greater than or equal to 2000 grams.

          -  At least one serum bilirubin level that is greater than the 95th percentile (&quot;high
             risk zone&quot;) based on the Bhutani nomogram(1), for the case population.

          -  Age at enrollment less than 7 days or less than or equal to 168 hours.

          -  No major anomalies (chromosomal abnormalities, cyanotic congenital heart disease,
             gastroschisis, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia, or other major gastrointestinal
             anomalies, major neurological injury or anomaly, and multiple congenital anomalies).

          -  Ability to follow subjects transferred to another facility for outcome data.

        Control

          -  Documentation of informed consent.

          -  Gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks.

          -  Birth weight greater than or equal to 2000 grams.

          -  At least one estimate of serum bilirubin. Bilirubin level estimated to be less than
             the 40th percentile (&quot;low risk zone&quot;) based on the Bhutani nomogram. While a serum
             bilirubin in the low risk zone is the preferred method for assessing the bilirubin
             level, many pediatricians use transcutaneous measure of bilirubin as a screening tool
             for identifying &quot;low risk&quot; patients. For this reason, we will allow controls to be
             identified using transcutaneous measurements and collect serum bilirubin levels only
             as clinically indicated.

          -  Age at enrollment less than 7 days or less than or equal to 168 hours.

          -  No major anomalies (chromosomal abnormalities, cyanotic congenital heart disease,
             gastroschisis, omphalocele, diaphragmatic hernia or other major gastrointestinal
             anomalies, major neurological injury or anomaly, and multiple congenital anomalies).

          -  Ability to follow subjects transferred to another facility for outcome data.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Case and Control

          -  Gestational age less than 37 weeks.

          -  Birth weight less than 2000 grams.

          -  Older than 7 days of age or 168 hours.

          -  Any major congenital anomalies.
