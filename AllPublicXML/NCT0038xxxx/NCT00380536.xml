      mental health center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with serious mental disorders tend to have shorter life expectancies and elevated
      rates of unhealthy behaviors and chronic illnesses. Peer-led medical illness self-management
      programs have been shown to be effective in improving the health and health behaviors of
      people with chronic medical conditions. This type of intervention, however, has yet to be
      systematically tested in individuals with mental disorders. Community mental health centers
      provide care to many people of low socioeconomic status who lack medical insurance. This
      study will evaluate the effectiveness of a medical illness self-management program in
      improving the health and health behaviors of people who are receiving care at a community
      mental health center.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to either partake in peer-led medical
      illness self-management group sessions or receive care as usual. Participants assigned to
      care as usual will continue to receive any services they would have otherwise been offered,
      but will not receive any additional services through the study. Participants assigned to the
      medical illness self-management program will attend group sessions once a week for 6 weeks.
      Sessions will focus on medical self-management, healthy behaviors, and effective use of the
      general medical system.
