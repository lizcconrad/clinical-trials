      administering ZYC300 with Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan).

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of ZYC300 in the treatment of advanced stage malignancy of the
      kidney in patients who have not had previous immune-based therapies or treatment of advanced
      stage malignancies (cancerous growths) of the ovary, breast, colon, or hormone-refractory
      prostate in patients who have failed at least one but no more than two prior regimens of
      chemotherapy. Patients who meet all entry criteria will be administered 600 mg/m^2
      cyclophosphamide intravenously 3 days before each dose of ZYC300. ZYC300 will be administered
      at 400 micrograms DNA/total dose every two weeks for a maximum of six doses (6 cycles).

      ZYC300 is a plasmid DNA formulated within biodegradable microencapsulated particles. This is
      the first time that ZYC300 and Cyclophosphamide will be given together. Cyclophosphamide is a
      chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA that has been used for many years in many different
      kinds of cancer. In this trial the study drug will be used to boost the immune system.
      Sometimes the immune system cannot fight infected or abnormal cells because of other cells
      called T reg cells. The T reg cells limit the immune systems attack on infected or abnormal
      cells. In this study, the hope is that Cyclophosphamide will inhibit the T regs cells so that
      the ZYC300 can work better to attack the cancer cells.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in the study, patients must meet the following criteria:

          1. Patients with:

             Advanced stage malignancies who have failed treatment, including at least one, but no
             more than two, prior regimens of chemotherapy: Ovary, Breast, Colon, Hormone
             Refractory Prostate Cancer (HRPC), and renal.

          2. Evidence of measurable disease by clinical or radiographic assessment or by tumor
             biomarker (ovarian and prostate cancer).

          3. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          4. A baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          5. A life expectancy &gt; 6 months.

          6. Adequate hematological function established within 14 days prior to receipt of the
             first dose of cyclophosphamide, defined as:

               1. Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 1,000/mm^2

               2. WBC ≥ 3,000/mm^2

               3. Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^2

               4. Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

          7. Adequate renal function established within 14 days prior to receipt of the first dose
             of cyclophosphamide, defined as serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit of normal.

          8. Adequate hepatic function established within 14 days prior to receipt of the first
             dose of cyclophosphamide, defined as:
