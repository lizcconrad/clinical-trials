  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if a new investigational vaccine, TOLAMBA™, is safe
      and effective in reducing the symptoms of ragweed allergy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ragweed allergy is the most common seasonal allergy in North America. Allergen immunotherapy
      is a therapeutic option for patients who have allergy symptoms that cannot be adequately
      controlled by avoidance of the allergen or medication. It may also be appropriate for those
      who cannot tolerate their medications due to side effects or have difficulties with
      medication compliance. This study compares the safety and efficacy of two different dosing
      regimens of TOLAMBA™ with placebo in reducing the symptoms of ragweed-allergic adults over
      two consecutive ragweed pollen seasons.

      Comparison(s): Subject-rated allergy symptoms of subjects treated with TOLAMBA™ dose-intense
      regimen or TOLAMBA™ lower-dose regimen, compared with subjects treated with placebo.

  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Interim data indicated that subjects exhibited no meaningful allergic disease during the first
    ragweed season, making it impossible to measure treatment effect.
