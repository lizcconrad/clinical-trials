      This study will look at blood samples taken from 300 preterm babies and newborns admitted for
      inpatient care at Hopital Gabriel Toure in Bamako, Mali, and to gather information that will
      help the investigators verify the role of malaria in illness of very small babies. Blood
      samples will be taken from the mothers so that the investigators can find out if they have a
      malaria infection and how their body fights malaria. The investigators will also determine
      whether the mother and newborn baby are infected with the same malaria parasite. The
      information from this study may be used to improve malaria treatment in very small babies.
      Mothers and babies whose blood is tested will receive treatment for malaria as recommended by
      the National Malaria Control Program (NCMP).

      The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine the rate of congenital and acquired
      malaria in inpatient neonates at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Bamako, Mali. The primary
      study endpoint will be the number of infants with malaria infection as detected by the
      positivity of one of the three malaria diagnosis assays. The secondary study endpoints will
      be: (1) the rate of congenital malaria, (2) the rate of acquired malaria, (3) the prevalence
      of antimalarial antibodies in neonates, and (4) the prevalence of specific hemoglobin types
      in the study population. Neonates of both sexes who weigh at least 2000g, are 0 - 28 days
      old, and are referred to the Unit of Reanimation and Neonatology of Hopital Gabriel Toure in
      Bamako, Mali, for inpatient care are eligible for enrollment in this two-year study. After
      informed parental consent is obtained, approximately 2 ml of venous blood will be collected
      for malaria diagnosis by OptiMal test, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). If in
      the clinician's judgment drawing blood is not feasible, a small blood sample will be obtained
      by heel prick from the infants and tested for the presence of malaria parasites. If any of
      the three infant malaria tests is positive, parenteral quinine will be administered as per
      the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. If malaria is detected in
      mothers, standard malaria therapy will be administered according to the National Malaria
      Control Program (NMCP) treatment guidelines. Blood will be obtained from mothers for
      molecular diagnosis of malaria infection and characterization of the genetic profile of
      mother's malaria infections.
