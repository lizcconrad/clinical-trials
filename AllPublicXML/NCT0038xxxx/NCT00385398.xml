      RATIONALE: Treatment with radiosurgery, temozolomide, and erlotinib may affect brain function
      (the ability to think, learn, remember, and judge) in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer and brain metastases. A study that evaluates brain function may help doctors plan the
      best treatment.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the effect of radiosurgery, temozolomide, and
      erlotinib on brain function in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and brain metastases.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of stereotactic radiosurgery, temozolomide, and erlotinib
           hydrochloride on cognitive function in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and
           brain metastases.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the feasibility and safety of this regimen, in terms of tumor response, time
           to tumor progression in brain, survival, physical functioning, and quality of life, in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the frequency of O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter methylation
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery on day -7. Patients receive oral temozolomide once
      daily on days 1-5 and oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily on days 1-23. Treatment with
      temozolomide and erlotinib hydrochloride repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo cognitive function evaluation as measured by Mini-Mental Status Exam
      administration and scoring; quality of life assessment as measured by Functional Assessment
      of Cancer Therapy subscale; and physical functioning assessment as measured by Katz index of
      activities of daily living and Karnofsky performance status at baseline and then every 8
      weeks during study treatment.

      Tumor tissue is examined by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT gene) promotor
      methylation.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study.
