  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, patients with severe sepsis and low protein C levels will receive drotrecogin
      alfa (activated) at the normal, approved dose and time of administration [24
      microgram/kilogram/hour (mcg/kg/hour) for 96 hours] or will receive the normal, approved dose
      or higher doses than the approved dose for a longer administration time. After the drug
      administration is complete, the protein C levels from the patients receiving the normal,
      approved dose will be compared to protein C levels from patients receiving the normal,
      approved dose or higher dose for a longer duration to determine if the protein C levels
      improve faster if given higher dose and/or longer administration time.

      Note: The protocol was amended to remove the option of shorter infusion durations.

    <measure>Mean Change in Protein C Levels From Day 1 to Day 7</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Mean change in protein C from Study Day 1 to Study Day 7 was tested using an unadjusted two-sample t-test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05. To be included in the primary analysis, Intention-to-Treat (ITT) patients must have at least 1 protein C value available at 24 hours or earlier and at least 1 protein C value at a post-24-hour timepoint.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change in Protein C Level From Study Day 1 to Study Day 7 in Patients With Moderate and Severe Protein C Deficiency</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1, Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Moderate Protein C Deficiency: A protein C level greater than half the lower limit of normal.
Severe Protein C Deficiency: A protein C level less than or equal to half the lower limit of normal.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 0, Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of 5 organ dysfunctions (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, coagulation) was assessed using a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Each organ has a possible dysfunction score of 0 to 4, for a total SOFA score range of 0 (no organ dysfunction) to 20 (all organs with dysfunction). SOFA scores were time-averaged.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Serious Bleeding Events (SBE) by Time Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Serious bleeding events (SBE): intracranial hemorrhage, life-threatening or fatal bleed, or bleeding event assessed as an SAE. Patients may have multiple events with onset in different time periods. SAEs include SBEs. The 3 SBEs in Alternative-Moderate Deficiency arm (days 5-8) occurred after completion of study drug infusion. One event (pleural haemorrhage) occurred same day of completion of infusion and 2 events (cerebral haemorrhage, shock haemorrhagic) occurred day after completion.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is more than 60 days but less than or equal to 180 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Fewer patients than planned had severe PC deficiency so only 2 higher doses were tested &amp; fewer required longer infusions so a large proportion of alternative therapy patients in effect received standard therapy making treatment comparisons difficult</limitations_and_caveats>
