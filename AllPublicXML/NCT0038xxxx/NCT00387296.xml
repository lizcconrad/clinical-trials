      The study's aim is to determine whether use of a mechanical device can improve the timeliness
      of anesthesia provided by liposomal lidocaine cream. Liposomal lidocaine cream has
      historically come in the brandnames of ELA-Max and LMX, with either 4% or 5% lidocaine in the
      cream. In this protocol, the abbreviation LLC will be generally used to refer to the 4%
      concentration to be used in FAST Lidocaine. Regardless of the concentration used, the
      encapsulation of lidocaine in liposomes protects the anesthetic from rapid metabolism and
      allows the medication to remain in the epidermis, yielding a theoretical benefit of
      long-lasting anesthesia.1 The test device is a painless functional microarray (FMA) that
      renders hundreds of microscopic punctures per cm2 in a patient's stratum corneum. The holes
      in the stratum corneum subsequently allow for faster movement of LLC into the skin to be
      anesthetized.

      Currently, topical anesthetics are used less commonly in the Emergency Department (ED) than
      would be the case if the available approaches were not associated with such long onset times.
      The most commonly utilized topical anesthetic for intact skin, eutectic mixture of local
      anesthetics (EMLA), requires at least an hour for anesthetic effect; maximal effect requires
      up to 2 hours.2, 3 4 The topical anesthetic to be used in the FAST Lidocaine study, 4% LLC,
      has a roughly equipotent analgesic effect to that of EMLA and works faster, but must still be
      in place for at least a half-hour before onset of reliable anesthesia.1, 5-8 Commentators
      have judged such delays &quot;considerable&quot; and written that because of long application times,
      use of topical anesthetics may not be practical.1, 8-10 In discussing agents (such as LLC)
      that are formulated for more rapid transcutaneous absorption, ED wound care experts have
      written that &quot;their delayed onset limits their use in the emergent setting.&quot;11 It has also
      been noted that LLC's utility is potentially diminished by the fact that anesthesia may begin
      to wear off as soon as 10 minutes after cream removal.8 Given the previously outlined
      findings, it is obvious that there is room for improvement in ED delivery of topical
      anesthesia. The goal of rendering topical anesthesia practical - and thus more likely to be
      used - constitutes the basis for the FAST Lidocaine study. We seek to identify whether a
      novel approach safely and painlessly improves the onset time (and perhaps depth) of topical
      anesthesia.

      Reducing pain caused by procedures involving violation of the skin barrier (e.g. intravenous
      [IV] line placement, anesthesia and suturing of wounds) is an important goal. Needlesticks
      and IV catheters have been identified as important causes of pain in both children and
      adults.8, 12, 13 In terms of frequency, U.S. EDs place over 20 million IV catheters and care
      for over 10 million wounds.9 Thus, there is potentially broad-based utility in a potentiator
      for local anesthesia absorption in the ED.

      The importance of the clinical goal of improving absorption of topical anesthesia has already
      prompted efforts aimed at improving delivery and efficacy of topically applied local
      anesthetics. Previous investigations have demonstrated utility - and limitations - of various
      methods of traversing and/or stripping the stratum corneum. Among the techniques studied have
      been use of electrical energy (iontophoresis),14 sound waves (sonophoresis),15, 16 adhesive
      tape17-19 and lasers.11, 12, 20, 21 While these varying approaches all have promise, their
      limitations leave room for assessment of a new method if it promises to be safe, painless,
      and effective.

      The approach of the FAST Lidocaine study will be to assess FMA use. The FMA is a painless
      mechanism that is placed on the skin with minimal pressure. It creates microscopic punctures
      in the stratum corneum, facilitating movement of anesthetic through the cutaneous barrier.
      The device's physical characteristics, namely its easy application and low apparent potential
      for incorrect or unsafe use, appear quite suitable for ED utilization. If it works, the FMA
      would be immediately useful in a variety of circumstances.

      The overarching goal of the FAST Lidocaine investigators is to assess whether the FMA can
      improve management of procedure-related pain in the ED. The main problem in terms of ED use
      of the currently available topical anesthetics - whether EMLA, LMX, or others - is the time
      of onset, rather than anesthetic efficacy. Thus, it is the timing impracticality for most ED
      situations that is the spur for FAST Lidocaine. The study's primary focus and endpoint will
      be time to anesthesia. Secondary analysis will evaluate whether the depth of anesthesia is
      improved by assessing the nadir of visual analog scale (VAS) assessments. However, it is
      noteworthy that deeper anesthesia is not necessary in order to establish the potential
      utility of FMA in the acute care setting.
