  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acute and chronic efficacy of spinal
      cord stimulation using the Precision implantable neurostimulation device with the Artisan
      paddle electrode in patients with Failed Back Surgery Syndrome (FBSS) and associated primary
      or secondary back or lower extremity pain. There are significant numbers of patients with
      FBSS who have moderate to severe drug refractory pain. An optimal outcome will demonstrate
      that the Precision SCS device has significant effectiveness in reducing this pain resulting
      in improved quality of life and functional capacity.

    <textblock>
      The conventional implantation of the spinal cord stimulator calls for dual percutaneous leads
      placed in parallel at T8-T9 vertebral levels. A common problem after surgery is the migration
      of leads from the initial implanted site, the consequence of which is inadequate pain relief.
      Anecdotal reports suggest that the paddle electrode can eliminate some of the problems
      associated with lead migration by providing a constant distance between the parallel
      electrodes. Furthermore, it has been reported to provide superior pain relief and paresthesia
      coverage.

      This study aims to evaluate pain and paresthesia coverage by placing a paddle lead. Patients
      invited to participate in this study will be eligible for SCS therapy and will have already
      selected therapy with the Advanced Bionics Precision system, independent of possible
      inclusion in this study.
