      The purpose of this study is to understand how genetic polymorphisms influence the efficacy
      and side effect profiles of Paroxetine and Escitalopram for major depression treatment.

      Despite remarkable progress in recent decades in modern psychopharmacotherapy, patients vary
      substantially in their response to antidepressants, ranging from total remission to complete
      treatment failure. Adverse effects, often bothersome and occasionally life-threatening,
      continue to represent significant challenges to patients and clinicians. Mechanisms
      responsible for such variability remain poorly understood. In addition, although less
      appreciated, substantial cross-ethnic variations in psychotropic responses often exist.
      Recent developments in the field of pharmacogenetics indicate that genetic factors may
      account for a large part of these differences in response. Specific genetic polymorphisms
      affecting the function of the serotonin (SERT) system has been postulated to predict the
      effect of antidepressants. Similarly, genetic mutations have been shown to exert a
      predominant influence on the expression of a number of drug-metabolizing enzymes, including
      most of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes that are responsible for the biotransformation of most
      antidepressants. Polymorphisms of genes controlling these enzymes have been found to be
      strongly associated with the propensity for various kinds of side effects. Capitalizing on
      these new developments, the proposed study will examine the predictive value of some of these
      genetic polymorphisms in 400 patients with DSM-IV major depression prospectively treated with
      Escitalopram (ECIT) or Paroxetine (PAR). It is postulated that mutations affecting the
      function of SERT will predict responses to ECIT, polymorphism of CYP2C19 will be associated
      with the side effect profiles and pharmacokinetics of ECIT.
