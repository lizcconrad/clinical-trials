  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2004 there were more than 40 million people infected worldwide with HIV, with
      an estimated 16,000 new infections every day (Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS
      [UNAIDS], 2004). The HIV epidemic threatens whole societies particularly in Africa and Asia
      and rates of infections in the Western countries have also increased over the last few years.
      However, despite more than 15 years of research, an effective vaccine against HIV and
      acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has still not been developed.

      There is considerable evidence that cellular immune responses can effectively control HIV-1
      replication during acute and chronic infections thereby possibly protecting individuals from
      infection and preventing the spread of HIV. To be truly effective in the general population,
      a vaccine must induce responses specific to immunologically conserved regions. The
      epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represents a very logical approach to this problem because of
      its potential to elicit a polyfunctional immune response and to focus these responses to
      conserved epitopes.

      In this study the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a recombinant MVA-BNÂ® vaccine
      expressing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and helper T lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes of HIV-1
      (MVA-mBN32) in 36 healthy volunteers will be examined. This will include a full analysis of
      CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ CTL responses to these epitopes, to establish the potential of
      such a homologous prime-boost vaccine approach to induce a broad cell-mediated response to
      different HIV antigens.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18 - 50

          2. Women must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine
             pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to vaccination.

          3. Women of childbearing potential must have used an acceptable method of contraception.

          4. Troponin I within normal institutional limits.

          5. Adequate renal function

          6. Adequate hepatic function

          7. Electrocardiogram (ECG) without abnormal findings

          8. Negative HIV test for HIV-1 prior to immunization

          9. HLA-A2, HLA-A3 or HLA-B7 positive.

         10. Written informed consent of the subject after information of the risks and benefits of
             the study are provided in a language the subject clearly understands, and before any
             study specific procedure.

         11. Ultrasound of the abdomen without clinically significant abnormalities.

        Exclusion Criteria:
