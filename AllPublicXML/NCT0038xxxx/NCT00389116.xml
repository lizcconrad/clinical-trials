  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel obstructions are responsible for 2 to 5% of emergency hospital admissions and 20%
      of all emergency surgical procedures. In 60 to 80% of cases, acute small bowel obstructions
      are the consequence of intraperitoneal postoperative adhesions. They constitute an extremely
      frequent pathology, leading to a high rate of hospital admissions and money expense.

      Management of small bowel obstruction is based on 2 options: either a surgical approach where
      all patients are operating on, or a conservative treatment in which surgery is proposed in
      case of failure of medical treatment. The surgical approach leads to operate on an excessive
      rate of patients while the medical approach increases the risk of increased small bowel
      resection, morbidity rate or hospitalization duration.

      In order to improve the management of small bowel obstruction, it seems necessary to better
      distinguish patients that need an emergency surgical procedure from patients in which medical
      treatment will be useful. Many studies have been performed to investigate the value of
      imaging in the management of small bowel obstruction, using abdominal X-ray, oral
      gastrografin administration or CT-Scan.

      The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of a systematic performance of imaging
      investigation on the management of patients presenting with a postoperative small bowel
      obstruction.

      All patients suffering from a postoperative small bowel obstruction will be included in this
      study. They will be randomised in 2 groups. In group S, patients will have CT-Scan and oral
      water administration while in group SG, Patients will have CT-Scan and oral gastrografin
      administration The major end point of this study is to analyse whether imaging examination
      can reduce the need for a surgical approach or the rate of small bowel resection and to
      determine its influence on fasting time or hospitalization duration
