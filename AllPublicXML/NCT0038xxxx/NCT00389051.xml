      The purpose of this study is to assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics and antitumor
      effect of bendamustine hydrochloride (SyB L-0501) in patients with indolent B-cell
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma is treated mainly with radiation and chemotherapy
      using a combination of chemotherapies, such as purine-analogues and CHOP (cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). After the approval of an antibody therapy agent
      RituximabÂ®, it alone or combination with CHOP has been introduced. Bendamustine hydrochloride
      has a unique structure compared with the marketed agents, and has an innovative mechanism of
      action. Thus, it is expected that Bendamustine hydrochloride will provide new alternatives
      for patients with indolent B-cell Non-hodgkin's lymphoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Indolent B cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients with prior therapy who satisfy the
        conditions listed below. No restrictions regarding gender.
