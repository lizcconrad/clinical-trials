      Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) refers to the collection of repeated measurements of
      phenomena as they occur in naturalistic settings using hand-held computers. By providing an
      EMA of psychosocial variables that influence patient pain and pain behaviors, this study
      seeks to characterize the pain experience in metastatic breast cancer from both patients' and
      spouses' perspectives.

      This study consists of two parts. Part 1 involves developing and pilot testing a hand-held
      computer program designed to assess antecedents, behaviors, and consequences of patient pain,
      as well as spouse response to pain. Five couples will complete a baseline survey and carry
      the hand-held computer for two weeks. They will be interviewed for feedback to refine the
      program. Part 2 is a longitudinal assessment of the psychological and relationship
      functioning of metastatic breast cancer patients and their spouses. The Optional Procedure
      for Part 2 involves using electronic diaries (EDs) to measure the cancer pain experience for
      patients with metastatic breast cancer and their spouses.

      The specific aims of this study are to: (1) To examine patient pain, spouse response to
      patient pain, and patient behaviors in response to pain over the course of 6 months in
      couples facing metastatic breast cancer, (2) test the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain
      in breast cancer; expanding it to include the influence of patient psychological functioning,
      spouse psychological functioning, and relationship functioning, on patient pain, spouse
      behaviors, and patient behaviors in response to pain, (3) use ecological momentary assessment
      to characterize patient pain, spouse response to patient pain, and patient behaviors in
      response to pain.

      Part 1:

      Women with metastatic breast cancer will be asked to take part in the study. Project staff
      will review patients' medical records to determine their eligibility for the study. Eligible
      patients will be approached by a project staff member when they begin treatment for
      metastatic disease.

      By agreeing to participate, you are agreeing to allow the study staff to contact your spouse.
      Spouses who are not present at the time patients are consented will not be asked to
      participate. Interested patients may still participate in this study even if their spouse is
      unwilling or unable to participate.

      A project staff member will show participants how to use hand-held computers. Learning to use
      the computers does not require previous computer experience. Participants will take the
      computers home and, when signaled by the computer, answer a brief series of questions about
      how they are feeling physically and emotionally at that particular moment.

      Participants will be prompted to answer questions 6 times a day, for 14 days after starting
      treatment. It should take about 2 minutes to answer the questions each time.

      Upon completion, participants will be interviewed separately in person or on the telephone
      for feedback about using the computer. The interview should take about 30 minutes.

      At the time participants are consented, they will also be asked to complete several
      questionnaires about their health, pain, and their relationship. It will take about 45
      minutes to complete all of the questionnaires. Participants may complete the questionnaires
      while waiting for their clinic appointments, or they may take the questionnaires home,
      complete them, and return them in a pre-stamped envelope.

      A project staff member will review patients' medical records to collect medical information
      relevant to this study.

      All answers given by participants will be kept private.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 5 patients and 5 spouses will be asked to
      participate. All we be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

      Part 2:

      Women with metastatic breast cancer will be asked to take part in the study. Project staff
      will review patients' medical records to determine their eligibility for the study. Eligible
      patients will be approached by a project staff member when they begin treatment for
      metastatic disease.

      By agreeing to participate, you are agreeing to allow the study staff to contact your spouse.
      Spouses who are not present at the time patients are consented will be contacted by phone, to
      find out if they are interested in participating in this study.

      Patients and spouses who are interested in participating will be asked to complete several
      questionnaires about their health, pain, and their relationship. It will take about 45
      minutes to complete all of the questionnaires. Participants in this study may complete the
      questionnaires while waiting for their clinic appointments, or they may take the
      questionnaires home, complete them, and return them in a pre-stamped envelope.

      Both patients and their spouses will be asked to complete the same questionnaires 3 months
      after completing the first questionnaire, and then again 3 months later. Any patient whose
      spouse does not wish to participate will not be asked to complete these additional
      questionnaires.

      Attempts will be made to give these questionnaires during routine clinic appointments so that
      the questionnaires can be completed while in the waiting room. If appointments do not occur
      at the same time as the questionnaires are scheduled to be completed or clinic time does not
      permit, patients and spouses will be mailed the questionnaire packets and asked to return
      them in self-addressed stamped envelopes.

      A project staff member will review patients' medical records to collect medical information
      relevant to this study.

      All answers given by participants will be kept private.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 622 individuals (311 patients and 311 spouses) will
      be asked to participate in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
