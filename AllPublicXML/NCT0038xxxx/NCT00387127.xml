    <measure>Number of Participants (Par.) With Complete Response (CR), as Assessed by Independent Radiological Review</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until 6 months post chemoradiation treatment, assessed for a median time of 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with CR are defined as those who achieved a complete tumor response at 6 months after the completion of the chemoradiation treatment (CRT), as assessed by independent radiological review. Tumor response was assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Data are based on Week 24 scans from participants receiving study treatment at that time and on those in follow-up.</description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS), as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until the date of disease progression or death due to any cause, assessed after a median of 22 months of follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>PFS=the time from randomization until the earliest date of disease progression or death due to any cause, if sooner. Per RECIST, progressive disease=a &gt;=20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions (TLs), or the appearance of &gt;=1 new L, symptomatic progression and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. For participants who did not progress or die at the time of reporting (data cut-off 1-Aug-2014), PFS data were censored at the time of the last investigator assessed radiological scan preceding the initiation of any alternative anti-cancer therapy.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Loco-regional Recurrence of Initial Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until progression in the T or N site or death due to any cause, assessed after a median of 30.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with loco-regional recurrence were those who had progression of disease in the T and N sites. Per the Tumor, Node, and Metastases (TNM) staging of tumors: T describes the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, and N describes regional lymph nodes that are involved. If a participant had progression in the T or N sites, then the participant was counted as having had an event of interest.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Loco-regional Control</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until progression in the T or N site or death due to any cause, assessed after a median of 30.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Loco-regional control is defined as the time from the date of randomization until progression in the T or N site. Participants who died or had secondary primary malignancies in the head and neck region outside of the T and N site or distant metastasis were not counted as an event and were instead treated as competing risks. Per the TNM staging of tumors: T describes the size of the tumor and whether it has invaded nearby tissue, and N describes regional lymph nodes that are involved. Due to the minimal events reported (data cut-off 30-Sep-2010), valid analysis could not be performed for loco-regional control rate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Distant Recurrence of Initial Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until the first occurrence of distant metastasis, assessed after a median of 30.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants were analyzed for the occurrence of distant metastasis (spread of a disease from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ or part) after randomization in the study until data cut-off date 1-Aug-2014. Participants who died or had recurrence of disease in the T or N sites or secondary primary malignancies in the head and neck region outside of the original T and N site were not counted as an event and were instead treated as competing risks.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until the first occurrence of distant metastasis, assessed after a median of 30.9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Distant relapse is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first occurrence of distant metastasis (spread of a disease from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ of part). Participants who died or had recurrence of disease in the T or N sites or secondary primary malignancies in the head and neck region outside of the original T and N site were not counted as an event and were instead treated as competing risks.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Overall Response (OR), as Assessed by the Investigator</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of randomization until 6 months post chemoradiation treatment, assessed for a median of 13 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants with OR were those who achieved either a CR or partial response (PR) from the assessment of overall tumor response at 6 months (24 weeks) following completion of CRT (data cut-off 30-Sep-2010). Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions; PR is defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the long diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as a reference, the baseline sum LD. Data are based on Week 24 scans from participants receiving study treatment at that time point.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Positive and Negative for the Expression of Biomarkers in Tumor Tissue: Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (HER)-1, HER2, HER3, HER4, P16, and Transforming Growth Factor (TGF-alpha)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 28 days prior to the date of the first dose of lapatinib/placebo start</time_frame>
    <description>Paraffin-embedded tissue block (or sections) from archived tumor tissue sample, if available (from time of original diagnosis) or fresh tumor tissue, was sent for testing to determine intra-tumoral biomarker expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. Stained tumor slides or tissue micro arrays (TMAs) were scored by a pathologist from 0 (no expression) to 3+ (high expression). An expression level of &gt;=2+ was considered positive.</description>

    <measure>Plasma Proteome Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>From up to 28 days prior to the first dose of lapatinib/placebo start to 8 weeks after the first dose</time_frame>
    <description>Proteomic analyses of blood plasma samples were to be conducted to identify any changes in the proteome profile that could be related to the treatment response. Examination of pre-dosing (screening) plasma protein profiles could uncover novel blood-borne protein candidate biomarkers/profiles, which could be used to predict drug response.</description>

        <description>Participants with CR are defined as those who achieved a complete tumor response at 6 months after the completion of the chemoradiation treatment (CRT), as assessed by independent radiological review. Tumor response was assessed using modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Per RECIST, CR is defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions. Data are based on Week 24 scans from participants receiving study treatment at that time and on those in follow-up.</description>

        <description>Distant relapse is defined as the time from the date of randomization until the first occurrence of distant metastasis (spread of a disease from one organ or part to another non-adjacent organ of part). Participants who died or had recurrence of disease in the T or N sites or secondary primary malignancies in the head and neck region outside of the original T and N site were not counted as an event and were instead treated as competing risks.</description>
