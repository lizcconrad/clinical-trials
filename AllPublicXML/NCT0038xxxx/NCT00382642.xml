  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether ondansetron is safe and effective in the
      treatment of alcohol dependence. We also want to learn whether the study drug ondansetron
      combined with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy will assist researchers to determine whether
      having a certain gene is responsible for determining how a person benefits or does not
      benefit from the use of ondansetron for alcohol dependence.

      This is a 13 week outpatient clinical trial. Participants will either receive ondansetron or
      placebo and behavioral therapy. There is a 1, 2, and 3 month post-study follow up
      visit.Screening for this study is initially done over the telephone and takes 15-20 minutes.
      If participants are eligible after the initial screen, they will be invited to come in for a
      more thorough in house screen which takes about 5 to 6 hours. The screening will include a
      physical exam, review of medical, alcohol and drug histories and blood collection. If
      participants are found to be eligible after the in house screen, they will be enrolled in the
      13 week outpatient clinical trial.
