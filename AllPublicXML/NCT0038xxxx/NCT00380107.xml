  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is the purpose of the researchers to identify the variation in intravascular deficits
      which can have relevance in high risk patients for minor and medium sized surgery.

      The investigators will also estimate fluid deficit in healthy, non-fasting subjects for
      comparison.

    <textblock>
      Intravascular volume optimization has shown to improve outcome after surgery. In minor and
      medium surgery , however, the preoperative volume deficit has not been estimated with
      functional parameters. Patient scheduled for minor surgery are included. After the patient is
      anesthetized the intravascular volume is optimized by stroke volume maximization by colloid
      boluses. Stroke volume is obtained by esophageal Doppler technique which is a minimally
      invasive method.

      The volume estimated for optimization is considered as the functional volume deficit.

      In the healthy subjects the probe will be placed in the awake subject. A standardized meal
      and fluid intake secures that the subjects are in a non-fasting state.
