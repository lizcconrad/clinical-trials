  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a mixture of 9 east Indian herbs known as
      Cystone regarding their ability to dissolve existing kidney stones and prevent formation of
      new ones. Cystine and calcium stone formers will be recruited for a 59 week trial. The first
      phase of the study will be two 6 weeks periods during which each subject will receive Cystone
      or placebo in random order (with a one-week wash out between 6 week treatment periods). The
      remaining 46 weeks, each subject will receive Cystone. End points are changes in urinary
      chemistries and stone burden by Computerized Tomography (CT) scanning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystone will be used in proven cystine and calcium stone forming adults who are not pregnant.
      Subjects must have a measurable stone by CT. The first phase is a double blind, randomized,
      placebo controlled cross-over of Cystone and placebo for 6 weeks each separated by a 1 week
      washout. Entry, 6 and 12 week 24 hour urine supersaturations or cystine, pH and sodium
      determinations will be collected. Then all patients enter an open label phase of 46 weeks,
      ensuring a 52-week total exposure to Cystone during the 59 week study. Baseline and 1 year
      stone quantification CT scans will be performed. End points will be changes in urine
      chemistry/supersaturation and stone burden. Stone burden was measured by CT, quantitatively
      for stone density and volume. All CT images were also reviewed in a blinded fashion by a
      radiologist to score each kidney as increased, no change or decreased stone burden.

      Statistics and Randomization: Randomization was accomplished using a table provided by the
      department of statistics to the study coordinator who was blinded as to whether the patients
      received placebo or Cystone®. Biochemical and supersaturation results were analyzed via a
      matched pair analysis using the JMP software package (SAS Instituted, Inc.); P values &lt; 0.05
      were deemed significant.

    <time_frame>baseline, after 6 weeks treatment on placebo, after 6 weeks treatment on cystone, at end of 46 weeks of open label cystone treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate.</description>

        <title>24 Hour Urine Supersaturation of Calcium Oxalate (CaOx)</title>
        <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate.</description>

          <title>24 Hour Urine Supersaturation of Calcium Phosphate (Hydroxyapatite)</title>
          <description>Urine is often supersaturated, which favors precipitation of crystalline phases such as calcium oxalate. However, crystals do not always form in supersaturated urine because supersaturation is balanced by crystallization inhibitors that are also present. Supersaturation is calculated by measuring the concentration of all the ions that can interact. Once these concentrations are known, a computer program can calculate the theoretical supersaturation with respect to the important crystalline phases, eg, calcium oxalate.</description>
