  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of anoperineal physiotherapy in
      adjunction to standard medical treatment on symptoms and quality of life of adults with anal
      incontinence, in comparison with standard treatment alone.

      A total of 443 patients will be randomized to 2 groups: standard care (medical treatment)
      alone or standard care associated with anoperineal physiotherapy. Outcome measures include
      the patient own view of the effectiveness of the treatment, the continence score, quality of
      life and psychological status. These outcomes are measured at the end of the 4 months
      treatment period.

      Following this period, the non responders to standard medical treatment will be proposed to
      undergo a course of anoperineal physiotherapy and the non responders to anoperineal
      physiotherapy will be treated by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). The
      outcomes will be measured at the end of the 4 months new treatment and again after 4 months
      follow-up.
