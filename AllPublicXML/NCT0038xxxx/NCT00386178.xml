    <textblock>
      Gamma tocopherol (gt) is a naturally occurring form of vitamin E that is found in many foods,
      and is also commercially available as a vitamin supplement. The purpose of this Phase 1
      research study is to see if two doses of gt, 600mg and 1200mg, are safe (do not cause
      gastrointestinal distress or other problems), and can cause changes in your blood levels of
      gt and other antioxidants. This study will also examine if there is a difference in response
      between asthmatic and non-asthmatic adults when taking the same dose of gt. Phase 1 research
      studies like this one are not intended to be a treatment, but are a scientific investigation.

      This is designed as an open label study of the effect of 600 mg and 1200mg gamma tocopherol
      (gt), orally administered daily for 8 days, on serum antioxidant levels in asthmatics and
      healthy volunteers. Each course of gamma tocopherol will be followed by a 7-8 day wash out
      period and serum testing to ensure that blood levels are back to baseline prior to starting
      the next course. The gamma tocopherol will be obtained from Yasoo Health Inc and contains
      623mg gt per 830 mg gelatin capsule.

      Allergy skin testing to a battery of allergens common to the region will be performed to
      determine the state of atopy both prior to drug administration and after the 8 day course.
      Allergic volunteers will be asked to abstain from taking any antihistamines during the 3 days
      prior to the skin testing. Repeat allergy testing will not be performed on subjects unable to
      hold antihistamines for health reasons, or on non-allergic volunteers who demonstrate no
      response to baseline testing. Spirometry will be performed to determine the current level of
      lung function. Subjects will be asked to refrain from taking vitamin supplements,
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and other dietary supplements.

        Inclusion Criteria: allergic asthmatic cohort

          -  Specific allergy to at least one of the following allergen preparations: (House Dust
             Mite f, House dust mite p, Cockroach, Tree mix, Grass Mix, Weed Mix, Mold Mix 1, Mold
             Mix 2, Rat, Mouse, Guinea Pig, Rabbit, Cat or Dog) confirmed by positive immediate
             skin test response.

          -  Oxygen saturation of &gt; 94 % at baseline

          -  Blood pressure within the following parameters (Systolic between 150 - 90,Diastolic
             between 100-60 mm Hg)

          -  Moderate or severe persistent asthma according to NHLBI definitions including history
             of one of the following: 1)Episodic wheezing, chest tightness or shortness of breath
             consistent with asthma occurring at least once a week that may affect
             activity;2)Asthma symptoms occurring at night or during sleep at least 1 time per
             week; 3)measured FEV1 or FVC is &lt;80% of predicted; OR 4)physician diagnosed moderate
             or severe persistent asthma which is currently treated or controlled with maintenance
             medication including moderate or high dose inhaled corticosteroid, or any dose of
             inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting inhaled B2-agonist

        Inclusion Criteria- healthy volunteer cohort

          -  Oxygen saturation &gt; 94 % at baseline

          -  Blood pressure within the following parameters (Systolic between 150 - 90, Diastolic
             between 100-60 mm Hg)

          -  No physician diagnosis of asthma since age 6

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any chronic medical condition considered by the PI as a contraindication to receiving
             gamma tocopherol, including significant cardiovascular disease, diabetes requiring

             month prior to entrance into the study.

             cannot be justified.

          -  Adults age 51 and older are excluded as the potential for concomitant illness in this

          -  Known vagal response to venipuncture

          -  Abnormal PT or PTT values at screening
