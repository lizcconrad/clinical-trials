  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether or not case management by a social worker
      and nurse can decrease the number of emergency room visits, increase the number of primary
      care doctor visits, and increase quality of life of people in a Medicaid managed care plan.

      This study will assign participants based on Zip Code to one of two conditions: control and
      experimental. In the control group, participants will receive telephonic assessments at
      baseline, three months, and six months. These assessments will be conducted by a member of
      the Medical Center’s Department of Geriatrics under the supervision of the Principal
      Investigator. Participants in the experimental group will receive medical case management
      provided by a nurse and social worker in the homecare setting including an in-home
      assessment. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, three months, and six months during
      routine homecare visits. Dependent variables being measured include: access to primary care
      physicians, emergent hospitalizations/admissions, articulation of advance directives, and
      quality of life. Data will be collected through the participants’ medical claims and records
      to analyze the number of emergent hospitalizations/admissions, documentation of advance
      directives, and number of visits to primary care physicians. To measure participants’ quality
      of life, the Depression Self-Rating Scale and the Clinical Anxiety Scale will be utilized.
      Data will be compared between and within the groups via statistical analyses. The researcher
      will conduct pre-post comparisons of utilization and other database-derived outcomes for both
      groups, comparing the 12 months prior to and up to 20 months following enrollment.
