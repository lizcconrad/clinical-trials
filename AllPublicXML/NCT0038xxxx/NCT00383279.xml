      RATIONALE: Finding out which problems affect employment in survivors of gynecologic cancer
      may help in planning cancer treatment and improve the quality of life of future cancer
      survivors.

      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at ways to improve employment in patients who have
      survived cervical cancer, uterine cancer, or ovarian cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Conduct formative work, including 4 to 5 focus groups, leading to development of a
           structured interview instrument assessing factors related to employment outcomes among
           women with gynecologic cancers.

        -  Pilot a recruitment strategy and administer the interview among a sample of 60 to 70
           gynecologic cancer survivors; and, with each woman's permission, a family member, a key
           health care provider, and her supervisor will be interviewed.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, pilot study.

      Patients complete a survey, meet with a focus group, and undergo a short interview.
      Patient-designated participants are also interviewed; these individuals may include a health
      care provider, a significant other, and/or a work supervisor.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.
