  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called painful bladder syndrome (PBS), or chronic pelvic
      pain syndrome(CPPS) is a common condition with no known cause or cure. Twin studies and
      family accounts have suggested that the condition may be genetic or passed down (inherited)
      from one generation to another.

      In this study, we are collecting genetic material and medical information from families in
      North America in an attempt to identify genetic factors that may cause IC/PBS/CPPS. We are
      enrolling families and individuals with IC/PBS/CPPS and their family members (both family
      members with and without IC like symptoms).

      To fully describe the phenotype of interstitial cystitis (IC)/painful bladder syndrome
      (PBS)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), in adults and children, and to correlate the
      phenotypic information to the genotypic findings utilizing linkage analysis, whole exome
      sequencing and candidate gene studies. Both individuals and families with IC/PBS/CPPS
      symptoms will be recruited to give a DNA (from saliva) and urine samples and answer 2
      questionnaires. Travel to Boston NOT necessary.
