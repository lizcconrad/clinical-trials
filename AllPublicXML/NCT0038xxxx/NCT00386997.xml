  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the poor outcome of patients with invasive fungal infections (IFI), a more effective
      prevention of these infections in such patients is wanted. These experiences in intensively
      treated elderly patients with acute leukemia are especially worrying.

      This pilot study is designed to collect information on the safety (and efficacy) of an
      antifungal preventative therapy with an AmBisome® loading dose regimen of 7 mg/kg/week, in
      four weekly administrations, during the aplastic phase following the start of chemotherapy
      for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in elderly patients, which is a high risk period for severe
      fungal infections.

      This is a multi-center, pilot, prospective, open label study. Approximately 20 patients will
      be recruited in 10 to 15 centers.

      The patient group will be the following:

      Elderly patients (≥ 55 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing chemotherapy with
      GMALL-Elderly 1/2003 protocol.

      They will be treated with LAMB for four weeks after induction phase I. Patients will attend
      for full assessment until trial completion or withdrawal: there will be 3 assessment visits
      during the first week, 2 assessment visits during the second week, and 1 weekly assessment
      visit during the third and fourth week of the prophylaxis treatment (the first visit of each
      week being the infusion visit as well).

      After the end of the prophylaxis period, patients will have 3 follow-up visits which will be
      scheduled at Weeks 6, 9, and 12.

      Please note that no other systemic antifungal prophylaxis is allowed to be used concomitantly
      with AmBisome®.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female patients

          -  Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) undergoing first induction
             chemotherapy within the GMALL-Elderly 1/2003 protocol

          -  Females of childbearing potential (less than 2 years post-menopausal) must be
             surgically incapable of pregnancy, or practicing an acceptable method of birth control
             with a negative pregnancy test (blood or urine) at baseline

          -  Understanding of the study's rationale and procedures documented in the patient's
             informed consent

          -  Ability and agreement to comply with all study requirements

          -  Patient willing to attend hospital appointments for each visit (infusions will be
             performed in hospital, under strict medical supervision).

             particular known history of anaphylactic reaction to amphotericin B or LAMB or any of
             its constituents
