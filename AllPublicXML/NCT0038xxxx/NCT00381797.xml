    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving bevacizumab together with irinotecan works in
      treating young patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory glioma, medulloblastoma,
      ependymoma, or low grade glioma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab
      may also stop the growth of glioma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bevacizumab together
      with irinotecan may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the rates of objective response observed prior to disease progression during the
      first four courses of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in pediatric
      patients with recurrent, progressive, or refractory malignant glioma (Stratum A [closed to
      accrual as of 4/21/2009]) or recurrent/progressive/refractory intrinsic brain stem glioma
      (Stratum B [closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009]).

      II. Estimate the rates of objective response observed prior to disease progression during the
      first four courses of treatment with bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride in patients
      with recurrent or progressive medulloblastoma (Stratum C [closed to accrual as of
      10/27/2009]) or recurrent or progressive ependymoma (Stratum D [closed to accrual as of
      7/29/2010]).

      III. Estimate the sustained disease stabilization rate associated with bevacizumab and
      irinotecan in patients with recurrent or progressive low grade glioma (Stratum E [closed to
      accrual as of 7/29/2010]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the rate of treatment-related toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      II. Estimate the cumulative incidence of sustained objective responses as a function of this
      regimen in these patients.

      III. Estimate the distributions of survival and event-free survival of these patients.

      IV. Correlate functional changes in tumor with progression-free survival and response using
      MR perfusion/diffusion imaging and fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (high-grade glioma [closed to accrual as of 4/21/2009] vs intrinsic brain stem tumor [closed
      to accrual as of 4/21/2009] vs medulloblastoma [closed to accrual as of 10/27/2010] vs
      ependymoma [closed to accrual as of 7/29/2010] vs low grade glioma [closed to accrual as of
      7/29/2010]).

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 15 and irinotecan
      hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes on day 16 or 17 for course 1. Patients receive bevacizumab
      and irinotecan hydrochloride on days 1 and 15 for all subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients undergo MRIs of the brain, magnetic resonance perfusion/diffusion, and
      fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography at baseline and periodically during
      treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days and then every 3
      months for up to 2 years.

    <measure>Cumulative Incidence of Sustained Objective Responses</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first imaging after treatment up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Cumulative incidence of sustained objective response provides a percentage of participants experiencing the event of interest at a given follow-up time point (for example, 6-months, 1-year, etc.) in the presence of competing events such as progressive disease or death, and it is estimated using the event data for both the event of interest and the competing events experienced by the study participants. In this sense, it is different than the incidence rates estimated in epidemiological studies in terms of 'incidences per 1000 person years. 6-month Cumulative incidence of sustained objective responses will be reported separately for each stratum.</description>

    <measure>Association of Log-transformed Tumor Volume Based on FLAIR With Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Hazard Ratio Estimates</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until the earliest of progressive disease, death, second malignancy or off study OR up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Using Cox proportional hazards models, the association of tumor volume based on FLAIR images with PFS will be investigated for those strata that have a sufficient number of participants with volume FLAIR measurements. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging is performed to investigate surrogate markers of tumor growth. Volume FLAIR measurements were longitudinal. As we are not comparing the strata, analyses will be done in each stratum separately, and thus we cannot report the Cox model results in the Statistical Analysis section. We consider these estimates 'descriptive' within each stratum. In this analysis, the hazard ratio is a relative measure of likelihood that a study participant experiences the event of interest compared to another participant who has a one-unit lower Log-transformed tumor volume based on FLAIR. The Cox survival model provides the mean hazard ratio along with its 95% confidence interval, which we report below.</description>

Therapy will begin with single-agent bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given intravenously (i.v) on day 1 and day 15 (+/- 24 hours) followed by MR-perfusion/diffusion imaging within 24-48 hours following the 2nd dose of bevacizumab. The first dose of irinotecan will be given i.v following this MR-perfusion scan. Subsequently, bevacizumab and irinotecan will be given every two weeks. The irinotecan dose will depend on whether the patient is on an enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug (EIACD). The irinotecan dose will be 250 mg/m2 (~ 80 % of dose tolerated by adults in the Duke Phase II study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan) every two weeks for those on EIACDs. If the patient is not on an EIACD, the starting dose will be 125 mg/m2.</description>

          <description>Recurrent, progressive or refractory high-grade gliomas (Stratum A): The only patients with Recurrent, progressive or refractory high-grade gliomas were treated in this arm. Therapy will begin with single-agent bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given intravenously (i.v) on day 1 and day 15 (+/- 24 hours) followed by MR-perfusion/diffusion imaging within 24-48 hours following the 2nd dose of bevacizumab. The first dose of irinotecan will be given i.v following this MR-perfusion scan. Subsequently, bevacizumab and irinotecan will be given every two weeks. The irinotecan dose will depend on whether the patient is on an enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug (EIACD). The irinotecan dose will be 250 mg/m2 (~ 80 % of dose tolerated by adults in the Duke Phase II study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan) every two weeks for those on EIACDs. If the patient is not on an EIACD, the starting dose will be 125 mg/m2.</description>

        <title>Sustained Disease Stabilization Rate Associated With Bevacizumab and Irinotecan in Patients With Recurrent or Progressive Low-grade Glioma (Stratum E)</title>
        <description>Disease stabilization is defined as a complete response(CR) or partial response(PR) observed during the first four courses and sustained for 8 weeks; or stable disease (SD) sustained for 6 courses characterized by SD at the end of course 2, at the end of course 4 and at the end of course 6. CR is complete disappearance of all enhancing tumor. PR is &gt;= 50% reduction in tumor size. SD is at least stable and maintenance corticosteroid dose not increased in neurologic examination.</description>

            <description>Recurrent low grade glioma (Stratum E): The only patients with recurrent low grade glioma were treated in this arm. Therapy will begin with single-agent bevacizumab 10 mg/kg given intravenously (i.v) on day 1 and day 15 (+/- 24 hours) followed by MR-perfusion/diffusion imaging within 24-48 hours following the 2nd dose of bevacizumab. The first dose of irinotecan will be given i.v following this MR-perfusion scan. Subsequently, bevacizumab and irinotecan will be given every two weeks. The irinotecan dose will depend on whether the patient is on an enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug (EIACD). The irinotecan dose will be 250 mg/m2 (~ 80 % of dose tolerated by adults in the Duke Phase II study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan) every two weeks for those on EIACDs. If the patient is not on an EIACD, the starting dose will be 125 mg/m2.</description>

        <title>Association of Log-transformed Tumor Volume Based on FLAIR With Progression-free Survival (PFS) Using Hazard Ratio Estimates</title>
        <description>Using Cox proportional hazards models, the association of tumor volume based on FLAIR images with PFS will be investigated for those strata that have a sufficient number of participants with volume FLAIR measurements. Volumetric magnetic resonance imaging is performed to investigate surrogate markers of tumor growth. Volume FLAIR measurements were longitudinal. As we are not comparing the strata, analyses will be done in each stratum separately, and thus we cannot report the Cox model results in the Statistical Analysis section. We consider these estimates 'descriptive' within each stratum. In this analysis, the hazard ratio is a relative measure of likelihood that a study participant experiences the event of interest compared to another participant who has a one-unit lower Log-transformed tumor volume based on FLAIR. The Cox survival model provides the mean hazard ratio along with its 95% confidence interval, which we report below.</description>

        <title>Systemic Clearance</title>
        <description>Blood specimens were collected on the days listed for pharmacokinetic studies for Bevacizumab. These specimens were analyzed to produce steady-state plasma Bevacizumab concentration-time data in study participants. The concentration-time data were analyzed to provide an estimate of the systemic clearance. The data were collected but the analyses of the PK data were conducted by Genentech using a broader cohort of pediatric patients from multiple trials in the paper &quot;Bevacizumab dosing strategy in paediatric cancer patients based on population pharmacokinetic analysis with external validation&quot; published by British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, 2016 volume 81(1):148-160. The estimates of the systemic clearance were calculated by the model described in the paper.</description>

The irinotecan dose will depend on whether the patient is on an enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug (EIACD). The irinotecan dose will be 250 mg/m2 (~ 80 % of dose tolerated by adults in the Duke Phase II study of bevacizumab plus irinotecan) every two weeks for those on EIACDs. If the patient is not on an EIACD, the starting dose will be 125 mg/m2.</description>

          <title>Descriptive Statistics for the Change of Perfusion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Concurrently Measured With the Change in Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 (VEGF-R2) Expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC)</title>
          <description>The change of perfusion in magnetic resonance imaging is calculated by taking the difference between the Day-15 measurements and the Baseline measurements for patients who had the changes of VEGF-R2. The purpose of reporting the descriptive statistics is to provide the information for the correlation coefficients reported in the next section, Section 19. MR perfusion ratio is the ratio of the perfusion measurements in the tumor and the perfusion measurerement in comparative frontal while matter, which is the comparative healthy part of the brain.</description>

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>Neuroimaging data capturing Volume Enhancing and Perfusion Ratio was so limited to run any statistical model. Similarly, due to limited data, some PK and Biology objectives were not able to be addressed.</limitations_and_caveats>
