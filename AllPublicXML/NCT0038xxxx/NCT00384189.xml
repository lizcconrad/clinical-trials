  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of inhaled ciclesonide at three
      different dose levels compared with placebo with respect to pulmonary function, asthma
      symptoms, and use of rescue medication in children aged 6-11 years with asthma. Treatment
      medication will be administered as follows: ciclesonide or placebo will be inhaled once daily
      in the evening. The study consists of a baseline period (2 to 4 weeks) and a treatment period
      (12 weeks). The study provides further data on safety and tolerability of ciclesonide.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested is called ciclesonide. This study looked at the safety and efficacy of
      inhaled ciclesonide in children with asthma. The study enrolled 1080 patients.

      Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups which were undisclosed to the
      patient and study doctor during the study:• Ciclesonide 40 µg, 80 µg or 160 µg • Placebo-
      this is similar to study drug but has no active ingredient. Ciclesonide was inhaled via a
      metered-dose inhaler (MDI with HFA-134a propellant), with or without spacer, once daily in
      the evening throughout the study. All participants were asked to document daily AM and PM
      peak expiratory flow (PEF), daytime and nighttime asthma symptom scores and number of puffs
      of rescue medicine in an electronic diary. This multi-centre trial was conducted worldwide.
      The overall time to participate in this study was 20 weeks. Participants made multiple visits
      to the clinic plus a final visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>PEF is the maximum speed of expiration. A portable electronic PEF meter was used for the home PEF readings. The patients recorded PEF daily, in the morning immediately after getting up. Readings were done preferably at least 4 hours after use of rescue medication and before inhalation of the study medication. At each measurement, three readings were obtained in the standing position. All three values were recorded in the diary; the highest value was used for evaluation. The higher change from Baseline values are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis. Last observation carried forward.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Kaplan Meier Estimates of the probability of not experiencing LOE by Week 12 was measured. LOE was reached if any of the following criteria occurred during the treatment period: • asthma exacerbation (a worsening of asthma symptoms requiring a change in medication; • nocturnal awakenings due to asthma on any 4 or more nights during any 7-consecutive-day period; • use of more than 8 puffs/day of salbutamol on any 4 or more days during any 7-consecutive-day period; • decrease in morning PEF to &lt;80% of randomization value on any 4 consecutive days during the treatment period.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Morning Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)</title>
        <description>PEF is the maximum speed of expiration. A portable electronic PEF meter was used for the home PEF readings. The patients recorded PEF daily, in the morning immediately after getting up. Readings were done preferably at least 4 hours after use of rescue medication and before inhalation of the study medication. At each measurement, three readings were obtained in the standing position. All three values were recorded in the diary; the highest value was used for evaluation. The higher change from Baseline values are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis. Last observation carried forward.</description>

The patients recorded PEF daily, in the morning immediately after getting up. Readings were done preferably at least 4 hours after use of rescue medication and before inhalation of the study medication. At each measurement, three readings were obtained in the standing position. All three values were recorded in the diary; the highest value was used for evaluation. The higher change from Baseline values are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Evening PEF From Diary</title>
        <description>PEF is the maximum speed of expiration. A portable electronic PEF meter was used for the home PEF readings. The patients recorded PEF daily, in the morning immediately after getting up. Readings were done preferably at least 4 hours after use of rescue medication and before inhalation of the study medication. At each measurement, three readings were obtained in the standing position. All three values were recorded in the diary; the highest value was used for evaluation. The higher change from Baseline values are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the Baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis.</description>

Daytime Asthma Score using a 5 point scale: 0=very well, no asthma symptoms to 4=asthma very bad, unable to carry out daily activities as usual.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Standard [PAQLQ(S)] Overall Score</title>
        <description>PAQLQS is a disease specific instrument to assess the impact of asthma on the patient’s quality of life. The PAQLQS consists of 23 items in 3 domains evaluating activity limitations, symptoms and emotional function. Patients answered each question using a 7-point scale from 1= maximum impairment to 7=no impairment) about their experience during the previous week. Total possible score ranging from 23 (worst) to 161(best). Higher change from Baseline scores are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire Standard [PAQLQ(S)] Overall Score</title>
          <description>PAQLQS is a disease specific instrument to assess the impact of asthma on the patient’s quality of life. The PAQLQS consists of 23 items in 3 domains evaluating activity limitations, symptoms and emotional function. Patients answered each question using a 7-point scale from 1= maximum impairment to 7=no impairment) about their experience during the previous week. Total possible score ranging from 23 (worst) to 161(best). Higher change from Baseline scores are the best. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the baseline value and age as covariates was used for analysis.</description>
