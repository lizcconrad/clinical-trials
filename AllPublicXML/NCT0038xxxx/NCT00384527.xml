    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of nitazoxanide compared
      to vancomycin in resolving symptoms of Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Patients with new onset of disease evidenced by diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools within
             24 hours), and one or more of the following symptoms of CDAD:

               -  abdominal pain or cramps

               -  peripheral leukocytosis

               -  fever

          -  C. difficile toxin A or B detected in a stool specimen obtained within 3 days before
             enrollment by enzyme immunoassay.

          -  Patients willing to avoid the following medications during the study:

               -  oral and intravenous metronidazole

               -  oral vancomycin

               -  anti-peristaltic drugs

               -  opiates (patients on opiates may be included in the study if they were taking
                  opiates prior to enrollment and the dose is not increased during the study)

               -  Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast)

               -  Lactobacillus GG

               -  cholestyramine

               -  colestipol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with other known causes of diarrhea or colitis (e.g., Shigella, Salmonella,
             Cryptosporidium parvum, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, inflammatory bowel
             disease, irritable bowel syndrome, advanced AIDS or chemotherapy for malignancy).

          -  Patients that commonly have 3 or more stools per day and/or severe abdominal pain in
             the absence of CDAD.

          -  Patients with severe lactose intolerance.

          -  Patients with more than 1 recurrence of CDAD during the 6 months prior to enrollment.

          -  Patients unable to take oral medications.

          -  Use within 1 week of enrollment of any drug or therapy with anti-C. difficile activity
             such as oral or intravenous metronidazole and oral vancomycin. [Patients that have
             taken up to 3 doses of metronidazole or vancomycin can be included in the study].

          -  Females of child bearing age who are either pregnant, breast-feeding or not using
             birth control and are sexually active.

          -  Patients who are either clinically unstable (e.g., fulminant disease patients with
             signs of toxic megacolon, imminent perforation, colectomy or death) or unlikely to
             live throughout the 31-day duration of the study due to underlying illness.

          -  History of hypersensitivity to nitazoxanide or vancomycin or any active ingredient in
             the formulations.
