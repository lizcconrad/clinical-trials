      This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cesamet™ in controlling pain
      in subjects experiencing pain due to chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain in patients with
      cancer.

    <textblock>
      To determine the safety and efficacy of Cesamet™ in the symptomatic treatment of
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.

      This is a phase IV, multicenter, open label of Cesamet™ at 1 mg daily progressing to 2mg BID
      in subjects with chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. This study has two phases: A
      pretreatment phase and a treatment phase.
