      RATIONALE: ABT-888 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth. Collecting and storing samples of blood from patients with cancer to study
      in the laboratory may help doctors learn more about the ways a patient's body handles the
      drug.

      PURPOSE: This early phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of ABT-888 in
      patients with refractory solid tumors or hematologic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the dose-range at which ABT-888 inhibits poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
           in tumor samples and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with
           refractory solid tumors or lymphoid malignancies.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of ABT-888.

        -  Determine the time course of PARP inhibition in PBMCs by ABT-888.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of administering 1 dose of ABT-888 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-finding study.

      Patients receive oral ABT-888 once on day 1.

      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of ABT-888 until significant tumor poly
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition is observed in 3 of 3 patients at 2 dose levels.
      Significant PARP inhibition is defined as ≥ 0.69 reduction on the log scale in poly
      (ADP-ribose) level from baseline to 3-6 hours after ABT-888 administration (with 90%
      confidence that it is not due to chance variation).

      Patients undergo peripheral blood collection at baseline and periodically after ABT-888
      administration for PARP inhibition, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies. Once
      significant PARP inhibition is observed in 1 of 3 patients, subsequently enrolled patients
      also undergo tumor biopsy* at baseline and 3-6 hours or 21-27 hours after ABT-888
      administration to determine PARP inhibition in tumor tissue.

      NOTE: *Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergo peripheral blood collection instead
      of biopsy.

      After completion of ABT-888 administration, patients are followed for 7 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23 patients will be accrued for this study.
