    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study for patients with thymoma or thymic carcinoma thought to be at
      significant risk for recurrence following surgical removal. This study involves the use of
      combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery, in hopes of increasing the
      chances of complete resection. The chemoradiotherapy protocol is one which has been used
      extensively for other diseases, and the side effects are therefore well-documented. Patients
      with thymomas thought to be at significant risk for recurrence (by x-ray and pathology
      criteria) will be allowed to participate, and will undergo combined chemotherapy with
      radiation to the chest followed by surgical removal of the tumor and postoperative
      chemotherapy. The main outcome measured will be the rate of pathological complete response
      (e.g. no active tumor in the resected specimen) to the preoperative treatment. Patients will
      receive postoperative treatment based on surgical and pathologic criteria.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Past experience has suggested that the ability to completely remove the thymoma using surgery
      is important in preventing recurrence. Strategies which would help the surgeon's ability to
      completely remove the tumor therefore need to be investigated.

      This study represents a multi-institutional, phase II pilot trial of preoperative
      chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection and postoperative chemotherapy for patients
      with invasive thymoma or thymic carcinoma at significant risk for recurrence. We hypothesize
      that this strategy will be well-tolerated and produce response and resectability rates
      exceeding those previously published involving surgical resection alone, or preoperative
      chemotherapy followed by surgery. Patients with locally advanced thymoma, based on
      radiographic and biopsy criteria, will undergo pretreatment computed tomography (CT) scan and
      positron emission tomography (PET) followed by concurrent (simultaneous) chemotherapy
      (cisplatin and etoposide) and radiation. After this therapy, patients will be reassessed
      using computed tomography (CT) and PET, and undergo surgical resection of their tumors.
      Following resection, patients will be either observed, or treated with postoperative
      chemotherapy, or chemotherapy and radiation. Correlative genomic, serologic and pathologic
      studies will also be performed.
