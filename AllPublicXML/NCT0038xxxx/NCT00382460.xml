    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the study was to evaluate 4000 subjects with acute coronary syndrome
      by comparing pravastatin 40 mg to atorvastatin 80 mg to determine if they are clinically
      equivalent, and to evaluate the effectiveness of gatifloxacin therapy in reducing
      cardiovascular events in combination with statin therapy.
