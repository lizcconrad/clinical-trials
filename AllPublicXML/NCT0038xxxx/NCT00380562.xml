      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the Experience Corps program in
      preventing or delaying physical disability in older adults, by studying the effects of
      volunteerism on physical, social and cognitive well-being.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Baltimore Experience Corps Study is a randomized, controlled, community-based trial of
      the effectiveness of Experience Corps (EC) to determine if participation for adults 60 years
      and older, over two years of follow-up, results in better outcomes in the EC versus control
      arm in terms of mobility, strength, balance, and cognitive functioning.

      The Experience Corps is a community-based model for health promotion for older adults
      embedded within a social engagement program. The program places older adult volunteers in
      meaningful roles in public elementary schools, bringing the time, experience, and wisdom of
      older adults to bear in improving academic and behavioral outcomes of children. The
      Experience Corps incorporates health promotion preventing disability and dependency
      associated with aging, into new, generative roles for older adults.

      This program was initially designed by Dr. Linda Fried of this application, along with Marc
      Freedman of Civic Ventures, Inc. It has gone through two national demonstrations, neither of
      which evaluated the impact on older adults.
