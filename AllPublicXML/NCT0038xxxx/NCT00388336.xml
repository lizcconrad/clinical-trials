  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Epoetin alfa
      administered at 60,000 Units every two weeks in cancer patients who are not receiving
      chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

      This was an open-label (doctors and patients knew which drug was being administered),
      non-randomized (patients were assigned to treatment), multi-center pilot study with the
      objective to investigate the effectiveness of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) on hematopoietic
      response (effect on red blood cells) when administered at 60,000 Units subcutaneously (under
      the skin) every two weeks in anemic patients with cancer who were not receiving chemotherapy
      or radiation therapy.

      Treatment with study drug was for a maximum of 12 weeks followed by a 4-week observation
      period after the last dose of the study drug had been administered.

      Safety and efficacy evaluations were performed at specified intervals throughout the study
      and included assessment of laboratory tests (Complete Blood Count [CBC], Serum Chemistry
      [including hemoglobin level]), vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations
      and the occurrence and severity of adverse events. All patients enrolled in this study
      received pharmacologic ferrous sulfate 325 mg by mouth once a day or an equivalent
      formulation, as tolerated, unless it was determined by the physician that the patient should
      not receive it. All patient's received injections of PROCRIT (Epoetin alfa) 60,000 Units
      under the skin once every two weeks. If after 4 weeks of treatment, the patient's hemoglobin
      level did not increase by &gt;= 1 g/dL, the Epoetin alfa dose was increased to 80,000 Units
      every 2 weeks. Study drug was administered for a maximum of 12 weeks followed by a 4-week
      observation period after the last dose of study drug. Epoetin alfa doses were reduced or held
      as needed depending on the patients' hemoglobin level.

             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, pulmonary emboli, deep vein thrombosis, ischemic
             stroke, other arterial or venous thrombotic events (excluding superficial thromboses),
             or known history of chronic coagulation disorder

          -  No transfusion within 28 days prior to first dose

          -  No planned chemotherapy or radiation during study and no prior chemotherapy within 8
             weeks or radiation within 4 weeks of study entry

          -  No prior treatment with Epoetin alfa or any other erythropoietic agent within the
             previous two months.
