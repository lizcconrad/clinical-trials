  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Escitalopram is the S-enantiomer of citalopram. Both escitalopram and citalopram are
      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and are used to treat depression in adults.
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of escitalopram and an active
      comparator in severely depressed patients.
