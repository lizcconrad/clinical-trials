  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems of self regulation, e.g. emotional dysfunction, represent a core symptom of adult
      patients with traumatic childhood experiences. The study intends to evaluate the efficiency
      of a 14-week group therapy for adult survivors of relational trauma in childhood. Main
      interventions are psychoeducation about the sequelae of childhood trauma, teaching of skills
      for affect regulation and techniques for activating resources. The hypothesis is that the
      group therapy significantly improves the participant's capacity in emotion management and
      self-soothing.

      Problems of self regulation, e.g. emotional dysfunction, represent a core symptom of adult
      patients with traumatic childhood experiences. Since sufficient capacity for self soothing
      and emotional regulation are essential for trauma exposure, modern trauma therapy concepts
      are phase-oriented, beginning with working on &quot;stabilization&quot;. The study intends to evaluate
      the efficiency of a 14-week group therapy for adult survivors of relational trauma in
      childhood. Main interventions are psychoeducation about the sequelae of childhood trauma,
      teaching of skills for affect regulation and techniques for activating resources. Inclusion
      criteria are clinical significant problems with self-regulation and the presence of childhood
      trauma. Outcome measures are based on self-rating questionnaires, clinical interviews and an
      experimental computer-task at timepoint pre-, post- and 3-month-follow-up. There is no
      control condition in the pilot-study phase.
