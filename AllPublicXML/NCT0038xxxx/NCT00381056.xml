      A cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted at 7 intervention and 8 control hospitals
      to evaluate the effect of teamwork training on the occurrence of adverse outcomes and
      processes of care in labor and delivery. The intervention, called the Labor &amp; Delivery Team
      Coordination Course, was a standardized teamwork training curriculum based on crew resource
      management that emphasized communication and team structure. The primary outcome was the
      proportion of deliveries at greater than or equal to 20 weeks gestation in which one or more
      adverse maternal and/or neonatal outcomes occurred (Adverse Outcome Index, AOI). Additional
      outcomes included 11 clinical process measures.
