  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to examine the effect of a multi-component intervention,
      designed to reduce consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, on weight gain, total energy
      intake, and diet quality in adolescents. The secondary aim is to evaluate whether outcomes of
      the intervention differ between adolescents for whom 100% fruit juice vs. other products
      (i.e., soda, fruit punch, lemonade, iced tea, coffee drinks, energy drinks, sports drinks)
      constitutes the primary source of sugar from beverages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We are partnering with community organizations (including high schools) in the greater Boston
      area and a major regional supermarket. Participants will be 240 high school students who
      drink at least 1 serving of sugar-sweetened beverage (including 100% fruit juices) per day
      and who have a BMI ≥ 85th percentile. They will be randomly assigned to an intervention or
      control group. The intervention, of 1-year duration, will target the home/family environment
      in combination with a behavioral intervention provided during brief check-in visits. The
      environment will be changed by delivering non-caloric beverages to the homes of adolescents
      who regularly consume sugar-sweetened beverages. Parents will be counseled by telephone to
      serve as role models in consuming non-caloric beverages. The behavioral intervention for the
      adolescents will include didactic and experiential components during the check-in visits.
      Study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 year (end of intervention period), and 2 years
      (end of follow-up period).

      Additional relevant material based on the original proposal (NIH grant application) is
      provided below:

      Each outcome will be compared between groups using a general linear model, adjusted for
      baseline covariates that could affect body weight: sex, race, ethnicity (Hispanic vs
      non-Hispanic), household income, parents' education, BMI, beverage consumption
      (sugar-sweetened, artificially sweetened, unsweetened), energy intake (total, sugar-sweetened
      beverages, fruit juice), physical activity level, and daily television viewing. Each
      covariate will be tested for confounding, mediation, and interaction effects on the primary
      outcome. Stratum-specific estimates of the group difference will be constructed for any
      covariates showing significant interaction.
