  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia has been demonstrated to be a common finding in patients with heart failure (HF).
      Previous studies in hospitalized patients with HF have found a prevalence of anemia ranging
      from 15% to 63%. More importantly, anemic patients with HF have increased morbidity and
      mortality. The mechanisms underlying anemia in HF are multifactorial, involving mild to
      moderate forms of anemia of chronic disease and ferropenic anemia. The clinical impact of
      iron supplementation in HF patients who have a relatively preserved renal function and either
      chronic disease anemia, ferropenic anemia or both remains largely unknown. The route of iron
      administration that could be most clinically effective is also unclear. Thus, the primary aim
      of the IRON-HF study is to assess the effects of iron supplementation alone (IV or PO) on
      parameters of functional capacity in HF patients with anemia with decreased availability of
      iron.

      The IRON-HF study is an investigator initiated, multicenter, prospectively
      designed,randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial.

      Randomization:Each of the eight participating centers will randomize patients by telephone
      contact with the randomization center at Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre. The
      randomization system will be based on a computerized table of random numbers and performed in
      blocks of three per participating center.

      Blinding:Each participating center will elect a third party blind individual (usually a RN)
      who will open the allocated medication box, prepare iron sucrose infusions or saline and
      administer to patients in opaque devices. Both patient and attending physicians and/or nurses
      will be blind to allocated therapy. Oral medications and oral placebo will be identical in
      all aspects.
