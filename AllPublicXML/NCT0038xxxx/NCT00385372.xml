    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic urticaria undertake a five week elimination diet (pseudoallergen free
      diet). The efficacy of the diet will be determined by symptom score, by the use of rescue
      medication (oral antihistamines and glucocorticosteroids) and by a Quality of Life
      Questionnaire on week 0 and week 5. All patients with sufficient response (regarding the
      urticaria score) enter a second dietary part over six weeks, whereas a provocation diet is
      carried out. Each diet week a choice of pseudoallergen rich food is added, sorted by the type
      of pseudoallergens (e.g. biogenic amines, organic acids, flavours, additives). This study is
      conducted to investigate if the provocation diet could be a new diagnostic intervention to
      elucidate clinical relevant pseudoallergens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic urticaria is defined as a daily or almost daily spontaneous occurrence of wheals that
      cause itching and lasting for at least six weeks. If there is no indication of a possible
      eliciting agent and because approximately 70% of patients benefit from it, a
      low-pseudoallergen diet should be carried out for 5 weeks. Although the low-pseudoallergen
      diet is successful, no explanation of the underlying mechanisms exists. On DBPC oral
      provocation testing with known food additives, only a small amount of patients, who
      experienced remission after a low-pseudoallergen diet react with new wheals and/or
      angioedema. For this discrepancy, natural food ingredients and new food additives are
      included in the dietary diagnostic. The high amount of substances, which are administrated
      within oral provocation testing can not reflect a realistic diet situation. Often it is
      impossible to ingest corresponding amounts of foods to reach the same concentration such as
      the provocation amount. Recording change reactions between food ingredients and the
      individual metabolism of the patients, the &quot;step by step&quot; food provocation method reveals
      itself to be most effective. In addition, individual predilections, amounts and frequency of
      ingested foods, are taken into consideration.
