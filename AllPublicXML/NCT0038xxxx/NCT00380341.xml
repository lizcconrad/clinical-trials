  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of spinal manipulative therapy on
      autonomic balance and to determine if there exists a relationship between autonomic state and
      postural control.

      Previous studies have demonstrated that sensory and cognitive systems share some common
      neural substrate. The afferent neural impuleses of mechanoreception (also known as
      somatosensation) as produced by joint mechanoreceptors and adjacent muscle spindle cells may
      impact supraspinal centers. Few studies have been done to determine if the afferent impulses
      generated by spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) can impact the porcessing that occurs at
      supra-spinal centers. The relationship between postural control and cognition is studies
      using a dual-tak methodology, a primary (postural) task will often demonstrate degradation
      with the addition of a secondary, concurrent (cognitive) task. The current study seeks to
      determine the effects of SMT on postrual control using a dual-task paradigm, while monitoring
      autonomic state (using Heart Rate Variability analysis) during the course of therapy. It is
      thought that SMT can improve HRV status, and postural control within a dual-task situation,
      and that there will be differences in postural control related to a participant's HRV status.
      Activities of daily living often invole the coupling of a cognitive task with a complex
      postural task.
