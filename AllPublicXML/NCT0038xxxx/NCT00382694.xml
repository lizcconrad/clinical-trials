  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is an incurable malignant disease which evnetuelly will relapse after
      primary treatment. Clonal B-cells have been identified and in theory these cells might be
      sleeping during primary treatment and be responsible for later relapse. Fluarabine has
      documented effect on both resting and dividing cells including B-cells. The protocol aim at
      evaluating safety and toxicity of adding fludarabine to induction chemotherapy with
      cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone before high-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell
      support.

      This is a randomised, placebo controlled, phase II study evaluating toxicity and safety of
      fludarabine added to CyDex (cyclophosphamide+dexamethasone) as induction therapy in younger
      patients with untreated and treatment demanding multiple myeloma. The treatment regimen
      Patients will be randomised at diagnosis either to CyDex + Placebo (control Arm A) or CyDex +
      Fludarabine (Experimental Arm B).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Primary:To determine the toxicity and safety of fludarabine when added to induction
           therapy by registration of side effects and adverse events in accordance with the common
           toxicity criteria (CTC).

        -  Secondary:To quantitate clonal cells in bone marrow and blood by flow cytometry (MRD)and
           to study new potential prognostic markers identified by cytomic, genomic and proteomic
           analysis.

        -  Tertiary: To estimate the efficacy of fludarabine when added to induction
           chemotherapy(CyDex) in patients with multiple myeloma by clinical end points: disease
           response and progression free survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple myeloma, stage I-III, previously untreated, and eligible for induction
             therapy followed by high dose treatment supported by autologous stem cell
             transplantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe uncontrolled clinical or microbiological evidence of infection at the time of
             enrolment.
