      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine versus
      placebo used for sedation during elective awake fiberoptic intubation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An awake fiberoptic intubation is indicated for any patient with an anticipated difficult
      airway because of their anatomy, airway trauma, morbid obesity, or unstable cervical spine
      injuries. An awake fiberoptic intubation in a non-sedated patient can be extremely
      stimulating, uncomfortable, and unpleasant. The clinician must focus on maintaining
      spontaneous breathing, hemodynamic stability, and the patient's comfort. The term &quot;awake&quot;
      fiberoptic intubation is used to distinguish this procedure from fiberoptic intubations
      performed under general anesthesia. Although patients may be sedated for &quot;awake&quot; fiberoptic
      intubation, they need to be responsive and capable of maintaining their own airway without
      assistance. Vital components of a successful awake fiberoptic intubation include an
      anesthesiologist experienced in this technique, adequate topicalization of the airway, and a
      sedated yet cooperative subject.

      Benzodiazepines, combined with opioid, are commonly used for anxiolysis and/or analgesia
      during awake fiberoptic intubations.

      Dexmedetomidine has sympatholytic, sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects that attenuate
      the catecholamine response to perioperative stress. Dexmedetomidine sedates patients by
      decreasing sympathetic activity and the level of arousal. Further more, dexmedetomidine has
      been found to facilitate a decrease in salivary secretion, a desirable effect during
      fiberoptic intubations.

      An estimated 100 subjects (50 DEX, 50 PBO) scheduled for an elective awake fiberoptic
      intubation because of a potentially difficult airway will be randomized prior to intubation
      at approximately 18 investigative sites.
