  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to reveal that inhaled corticosteroid therapy combined with a
      short-acting beta2- agonist given on a symptom driven basis is as effective as traditional
      asthma therapy.

      Thus, three advantages will be achieved:

        1. better compliance with treatment since patients will most likely have to administer the
           treatment less frequently,

        2. maximum pharmacological effect with the least amount of drug and

        3. less economic burden on health care providers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is widely recognised as a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. The 1997
      American National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Guidelines states that a firm
      scientific basis exists to indicate that asthma results from complex interactions among
      inflammatory cells, mediators and the cells and tissues resident in the airways.

      Despite the existence of effective therapy people still die from asthma. It is pertinent to
      state that the clinical effect of a drug is not only dependent on the specific action of the
      drug, but also on the patient’s way of using it. Therefore, compliance is an important factor
      especially for chronic disorders such as asthma. Indeed, non compliance with asthma therapy
      is a serious problem. It has been reported that drug side effects, lifestyle, social and
      economic factors, method of drug delivery and dosing are factors that contribute to poor
      compliance. The consequences of poor compliance lead to increased morbidity due to increased
      symptoms and asthma exacerbation.

      The NHLBI Guidelines recommend daily treatment for patients with mild persistent asthma with
      inhaled glucocorticoids (200-500mcg/die) and short-acting bronchodilators as needed but no
      more than 3-4 times a day.

      Comparisons: beclomethasone dipropionate 250 mg combined with salbutamol 100 mg “as needed”,
      vs salbutamol 100 mg alone “as needed”, vs beclomethasone 250 mg twice a day plus salbutamol
      100 mg “as needed” and vs beclomethasone dipropionate 250 mg combined with salbutamol 100 mg
      twice a day plus salbutamol 100 mg “as needed”, in the treatment of patients with mild
      persistent asthma.
