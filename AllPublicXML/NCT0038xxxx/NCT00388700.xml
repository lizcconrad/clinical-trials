  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether the combination of 5-fluorouracil
      (5-FU) plus a DAVANAT (carbohydrate polymer) along with Avastin and Leucovorin (LV) is
      beneficial in treating colorectal cancer in patients unable to tolerate intensive
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, multi-center study of DAVANAT which has been shown to increase the
      anti-tumor activity of 5-FU in mice. 5-FU is a chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat
      tumors. A Phase I study of 40 patients showed that DAVANAT in different doses plus 5-FU was
      well tolerated in patients with different types of solid tumors who failed standard, approved
      treatments.

    <description>To assess the clinical benefit of a regimen of GM-CT-01/5-FU, LV plus Avastin® when administered intravenously as a first-line treatment to patients with Stage III or IV ,advanced or metastatic CRC. Clinical activity will be assessed by determining the percentage of subjects exhibiting an objective response (complete response [CR]) plus partial response [PR]). Tumor response will be assessed following Response Evaluation by RECIST guidelines.</description>
