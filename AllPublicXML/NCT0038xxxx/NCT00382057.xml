  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a medical condition defined by high levels of cholesterol in the
      blood, high blood pressure, central obesity (gain in fat around the region of the stomach),
      and insulin resistance (body responds less well to insulin). This state of impaired insulin
      resistance can lead to type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is one of the most common metabolic
      disorders in the U.S. Numerous studies have shown an inverse relationship between insulin
      resistance and testosterone levels in men, however, causality has not been established. This
      protocol investigates the role of testosterone in modulating insulin sensitivity in insulin
      resistant states such as the metabolic syndrome. The hypothesis is that testosterone
      administration will improve insulin sensitivity.

      This protocol will address the impact of three months of testosterone (T) therapy on all
      components of the metabolic syndrome and the mechanism underlying changes in insulin
      sensitivity by analyzing changes in body composition, and detailed studies of fat metabolism
      and skeletal muscle. In addition, this protocol will address the role of estradiol (E2) in
      mediating the effect of testosterone on insulin sensitivity.

      Seventy-two subjects will undergo a screening visit to assess eligibility after which a
      baseline evaluation will be performed. The baseline metabolic assessment will consist of an
      intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) to measure insulin sensitivity, MRI and DEXA scan
      to assess muscle and body fat distribution, VO2 max test and resting metabolic rate, and a
      muscle biopsy to look at how the muscle is affected by insulin and testosterone.

      Subjects will then be randomized to one of three 12-week treatment arms, 1) Group 1
      (Placebo); 2) Group 2 (Depot GnRH agonist (Zoladex) + T + placebo); or 3) Group 3 (Zoladex +
      T + aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole)). The rationale for this study design is as follows.
      Under normal physiological conditions, administration of T leads to a concomitant increase in
      E2 levels due to endogenous conversion by the aromatase enzyme system. Therefore, in order to
      dissect the relative roles of T and E2 on insulin sensitivity, one group of subjects will
      receive T in conjunction with the aromatase inhibitor, anastrozole.

      At 13 weeks, the entire baseline evaluation including IVGTT, resting metabolic rate and VO2
      max, body composition assessment by DEXA and MRI, and muscle biopsy will be repeated.
      Subjects will return for a follow up visit four weeks later to measure CBC, T and PSA levels,
      to ensure levels are within the normal range.
