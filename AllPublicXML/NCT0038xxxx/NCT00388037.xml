    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well sunitinib malate works in treating
      patients with recurrent ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.
      Sunitinib malate may inhibit the ability of cancers to grow blood vessels, something they
      need to grow. It may also shrink tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) given orally daily
      in patients with advanced or metastatic previously treated epithelial ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic previously
      treated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      III. To document cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response rate, early objective progression rate,
      and, if objective responses are observed, response duration.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.

    <description>Partial response is defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of the target lesion maintained for at least 4 weeks; complete response is defined as complete disappearance of disease and cancer related symptoms maintained for at least 4 weeks. The 95% confidence interval for response rate will be calculated. The median and range of the duration of response will be assessed.</description>
