  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary valve replacement in the adult population is an uncommon operation. The majority of
      native valve pathology in adults involves the mitral, aortic, and occasionally tricuspid
      valves. On the other hand, right ventricular outflow tract and pulmonary valve disease is
      quite common in children, especially with tetralogy of fallot, truncus arteriosus, pulmonary
      atresia/ventricular septal defect, and double outlet right ventricle. Unfortunately, right
      ventricular pathology often develops in adulthood as a result of pulmonary insufficiency or
      pulmonary stenosis created by previous childhood operations. Without the valve size
      constraints present at prior operations, these patients can be well-served by the placement
      of adult-sized bioprosthetic valves. There are limited descriptions in the adult cardiac
      literature of the actual technique of pulmonary valve replacement. We present our current
      technique and the pitfalls encountered when performing pulmonary valve replacement in adults.

      This will be primarily a technique paper. The only clinical data points I am interested in
      are the presence of pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary insufficiency or perivalvular leak on the
      initial post-operative echocardiogram. I estimate reviewing 50 patients' charts dated March
      22.2003 through and including March 22.2006 at Emory Hospital .

      Primary Aim: Present an effective technique for pulmonary valve replacement

      Secondary Aim: Present our excellent technical results of PVR in our adult congenital
      patients
