    <textblock>
      This phase II study will evaluate the effect of bevacizumab, capecitabine and oxaliplatin
      with radiation on rectal cancer. Researchers will also evaluate the tolerability (how it
      makes the patient feel) and safety of this combination by watching for harmful
      side-effects.It is hoped that by adding bevacizumab to the capecitabine/oxaliplatin treatment
      in combination with radiation before surgery will improve response rate.

    <textblock>
      Improved pre-operative therapy is required in the management of high risk rectal cancer in
      order to decrease local recurrence and increase the rate of sphincter sparing surgery.
      Capecitabine, oxaliplatin and bevacizumab represent new systemic agents and have been given
      safely in phase I and II trials concurrently with radiation with promising improvements in
      pCR rates of 15 -24% compared to historic rates of 8-14% achieved with 5-FU alone.
      Improvements in pCR rates have not been associated with an increase in post-operative
      complication rates. A trial of all three of these agents is justified due to their enhanced
      efficacy when given in combination as well as their non-overlapping treatment toxicity
      profile.

      This is a one-armed, multi-centred, Phase II study in patients with T3/4 locally advanced and
      T3/4 low lying rectal cancer, to study the efficacy and safety of the addition of bevacizumab
      to a regimen of capecitabine and oxaliplatin in combination with pre-operative radiation.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the rectum, defined as either:

        Mid- or upper rectal tumours (&gt;= 6 - 15 cm): T3 or T4 adenocarcinoma that is fixed or
        partially fixed or tethered and is potentially resectable; or Low rectal tumours (&lt;6cm): T3
        or T4 adenocarcinoma: or Node positive rectal tumours (&lt;= 15cm): T1-4N2 or T1-4N+ where
        pelvic nodes approach or invade the mesorectum.

        M0/X or M1 is permitted as long as definitive resection of the primary tumour is planned
        and, in the opinion of the investigator, it is safe to delay full dose of systemic
        chemotherapy

          -  Appropriate staging investigations of the primary tumour, either endorectal ultrasound
             or pelvic MRI.

          -  Male or female aged 18 or older.

          -  Have a performance status ECOG of 0 or 1.

          -  Have a life expectancy greater than 6 months.

          -  Adequate organ function and coagulation parameters as measured by:

        ANC &gt;=1.5 platelets &gt;=100 Serum creatinine &lt;= 1.5X ULN AST, ALT &lt;= 2.5X ULN Bilirubin &lt;=
        1.5 ULN PTT and INR within normal limits Albumin &gt;= than 30

          -  Patient consent

          -  No neurological diseases that can increase the neurotoxicity of oxaliplatin

          -  Be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Major surgical procedure, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day -14, (i.e. patients must have recovered from any major surgery), or
             anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during or within 7 weeks after
             chemo-radiotherapy.

          -  Known to have clinical or radiological evidence of CNS metastases.

          -  Patients with a past or current history (within last 2 years) of other malignancies,
             except for the indication under this study and curatively treated basal and squamous
             skin cancer or in-situ cancer of the cervix.

          -  Women of childbearing potential with either a positive or no pregnancy test at
             baseline or lactating. Postmenopausal women must have been amenorrheic for at least 12

             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates use of an investigational drug or puts the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          -  Ongoing treatment with aspirin (&gt; 325 mg/day) or other medications known to predispose
             to gastrointestinal ulceration.
