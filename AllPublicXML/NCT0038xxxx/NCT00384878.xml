    <textblock>
      The primary end point of the study is confirmed objective response rate (complete response
      [CR] and partial response [PR]). A response rate of 80 percent for cetuximab plus cisplatin
      and weekly 24-hour infusion of high-dose 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (P-HDFL) chemotherapy
      is assumed. The Simon two-stage design will be used for P1 - P0 = 0.20. The response rates of
      interest are P0 = 60% and P1 = 80%. The investigators will reject cetuximab plus P-HDFL
      chemotherapy if the response rate is 8/13 at the first stage, and will reject the cetuximab
      plus P-HDFL chemotherapy if the response rate is 25/35 at the second stage. If there are more
      than 8 responses in 13 patients in the first stage, the study will continue to a total of 35
      patients in the second stage. If there are more than 25 responses in 35 patients in the
      second stage, this treatment will be acceptable with a p-value of 0.05 and of 0.20. Evaluable
      patients for response will be those who received at least 4 doses of cetuximab (i.e. one
      cycle of protocol treatment). All enrolled patients will be subjected to toxicity
      evaluations.

      The primary end point of the study is confirmed objective response rates (by RECIST, Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). The secondary end points of the study are
      progression-free survival, overall survival, and treatment-related toxicities.

      The analysis of response to treatment will be restricted to the eligible patients with at
      least one measurable lesion. The safety analysis will be restricted to the patients who
      received at least one cycle of the administered chemotherapy. The time-to-event end points
      will be estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier and based on the intent-to-treat
      principle. Overall survival will be defined as the time interval between the date of study
      entry and the date of death. Progression-free survival will be defined as the time interval
      between the date of study entry and the date of disease progression or death, whichever
      occurred first. Duration of response will be defined as the time interval between the date of
      initial objective response and the date of disease progression, which is only for responders.
      If the event is not yet observed at the time of the last record, the patient will be censored
      at that time point.

      Non-resectable gastric cancer is an incurable disease. Systemic chemotherapy confers
      prolongation of survival and improvement of quality of life. Regimens containing cisplatin
      and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are widely adopted in the world. A P-HDFL regimen, based primarily
      on weekly 24-hour infusion of cisplatin and high-dose 5-FU and leucovorin, is commonly used
      in Taiwan for patients with advanced gastric cancer; the overall response rate is around 60%
      (45%-76%, 95% C.I.), and the patients' compliance is excellent.

      Expression of EGF and EGFR was detected in about 62.1% and 51.5% gastric cancer tissues,
      respectively. Tumors with simultaneous expression of EGF, TGF-alpha, EGFR and p185c-erbB-2
      were associated with a high BrdU labeling index, rapid tumor growth, and an unfavorable
      outcome. Teramoto et al. have shown a dose-dependent growth inhibition of an anti-EGFR
      monoclonal antibody (MoAb 528) on EGFR-overexpressing human gastric cancer cells, both in
      vitro and in vivo. We have recently demonstrated that cetuximab is cytotoxic to human gastric
      cancer cells, and cetuximab has a chemo-sensitizing effect for cisplatin and 5-FU in human
      gastric cancer cells (Yeh et al, unpublished observation). We hypothesize that the
      combination of cetuximab with P-HDFL will further improve the efficacy of the latter on
      advanced gastric cancer.

      This is a multi-center, prospective phase II trial. Patients with histologically proven
      nonresectable or recurrent/metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma, with at least one measurable
      lesion, no prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and adequate baseline organ functions will be
      eligible. Cetuximab (Erbitux; Merck, Germany) 400 mg/m2 will be given as an intravenous (IV)
      infusion, initially (i.e., day 1 of cycle 1); and then followed by weekly IV infusions of
      cetuximab 250 mg/m2 (i.e., days 8, 15, 22 of cycle 1, and days 1, 8, 15, 22 of cycle 2 and
      subsequent 28-day cycles). Cisplatin will be given as a 24-hour continuous IV infusion in a
      dose of 35 mg/m2/day, admixing with 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 and leucovorin (folinic acid) 300 mg/m2,
      day 1 and day 8. A 24-hour continuous IV infusion of 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 and leucovorin 300
      mg/m2 will be given on day 15. The cycles will be repeated every 28 days, and the response
      evaluation will be performed every two cycles and at the end of protocol treatment. Confirmed
      objective response rate by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) will be the
      primary end-point. Using the Simon two-stage design for phase II study (P1 - P0 = 0.20 with
      the response rates of interest being P0 = 60% and P1 = 80%), a total of 35 patients are
      planned to be enrolled in an estimated enrollment period of 12 to 18 months.
