      RATIONALE: The Epstein-Barr virus can cause cancer and lymphoproliferative disorders.
      Valganciclovir is an antiviral drug that acts against the Epstein-Barr virus. Phenylbutyrate
      may make cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus more sensitive to valganciclovir. Giving
      phenylbutyrate together with valganciclovir may block the growth of Epstein-Barr
      virus-infected cells and kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving phenylbutyrate together with
      valganciclovir works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Epstein-Barr
      virus-positive cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic phase activation by BZLF1
           expression in patients with relapsed or refractory, EBV-positive malignancies treated
           with phenylbutyrate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine tumor responses in patients treated with phenylbutyrate followed by
           valganciclovir.

        -  Track serum EBV load by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and correlate changes
           with EBV lytic phase activation/tumor response.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral phenylbutyrate three times daily on days 1-21 and oral valganciclovir
      once or twice daily on days 4-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo biopsy on day 3 of course 1. Serum Epstein-Barr virus DNA is analyzed for
      expression of BZLF1 and LMP2 by quantitative polymerase chain reaction on days 3 and 14 of
      course 1 and on day 1 of each subsequent course.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 and 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14 patients will be accrued for this study.
