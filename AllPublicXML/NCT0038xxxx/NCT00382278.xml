  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a fase I/II clinical study to evaluate feasibility, safety and kinetics of cellular
      therapy with bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (ABMMC) in patients with liver cirrhosis.
      All the patients have moderate liver disfunction and a waiting time expectancy of liver
      transplantation longer than 12 months due their low MELD score. The ABMMC are labeled with
      99mTc and infused through the hepatic artery. Scintigraphy is performed 2 and 24 hours after
      infusion. Patients are submitted to frequent clinical, laboratorial and image evaluation
      during the follow up period of 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A one year clinical trial was conducted. Patients had moderate liver dysfunction and a liver
      transplant was not expected to occur earlier than 12 months, due to low MELD scores.
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatic artery or portal vein thrombosis were excluded by
      color Doppler ultrasonography (DUS) and 3-phase computed tomography (CT). Under local
      anesthesia, 100 mL of bone marrow were aspirated from the posterior iliac crest. ABMMC were
      isolated by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, 10% of the cells were
      labeled with SnCl2-99mTc, and a small fraction was used for cell counting and viability
      analysis. ABMMC were delivered preferentially in the common hepatic artery by celiac trunk
      catheterism. Total body scintigraphy (TBS) was performed 3 hours after infusion. Patients
      were submitted to frequent clinical, biochemical and imaging evaluation during follow up.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Other authors showed the same metabolic effect may be obtained when BMMC are delivered
    peripherally, with lower risk and cost than through hepatic artery.

    <description>Under local anesthesia, 100 mL of bone marrow were aspirated from the posterior iliac crest. ABMMC were isolated by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Hypaque gradient, 10% of the cells were labeled with SnCl2-99mTc, and a small fraction was used for cell counting and viability analysis. At least 100 millions of mononuclear-enriched BMC suspended in 20 mL of saline were delivered preferentially in the common hepatic artery by celiac trunk catheterism.</description>
