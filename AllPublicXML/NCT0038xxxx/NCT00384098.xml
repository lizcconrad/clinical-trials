    <textblock>
      Vitamin D and its analogs are currently widely used for the treatment of psoriasis. The study
      drug (CTA018) is a novel analog of vitamin D, and this Phase 2 study will investigate the
      efficacy and safety of CTA018 in the treatment of psoriasis. Patients with chronic plaque
      psoriasis will receive one of three doses of CTA018 cream or vehicle (no study drug) daily
      for 12 weeks.
