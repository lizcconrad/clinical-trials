  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if emergency room physicians can use bedside
      ultrasound to quickly determine the proper placement of a central venous catheter and to
      evaluate for complications such as a punctured lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheterization (CVC) of the subclavian or internal jugular veins is a common
      procedure performed in the emergency department (ED). This procedure is followed by
      complications in 0.3 to 12% of cases. Pneumothorax (PTX) and catheter-tip misplacement can
      occur. The diagnosis of these complications requires a chest radiograph (CXR). In certain
      cases, CXR may be time-consuming, requiring more than 30 minutes. This could be harmful in
      the case of critically ill patients. Moreover, several investigators have questioned the need
      of routine post-procedural CXR in the absence of clinical complications.

      Recent data has shown that ultrasound can accurately detect PTX in critically ill patients.
      Furthermore, bedside ultrasound is an easy technique to investigate the subclavian and
      internal jugular veins, and can improve the success rate of catheter insertion. Ultrasound
      also allows visualization of central venous catheters in vivo. Ultrasound has been reported
      as a tool to detect catheterization complications and misplacement when performed by ICU
      physicians, but has never been studied in the ED.

      This method could be valuable in hemodynamically unstable patients, who quickly need a CVC
      for the measurement of central venous pressure, immediate fluid resuscitation, and infusion
      of vasoactive medications. Similarly, bedside ultrasound examination could quickly confirm
      PTX and allow immediate chest tube insertion in case of respiratory distress after catheter
      insertion.

      We hypothesize that bedside ultrasound examination performed by ED physicians could
      accurately detect placement of the CVC and the presence or absence of a PTX after
      catheterization of the jugular and subclavian veins.
