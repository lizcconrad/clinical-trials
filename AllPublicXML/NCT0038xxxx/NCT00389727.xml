  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to assess the feasibility of increasing dose of irradiation
      with IMRT using a SIB approach over 6 weeks.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be acute toxicity assessed during treatment and during
      the first 3 months following the completion of radiotherapy The secondary endpoint will
      include loco-regional control, disease-free survival, survival and late toxicity at 2 years
      after completion of radiotherapy

      Loco-regional failures remain a major concern following irradiation of locally advanced head
      and neck cancers. This has led radiation oncologists to investigate novel approaches offering
      better therapeutic indexes. Modification of dose fractionation schedules can improve the
      therapeutic outcome by using accelerated or hyperfractionated regimes [Ang, 1990; Ang, 1998;
      Fu, 2000; Gwozdz, 1997]. Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) technique allows the
      planning and irradiation of different targets at different dose levels in a single treatment
      session, instead of successive treatment plans. With conventional 2D radiotherapy, both
      normal tissues and tumors are irradiated with a similar dose per fraction of 1.8-2 Gy,
      whereas with IMRT dose gradients are introduced in such a manner that normal tissues receive
      a much lower dose per fraction. Isoeffective relationships based on the Linear-Quadratic (LQ)
      model have shown that for a similar total physical (nominal) dose, lowering the dose per
      fraction to below 2 Gy will reduce the biological effect, while increasing the dose per
      fraction to above 2 Gy will increase that effect [Withers, 1988]. As the highly conformal
      dose distribution that is achievable with IMRT makes it possible to envisage an increase in
      physical dose while still maintaining the dose to the OAR at a reasonable level, several
      options could be considered to attain this objective. In simultaneous accelerated radiation
      therapy (SMART) boost technique initially described by Butler, large fractions of 2.4 Gy were
      delivered to the primary Planning Target Volume (PTV) associated with the primary tumor GTV,
      while conventional fractions of 2 Gy were delivered to the secondary PTV associated with the
      regions at risk for microscopic disease up to a total dose of 60 Gy and 50 Gy, respectively
      [Butler, 1999]. The treatment was thus completed in 5 weeks, which corresponded to a moderate
      shortening of treatment time. The term &quot;simultaneous integrated boost&quot; (SIB) was introduced
      later to define such treatment, delivering different doses per fraction in different target
      regions [Mohan, 2000]. The authors proposed either the delivery of the conventional 2 Gy per
      fraction to the primary PTV, allowing a significantly lower dose per fraction to the
      secondary PTV, or the delivery of 2 Gy per fraction to the lower and intermediate dose
      volumes, thereby enabling a higher dose per fraction to be delivered to the primary PTV, with
      as much as 2.4 Gy for gross disease. The latter regimen has the advantage of shortening the
      treatment duration which, further increases the biological dose. The SIB technique offers the
      biological advantage of shortened treatment duration, i.e. 70 Gy over 6 weeks, which has been
      shown to significantly increase the loco-regional control compared to the same dose delivered
      in 7 weeks [Fu, 2000]. With the prescription of a dose per fraction of 2.4 Gy to the primary
      PTV, the physical dose is increased to 72 Gy, which corresponds to a biologically equivalent
      dose of 79.3 Gy (including correction for the overall treatment time [OTT]). Assuming a 37
      value of 2, such an increase in the biological dose of 7.5% could be translated into an
      increase in loco-regional control in the order of 15% [Bentzen, 2002]. The gain resulting
      from an increase in the equivalent dose could be achieved without any further increase in
      late normal tissue complications compared to standard treatment (70 Gy in 2 Gy per fraction).
      Only the normal tissues embedded in the tumor volume and thus included in the PTV would be
      irradiated with a dose per fraction similar to that for the tumor itself. Provided that the
      dose per fraction to the OAR was limited to a maximum of 2 Gy per fraction, this increase in
      dose intensity would be achievable without undue damage to normal tissue. However, the
      concept of increased dose intensity with the SIB technique has to be validated in
      well-designed phase I /II and thereafter phase III trials. In line with this, the Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group has initiated an IMRT phase I/II trial (RTOG H-0022) for oropharyngeal
      carcinomas. In this protocol, a dose of 66 Gy is prescribed for the primary tumor PTV and
      delivered in 30 fractions of 2.2 Gy over 6 weeks; simultaneously, a physical dose of 54 Gy
      (30 fractions of 1.8 Gy) is prescribed for the PTV associated with subclinical disease. The
      main objectives of this protocol are to assess the adequacy of target coverage and salivary
      gland sparing, to determine the rate and pattern of loco-regional recurrence, and to assess
      the nature and the prevalence of acute and late normal tissue toxicity and their relationship
      to the dose distribution. This feasibility study will be carried out to assess clinically the
      SIB approach in moderately advanced carcinomas.
