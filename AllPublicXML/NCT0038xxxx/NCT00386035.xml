      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of two different anti-HIV drug regimens

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is important to consider the role that HIV infected individuals play in ongoing HIV
      transmission. Different anti-HIV treatment regimens may lead to variations in HIV
      transmission risk behavior among HIV infected individuals. HIV infected people with viral
      loads of less than 1,000 copies/ml are less likely to transmit HIV through heterosexual sex.
      However, condom use sometimes decreases after individuals start combination antiretroviral
      therapy (ART); also, some studies have shown an increased rate in acquiring sexually
      transmitted infections (STIs) following initiation of ART, and those on ART may transmit a
      drug-resistant strain of HIV. In the SMART study, participants were randomly assigned to one
      of two treatment groups:

        -  Group 1 participants will follow a drug conservation (DC) regimen in which ART will be
           stopped or deferred until CD4 cell count drops below 250 cells/mm3, will be initiated
           until CD4 cell count is at least 350 cells/mm3, and then will be followed by episodic
           ART based on CD4 cell count.

        -  Group 2 participants will follow a viral suppression (VS) regimen in which ART is
           continued to keep viral loads as low as possible, regardless of CD4 cell count.

      The purpose of this study is to compare how the DC and VS regimens affect HIV transmission
      risk behavior among SMART study participants.

      At baseline, participants will complete a questionnaire about their sexual behavior during
      the previous 2 months. They will also undergo urine and blood collection for STI testing.
      These same procedures will occur at Months 4 and 12, then every year thereafter for the first
      4 years that a participant is in the parent study. Participants and their physicians will be
      notified of STI testing results so that patients can be referred to appropriate care.
