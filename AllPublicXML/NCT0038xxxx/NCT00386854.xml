  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects of
      eccentric endurance exercise and to compare them with those of concentric exercise in healthy
      sedentary individuals.

  <detailed_description>

      Physical exercise decreases the risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular
      disease. Skeletal muscle can be exercised by two ways: Concentric contraction is defined as
      active shortening of muscles, e.g. by stepping upwards, whereas eccentric muscle contraction
      is defined as active resistance to stretching, e.g. by stepping downwards. Although the
      effects of exercise (i.e. the combination of concentric and eccentric muscle contraction) on
      metabolic parameters have been extensively investigated, there are no data on the specific
      metabolic effects of concentric versus those of eccentric muscle work in humans.

      Comparison(s): Metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects of eccentric endurance exercise (i.e.
      stepping upwards), compared to metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects of concentric exercise
      (i.e. stepping downwards).
