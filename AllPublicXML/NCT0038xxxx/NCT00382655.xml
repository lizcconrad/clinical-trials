  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to prevent injuries and diseases among older adults through the
      development and evaluation of a novel emergency medical services (EMS)-based screening
      program to identify preventable injuries and diseases and refer the identified injuries and
      diseases for intervention.

      To prevent injuries and diseases among older adults, this study specifically aims to:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility of an EMS-based primary prevention program that screens older
           adults for need of the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine and for risk of falling during
           emergency medical responses in a rural setting;

        2. Evaluate the outcome of the EMT-implemented screening and education program by
           performing a 14-day telephone follow-up on older adults cared for by EMTs.

      At the conclusion of this award, we will determine if an EMT-implemented primary prevention
      program for older adults is feasible and benefits the community.
