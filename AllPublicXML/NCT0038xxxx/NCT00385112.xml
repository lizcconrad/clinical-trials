  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the Medtronic Freestyle porcine valve is
      effective over a long period of time when it is used to replace the valve that normally
      allows blood to flow from the right lower pumping chamber of the heart to the lungs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the time between June 1998 and June 2006, the Medtronic Freestyle® porcine aortic root
      (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was used for reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow
      tract in children that underwent surgery at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. These children
      were born with heart problems that made it difficult for blood to flow from the lower right
      chamber of the heart to the lungs where it would normally pick up oxygen to be used by the
      body. Consequently, these children required surgery to repair the valve and eliminate this
      restriction of blood flow to the lungs in order to preserve life. In this case, the Freestyle
      valve was used. It is a relatively new valve and it is not known how it functions and how it
      impacts overall heart function over a long period of time. We are requesting permission to
      recruit volunteers that have received the Freestyle valve for this purpose in order to
      determine its long term performance. Specifically, we are seeking volunteers that are willing
      to have an echocardiogram performed. It is through the evaluation of a recent echocardiogram,
      as it compares to previous echocardiograms performed on the same patient, that the usefulness
      of the Freestyle valve will be evaluated for its durability and its long term impact on heart
      function.

          -  Patients that have received the Medtronic Freestyle® porcine aortic root for right
             ventricular outflow tract reconstruction whose most recent echocardiogram is not
             useful for evaluating the study points despite the fact that it may have been
             performed within the last 12 months.
