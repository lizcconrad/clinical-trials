      The purpose of this study is to design, implement, and evaluate a recreation site-based
      obesity prevention &amp; control intervention for 7-9 year old children and their families by
      targeting physical activity and dietary behaviors.

      The primary aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention to prevent the
      onset of overweight and obesity in 7-9 year old children. The recreation center site
      intervention emphasizes changes in quantity and quality of physical activity and
      nutrition-related offerings within the centers. The home site intervention targets the home
      environment and household rule setting delivered via Family Health Coaches and tailored to
      the needs of the family. Five hundred forty one (541) families were recruited to participate
      in this project. Participants were selected in part based on residence in proximity to
      participating recreation centers. Eighteen (18) families living up to 3 miles from each of
      the 30 recreation centers involved in the project were be recruited to participate. For each
      family, one child was recruited between the ages of 5 and 8 years old and this child's
      primary caregiver was enrolled in the study. The study's primary outcome is Body Mass Index
      (kg/m2).

    <description>The two year intervention involves changing the environment and policies in community recreation centers to promote physical activity and healthy eating choices. The Recreation Specialist will meet with recreation center staff monthly to create action plans that work towards this goal. Family Health Coaches will be in contact with intervention families twice a month either through a phone consultation, workshop at the recreation center,or home visit. Intervention families will receive a monthly mailing highlighting tips for healthy eating and physical activity. MOVE families will be encouraged to utilize the recreation center as a resource in supporting their child's physical activity and healthy eating behaviors.</description>
