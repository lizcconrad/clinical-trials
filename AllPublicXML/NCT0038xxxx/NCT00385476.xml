      The goal of the study is to learn about patients' knowledge of their medications in an
      outpatient acute care setting (such as the M. D. Anderson Emergency Center) and to learn
      about any clinical factors that affect patients' knowledge of their medications.

      You will be asked to list your prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, herbal
      preparations and vitamins, minerals and supplements that you take. Information about you
      (such as age or gender), the status of the disease (such as cancer diagnosis and extent of
      disease), and your Emergency Center visit (such as your reason for visit and discharge
      diagnosis) will be collected from your medical record.

      To find out if your answers on the questionnaire are correct regarding the medications you
      take, researchers will check the pharmacy database for medications you fill at the M. D.
      Anderson pharmacy, your medical record, and contact any outside pharmacy that you may use to
      fill your medicines, with your permission. In order for outside pharmacies to release the
      requested medication information, you will need to sign an Authorization for Disclosure of
      Health Information from Pharmacy Records.

      Your information will be kept confidential. All patient data will be reported and published
      as a group. You will not be individually identified. Data will be stored with patient codes
      so that your identity will be protected. In addition, the study database will be password
      protected.

      You may be contacted in the future for more information; however, you are not obligated to
      answer any future questions just because you agreed to participate in this study.

      This is an investigational study. About 350 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients admitted to the Emergency Center

          2. Patients must be able to read and write English

          3. Patients must agree to participate and sign informed consent

          4. Patients 16 years or above. (Age limit explained below)

          5. Patients must be able to complete the survey tool. They may have help from a caregiver
             in transcribing the information but the caregiver can not fill the tool independent of
             the patient. A research assistant will be trained to discriminate whether a caregiver
             is acting as a scriber or independently completing the tool. If the caregiver
             completes the tool independently, the patient will be excluded from the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with altered mental status and those with an acute, emergent illness and
             hemodynamic instability (Examples: status epileptics, sepsis, and cardiac arrest)

          2. Employees of the institution with work-related injuries

          3. Visitors who are non-cancer patients

          4. Patients transferred directly from another hospital

          5. Patients will be excluded after their first enrollment during the study period. (Can
             only be enrolled once though may have multiple Emergency Center visits during study
             time frame).

          6. Patients will be excluded if all prescribed medications are filled at an external
             pharmacy and this pharmacy is not accessible.
