      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving bortezomib together with
      dexamethasone may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib together with
      dexamethasone works in treating patients with multiple myeloma that has relapsed or has not
      responded to treatment.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the overall response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients
           with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma treated with induction therapy and
           maintenance therapy comprising bortezomib and dexamethasone.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Patients also
           receive oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12. Treatment repeats every
           21 days for 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) receive an additional
           2 courses of induction therapy and proceed to maintenance therapy.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients
           also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, 16, 22, and 23. Treatment
           repeats every 36 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           Patients who achieve CR receive an additional 2 courses of maintenance therapy beyond
           documentation of CR.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
