  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy (and safety) of antiviral therapy in
      patients with chronic hepatitis C after liver transplantation. The only approved drugs for
      treatment of hepatitis C are pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

      Hepatitis C recurrence after liver transplantation remains the main cause of graft loss after
      liver transplantation. Several strategies can be used to prevent or treat hepatitis C in the
      setting of liver transplantation. There are no controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of antiviral treatment (using pegylated interferon and ribavirin) in liver transplant
      recipients. The main endpoint of this study was: 1) histological outcomes (effect of
      antiviral treatment on disease progression, i.e. liver fibrosis). The secondary endpoint were
      1) Sustained virological response (persistent HCV-RNA clearance) and 2) Safety of pegylated
      interferon and ribavirin
