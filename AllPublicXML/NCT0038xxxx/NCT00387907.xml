  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of
      experimental drug (larotaxel) when combined with Herceptin速 in patients with advanced breast
      cancer. Anti-tumor activity will be determined by looking at changes in tumor size on CT or
      MRI scans. Additional goals of this study are to look at patient safety, to determine how
      long the study drugs (larotaxel and Herceptin速) stay in the patient's body and what effects
      the study medications may have on each other, and to find out how long patients remain cancer
      free on this study treatment.
