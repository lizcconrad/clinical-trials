      This phase II trial studies how well sunitinib malate works in treating patients with thyroid
      cancer that did not respond to iodine I 131 (radioactive iodine) and cannot be removed by
      surgery. Sunitinib malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate of single agent sunitinib (sunitinib malate) in patients with
      iodine refractory, unresectable well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) who have evidence
      of disease progression within 6 months of study enrollment.

      II. Determine the response rate of single agent sunitinib in patients with medullary thyroid
      cancer (MTC) who have evidence of disease progression within 6 months of study enrollment.

      III. Determine the toxicity, duration of response, progression free survival, and overall
      survival in patients with WDTC or MTC treated with single agent sunitinib.

      IV. Determine whether the presence of ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene rearrangements in
      patients with WDTC or RET mutations in patients with MTC predict response to sunitinib.

      V. Determine whether therapy with sunitinib affects phosphorylation of downstream RET
      effector, mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (ERK), in WDTC and MTC tissue.

      VI. Determine whether specific germ-line polymorphisms in the RET gene are associated with
      favorable outcome in patients with WDTC treated with sunitinib.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 cohorts according to type of thyroid cancer
      (medullary vs well-differentiated).

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years.

    <description>Relevant laboratory correlates will be compared between responders and non-responders using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The association between the presence or absence of RET gene rearrangements/mutations and tumor response, as well as the association between germ-line polymorphisms in the RET gene and response, will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test. The correlative and genetic data will also be entered as covariates (univariate analyses only due to the small sample size) in a Cox regression model of progression-free survival.</description>

        <description>Relevant laboratory correlates will be compared between responders and non-responders using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. The association between the presence or absence of RET gene rearrangements/mutations and tumor response, as well as the association between germ-line polymorphisms in the RET gene and response, will be analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. The correlative and genetic data will also be entered as covariates (univariate analyses only due to the small sample size) in a Cox regression model of progression-free survival.</description>
