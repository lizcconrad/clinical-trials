      RATIONALE: Escitalopram may help improve depression and quality of life in patients with
      advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer. It is not yet known whether escitalopram is more
      effective than a placebo in treating depression in patients with advanced lung or
      gastrointestinal cancer.

      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of escitalopram and to
      see how well it works compared to a placebo in treating depression in patients with advanced
      lung or gastrointestinal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of escitalopram oxalate vs placebo in treating major depressive
           disorder in patients with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer.

        -  Compare the side effect burden of escitalopram oxalate vs placebo in these patients.

        -  Determine potential moderators of the efficacy of escitalopram oxalate in these
           patients, including medical, psychological, and social variables.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to stage of disease (stage IIIB with effusions vs stage IV) and current
      treatment (radiation vs chemotherapy vs novel agent). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks followed by oral placebo
           once daily for another 4 weeks

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks followed by escitalopram
           oxalate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral escitalopram oxalate 10 mg once daily for 4 weeks
           followed by oral placebo once daily for 4 weeks.

      After 8 weeks, all non-responders are offered open treatment with an antidepressant.

      Depression, fatigue, quality of life, anxiety, and somatization are assessed at baseline and
      then at 4 and 8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients will be accrued for this study.

    <measure>Depression Response Rate of Escitalopram Oxalate 10 mg Once Daily Compared to Placebo Once Daily for Major Depressive Disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Response rate was defined as a 50% reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores over 4 weeks. The HAM-D can have total scores that range from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating greater depression. Scores over 14 are considered to be in the depressed range.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in HAM-D scores was calculated by subtracting the score at 4 weeks from the score at baseline. The HAM-D can have total scores that range from 0 to 50, with higher scores indicating greater depression. Scores over 14 are considered to be in the depressed range.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Side Effect Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Side efect burden was defined as the total score of the UKU Side Effects Rating Scale. This scale contains 48 items corresponding to side effects which are rated from 0-3, with 0 meaning not present and 1-3 rating the severity of the side effect. Higher scores represented greater side effect burden. The scale range is 0 to 144.</description>
