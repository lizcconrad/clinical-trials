  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treating acute ischemic stroke
      with mechanical embolectomy using the Merci Retriever or the Penumbra System within 8 hours
      of symptom onset to standard medical treatment, and to identify people who might benefit from
      mechanical embolectomy by the appearance of stroke on multimodal computerized tomography (CT)
      or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke most commonly occurs when there is a blockage of blood flow to one of the arteries in
      the brain. The blockage is often caused by a clot. There is currently only one FDA-approved
      stroke treatment. However, only 2 percent of ischemic stroke patients receive this treatment
      because it must be given within 4.5 hours of the stroke onset. There is an overwhelming need
      for new treatments that extend the time window to treatment since most individuals with
      stroke arrive at the hospital after the 4.5-hour time window.

      Two of the most promising new devices are the Merci Retriever, a tiny corkscrew device, and
      the Penumbra System, an aspiration device. Both are designed to remove clots from arteries
      and thereby restore blood flow to the brain.

      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of treatment with the Merci
      Retriever or Penumbra System within 8 hours of symptom onset to standard medical treatment,
      and to identify people who might benefit from the devices by the appearance of the stroke on
      multimodal computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous testing
      has determined that the use of the Merci Retriever is successful in opening up blocked blood
      vessels in approximately ½ of the individuals in whom it is used, and the Penumbra System is
      successful in opening up blocked blood vessels in approximately 80% of the individuals in
      whom it is used.

      A total of 120 participants from approximately 30 different medical centers will be enrolled
      into this study. Participants will be randomized to either receive treatment by mechanical
      embolectomy with the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System and standard medical care or
      treatment with standard medical care alone. Standard care for stroke patients may include
      intravenous fluid, careful regulation of blood pressure, blood-thinning medicine (such as
      heparin or warfarin), anti-platelet medicine (such as aspirin or clopidogrel), and
      rehabilitation therapies.

      Participants undergoing the Merci Retriever or Penumbra System procedure will have a cerebral
      arteriogram with pictures taken with dye prior to the procedure to determine the location of
      the blockage, and following the procedure to determine if blood supply has been restored. The
      total mechanical embolectomy procedure with either device will take approximately 1 to 2
      hours. Participants will have brief neurological exams several times during this time to
      monitor changes in their neurological condition.

      Participants will have follow-up visits, including neurological exams, at 30 days and at 90
      days.

      This study is part of the Specialized Program of Translational Research in Acute Stroke
      (SPOTRIAS), which allows researchers to enhance and initiate translational research that
      ultimately will benefit stroke patients by treating more patients in less than 2 hours, and
      finding ways to treat additional patients later.

    <time_frame>at 90 days post-stroke</time_frame>
    <description>Scale name is provided (Modified Rankin Scale) which is a standard measure of functional neurologic outcome in stroke. The scale runs from 0-6, running from perfect health without symptoms to death.
0 - No symptoms.
1 - No significant disability. Able to carry out all usual activities, despite some symptoms.
2 - Slight disability. Able to look after own affairs without assistance, but unable to carry out all previous activities.
3 - Moderate disability. Requires some help, but able to walk unassisted.
4 - Moderately severe disability. Unable to attend to own bodily needs without assistance, and unable to walk unassisted.
5 - Severe disability. Requires constant nursing care and attention, bedridden, incontinent.
6 - Dead.</description>

    <measure>Symptomatic Hemorrhagic Transformation</measure>
    <time_frame>from baseline to day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is defined as 4 point neurologic worsening on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score associated with parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH-2*), remote intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage on imaging. The NIHSS is a scale measuring specific neurologic deficits caused by a stroke with scores ranging from 0 to 42, and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits.

    <description>The MERCI (Mechanical Embolus Removal in Cerebral Ischemia) Retriever consists of a flexible, nickel titanium (nitinol) wire with a helical-shaped distal tip. The helical distal tip is covered with a platinum radiopaque coil, which facilitates fluoroscopic visualization. The body of the MERCI Retriever is covered with a hydrophilic coating that helps facilitate device placement. The MERCI Retriever is available in 6 configurations (Merci Retrievers X6, L5, L4, L6, V series, DAC).
The Penumbra System uses a reperfusion catheter in parallel with a separator component and an aspiration source to achieve separation of the thrombus and subsequent aspiration of the occlusion from the vessel. The system is available in different sizes according to the target vessels (041 Reperfusion Catheter/Separator pair for use in vessels larger than 3mm, notably the ICA and M1; 032 Reperfusion Catheter/Separator pair for use in vessels 2mm - 3mm, notably the M2).</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>From 2004 to 2011, participants were enrolled at 22 sites with expertise in acute stroke care, imaging and interventional neuroradiological procedures. Eligible patients presenting within 8 hours of symptom onset were enrolled. The study website generated a randomized treatment assignment using a penumbral pattern code based on brain imaging.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Randomization was stratified by favorable penumbral or non-penumbral pattern based on on-site analysis of baseline multimodal MRI or multimodal CT. While 127 subjects were enrolled, only 118 of these subjects qualified for the primary analysis per discussion with the DSMB as 9 subjects enrolled did not actually meet full eligibility criteria.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Embolectomy patients were treated up to 8 hours from symptom onset with any combination of FDA-cleared embolectomy devices, including the Merci Retriever since trial initiation in 2004 and Penumbra System since 2009. A favorable penumbral pattern was defined as a predicted infarct core of 90 ml or less and a proportion of predicted infarct tissue within the at-risk region of 70% or less.
Intra-arterial tPA up to 14 milligrams was allowed as rescue therapy within 6 hours of onset.</description>

        <description>Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is defined as 4 point neurologic worsening on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score associated with parenchymal hematoma type 2 (PH-2*), remote intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or intraventricular hemorrhage on imaging. The NIHSS is a scale measuring specific neurologic deficits caused by a stroke with scores ranging from 0 to 42, and higher scores indicating more severe neurologic deficits.
