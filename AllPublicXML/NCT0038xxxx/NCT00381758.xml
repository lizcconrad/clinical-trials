    <textblock>
      This study was designed to compare Concerta Extended Release tablets with Metadate CD
      capsules in children with ADHD who were between 6 and 12 years old. The effects on ADHD
      symptoms, and any side effects of treatment, were measured for 12 hours after dosing in a
      simulated classroom. The treatments were blinded and the effects were compared with a
      Placebo.
