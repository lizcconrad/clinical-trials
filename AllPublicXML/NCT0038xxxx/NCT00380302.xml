      Primary: This study is being conducted to evaluate if AVE1625 is safe and tolerated in
      patients with Alzheimer's disease that is not too severe. There is also evaluation of whether
      patients who take the study medication improve compared to patients who take a placebo (sugar
      pill).

      Secondary:The study will also evaluate the blood levels of the study medication, AVE1625 in
