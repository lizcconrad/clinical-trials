      Primary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of Zevalin for the treatment of low-grade follicular
           Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the orbit or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) of
           conjunctiva using radiographic imaging, clinical examination (slit lamp biomicroscopy
           and external examination of the conjunctiva), and external photography whenever
           possible.

        2. To establish the safety profile in this patient population using clinical examination
           including slit lamp biomicroscopy, and evaluation of the tear film with Schirmer's test.

        3. To establish the dosimetry for Zevalin in the orbit in the first 3 patients who agree to
           undergo dosimetry.

      Rituximab and Zevalin are monoclonal antibodies that bind to lymphoma cells and cause cell
      death.

      As is the case for all patients with orbital lymphoma, an orbital biopsy must be performed to
      confirm the diagnosis and status of the orbital lymphoma. The study doctors must first make
      sure that the disease has not spread too much and is not severe enough to require immediate
      treatment with chemotherapy before you can begin treatment on this study. You will have about
      4 teaspoons of blood drawn. Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood or
      urine pregnancy test.

      You will receive two injections of rituximab by vein over about 4 to 6 hours. This is
      followed by an infusion of Zevalin over about 30 minutes on the same day. Whole body images
      will be performed immediately and at 4-6, 24, 72, and 144 hours after receiving Zevalin.
      About 1 week later, you will receive a second infusion of rituximab and Zevalin.

      You may be taken off the study if your orbital lymphoma does not respond within three months
      of receiving rituximab and Zevalin. Researchers will measure your response to therapy using
      magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit and an evaluation of the eye in the clinic. If
      you are taken off study, you will be given the option of receiving external beam radiation
      therapy as treatment for the disease.

      Follow-up evaluations will be done every 3 months for 2 years and every 6 months for Years 3
      and 4. This testing is considered standard of care and would include medical history,
      physical exam, blood tests, and urine tests. The status of the disease will be evaluated
      using CT scan or MRI of the orbit every 3 months for the first year and every 6 months for
      Years 2, 3, and 4. Blood tests (about 4 teaspoons each) will be every 3 months for the first
      year and may be continues every 3 to 6 month until they become negative or you start another
      anti-cancer therapy.

      This is an investigational study. Zevalin and rituximab are both FDA approved but their use
      together in this study is investigational. A total of up to 12 patients will take part in
      this study. All will be enrolled at The University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson Cancer Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Biopsy-proven diagnosis of low-grade Non-Hodgkin's follicular lymphoma of the orbit or
             MALT of the conjunctiva/orbit. The orbit/conjunctiva has to be the primary or
             predominant site of involvement or if there is a previous history of systemic
             involvement, the orbit/conjunctiva should be the only site of new recurrence.

          2. No anti-cancer therapy for three weeks (six weeks if Rituximab, nitrosourea or
             Mitomycin C) prior to study initiation, and fully recovered from all toxicities
             associated with prior surgery, radiation treatments, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy

          3. An Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved signed informed consent

          4. Age &gt;18 years. This is justified since low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the orbit
             is extremely rare to non-existent in the pediatric population

             lymphoma (IWFA) c) Platelet counts&gt; 150,000/mm3, these patients will receive a dose of
             0.4 mCi/kg of Zevalin d) Platelet counts from 100,00/mm3 to 149,000/mm3, these
             patients will receive a 0.3mCi/kg dose of Zevalin

          8. Female patients who are not pregnant or lactating

          9. Men and women of reproductive potential who are following accepted birth control
             methods (as determined by the treating physician, however abstinence is not an
             acceptable method)

         10. Patients previously on Phase II drugs are eligible if no long-term toxicity is
             expected, and the patient has been off the drug for eight or more weeks with no
             significant post treatment toxicities observed

         11. Patients determined to have less than 25% bone marrow involvement with lymphoma within
             six weeks of registration (based on a bone marrow biopsy). (This criteria must be
             strictly met for adequate patient safety.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with impaired bone marrow reserve, as indicated by one or more of the
             following: a) Prior myeloablative therapies with autologous bone marrow
             transplantation (ABMT) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) rescue b) Platelet count &lt;
             than 100,000 cells/mm3 c) Hypocellular bone marrow (less than 15% cellularity) d)
             Marked reduction in bone marrow precursors of one or more cell lines (granulocytic,
             megakaryocytic, erythroid)

          2. Prior radioimmunotherapy

          3. Presence of central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma

          4. Patients with HIV or AIDS-related lymphoma

          9. Patients who have received prior external beam radiation therapy to &gt; 25% of active
             bone marrow (involved field or regional)

         10. Patients who have received Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or GM-CSF)
             therapy within two weeks prior to treatment

         11. Serious nonmalignant disease or infection which, in the opinion of the investigator
             and/or the sponsor, would compromise other protocol objectives

         12. Major surgery, other than diagnostic surgery, within four weeks

          <title>Number of Participants With Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR)</title>
          <description>Tumor response to therapy measured by tumor size as measured radiographically at baseline and at three months from baseline. Tumor response classified as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD) using International Workshop Standardized Response Criteria (IWC) for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphomas. If the orbital/ocular adnexal lymphoma was not evaluable radiographically, clinical evaluation using slit lamp biomicroscopy was used to assess PR or CR.</description>
