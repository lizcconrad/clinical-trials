      The Trial aims to evaluate long-term efficiency of Excel stent in the inhibition of
      restenosis as well as the safety after the cessation of the 6-month anti-platelet drug
      treatment.

      30-day, 6-month, and 12-month clinical follow-up and 6 to 9-month IVUS or SCA follow-up to
      measure long-term efficiency of Excel stent in the inhibition of restenosis as well as the
      safety after the cessation of the 6-month anti-platelet drug treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who should fulfill with criteria of implanting Excel stents.

          -  Each patient enrolled is only allowed to implant Excel stents.

          -  Each patient are not allowed to be implanted more than 6 Excel stents.Also, 3
             over-lapped stents are not allowed to be implanted in the same vessel(3-5mm
             overlapping needed; length of stents totally are not allowed to be over 80mm; fully
             post-dilated is essential for overlapping).

          -  Patients acknowlegement to the trial is essential.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  AMI withine 1 week.

          -  Patients who do not suitable to Excel stenting.(For example, non-tolerant to
             anti-platelet drug or cardiac/non-cardiac surgery undergoing recently.)

          -  Patients who have multiple branch lesions can not apply single Excel stenting.

          -  Patients who refuse to sign the Trial Acknowledgement.

          -  Patients with intra-stent restenosis.
