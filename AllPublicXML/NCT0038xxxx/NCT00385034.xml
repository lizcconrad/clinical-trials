  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tested the effectiveness of computer-assisted screening for identifying patients
      at risk of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a Canadian family practice. It was hypothesized
      that the use of computer-assisted screening among female patients would lead to higher rates
      of IPV discussion-opportunity and IPV detection during medical consultations, compared to
      patients receiving standard medical care.
