      The purpose of this study is to describe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalization
      rates and to begin to address the utilization of outpatient resources for RSV
      medically-attended lower respiratory tract infections (MALRI) in 32-35 week gestational age
      (GA) premature infants who are less than 6 months of age and do not receive treatment.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To estimate the incidence of hospitalization attributable to RSV within 150 days from
           enrollment in premature infants who are:

             -  32-35 weeks GA

             -  less than 6 months of age at the start of the RSV season

             -  not receiving palivizumab prophylaxis and not recommended to receive palivizumab
                according to the AAP guidelines

        -  To estimate the incidence rate of hospitalization attributable to RSV in the other
           relevant study populations and time periods (e.g., Cohort 2, Cohorts 1 and 2 combined,
           and subgroups based on chronological age at the start of the RSV season, GA, etc. within
           150 days from enrollment and other time periods based on RSV activity, etc.)

        -  To estimate the incidence of RSV-associated MALRI in the study populations

        -  To characterize the incidence and type of clinical interventions for MALRI in the study
           populations
