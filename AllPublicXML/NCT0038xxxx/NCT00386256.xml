  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a home exercise program for patients 60 years of age
      and over who are deconditioned following their discharge from the hospital, or recruited from
      GLA outpatient clinics. The program will be designed to monitor and improve patients'
      exercise behavior through the use of home technology, such as text messaging monitors.

      The aim of this study is to develop and determine the feasibility of implementing a home
      exercise and functional status monitoring telerehabilitation program, known as TEL-REHAB, for
      older adults 60 years of age and over who are deconditioned following their discharge from
      the inpatient setting, or recruited from GLA outpatient clinics. Deconditioning is a
      modifiable risk factor for preventing institutionalization of frail elderly patients who
      would otherwise be able to live independently. Home exercise programs are an effective
      intervention to reduce the risk, but patient compliance with home exercise programs, and
      assessments of patients during home exercise programs, are barriers to achieving maximal
      benefits. Face-to-face visits with physical medicine professionals are an effective means to
      perform these functions, but are problematic because of professional time impacts and patient
      transportation problems. A TEL-REHAB program will empower these patients to take
      responsibility for their own health by providing ongoing communication with a healthcare
      provider. In this way, telerehabilitation may assist older adults to remain independent in
      their homes as long as possible.

    <measure>Exercise Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>at monthly intervals, for 3-months</time_frame>
    <description>An 11-week exercise adherence rate was calculated by dividing the total number of days that the participant reported exercising by 77 days and multiplying by 100. This first calculation estimated the exercise adherence rate for the full intervention period regardless of participant dropout. Eleven weeks rather than 12 weeks was used in the denominator because subjects received their HB units some time during the first week of study enrollment and may have missed some days during this first week.</description>

    <description>An 11-week text messaging or phone adherence rate was calculated by dividing the number of response days via the HB or phone divided by 77 days and multiplied by 100. This first calculation estimated the text messaging or phone adherence rate for the full intervention period regardless of participant dropout. Eleven weeks rather than 12 weeks was used in the denominator because subjects received their HB units some time during the first week of study enrollment and may have missed some days during this first week.</description>

        <title>Exercise Adherence</title>
        <description>An 11-week exercise adherence rate was calculated by dividing the total number of days that the participant reported exercising by 77 days and multiplying by 100. This first calculation estimated the exercise adherence rate for the full intervention period regardless of participant dropout. Eleven weeks rather than 12 weeks was used in the denominator because subjects received their HB units some time during the first week of study enrollment and may have missed some days during this first week.</description>
