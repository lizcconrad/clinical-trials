    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of siltuximab administered in
      combination with mitoxantrone and prednisone in participants with metastatic (spread of
      cancer cells from one part of the body to another) hormone-refractory (not responding to
      treatment) prostate cancer (abnormal tissue that grows and spreads in the body) (HRPC).

      This is a 2-part, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) multicenter
      (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), Phase 2
      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of siltuximab plus mitoxantrone
      versus mitoxantrone in participants with metastatic HRPC who have received 1 prior
      Docetaxel-based chemotherapy (treatment of disease, usually cancer, by chemical agents)
      regimen (pattern of giving treatment). Part 1 of the study is single arm where participants
      will receive mitoxantrone, prednisone and siltuximab. Part 2 of the study is randomized
      portion (the study drug is assigned by chance), consisting of 2-arms. The experimental arm
      will consist of treatment with mitoxantrone, prednisone and siltuximab. The control arm will
      consist of treatment with mitoxantrone and prednisone. Mitoxantrone will be administered at a
      dose of 12 milligram per square meter (mg/m^2) intravenously (into a vein) as a 30-minute
      infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) on Day 1 of each
      3-week cycle, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (any harmful effect of a
      drug) or up to 10 cycles (a maximum total dose of approximately 120 mg/m^2). Siltuximab will
      be administered at a dose of 6 mg/kilogram intravenously as a 2-hour infusion, starting Day 1
      of Cycle 1 to continue every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or up
      to a maximum of 1 year. All participants will receive prednisone 5 mg twice daily starting
      with the first administration of Mitoxantrone. The duration of treatment will be a maximum of
      12 months for cumulative dose. Radiologic assessments will be performed on Week 12 after the
      first study agent dosing, then every 9 weeks until the end of treatment and then once every 3
      months until documented disease progression. Tumor (a mass in a specific area) response will
      be assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. There will
      be short-term follow-up visits (conducted monthly for 2 months), followed by long-term
      follow-up visits (conducted once every 3 months). Participants' safety will also be monitored
      throughout the study.

    <time_frame>Baseline up to 12 weeks after last dose administration</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. An SAE is any AE that results in: death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, is life-threatening experience, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect and may jeopardize participant and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization, Week 12, then every 9 weeks until 1 month after last dose administration, then every 3 months until disease progression or death, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS is the time from the date of randomization until the first documented sign of progression (at least a 20 percent increase in the sum of the longest diameter [LD] of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new target or non-target lesions as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] or 3 or more new skeletal lesions on bone scan with confirmation of second bone scan or with clinical deterioration) or death, whichever occurs first.</description>

    <description>The TtCD is defined as the time from the start of treatment (for participants in Part 1) or randomization (for participants in Part 2) until the first documented clinical deterioration (consists of pain requiring palliative (intended to relieve pain) intervention (a treatment given during the course of a research study), or death due to any cause, whichever occurs earlier.</description>

    <description>Palliative response was defined as a 2-point or greater reduction from baseline pain, without a categorical increase in prescribed disease-related analgesic (drug used to control pain) use or at least a categorical decrease in disease-related analgesic use without a concomitant (given at the same time) increase in pain. Each component required confirmation at least 3 weeks later.</description>
