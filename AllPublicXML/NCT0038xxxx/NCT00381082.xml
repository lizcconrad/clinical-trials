      Objective

      To compare the cure rates (defined as the complete absence of live lice, adults or nymphs, as
      diagnosed by wet-combing of three Australian approved head lice products for the treatment of
      primary school children with head lice infestation. The study design will be randomised and
      assessor-blind using three comparative parallel treatment groups.

      The study population will consist of Queensland state primary school children (up to Year 7)
      with live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp who have not used any head lice
      product in the four weeks prior to the study.

      All products were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. KP24 and Banlice were
      applied twice separated by a one week interval. MOOV Head Lice Treatment was applied on Day
      0, Day 7 and Day 14. The cure rate (absence of live lice) one day after the first
      administration for all products was a secondary outcome measure. The cure rate at 7 days
      after the final administration (Day 14 for Banlice or KP24 and at Day 21 for MOOV Head Lice
      Treatment) was the primary outcome measure. Siblings were treated if these were found to be
      infected as an enrolment criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female primary school children.

          -  Presence of live head lice (adults or nymphs) on the hair or scalp. The presence of
             live lice will be determined from a visual inspection of the hair and scalp and
             Dry-combing of the hair. Combing will stop immediately once live lice are observed.
             The presence of lice eggs alone is not a sufficient condition for inclusion in the
             trial.

          -  Be available for the duration of the trial.

          -  Parent / Guardian is willing not to use other head lice products or methods (e.g.
             combs) to treat their child’s head lice for 21 days after the first treatment.

          -  Parent / Guardian has given written informed consent to their child’s participation in
             the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of allergies or adverse reactions to head lice products or the components of
             the specific products being tested.

          -  Treatment with any head lice product in the month prior to Day 0.

          -  Presence of scalp disease(s).

          -  If a subject has a sibling in Grade 1-7 this sibling must also be enrolled in the
             study and treated on Day 0 otherwise the subject must be considered ineligible for
             enrolment.

          -  Subjects must have one fixed place of residence
