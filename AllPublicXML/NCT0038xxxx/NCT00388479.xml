  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major abdominal surgery are at highest risk for developing postoperative
      ileus (POI), occurring in nearly all cases. Signs and symptoms of POI may include abdominal
      distention and bloating, persistent abdominal pain; nausea and/or vomiting; delayed passage
      or inability to pass flatus or stool; and inability to tolerate a solid diet. This study will
      test the ability of alvimopan 6 mg or 12 mg given 2 hours before the scheduled start of
      surgery to hasten the recovery of GI function in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery
      (bowel resection or abdominal hysterectomy).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a temporary slowing down or stopping of bowel function and a
      slowing down of movement of contents of the intestines. This functional impairment persists
      for a variable duration following surgery, usually resolving within 1 day in the small
      intestine, 1 to 3 days in the stomach and 3 to 5 days in the colon. When POI persists for
      more than 5 days, it is generally considered severe, sometimes referred to as complicated or
      prolonged POI, and increases the risk for related morbidity. No drug therapy has been shown
      to consistently shorten the duration of POI. This study is designed to demonstrate that
      alvimopan, a novel, peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonist, accelerates the
      recovery of GI function in patients undergoing bowel resection or hysterectomy.
