  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the best treatment sequence and combination of
      acupuncture points for the treatment of phantom limb or residual limb pain in the
      traumatic/surgical amputee.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to identify the optimum combination of acupuncture points
      and treatment sequence in the treatment of post amputation limb pain in terms of the change
      in Phantom Limb Pain (PLP) and/or Residual Limb Pain (RLP) as measured by the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) and the McGill Short Form Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Further, any side effects
      associated with the acupuncture treatment regimens, time requirements, and patient compliance
      with the treatment regimens will be estimated.

      Study participants will be randomized to one of three acupuncture treatments: Chinese Scalp
      Acupuncture, French Auricular Acupuncture, or a combination of both.
