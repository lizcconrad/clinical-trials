      The purpose of this study is to assess whether NaFeEDTA and electrolytic iron improve iron
      status of young school children, when added as iron fortificants in whole maize flour.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fortification of staple foods with iron may be an effective method of addressing the problem
      of iron deficiency. Questions however remain of the type of iron fortificants to use, the
      appropriate fortification levels and suitable food vehicles. Cereals form attractive vehicles
      because they are widely consumed in parts of the world that bear a large burden of the iron
      deficiency problem. They are however high in phytates and would reduce the bioavailability of
      commonly used iron fortificants. Isotope studies have shown that even in the presence of
      phytates, iron from NaFeEDTA is relatively more bioavailable than that from other fortificant
      sources. Its efficacy has however not been assessed in human trials. Electrolytic iron, on
      the other hand is widely used and was legislated as the iron fortificant of choice in South
      Africa. Its efficacy in a high-phytate vehicle has also not been assessed. We have therefore
      undertaken to assess the efficacy of NaFeEDTA at two doses, as an iron fortificant in whole
      flour, and the efficacy of electrolytic iron at a dose similar to the high-dose NaFeEDTA. The
      results will contribute information on the suitability of these fortificants in whole maize
      flour, a food commonly consumed in sub-Saharan Africa.
