    <textblock>
      The objective for this pilot project is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of the
      Interactive Voice Response protocol (IVR) on physical activity and eating behaviors in a
      group men and women who have been identified by their physician as being pre-diabetic. We
      hypothesize that participants receiving the IVR follow-up will have greater positive changes
      in their physical activity and eating behaviors when compared to those who receive only the
      standard-care pre-diabetes class.

      Patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes present a unique opportunity for health care providers
      to implement preventive practices. Behavioral intervention strategies that target weight
      reduction or maintenance and increased fitness not only provide exceptional cardiovascular
      benefits, but also play an important role in delayed development or prevention of type 2
      diabetes mellitus (DM). This study was designed to determine the feasibility and
      effectiveness of automated telephone support calls targeting physical activity and healthful
      eating as strategies for weight loss for patients with pre-diabetes.

      Participants with pre-diabetes who participated in a 90-minute diabetes prevention class were
      consented to participate in this behavioral study and were then randomly assigned to receive
      automated telephone support targeting physical activity and nutrition weight loss strategies
      or to a no-contact control group. Objective physical activity (accelerometer), self-reported
      dietary intake, and body weight were assessed at baseline and at 3-months follow-up.
