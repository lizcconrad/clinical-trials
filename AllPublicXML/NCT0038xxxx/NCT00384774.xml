      This study evaluates the efficacy of a range of intravenous doses of COL-144 in the treatment
      of migraine headache in order to select a dose range for further studies.

      This study is set up:

        -  to evaluate the efficacy (headache response at two hours) of a range of intravenous
           doses of COL-144 in order to select a dose range for further evaluation,

        -  to explore the time course and effect of a range of dose levels of COL-144 on features
           of the migraine including: headache response, proportion of patients pain-free, headache
           recurrence, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, disability, use of rescue medication,
           patient global impression and vomiting

        -  to explore the safety and tolerability of a range of doses of COL-144 in terms of
           adverse events, physical exam, vital signs, laboratory evaluations, and ECGs

        -  to determine key PK parameters for COL-144 and to explore the relationship between the
           PK of COL-144 and the time course and extent of clinical response
