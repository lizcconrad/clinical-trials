  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of Systane Free to Saline in decreasing
      the symptoms of dry eye after aggressive therapy. As a principal outcome measure, we are
      using the modified Schein dry eye symptomatology questionaire to determine whether any
      improvement in signs is mirrored by improvement in the Schein Score. Up to 30 dry eye
      subjects will be dosed six times per day for one month. The typical clinical signs will be
      onmitored (e.g., corneal staining) along with dyrness symptoms. The hypothesis is that an
      optimized drop, Systane Free, will be more effective than saline solution in improving dry
      eye signs and symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The informed consent document must be read, signed and dated by the subject or legally
        authorized representative before conducting any procedures. Additionally, the informed
        consent document must be signed and dated by the individual obtaining consent of the
        subject.

        Adult subjects with mild to moderate dry eye. Criteria for the diagnosis must include two
        of the three following characteristics as demonstrated at the Eligibility Visit:

        Composite symptom score of greater than or equal to 7 on the Schein Questionnaire.

        Sodium Fluorescein (NaFl) Tear Break-Up Time less than 7 seconds in both eyes. Cumulative
        Sodium Fluorescein Corneal Staining greater than or equal to 4 in both eyes on a 0 to 20
        point scale.

        Rose Bengal corneal staining greater than 4 of 24 maximum for 6 zones. Able and willing to
        follow study instructions. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of twenty twenty
        five or better in each eye.

        The informed consent document must be read, signed and dated by the subject or legally
        authorized representative before conducting any procedures. Additionally, the informed
        consent document must be signed and dated by the individual obtaining consent of the
        subject.

        Adult subjects with mild-to-moderate dry eye. Criteria for the diagnosis must include two
        of the three following characteristics as demonstrated at the Eligibility Visit

        Composite symptom score of greater than or equal to 7 on the Schein Questionnaire.

        Sodium FluoresceinTear Break-Up Time less than or equal to 7 seconds in both eyes.

        Cumulative Sodium Fluorescein Corneal Staining greater than or equal to 4 in both eyes on a
        0 to 20 point scale.

        Rose Bengal corneal staining greater than 4 of 24 maximum for 6 zones. Able and willing to
        follow study instructions. Subjects must have best corrected visual acuity of twenty twenty
        five or better in each eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        History or evidence of ocular or intraocular surgery in either eye within the past six
        months. LASIK and other keratorefractive procedure patients may participate if the surgery
        was earlier than 12 months at the time of the beginning of the study.

        History or evidence of serious ocular trauma in either eye within the past six months.

        History of hypersensitivity to any component of the study medications. These include the
        artificial tear and the diagnostic dye sodium fluorescein.

        History or evidence of epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis); vaccinia,
        active or recent varicella, viral disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva; chronic
        bacterial disease of the cornea and/or conjunctiva and/or eyelids; mycobacterial infection
        of the eye; and/or fungal disease of the eye.

        Use of topical ocular medications during the study period. Subjects using systemic
        steroids, immunosuppressive agents and/or anti-cholinergics (e.g. cold and allergy
        medications, tricyclic antidepressants) for treatment of autoimmune connective tissue
        disease may not be enrolled in the study if they have not been on a stable dosing regimen
        for a minimum of 30 days prior to the Eligibility Visit. In addition, the dosing regimen
        must remain stable throughout the 4-week treatment period.

        Ocular conditions such as active acute conjunctival infections or iritis. Individuals
        unwilling to discontinue contact lens wear for seven days prior to the study and throughout
        the study.

        Participation in an investigational drug or device study within 30 days of entering this
        study.
