  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based
      HIV prevention education for high-risk, underserved rural women in Appalachia. This study has
      potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on the use of
      social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk substance use
      and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and significant
      public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will respond to a
      critical and unmet need to increase access to prevention interventions using social media, as
      well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use behaviors among vulnerable
      populations.

      The overall aim of this R34 application is to adapt and feasibility test an evidence-based
      intervention for HIV prevention for a high-risk group of rural women in Appalachia. This
      study has potential to make a significant contribution to science by advancing knowledge on
      the use of social media to increase access to prevention interventions to reduce high-risk
      substance use and related health disparities among rural women during a time of emerging and
      significant public health risk in Appalachia. Successfully accomplishing study aims will
      respond to a critical and unmet need to increase the reach and scope of prevention
      interventions using social media, as well as advance knowledge about the high-risk drug use
      behaviors of this underserved group. Considering the need for prevention interventions among
      this high-risk group and the popularity of Facebook, the purpose of this R34 proposal is to
      adapt an evidence-based HIV prevention intervention for social media delivery and to
      feasibility test through a randomized control trial with 60 high-risk rural women drug users.
      The following aims guide the proposed study: (1) Adapt the NIDA Standard for HIV prevention
      for delivery via Facebook; and (2) Examine the feasibility of the adapted intervention with
      high-risk rural women through a randomized control pilot. The proposed use of Facebook in
      this study is promising because it is a stable, widely used, cost-efficient platform that
      could be leveraged to increase access to critically needed HIV prevention education. This
      study presents an exciting opportunity to examine the use of Facebook as a technique to
      expand the reach of evidence-based preventions interventions for high-risk drug users who are
      not likely to engage in formal treatment. Findings from this study will inform development of
      the larger R01 which would allow examination of the effectiveness and sustainability of this
      HIV prevention intervention in understudied, high risk populations.
