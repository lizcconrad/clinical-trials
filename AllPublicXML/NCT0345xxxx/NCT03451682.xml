  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryopreservation is the storage of biological material at subzero temperatures at which
      biochemical processes of cell metabolism and the biochemical reactions that lead to cell
      death are slowed, interrupted or stopped.Many investigators have focused on the use of
      antioxidants in the freezing media to reduce the negative effects of reactive oxygen
      species(ROS) on spermatozoa and in this context addition of vitamin E to cryoprotective
      medium enhanced the post-thaw sperm motility and preserved sperm DNA integrity , superoxide
      dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were added to boar spermatozoa freezing media and they not
      only increased sperm motility and viability but also decreased post-thaw ROS generation which
      led to improvement in results of in vitro fertilizing with thawed spermatozoa.However, the
      impact of in vitro addition of proanthocyanidins to human semen before cryopreservation on
      post-thawing semen parameters, DFI has not been studied yet. The research question evaluated
      in the current study was whether semen samples of infertile men supplemented or not with
      procyanidine before cryopreservation, differ in post-thawing semen parameters and sperm DNA
      fragmentation index (DFI).
