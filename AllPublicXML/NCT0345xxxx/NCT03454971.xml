  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last few years, the medical care of oncohematologic cancers diagnosed patients was
      shaken by the arrival of new therapies : targeted therapies. Very efficient, these therapies
      use the oral pathway in most cases, and are taken at home. These treatments show plenty of
      drug interactions and side effects aren't rare and require, in their own, a rigorous follow
      up in order to reduce their occurrence, intensity and their impact on patients' quality of
      life. A bad management of the treatment could lead to an inacceptable toxicity, or to its
      premature interruption.

      With all the new administration and follow up strains in mind, we want to elaborate the
      medical pathway structure for these patients by reinforcing the nurse coordination and by
      integrating another healthcare professional : the hospital pharmacist, which is a
      professional especially implicated in the drug delivery, the control of drug interactions and
      medical advices relative to the given drug.

      Private healthcare professionals (referring physicians, pharmacists, private nurses),
      unsufficiently trained and informed about these new treatments and their side effects, are
      asking for further information concerning the drugs prescribed to their patients, and are
      willing to keep open a communication line for the home follow up.

      These patients, who are autonomously taking their medication, are in need to be informed and
      supported to insure the good management of the drug, while taking in account their
      environment, their knowledge of their cancer and treatment and also of all the issues that
      could occur during their therapy, in order to resolve them.

      We propose a multidisciplinary medical care taking place at the very beginning of an oral
      therapy treatment, in order to ensure the security of the drug administration. Patients and
      healthcare professionals will be closely followed during the first two treatment cycles.
      After this, side-effects incidence are less frequent and the usual oncohematologic follow up
      is sufficient.
