  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of EDO-S101
      that can be given with or after radiation therapy to patients with glioblastoma. The safety
      of this study drug will also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. EDO-S101 is not FDA approved or commercially available for
      the treatment of glioblastoma. It is currently being used for research purposes only.

      The study doctor can describe how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 128 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Groups and Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to 1 of 2
      groups based on when you join the study:

        -  If you are in Group 1, you will receive EDO-S101 on Day 1 of each 21-day Cycle.

        -  If you are in Group 2, you will receive EDO-S101 on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day Cycle.
           Participants in this group will also receive radiation therapy per standard of care.

      Additionally, you will be assigned to a dose level of EDO-S101 based on when you joined this
      study. Up to 6 dose levels of EDO-S101 will be tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled
      at each dose level. The first set of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each
      new set will receive a higher dose than the set before it, if no intolerable side effects
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of EDO-S101 is found.

      Each time you receive EDO-S101, it will be given by vein over about 30 minutes.

      You will be given standard corticosteroids to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may
      ask the study staff for information about how the drug is given and its risks.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive EDO-S101 for up to 12 cycles. You will no longer be able to receive the study
      drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Study Visits for Group 1:

      On Day 1 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. If you can become pregnant,
           this sample will also be used for a pregnancy test.

        -  You will have an EKG before and 2 times over the 60 minutes after the infusion.

      In addition to these tests, on Day 1 of odd-numbered cycles beginning with Cycle 3 (Cycles 3,
      5, 7 and so on):

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      On Days 8 Cycle 1:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On Days 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Study Visits for Group 2:

      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a neurological exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This sample will also be used
           for a pregnancy test, if you can become pregnant (Day 1 only).

        -  You will have an EKG before and 2 times over the 60 minutes after the infusion.

      In addition to these tests, on Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every odd-numbered cycles beginning with
      Cycle 3 (Cycles 3, 5, 7 and so on):

        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      On Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 1, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      At any time during the study, extra tests may be performed if the doctor thinks they are
      needed. The study doctor will tell you more about any extra tests that may be needed.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drug, and then every 3 months after that, the
      study staff will call you to learn how you are doing. The call should take about 5-10
      minutes.

      If the disease gets worse and you have surgery as part of your standard care, tumor tissue
      that is removed during this procedure will be collected for biomarker testing, including
      genetic biomarkers.

      If you stop taking the study drug and the disease has not gotten worse, you will have the
      following as often as the doctor thinks is needed:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have an MRI.

      The study doctor will discuss with you how often these tests may be performed. If the disease
      gets worse or the study ends, you will no longer have these tests for the study.

             within 72 hours of starting first dose of study drug.

          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth
             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the
             duration of the study. Subjects of childbearing potential are those who have not been

             course of the study.

         11. Patients must have completed standard radiation therapy with concurrent TMZ and must
             not have evidence of progressive disease on post treatment imaging. Progression can
             only be defined using diagnostic imaging if there is new enhancement outside of the
             radiation field (beyond the high-dose region or 80% isodose line) or if there is
             unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathologic sampling (e.g., solid tumor
             areas [i.e, &gt; 70% tumor cell nuclei in areas], high or progressive increase in MIB-1
             proliferation index compared with prior biopsy, or evidence for histologic progression
             or increased anaplasia in tumor). Note: Given the difficulty of differentiating true
             progression from pseudoprogression, clinical decline alone, in the absence of
             radiographic or histologic confirmation of progression, will not be sufficient for
             definition of progressive disease in the first 12 weeks after completion of concurrent
             chemoradiotherapy. (For Stage 1: Post-chemoradiation group only)

         12. Patients must have undergone surgery of their GBM, and must not have had any further
             treatment following surgery. A minimal interval of 7 days between the day of surgery
             and the day of inclusion should be respected; a maximal interval of 31 days between
             the day of surgery and the day of inclusion should be respected; the patient should
             have fully clinically recovered from the surgery. (For Stage 2: Radiation with
             concurrent and adjuvant EDO-S101 only)

         13. Patients must undergo surgery and must not have further treatment. (For MTD Expansion
             cohort only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has received prior interstitial brachytherapy, implanted chemotherapy, or therapeutics
             delivered by local injection or convection enhanced delivery. Prior treatment with
             Gliadel® wafers will be excluded. Concomitant use of the Optune device will also be
             excluded.

          2. Is currently participating or has participated in any other investigational or
             therapeutic trial before or after chemoradiation.

          3. Any serious medical condition that interferes with adherence to study procedures.

          4. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, within 2 weeks prior to
             study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., &lt;/= Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse
             events due to a previously administered agent. Note: Subjects with &lt;/= Grade 2
             neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and may qualify for the study. Note: If
             subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the toxicity
             and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          5. Patients with a history of a second malignancy diagnosed within three (3) years of
             study enrollment or have a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires
             active treatment. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially
             curative therapy.

          6. New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage III/IV congestive heart failure, arrhythmias
             not adequately controlled.

         11. Has an ongoing or previous history of spontaneous intratumoral hemorrhage.

         12. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         14. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit.

         15. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).
             Testing not required.

         16. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected). (Testing not required for Stage 2 and MTD Expansion
             cohort)

         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

         18. Contraindication for undergoing MRIs

         19. Use of any drug with HDAC inhibiting activity.

         20. Use of valproate in any of its indications (epilepsy, mood disorder). Valproate, due
             to its HDAC inhibiting activity is contraindicated. For those patients on valproate,
             valproate will need to be discontinued and switched to a different anti-epileptic
             agent or psychotropic agent. A washout period of 4 days from valproate acid will be
             allowed prior to enrolling into the trial.
