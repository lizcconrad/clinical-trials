  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to explore patients perception of chronic abdominal pain after Roux en Y
      gastric bypass surgery for morbid obesity. The investigators aim to describe characteristics
      of symptoms of pain. Potential risk factors for developing abdominal pain post gastric bypass
      will be explored.

      This is a single-center, prospective, longitudinal, cohort study performed at the Department
      of Morbid Obesity and Bariatric Surgery, Oslo University Hospital. Patients undergoing
      gastric bypass are eligible for inclusion. The study is approved by the Regional Committee
      for Medical and Health Research Ethics (no.2013/1263), South-East health region. All
      participants provide written consent for study paennrollment.

      The participants are asked to fill inn a set of questionnaires before and during follow-up
      after gastric bypass surgery. Symptom characteristics are explored and evaluated. Quality of
      life is included in the analyses. The main outcome is findings at 2 years post surgery, but
      the patients will be followed for 5 years.

      The investigators also aim to evaluate by objective measures the patients perception of pain
      by temperature and skin pressure stimulants before and after surgery (2 years).
