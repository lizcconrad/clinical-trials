  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study arises from the need to optimize antibacterial drug usage to face increasing drug
      resistance among gram-negative pathogens in intensive care units. Gram-negative organisms are
      responsible for 70% of drug-resistant infections acquired in the intensive care unit.
      Meropenem is a β-lactam, carbapenem, antibacterial agent usually administered by intermittent
      infusion. As β-lactam efficacy is determined by the time in which the drug concentration
      exceeds the minimum inhibiting concentration of the target pathogen, intermittent infusion of
      this short half-lived drug can lead to precipitous drops in serum drug levels, an occurrence
      linked to emergence of resistant pathogens. The investigators hypothesize a beneficial effect
      of a continuous meropenem infusion on mortality and emergence of drug resistant pathogens.
      All patients enrolled will receive 1 g of meropenem bolus. After that, subjects will be
      randomized to receive a continuous infusion of study drug 3g/day or a bolus administration of
      the same amount of drugs. The investigators expect a reduction of mortality and emergence of
      extensive or pan drug resistant pathogens from 52 to 40% in the continuous infusion group.

    <measure>Cumulative SOFA-free point</measure>
    <time_frame>up to day 28</time_frame>
    <description>SOFA score will be evaluated every day up to day 28. SOFA-free daily score is 24 (maximum SOFA) minus actual SOFA. Cumulative SOFA-free is the sum of SOFA-free daily from randomization to date 28. Patients dead before day 28 can't ameliorate their SOFA-free score. This way, the higher the cumulative SOFA-free, the higher is the amelioration of the patient and his probability of survival.</description>
