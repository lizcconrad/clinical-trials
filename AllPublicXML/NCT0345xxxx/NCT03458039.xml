  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate two Train-the-Trainer implementation strategies to increase and
      better sustain the number of providers delivering evidence-based mental health services in
      low and middle-income countries (LIMC). The first strategy is the gold standard approach
      using experts to do a &quot;live&quot; training and the second is a technology based strategy.
      Evaluation will include trainer and provider competency, knowledge and fidelity, as well as
      cost effectiveness and will be relevant for diverse evidence-based practices that are not
      being scaled-up in LMIC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to evaluate implementation strategies that can reduce
      the science-to-practice gap of evidence-based treatments (EBT) for mental health. Although
      evidence suggests that mental health treatments are acceptable and efficacious in
      low-and-middle income countries (LMIC) for the treatment of common mental disorders, there
      remains a gap in our understanding of how to bring these interventions to scale. A
      significant challenge is training and sustaining counselors in EBT. Implementation research
      will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of two Train-the-Trainer (TTT) implementation
      strategies to increase and sustain the number of counselors in a non-inferiority design. One
      TTT strategy is the gold-standard of utilizing expert trainers to conduct in-person training
      and coaching to produce local trainers. The second strategy is technology based with no
      experts needed on-site, utilizing phones that function both on and offline and allow for
      pre-recorded teachings. Trainers (6-8) will be randomized to one of the TTT strategies, and
      subsequently complete two Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) trainings with local lay
      counselors. A total of 100 lay counselors trained in CETA will serve at least 5 adolescents
      or young adults under supervision of the local trainers. The transdiagnostic treatment being
      scaled up, CETA, was effective in two randomized clinical trials in LMIC settings with lay
      providers. CETA provides the basis for feasible scale-up through the use a single therapy to
      treat multiple common mental disorders with varying severities, an approach that is more
      cost-effective than implementing multiple single-disorder focused psychotherapy treatments in
      LMIC. Outcomes will include: 1) trainer and counselor competency, knowledge and fidelity
      through tests, behavioral rehearsal, and audio/video recordings, 2) client mental health
      symptomatology, and 3) implementation constructs of reach, acceptability, appropriateness,
      feasibility, and scale-up potential. The cost-effectiveness of the two TTT strategies will
      also be evaluated. The project will specifically strengthen the capacity of: 1) study staff
      to conduct mental health implementation science research, 2) counselor and trainers in CETA
      training, supervision and delivery, and 3) policy and decision makers to interpret and
      appropriately utilize the scientific evidence to improve mental health policies and programs.
      At 15+ organizations with CETA providers, monitoring systems will be set up to assess
      quality, reach and cost going beyond the study. These aims will contribute to developing
      dynamic sustainable Learning Health Care Systems in LMIC. This proposal leverages previous
      studies and strong collaborations in Zambia with the Ministry of Health and numerous local
      organizations. Results from this trial will produce effectiveness and costing data on 2 TTT
      strategies that could inform the scale-up potential of diverse EBT in LMIC across and beyond
      mental health. This research study ultimately addresses both the treatment and implementation
      gaps in lower-resource settings globally.

    <description>Training the trainer involves taking an experienced counselor and teaching them how to train additional counselors in a specific therapy. A technology-based train the trainer strategy will be developed and tested. The hypothesis is that the technology strategy will have similar effectiveness to the standard live strategy. Therefore, all experienced-counselors will receive a train-the-trainer intervention.</description>
