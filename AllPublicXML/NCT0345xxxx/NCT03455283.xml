  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively collect data on the pattern of use for
      gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) in real-life setting with special reference to
      Clariscan after its commercial launch in Europe and in addition quality of images, diagnostic
      confidence and customer satisfaction will be assessed on a Likert scale by the local
      radiologist/technician and spontaneously reported immediate and delayed adverse events (AEs)
      to assess the effectiveness and safety profile of GBCAs in clinical practice respectively.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pattern of Use of GBCAs in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Centres</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pattern of use will be assessed on summary data collected from: number of radiological procedures (including ultrasound, MR, computed tomography [CT] scan, fluoroscopy, X-ray, single-photon emission CT [SPECT], and positron emission tomography [PET] examinations), number of MR machines, number of enhanced and non-enhanced procedures, characteristics of the treated population (age, gender, BMI), dose indication, referring physician (seniority or specialty) performed by the study centre, investigator and patient-level variables. A qualitative analysis of these variables will be performed describing the overall pattern of use, referral pattern, and challenges in a radiological practice.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Visualization of the Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance (CE-MR) Image, Based on the Local Radiologist Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-image acquisition on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of image will be assessed by the local reporting radiologist on a 4-point Likert scale. For cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), qualitative assessment will be performed by blinded readers and assess image quality on a scale of 1 to 4 as 1=poor image quality and blurring of the arterial segment; 2=fair image quality, inadequate arterial enhancement for confident diagnosis; 3=good image quality and arterial enhancement, adequate for confident diagnosis; 4=excellent image quality and arterial enhancement, for highly confident diagnosis. For Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), characterisation of the lesion (or most representative lesion, i.e., enhancing and/or largest if there will be &gt;1 lesion present) will be assessed on a 4-point scale as 1= poor, inadequate; 2= fair, partial; 3= good, adequate; 4= excellent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Diagnostic Confidence (Evaluated by Local Radiologist) in Pre-Contrast and Post-Contrast CE-MR Examination Results</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre and post administration on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For each participant based on the most representative lesion. All available sequences (e.g., fluid attenuation inversion recovery [FLAIR], T2, and T1 with and without contrast administration) will be available for readers to review and evaluate. Before reviewing the CE-MR image, the radiologist will be asked to enter the confidence to make a diagnosis for the participant as a whole number between 0% to 100% based only on the non-enhanced image. The radiologist will then enter the diagnostic confidence as a whole number between 0% to 100% after the CE-MR scan results are read. This will be used to calculate the change in diagnostic confidence in this study by the local radiologist for all GBCAs including Clariscan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Customer Satisfaction Survey, Based on the Reports by the Local Nurse/Radiology Technician</measure>
    <time_frame>Upto end of recruitment (upto 90 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Customer satisfaction survey was reported once per centre by MR nurse/technician from the investigator's staff - Quality of packaging including bottles, syringe, marking, pack size available. This will be recorded once for each GBCA used at the study centre as an overall impression and rated as: 1 = can be improved; 2 = good; 3 = excellent.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Treatment-Related Adverse Events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 months</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Visualization of the Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance (CE-MR) Image, Based on the Assessment by MR Experts</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 18 months from study start date</time_frame>
    <description>The anonymised images will be blindly analysed by an expert MR radiologist panel to assess the quality of images. The first 50 images will be analysed in a 1:1 ratio for Clariscan and other GBCAs, i.e., the first consecutive 25 images for Clariscan and the first consecutive 25 images of the other GBCAs (excluding liver-specific GBCAs). This analysis will be performed at a later date and not part of the initial read out of the study.</description>

      <textblock>
        Participants routinely evaluated with CE-MR in one of 17 European radiology centres.
        Eligible centres will have Clariscan included on the formulary for Magnetic resonance (MR)
        examinations and have electronic record of cumulative data and are willing to report the
        cumulative data at the end of the recruitment period. Only one investigator per centre will
