  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to use epidemiological tools to understand the transmission and evolution of
      influenza viruses at an individual and population level within a small-scale city (Basel)
      through a combination of experimental, clinical, and mathematical advances. Investigators aim
      to quantitatively characterize the viral transmission using novel molecular-epidemiological
      tools based on whole genome sequencing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Samples will be collected such as whole blood, serum and DNA, nasopharyngeal swamps to
      diagnose influenza by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and to determine colonization rates
      with Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia. All samples except the first
      naso-pharyngeal swab for influenza diagnostics will be stored in a biobank and analysed in
      batches. Each influenza virus isolate will be sequenced using a &quot;whole genome sequencing&quot;
      approach. The viral transmission and evolution will be analysed using whole genome data for a
      detailed molecular and phylogenetic tree analysis, respectively. The epidemiological and
      geographical data will be incorporated into the phylogenetic model.
