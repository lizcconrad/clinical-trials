                  including any female who is post-menopausal or any female who is surgically
                  sterilized (via documented hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation). (For

               -  child bearing potential, the subject is eligible to enter and participate in this
                  study if she is not lactating and has a negative urine pregnancy test at the

                  agree to use an alternate method of contraception if they should become sexually
                  active and will be queried on whether they have been abstinent in the preceding 2
                  weeks when they present to the clinic for the Final Visit.) or, ii. has a male
                  sexual partner who is surgically sterilized prior to the Screen Visit and is the

                  only) with double-barrier method of contraception consisting of spermicide with
                  either condom or diaphragm. (Women of child-bearing potential using an oral
                  contraceptive in combination with a double-barrier method of contraception are
                  required to continue to use this form of contraception for 1 week following
                  discontinuation of study medication).

                  of any intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant with published data
                  showing that the highest expected failure rate is less than 1% per year. The
                  subject must have the device inserted at least 2 weeks prior to the first Screen
                  Visit, throughout the study, and 2 weeks following the end of the study,
