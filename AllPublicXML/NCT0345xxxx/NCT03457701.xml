  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Daprodustat administration has the potential, by virtue of increasing hypoxia-inducible
      factor (HIF) levels, to increase oral iron absorption and incorporation into hemoglobin
      (Hgb). Therefore, the purpose of this study is to compare the effect of daprodustat to rhEPO
      (i.e., epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa) on non-heme oral iron absorption using stable
      isotopic iron (57Fe and 58Fe) by measuring incorporation of iron in erythrocytes. This study
      will be a randomized, repeat dose, open label, two period cross-over study in adult, male and
      female subjects with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease who are not on dialysis
      currently treated with stable doses (&lt;=50% change in 4-weekly dose) for at least 8 weeks
      prior to and including the screening period, of rhEPO (i.e., epoetin alfa or darbepoetin
      alfa). Sufficient subjects will be enrolled such that at least 12 subjects comprise the
      Evaluable Population. The study will compare the fractional iron absorption between treatment
      arms (daprodustat and rhEPO [i.e., epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa]) and will evaluate the
      difference is equal/not equal to zero. Approximate duration of study participation will be up
      to 73 days.

          -  The Hgb stability assessment is the difference between the maximum and minimum values
             of the three Hgb measurements obtained between Week -4 and Day 1.
