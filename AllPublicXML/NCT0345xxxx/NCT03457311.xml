  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the oral galactose single point (OGSP) cutoff values to
      discriminate subjects with different hepatic function. The secondary objective is to analyze
      the correlations between OGSP and other hepatic function assessment methods among this trial
      subjects.

    <textblock>
      A novel, simple, clinically useful quantitative liver function test, called the galactose
      single point (GSP) method, was developed to assess residual liver function by measuring
      galactose blood concentration 1 hour after galactose was administered (0.5 g/kg). The
      galactose single point (GSP) method has been used to evaluate liver function in both humans
      and rats, and GSP concentration has been found to closely reflect changes in enzyme activity
      and hepatic blood flow. The Federal Drug Administration of the U.S. has recommended the GSP
      method in its guidelines for industry pharmacokinetics for patients with impaired hepatic
      function (FDA 2003). The GSP method has also been successfully applied to measure the
      clearance of drugs that are excreted from the liver but not metabolized, such as promazine
      and cefoperazone, specifically in patients with various liver diseases. Hu et al.
      demonstrated that GSP concentration is strongly correlated with the severity of liver
      disease.

      This translate the traditional GSP method to oral galactose single point (OGSP) that will
      greatly improve the technical simplicity and reduce the burden to patients and will easily
      applied to patient both in hospital and home to measure the residual liver function.

    <description>For the OGSP measurement, subjects will be orally administered with 1.25 ml/kg G.S.P. oral solution (400 mg/ml of galactose). At least 20 ml water will be given to subjects after drinking G.S.P. oral solution within 3 to 5 minutes. Sixty minutes after oral G.S.P. solution, a sample of 0.5 ml of whole blood will be taken from subject's finger for the determination of OGSP value.</description>
