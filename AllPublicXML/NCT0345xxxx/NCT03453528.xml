      Single-centre, prospective, diagnostic trial to evaluate the Prostate-Specific Membrane
      Antigen (PSMA-antigen) over-expression in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer
      (mCRPC) and in advanced/metastatic solid tumors patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the detection rate of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT,
      defined as the ratio of 68Ga-PSMA-positive patients and the total number of cancer patients
      with known advanced/metastatic disease that performed a 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT as part of the
      present study. A positive patient is defined as a patient with at least one
      68Ga-PSMA-positive lesion.
