    <textblock>
      A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase I clinical study of the safety and
      tolerability of increasing doses of drug XC221 after single and repeated oral administration
      in healthy volunteers. The volunteers received the study drug once, and then continued daily
      intake for 5 days after a 6-day break. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the
      safety and tolerability profile for drug XC221 after single and multiple administration based
      on the frequency and severity of adverse events and changes in vital signs, laboratory
      results, electrocardiography and results of the physical examination. The secondary objective
      of the study was to assess pharmacokinetics of active pharmaceutical substance XC221GI and
      its metabolite XC221A.

      One Russian center was approved for participation in this study. One center was initiated.
      Healthy volunteers were enrolled in 1 center. The study consisted of 4 periods: screening,
      single administration, multiple administration and follow-up.

      All eligible subjects were randomized into the study in appropriate cohort groups
      sequentially. Cohort 1 - XC221 or Placebo 60 mg once and then daily 5 days after a 6-day
      break; Cohort 2 - XC221 or Placebo 200 mg once and then daily during 5 days after a 6-day
      break. The decision regarding increasing of the study drug dose for a subsequent cohort was
      made by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee on the basis of preliminary safety results
      assessment. A total of 24 volunteers received XC221 (60 mg or 200 mg) and a total of 8
      volunteers received the placebo during the study participation. The follow-up period lasted
      for 4 weeks.

    <description>Adverse events have been classified according to CTCAE ver 4.03. Adverse events will be summarized descriptively by treatment arm. Verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and organ systems using the current Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version.
