  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate if performing a small caliber office hysteroscopic cervical
      negotiation would succeed to bypass tight markedly stenotic cervix in comparison to blind
      cervical probing done under general anesthesia. Moreover, we test the impact of drawing a
      detailed diagram after this procedure on the success of ET in patients with failed mock or
      actual trials of embryo transfer (ET).

      It comprises 122 nulliprous women with failed cervical sounding on vaginal examination in the
      office. Women were divided into 2 groups. Group A comprised 64 cases subjected to
      small-caliber office hysteroscopic cervical negotiation while 58 cases were subjected to
      cervical probing under general anesthesia. Main outcome measures included success to bypass
      primary cervical stenosis and complication rate

    <description>Office hysteroscopy 30 degrees 2.6 mm telescope with an outer sheath of 3.2 mm (Storz Co., Tutlingen, Germany). Hysteroscopy is performed as usual by proper examination of the vagina and the ectocervix for any abnormality followed by introduction of the hysteroscope into the cervical canal. At this step, the hysteroscopist waits for a while until the distending fluid forms a micro-cavity. At this point, the telescope is advanced with necessary rotatory movements of the 30 degrees telescope guided by the vision of the dark spot which is the internal os. If it is reached, again waiting for some time to allow fluid distension of the internal os area.</description>

    <description>Cervical probing is started with a 2 mm probe after grasping the cervix with a multi-tooth tenaculum put anteriorly or posteriorly according to prior transabdominal or transvaginal sonographic examination of the cervical canal. If the probe succeedes to bypass the internal os, a higher caliber probe is used. Thereafter, a uterine sound (4mm = 1.33 Fr) is introduced into the endometrial cavity. Lastly, gentle cervical dilatation up to Hegar's 8 is performed as usual with classic leaving each dilator for 30 seconds inside the internal os. If probes couldn't bypass the internal os, the procedure is considered failed. If the probe enters a cavity other than endometrial cavity, a false passage is considered.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  nulliprous women with failed cervical sounding on vaginal examination in the office.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  There shouldn't be any previous operation on the cervix nor use of any medication to
             prime the cervix (primary). Multiparity is an exclusion criterion to eliminate any
             bias due to previous cervical dilatation, even multiparous women delivered by cesarean
             section were excluded to exclude patient heterogeneity.
