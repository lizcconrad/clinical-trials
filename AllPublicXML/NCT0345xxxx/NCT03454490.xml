  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession is defined as the apical migration of the gingival margin from the
      amelocemental junction. This condition may be associated with symptoms such as tooth
      hypersensitivity, root decay, and cosmetic complaints from patients. Many treatments have
      been used to treat gingival recession and the gold standard is the autogenous connective
      tissue gingival graft because of its predictability. This type of gingival graft is performed
      by harvesting connective tissue from patients' hard palate. Periodontists and general
      dentists frequently perform these gingival grafts. Occasionally, some patients develop
      postoperative complications that need to be addressed in an hospital setting. An uncommon but
      concerning complication of an autogenous connective tissue gingival graft is a donor site
      pseudoaneurysm of the greater palatine artery. No description of this complication following
      a gingival graft has been identified in the current literature. One case report mentioned
      that pseudoaneurysm of the greater palatine artery looks like a pulsatile nodule associated
      or not with pain on palpation. From the experience of the investigators, patients may consult
      an hospital setting having a complaint of major oral bleeding. Local hemostatic agents can
      palliate this type of bleeding, but angiographic embolization is often required. Several
      cases were treated in the investigators' hospital. Thus, the investigators believe it is
      relevant to share this experience with the scientific community. The primary objective of
      this case series is to inform dental professionals of the existence and the management of
      postoperative pseudoaneurysm of the greater palatine artery following autogenous gingival
      graft. The secondary objective is to find potential solutions to minimize the incidence of
      this morbid complication.
