  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure changes in smoking behavior during and following
      sampling of an e-cigarette product. E-cigarettes are classified by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) as a tobacco product, though they contain no tobacco. Unlike regular
      cigarettes, which are burned (creating smoke that is inhaled), e-cigarettes include a heating
      element that vaporizes nicotine. E-cigarettes are likely much safer than conventional
      cigarettes, but they may not be entirely safe. We are testing the effects of one specific
      ecigarette (NJoy) on naturalistic changes in smoking behavior. Neither the tobacco industry
      nor any ecigarette manufacturer provides support of any kind to this study. There is no
      requirement to quit smoking in this study, nor is there any requirement to use e-cigarettes.

      Eligible smokers, once consented, will be randomized to receive a sample of ecigarettes (NJoy
      Pre-Filled Tank; n=440) or not (n=220). E-cigarette samples are inclusive of a battery and
      self-contained tanks of assorted flavors to last up to 4 weeks. Participants will be
      recruited nationally, but a subset (N=120) will be recruited locally to allow for biomarker
      collection . Our two-fold purpose is to 1) characterize naturalistic uptake of e-cigarettes,
      and 2) assess impact of e-cigarette uptake on smoking behavior. All smokers will be asked to
      provide smoking diary data, captured electronically, daily for 4 weeks. More substantive
      phone assessment will track smoking and related behaviors at baseline (Day 0) and +10, +17,
      and +24 days (weekly during initial 3 weeks, following brief lag for delays in product
      mailing), and at +1, +3, and +6 months.
