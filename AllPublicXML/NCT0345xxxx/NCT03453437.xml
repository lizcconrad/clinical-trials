  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled study. A total of 200 students will be invited to
      participate in a 5-session mindful self-compassion course aimed at increasing self-compassion
      and reducing maladaptive perfectionism, anxiety, depression, and unhealthy body image.
      Self-compassion is the ability to show oneself kindness in instances of perceived inadequacy,
      failure, and suffering by attending to distressing experiences with kindness, mindfulness,
      and the ability to recognize these as a part of a shared humanity. Twelve participants will
      be randomly selected for pre- and post interviews to qualitatively evaluate outcome. Ten
      participants with high perfectionistic tendencies will be selected to participate in a
      narrative life story interview.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test four hypotheses:

        1. At baseline, low levels of maladaptive perfectionism, and lower levels of depression,
           anxiety and body appreciation - reversed, will be related to greater self-compassion.
           The investigators expect high level of maladaptive perfectionism to be related to lower
           baseline self-compassion, higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of
           body appreciation.

        2. The intervention, a five session self-compassion intervention, will be sufficient to
           induce positive changes in perfectionism and psychological symptoms of anxiety,
           depression and body-appreciation- reversed.

        3. Changes in self-compassion will co-vary with changes in maladaptive perfectionism and
           body appreciation.

        4. Higher baseline levels of maladaptive perfectionism will predict greater gains from the
           intervention, because perfectionistic students will have greater need for a
           self-compassion intervention.

    <description>Adaptive perfectionism as measured by the &quot;Personal Standards&quot; subscale and maladaptive perfectionism/evaluative concerns perfectionism as measured by &quot;Doubts about Actions&quot; and &quot;Concern over Mistakes&quot; subscales of the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale. Personal Standards consists of seven items (6 items for &quot;pure personal standards&quot;), Doubt about Actions consists of four items, and Concern over Mistakes consists of 9 items. All items are on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to disagree with higher scores indicating most perfectionistic tendencies. Full range: 20-100 with higher scores representing more perfectionistic tendencies. Evaluative concerns perfectionism range: 13-65, higher scores indicate more evaluative concerns perfectionism. Personal standards range: 7-35 with higher scores indicating higher personal standards.</description>

    <description>Mindful self-compassion is a course developed by Kristin Neff and Christopher Germer designed to cultivate self-compassion as measured by three subcategories: self-kindness, mindfulness, and a sense of common humanity. This study will shorten the original 8-week course to 5 sessions, and will include interventions and lectures aimed directly toward addressing evaluative concerns perfectionism.</description>
