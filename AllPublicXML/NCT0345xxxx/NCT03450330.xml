  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with advanced NSCLC who have progressed following prior
      therapy. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in patients, and so it will
      help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug treatment. It will also
      measure the levels of drug in the body and preliminarily assess its anti-cancer activity as
      monotherapy and in combination with Osimertinib.

      A phase I/II, open-label, multicentre study to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of AZD4205 as monotherapy or in combination with
      Osimertinib in patients with EGFR mutant advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
      This study includes dose escalation part and dose expansion part.
