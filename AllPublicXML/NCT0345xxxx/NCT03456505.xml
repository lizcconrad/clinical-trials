  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will assess the effects of mindfulness meditation training on an eye blink
      conditioning (EBC) task in a sample of novice meditators. This methodology will allow
      investigation of whether mindfulness interrupts classical conditioning through the process of
      de-automatization. Implicit learning rates, as reflective of unconscious habit formation and
      measured by the frequency of conditioned responses during the EBC, will be a main outcome of
      interest. The proposed study will also assess the effects of mindfulness meditation training
      on an emotion regulation (ER) task, with a specific focus on reappraisal of negative images
      and savoring of positive images.
