      Despite systems for early detection of critical illness, 12% of patients in the emergency
      department develop clinical deterioration with an increased risk of death as a result.

      There is a need for a intervention to support the identification and clinical management of
      patients at risk of clinical deterioration earlier hospitalization. The Cincinnati Children's
      Hospital has introduced a model that systematically complements systems for early detection
      of critical illness with the assessment of patient and relatives concern, clinical intuition
      and concern of the staff. In addition, the model includes formalized organizational processes
      aimed at systematic review of risk patients and early treatment efforts. Studies from United
      States indicate that the model can lead to reduction of serious incidental events and
      increase the staff awareness of the situation. The Cincinnati model is designed for children
      and has not yet been studied in a controlled study.

      Purpose To develop and investigate the impact of a Danish patient safety model. Method A
      literature review is conducted to identify risk factors that should be included in a model
      aimed at detecting and managing clinical deterioration. A patient safety model is developed
      on the basis of the literature review and the Cincinnati model and is tested in a pilot
      study. In a controlled intervention study, the effect is investigated against severe clinical
      deterioration. The intervention is carried out at the emergency departments at Horsens
      Regional Hospital and Viborg Regional Hospital with the regional hospitals in Randers and
      Herning as control departments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventing deterioration in acute patients is of great interest internationally. Studies
      demonstrate that clinical deterioration can be measured up to 24 hours before a heart arrest
      or intensive care admission in the vital signs. Therefore, the health services have
      implemented early warning systems to detect deterioration and critical illness.

      Despite the systems, 12% of patients in an emergency department still develop severe clinical
      deterioration with increased risk of death as a result. Research indicates that the reasons
      for this may be diverse and further action to support the early identification and treatment
      of patients at risk of deterioration is needed.

      Cincinnati Children's Hospital has introduced a patient safety model to ensure identification
      and mitigation of patient risk through escalated observation, care and treatment depending on
      the individual's risk for clinical deterioration. The model includes early warning systems,
      but as something new, it is supplemented with systematic evaluation of more subjective
      factors such as staff's clinical gaze and concerns, patient/relatives' concerns,
      communication problems and high risk therapy.

      In an observational study, the Cincinnati Situation Awareness model was found to be
      associated with a near 50% reduction in unsafe intensive care unit transfers and decrease in
      severe safety events. However, the model has so far not been evaluated in a controlled study
      or an adult population.

      The study will consist of three substudies; the overall study design is based on a framework
      for implementation of complex interventions following a four-step-process entailing
      development, pilot test, evaluation and reporting.

      Study I. The study will consist of a systematic review and aims to identify risk factors
      associated with severe clinical deterioration and severe safety events that should ultimately
      be considered for inclusion in the patient safety model.

      The aim of study II is to develop a patient safety model based on the components in the
      Cincinnati Situation Awareness model and explore its feasibility. The Danish patient safety
      model is expected to consist of systematic patient risk screening, bed huddles and audits of
      intensive care unit transfers.

      Relevant aspects that should be included in the systematic patient risk screening are
      identified based on the literature study. A multidisciplinary panel is established to ensure
      that the choice of risk parameters is made on the basis of risk factors with the highest
      impact and the applicability to standard care.

      A pilot test of the model will be conducted to evaluate the feasibility of methods and
      procedures based on the principles of the Medical Research Council guidance.

      The final model will be investigated in a prospective controlled intervention study design to
      examine the effect in relation to severe clinical deterioration, safety awareness and serious
      adverse events (Study III).

      The study will follow a Quasi-experimental design. The intervention will be implemented at
      the Emergency Departments and Intensive Care Units at Horsens and Viborg Regional Hospitals
      with the Emergency Departments at Herning and Randers Regional Hospitals as controls.

      A positive outcome is expected to increase patient safety by reducing patients with severe
      deterioration, serious adverse events and increase staff safety awareness.

    <intervention_model_description>The study consists of two intervention and two control departments. The intervention consists of a risk assesment to ensure systematic and standardized identification of patients in risk of clinical deterioration and a decision support algorithm. Actions are undertaken on the basis of the standardized decision support and when a patient is determined to be at risk escalation plans are activated. As part of the intervention, huddles are conducted and patients at risk are interdisciplinarily discussed.</intervention_model_description>

The score is aggregated and the vital signs include respiratory rate, SatO2, systolic blood pressure, pulse, temperature and level of consciousness measured by APVU.
The initial deterioration process from score 0-1 will be considered as &quot;no deterioration&quot;. Deterioration directly to score 2 and above, or deterioration from score ≥2 and further will be considered severe.</description>

The patients included in the study will be monitored using the new risk assessment tool with different intervals according to the patients' conditions. Underlying the tool are algorithms of action for intervention in the critically ill patient, inter professional guidelines and guidance for standardized monitoring, escalation plans and huddles.</description>
