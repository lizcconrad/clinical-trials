  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well abatacept, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone work in
      treating patients with multiple myeloma that is resistant to chemotherapy. Abatacept may
      block certain proteins that are present on multiple myeloma cells that have been shown to
      protect against chemotherapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixazomib citrate and
      dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving
      abatacept, ixazomib citrate, and dexamethasone may work better at treating patients with
      multiple myeloma resistant to chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the therapeutic efficacy (as measured by response rate) of abatacept +
      ixazomib citrate (ixazomib) + dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients in first relapse (or
      who are primary refractory) following treatment with a bortezomib-containing regimen,
      compared to historical controls of ixazomib + dexamethasone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the toxicity profile of abatacept + ixazomib + dexamethasone in multiple myeloma
      patients in first relapse (or who are primary refractory) following treatment with a
      bortezomib-containing regimen, compared to historical controls of ixazomib + dexamethasone.

      II. To assess progression-free and overall survival profile of abatacept + ixazomib +
      dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients in first relapse (or who are primary refractory)
      following treatment with a bortezomib-containing regimen, compared to historical controls of
      ixazomib + dexamethasone.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess whether myeloma expression of CD28, CD86, serum kynurenine and/or IL-6 are
      correlated with specific clinical outcomes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive abatacept intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of course 1, then
      subcutaneously (SC) on days 2, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1, and then on days 1, 8, 15, and 22
      of subsequent courses. Patients also receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on
      days 1, 8, and 15 and dexamethasone on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months thereafter.
