      Primary objective:

      To correlate the blood/urine metabolomic biomarkers with PET/MR imaging.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the PET/MR in diagnosis of prostate
           cancer.

        2. To examine the diagnostic performance among subgroups of defined high-risk and low-risk
           subjects.

        3. To interrogate the metabolomic alterations with the molecular PET/MR to develop workable
           panel biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      According to 2015 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline, medical imaging
      plays important roles for detection and staging for PCa, in addition to blood or urine
      biomarkers. Although there are a number of very different diagnostic imaging methods, e.g.
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
      spectroscopy, or 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET), none of these have gained a
      dominant role as the optimum method for all clinical scenarios.The recently added
      armamentarium, PET/MR, might improve diagnosis in this regard.

      Therefore, we conduct this trial to identify the ability of [11C]Choline PET/MR to evaluate
      the patients with prostate cancer, especially under the circumstance of elevated PSA level.
