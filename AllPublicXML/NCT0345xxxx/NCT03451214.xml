      This research is a dietary intervention study designed to evaluate the effect of progressive
      changes in Zn intake on fatty acid metabolism and to correlate those changes with biomarkers
      of dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. The main objective is to validate plasma fatty acid
      metabolism as a biomarker of inadequate Zn intake in subjects consuming identical diets with
      specific Zn content. The relative sensitivity of some fatty acid enzyme activities will also
      be compared to the DNA strand breaks. In addition to the primary objectives, correlations in
      enzyme activity with changes in fat metabolism, namely circulating triglyceride and
      cholesterol, will be determined. This will enable the determination of the effect of a low Zn
      intake on various aspects of dyslipidemia. Similar correlational analyses will be performed
      with clinical measures of inflammation and insulin resistance.
