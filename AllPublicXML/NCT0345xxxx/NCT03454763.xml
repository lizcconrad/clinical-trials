      Randomized Phase II Trial in sstr2 Positive Tumors to Optimize the Interval Between Cycles of
      PRRT With 177lu-dotatate

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this randomized phase II comparative study is to evaluate the
      Progression Free survival (PFS) and the safety as co-primary objective of two different
      schedule of administrations of 177lu-dotatate: intensive (every 5 weeks) vs no intensive
      (every 8-10 weeks) The secondary objectives are DCR, the late toxicity, OS and dosimetry.
      Patients with any tumor histotype documented as sst2-positive in pre-study period will be
      enrolled in the study.

      The study will include a total of 618 planned patients. They will be randomly assigned to
      receive 5 cycles of PRRT at intervals of 5 or 8-10 weeks between cycles.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;18 years.

          2. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmation of neuroendocrine
             tumors or any other tumor histology type documented as sst2-positive (, that may
             benefit from receptor radionuclide therapy and for which there aren't any other
             effective treatments.

          3. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.criteria also patients without measurable
             but with evaluable disease disease can be enrolled.

          4. Any disease stage is allowed. Patients with documented disease will be admitted to
             therapeutic phase only if the diagnostic OctreoScan (the tumour uptake will be

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.
