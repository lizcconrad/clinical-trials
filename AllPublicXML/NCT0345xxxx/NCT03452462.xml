  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims are to compare Direct His Bundle Pacing (DHBP) with biventricular pacing (BiV) in
      terms of electrical resynchronization using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and also in
      terms of acute hemodynamical effect using finger plethysmography and conduction velocimetry.
      The study will be a randomized crossover design with acute measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      By recruiting native conducting tissue to relay electrical activation of the ventricles via
      the Purkinje fibre network, DHBP may potentially achieve greater electrical resynchronization
      and hemodynamic benefit compared to BiV where the electrical activation wavefronts propagate
      from two discrete pacing sites. Electrical synchrony achieved by these pacing modes have
      however never been compared. Furthermore, the acute hemodynamic effect of DHBP has been
      compared to BiV only in a small single study to date. The aims are to compare DHBP with BiV
      in terms of electrical resynchronization using electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) and also
      in terms of acute hemodynamical effect using finger plethysmography and conduction
      velocimetry. The primary endpoint will be left ventricular activation time, with secondary
      endpoints including various electrical (right ventricular activation time, total ventricular
      activation time etc) and hemodynamic parameters (systolic pressure, cardiac output, cardiac
      contractility). It is expected that DHBP offers shorter left ventricular activation time
      (i.e. better synchrony) and hemodynamic benefit compared to BiV.
