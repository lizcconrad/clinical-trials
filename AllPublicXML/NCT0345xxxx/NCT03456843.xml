  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well surgical removal of the prostate and
      antiandrogen therapy with or without docetaxel work in treating men with newly diagnosed
      prostate cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Androgens can cause the growth
      of prostate cancer cells. Antiandrogen therapy may lessen the amount of androgens made by the
      body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping
      them from spreading. Surgery, antiandrogen therapy and docetaxel may work better in treating
      participants with prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit of combining radical surgery ? cytoreductive radical
      prostatectomy (CRP) - with the best systemic therapy (BST) in men with newly diagnosed
      clinical M1a or M1b metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the impact of CRP+BST on time to biochemical progression, cancer-specific
      survival, complication rates, and quality of life (QOL) in patients with mPCa.

      II. To determine the transcription levels of bone morphogenetic protein -6 (BMP-6) and
      transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?).

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive antiandrogen therapy with or without docetaxel at the discretion
      of the treating physician.

      ARM II: Participants receive antiandrogen therapy for at least 1 month, then undergo
      cytoreductive radical prostatectomy. Participants continue antiandrogen therapy and may
      receive docetaxel within 3 months after surgery at the discretion of the treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months from time of
      progression.
