    <intervention_model_description>Phase 1b The phase 1b part of the study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AMG 592 in subjects with SLE. Subjects will be treated for a total of 12 weeks after which they will be followed for an additional 6 weeks for safety and additional PK/PD data collection. Three dosing cohorts are planned for the phase 1b part of the study.
Phase 2a The phase 2a part of the study is a 52-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo controlled study in subjects with moderate to severe SLE or cutaneous lupus with inadequate response to standard of care therapy. The phase 2a part of the study will commence after a RP2D is identified. Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either AMG 592 or placebo.</intervention_model_description>

             a safety risk, will prevent the subject from completing the study, will interfere with
             the interpretation of the study results, or might cause the study to be detrimental to
             the subject.
