  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is nowadays more and more recognized as an important feature of the
      multiple sclerosis (MS) disease. Cognitive disorders frequency in MS is estimated between 40
      and 60%. Cognitive impairment affects quality of life and vocational status in MS patients.

      Until recently, little information was available on the cognitive dysfunction and their
      evolution that occur in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) as compared with
      relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). In PPMS pathological studies have shown the importance of
      cortical demyelination and meningeal inflammation suggesting that the GM alteration could
      play a major role in the cognitive impairment in this phenotype. The cognitive evolution and
      the brain tissue alteration at the origin of these difficulties remain poorly understood in
      PPMS. The use of new techniques for morphological and functional MRI can study the
      contribution of diffuse White Matter (WM) alteration (probably through disconnexion of
      relevant network) and diffuse Grey matter (GM) alterations in the cerebral cortex and other
      structures (the hippocampi, the cerebellum, and the thalami) in cognitive impairment in PPMS
      patients and on their evolution.

    <measure>Change of composite z cognitive score based on individual neuropsychological scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline (day 0) and at 24 months from baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The composite z cognitive score is the average of z individual cognitive scores. The score from each cognitive test is transformed into z-scores. Z-scores will be calculated for each cognitive score with the following formula: (patient's score - mean value of HC group matched for age, sex, and education level)/standard deviation of the matched HC for each evaluation time (baseline and 2 years).
Individual neuropsychological scores included in composite z cognitive score : the Alertness subtest, the divided attention subtest and the visual-scanning subtest from the TAP, The Symbol-digit-modalities-test, the Paced-Auditory-Serial-Addition-Test 3s, reversed span, the Stroop test, the Verbal fluency, Trail Making test, the California Verbal memory learning test and the Brief visual memory test -revised</description>
