    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is a common condition requiring urgent surgery but is often difficult to
      distinguish from other non-surgical conditions such as urinary infections, pelvic
      inflammatory disease and non-specific abdominal pain. Delay in diagnosis can result in
      significant morbidity and potential mortality. Currently, there is no one diagnostic test
      available and raised inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and White Blood
      Count (WBC) along with an evolving clinical picture, help guide management. However, these
      markers are slow to respond to inflammation and are non-specific for appendicitis. The
      Complement cascade is an immune response to inflammation and infection involving three
      pathways which activate a number of proteins in the blood. Monitoring the absolute levels of
      these proteins should provide a faster and differential diagnostic test. The investigators
      propose a pilot trial to measure concentrations of Complement cascade activation biomarkers
      in the blood during hospital admissions for acute right lower abdominal pain, a symptom of
      appendicitis. Further, analysis of the differential Complement cascade pathway activation
      could potentially identify underlying pathology allowing the clinicians to target therapies.

      The proposed study is a pilot study on a cohort of participants recruited at emergency
      admission with acute right iliac fossa pain (right lower abdominal pain) to the Royal Devon &amp;
      Exeter Hospital Accident &amp; Emergency department. The pilot trial will collect one urine
      sample on admission and blood over a time course for each patient to record blood plasma
      levels of Complement proteins during hospital admissions with suspected appendicitis. The
      assay schedule is detailed in Table 1 below. The trial will perform additional Complement
      cascade activation tests on routine blood samples taken during the patient's stay in
      hospital. In addition 3 trial samples will be taken at time intervals that will capture the
      early Complement cascade response. Those patients going onto surgery will have a total of 5
      additional trial samples taken, with 2 samples taken intra-operatively whilst under
      anaesthesia. From our previous experience in a similar pilot study CPOP (Complement cascade
      Predictors of Procedural Outcome), the investigators have introduced a blood taking 'curfew
      window' in which trial sample No. 2 &amp; 3 must not take place between the hours of midnight and
      0600 hrs. This is to incorporate the wishes of patients and improve compliance with the
      study. Sample analysis will be performed in parallel in the clinical chemistry laboratory for
      assays of CRP and the complement proteins C3 and C4. The additional trial assays will be
      performed by Prof Shaw's research post doctoral assistant in the clinical chemistry
      laboratory and in the Medical School. A fresh frozen urine sample will be acquired from the
      routine urine sample given on all admissions for RIF pain. This urine sample will be analysed
      for Complement activation products such as C3a and C5a. Diagnostic end points will be
      acquired through the routine management of these patients and accessed via the hospital
      imaging (PACS) and pathology (IHCS) reporting system. These will include appendix histology
      and microbiology, urinalysis, blood cultures, imaging and cervical swabs.

      The assays deployed for the CDAA pilot trial will include the current biomarkers of
      Complement consumption, C3 and C4, available in the clinical chemistry laboratory; in
      addition the investigators will use a panel of activation markers including C3dg, C4d, Bb and
      TCC that have been developed during the CPOP clinical trial. Prof Shaw's group now has
      extensive experience with the development, optimisation and internal auditing of the
      activation assays. The assay for the trial will be performed in Prof Shaw's laboratory in
      parallel with the clinical chemistry laboratory who will be responsible for producing
      aliquots from the plasma
