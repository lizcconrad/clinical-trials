  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the clinical efficacy of midline catheters compared to conventional
      treatment in patients with an expected intravenous therapy duration of more than 5 days.
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The study will include 120 patient. Endpoints
      include insertion of CVSs, peripheral venous catheters, catheter patency and a number of
      possible complications.
