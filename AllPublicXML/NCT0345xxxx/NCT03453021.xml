  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to measure the effect of mepolizumab on declines in
      oral corticosteroid therapy (prednisolone or prednisone) in patients with severe eosinophilic
      asthma.

      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that affects 5 to 10% of adults and
      children. Despite current treatments that are often effective, 10% of patients are not
      controlled by inhaled therapies. These severe asthma require regular use of systemic
      corticosteroids in 30 to 40% of cases. In this context, the use of glucocorticoids is
      associated with many more or less serious adverse effects, but still affecting the patient's
      quality of life. Several treatments have already been proven to save systemic steroids
      (theophylline, anti-leukotrienes, golimumab ...). On the other hand, none is currently
      recommended because of a risk / benefit ratio that is too high.

      Mepolizumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inactivates interleukin 5. It
      has recently been shown to be effective in reducing the daily dose of oral corticosteroids
      and in reducing exacerbations in these patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. It also
      reduces the number of eosinophils in the blood and sputum and improves the quality of life.

      Patients will receive a subcutaneous injection of 100mg mepolizumab every 4 weeks for one
      year, for a total of 12 injections.

      In France, this treatment was subject to a Temporary Authorization for Nominative Use in
      severe eosinophilic asthma and is reserved for hospital use.

      The injections will be done in HDJ Pneumology CHU Grenoble Alpes and patients will be
      followed monthly during injections.
