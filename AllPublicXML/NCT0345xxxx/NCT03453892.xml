  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy for the treatment of several cancer entities steadily increased during the last
      years. The data from the finalized and ongoing studies show the tremendous impact of immune
      checkpoint inhibition (ICI) also for advanced metastatic patients. Especially the ICI with
      pembrolizumab and nivolumab have an increasing number of first line treatment approvals.
      However, in particular metastatic patients which receive ICI therapy are often irradiated for
      immediate palliation of several metastases. Preclinical work revealed that radiotherapy (RT)
      is capable to modulate the tumor phenotype, its microenvironment in a way that systemic
      anti-tumor immune responses are induced. However, radiation has also immune suppressive
      properties as e.g. the expression of immune checkpoint molecules is increased following
      radiotherapy. So the ICI therapy in combination with the RT has the potential to overcome the
      immunotolerance of the tumor and the metastases. More and more reports therefore describe a
      so-called systemic immune-modulating effect of radiotherapy (former and still often named as
      abscopal effect). However the timely application of ICI and RT is often randomly and depends
      on the clinical need for the palliative RT. The aim of this trial is therefore to standardize
      the chronology of RT in combination with ICI, to evaluate the effects of radio-immunotherapy
      with a stratified and comparable patient cohort. The ST-ICI study is a prospective and
      observational study not influencing the standard therapeutic scheme and will provide hints
      how the radio-immune therapy drives systemic anti tumor responses.
