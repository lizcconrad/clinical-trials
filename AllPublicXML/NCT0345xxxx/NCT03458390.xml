    <textblock>
      A prospective, single center, study to evaluate the effectiveness of the HyGIeaCare Prep when
      used in combination with the PillCam COLON; the hypothesis is that the HyGIeaCare Prep will
      be easier for the patients to tolerate, and the results will be as good as the existing oral
      preparation.

    <textblock>
      Patients who agree to participate in the study will have their HyGIeaCare procedure and then
      will present to the PillCam COLON room, in the same suite for the PillCam COLON procedure.

      The commercial preparations for the PillCam COLON procedure will be the same, except the
      HyGIeaCare procedure will replace the split polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution
      preparation.

      2-days prior:

        -  Normal diet

        -  10 glasses of liquid

           1-day prior:

        -  Clear liquid diet all day

        -  Dulcolax 2 tabs at 2pm and 2 tabs at 8pm

        -  Nothing by mouth after midnight

      Day of Procedure:

        -  6am- Dulcolax 2 tabs

        -  8am- HyGIeaCare Procedure

        -  9am- ingest PillCam Colon

        -  10am- ingest Reglan

        -  At small bowel detection, drink 10oz SUPREP and 32oz water

        -  3hrs later- drink 10oz SUPREP and 32oz water

        -  2hrs later- insert suppository
