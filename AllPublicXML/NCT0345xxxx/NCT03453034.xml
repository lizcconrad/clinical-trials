  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of TQ-B3233 [ Time Frame: 48 weeks ] [ Designated as safety
      issue: Yes ]The highest dose at which no more than 33% of the subjects experience a
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during treatment.

      Pharmacokinetics of TQ-B3233 (in whole blood):In the study of single-dose, full PK profiles
      will be obtained at H0/H0.5/H1/H2/H3/H5/H8/H10/H12/H24/H48/H72（H means Hour）.In the study of
      multiple-dose,full PK profiles will be obtained at D0/D1/D2/D8/D15/D22/D28（D means Day）.
