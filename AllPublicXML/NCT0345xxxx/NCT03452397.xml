    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have used and/or desired to use an artificial tear substitute for dry eye symptoms
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have had any intraocular surgery (such as cataract surgery), extraocular surgery (such
             as blepharoplasty) in either eye within three months or refractive surgery within
             twelve months of Visit 1

          -  Have a history or presence of any ocular disorder or condition in either eye that
             would, in the opinion of the Investigator, likely interfere with the interpretation of
             the study results or participant safety such as significant corneal or conjunctival
             scarring; pterygium or nodular pinguecula; current ocular infection, conjunctivitis,
             or inflammation not associated with dry eye; anterior (epithelial) basement membrane
             corneal dystrophy or other clinically significant corneal dystrophy or degeneration;
             ocular herpetic infection; evidence of keratoconus; etc. Blepharitis not requiring
             treatment and mild meibomian gland disease that are typically associated with DED are
             allowed.

          -  Have a systemic condition or disease not stabilized or judged by the Investigator to
             be incompatible with participation in the study or with the lengthier assessments
             required by the study (e.g., current systemic infection, uncontrolled autoimmune
             disease, uncontrolled immunodeficiency disease, history of myocardial infarction or
             heart disease, etc.)

          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the procedural agents or study drug components

          -  Have any condition or history that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere
             with study compliance, outcome measures, safety parameters, and/or the general medical
             condition of the subject
