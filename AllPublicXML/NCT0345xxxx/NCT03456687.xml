  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate how the brain and motor behavior changes
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) over time in response to Exenatide. In previous clinical trials, PD
      patients have experienced symptomatic improvement on Exenatide and literature suggests it may
      help slow the progression of Parkinson's. Both will be evaluated in this study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will receive baseline testing to confirm a diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease and
      to determine eligibility in the research study. All of the participants in this study will
      receive the study drug (Exenatide). The study drug will be provided at the end of the first
      visit, and participants will be administered the drug once per week for the duration of the
      study (1 year).

      During the research study the following test may occur: (1) questionnaires about quality of
      life and depression; (2) tests to measure strength and motor function; (3) tests to measure
      cognition; (4) orientation session to learn a precision gripping task; (5) functional MRI
      scan of the brain; (6) structural MRI scan of the brain.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) through use of the UK PD
             brain bank diagnostic criteria

          -  early stage PD patients within 5 years of diagnosis who have never taken Exenatide for
             any reason

          -  PD patients with a Hoehn and Yahr stage less than or equal to 2 when on medication

          -  patients able and willing to sign informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  individuals who have any type of implanted electrical device (such as a cardiac
             pacemaker or a neurostimulator)

          -  individuals with a certain type of metallic clip in the body (i.e., an aneurysm clip
             in the brain)

          -  claustrophobia

          -  women who are or might be pregnant and nursing mothers. Pregnancy tests will be
             carried out for each female subject prior to the MRI scan.

          -  individuals who have a history metalworking involving cutting processes such as
             grinding, filing, shaving, and threading, will need radiological clearance to
             participate in this study. Specifically, individuals who report a history of
             metalworking will be referred to Radiology at Shands University of Florida(UF) for an
             orbitofrontal x-ray.
