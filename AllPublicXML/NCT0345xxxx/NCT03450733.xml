    <textblock>
      This study is in response to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) call to all manufacturers
      with 510(k) clearance for metal-on-metal (MoM) total hip arthroplasty (THA) devices to
      conduct postmarket surveillance studies. MicroPort has various acetabular shells, acetabular
      liners, fixation screws, femoral heads, femoral stems, modular necks, and proximal bodies
      currently cleared for MoM indications. Together these components comprise the Wright Medical
      Technology (WMT) MoM THA System. The primary objective of the study is to determine the
      incidence of adverse local tissue reactions (ALTR) in each THA implanted with the WMT MoM THA
      System overall and for each yearly cross-section from 4-year to 8-year post implant.

    <description>Subjects in Group 1 previously implanted between 4 and 8 years prior to the study start date will be identified from Investigator records. Collected data will be evaluated in aggregate and cross-sectioned by year of implantation. Subjects will be cross-sectioned by the time that has elapsed between implantation and the initial visit (e.g. 4 years, 5 years) using contiguous visit windows (number of years + 6 months). There will be 15 THAs collected for the Year 4 intervals and 35 THAs collected for the remaining intervals.</description>

        Group 1: Subjects previously implanted with components of the Wright Medical Technology
        (WMT) Metal-on-Metal (MoM) Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) System

        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be included in Group 1, subjects must meet all of the following criteria:

          1. Has been implanted with appropriate components of the WMT MOM THA System for at least
             four years +/- six months (i.e., 3.5 years since implantation), but not longer than
             eight years and six months (i.e., 8.5 years since implantation)

          2. Has previously undergone primary THA for any of the following:

               1. non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including osteoarthritis, traumatic
                  arthritis, or avascular necrosis;

               2. inflammatory degenerative joint disease including rheumatoid arthritis;

             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from either study group if they meet any of the following
        criteria:

          1. Subject is currently enrolled in another clinical investigation which could affect the
             endpoints of this protocol

          2. Subject is unwilling or unable to sign the Informed Consent document

          3. Subject has documented substance abuse issues

          4. Subject has an emotional or neurological condition that would pre-empt their ability
             or willingness to participate in the study

          6. Group 1 only: Subject has a condition or previously implanted medical device that
             contraindicates MRI (e.g. pacemaker, implantable defibrillator)

          7. Group 1 only: Subject was skeletally immature (less than 21 years of age) at time of
