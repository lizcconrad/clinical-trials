  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bone fragility is a complication of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes treatments may
      ameliorate or deteriorate bone fragility in this population. Bariatric surgery is gaining in
      popularity in people with type 2 diabetes and may impact bone health. Objectives: To
      determine, in people with type 2 diabetes and obesity undergoing bariatric surgery: (1) the
      impact of 3 bariatric procedures namely sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-in-Y gastric bypass and
      biliopancreatic diversion, on bone fragility; (2) what factors influence bone fragility after
      bariatric surgery.

      Research project overview: This study will involve 3 research centres in the province of
      Quebec. It will include 105 patients with type 2 diabetes who are undergoing bariatric
      surgery (35 patients per type of bariatric procedure) and 20 individuals without type 2
      diabetes and obesity who will serve as controls. Bone density and factors that may influence
      bone density (including improved diabetes control and changes in abdominal fat, muscle mass,
      physical activity, nutrition, hormones, etc.) will be evaluated before surgery and at 1 and 2
      years after surgery.

      Relevance to diabetes: This study is important for both the patient with type 2 diabetes
      undergoing bariatric surgery and healthcare professionals to inform on the benefits and risks
      of each bariatric procedure. It will also help identify factors that could be tested to
      prevent or treat bone fragility in people with type 2 diabetes.

        This is a multi-centre, prospective and observational study comprising 3 bariatric groups
        namely SG, RYGB and BPD (n=35/group) and one control group (n=20). Bariatric groups will
        include adult men and women with type 2 diabetes and obesity undergoing bariatric surgery
        and followed at 0, 1 and 2 years after surgery, and the control group will consist of 20
        individuals with a normal BMI and normoglycemia matched for age and sex and assessed at a
        single visit.

             medication (e.g. glucocorticoids, anti-epileptic drugs, osteoporosis therapy and
             thiazolidinediones) affecting bone metabolism; BMI&gt;60 kg/m2; CT scan impossible to
             perform (e.g. patient too large for the gantry aperture); pregnant women or women who
             plan to become pregnant during the study or women of childbearing age who do not agree
             to take an appropriate contraceptive method during the study; history of oesophageal,
             gastric or digestive surgery; history of bariatric surgery; cancer at risk of
             recurrence during the study; Prosthesis that could interfere with interpretation of
             imaging data; Chronic severe condition or illness precluding from participation in the
             project.
