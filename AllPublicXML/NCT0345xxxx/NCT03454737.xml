  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial, unicentric, prospective, controlled, randomized, double blind
      during the experimental phase A.

      In the experimental phase B, it is contemplated to administer the experimental treatment to
      the subjects included in the group treated with P-PRP in the event that the first treatment
      would be significantly more effective, both from a clinical and regenerative point of view

      -  Main objective

             1. Confirm the presence of patellar tendon gap regeneration after the peritendinous
                and intratendinous infusion of MSV and compare it with the P-PRP group, evaluated
                by ECO, NMR and UTC.

             2. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of infusion of MSC in refractory patellar
                tendinopathy compared with the P-PRP group through the subjective clinical
                evolution of the patient, the EVA and VISA-P questionnaires and the strength of the
                extensor muscle group measured by dynamometry.

        -  Secondary objective 1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of the advanced therapy
           medication MSV and P-PRP when applied by percutaneous infusion into the body of the
           patellar tendinosis, verifying that each of the procedures established in the protocol
           is feasible and recording the possible adverse effects related with both treatments and
           adverse events arising during the period of the clinical trial, whether or not related
           to it
