    <textblock>
      1. The purpose of this study is to develop a validated computational model for assessing
           normative change in these patterns in patients with vocal cord atrophy before and after
           voice therapy.

        2. This is a prospective study comparing two cohorts - patients with vocal cord
           atrophy(VCA) (G1) and healthy controls (G2). Subjects with VCA will receive a cone beam
           computed tomography (CBCT) scan with the standard laryngeal protocol before and after
           voice therapy. Healthy controls will also receive one cone beam computed tomography
           (CBCT) scan. Subjects with VCA (G1) will undergo post-therapy scans approximately 4
           weeks after completion of voice therapy treatment. Enrolled subjects will also undergo a
           video stroboscopy and acoustic/aerodynamic testing. Subjects in G1 typically have these
           procedures performed before and after voice therapy as standard of care. Participants in
           G2 (healthy controls) will have the video stroboscopy and acoustic/aerodynamic testing
           just once since they would not otherwise be scheduled to undergo voice therapy.
           Potential subjects will be between 65 and 80 years of age will be considered for the
           study if they qualify based on inclusion criteria. Potential subjects will undergo are
           pre-screening process involving an initial telephone screening.

        3. Raw data (measured and calculated) derived from this pilot study will be reported, and
           no statistical analysis will be performed. Data from specific aim 1 (G2) and specific
           aim 2 (G1) will be compared using graphical representations such as bar and dot plots.
           There is a potential for the loss of confidentiality; however, every reasonable effort
           will be made to limit breaches of privacy and confidentiality. Subjects may directly
           benefit from this study. In addition, data and conclusions derived from this study may
           help future patients regarding the effects of vocal therapy on vocal cord atrophy (VCA).

      The investigators will recruit up to 12 subjects to account for screen failures. Once 8
      eligible subjects are enrolled (4 per group), then enrollment will end.

    <description>Visualization of vocal cords in slow motion. It uses a stroboscopic lamp, which generates regular flashes of light. A flexible tube is inserted in the back of the mouth or through the nose and into the throat. Video pictures are then recorded while patients are making sound.</description>
