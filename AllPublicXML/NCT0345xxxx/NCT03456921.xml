      This project project will provide an effective, evidence-based intervention for advance care
      planning (ACP) to 50 underserved U.S. communities or those with poor access to healthcare
      systems due to economic, cultural or other barriers. The project will also examine 15 of the
      50 communities to learn about the unique needs of African American communities in regards to
      ACP and to assess the intervention with this population. The team includes the Hospice
      Foundation of America and a university-based research team from Penn State Milton S. Hershey
      Medical Center.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to explore how best to meet the needs of underserved communities
      to improve engagement in the advance care planning (ACP) process, which is defined as a
      complex and ongoing process that involves discussions with loved ones and/or clinicians,
      and/or may involve completion of an advance directive document. To do so, this national
      project will involve two components: 1) a community outreach program, Community Game Days;
      and 2) a research project. The community outreach component seeks to provide an effective,
      evidence based ACP intervention to 50 underserved communities (defined as those with poor
      access to healthcare systems due to economic, cultural or linguistic barriers). Of these, 15
      African American communities across the United States will be selected for participation in
      the research aspect of the project which seeks to assess the program's impact on and to learn
      about the unique needs of African American populations with regard to ACP. A highly
      integrated, collaborative approach will be used, bringing together a national organization
      concerned about end-of-life care (the Hospice Foundation of America (HFA) and a
      university-based academic research team (led by Dr. Lauren Van Scoy at Penn State Milton S.
      Hershey Medical Center through her research program, Project Talk).

      The project teams will organize and support a 14-month long community outreach project that
      will bring an end-of-life conversation game, &quot;Hello,&quot; to 50 communities across the United
      States. The game has been found to stimulate substantive, enjoyable and meaningful
      end-of-life discussions among participants. Further, over 70% of participants who played the
      game went on to perform additional ACP behaviors.2-4 That body of research is limited,
      however, by a primarily Caucasian or South Asian Indian demographic. It is well established
      that African Americans have historically low rates of ACP completion when compared to
      Caucasians and that they often receive overly aggressive and unwanted care at the
      end-of-life.5,6 Thus, learning how best to engage the African American population in ACP
      activities is critical. Thus, this research project aims to determine whether and to what
      extent this priming activity yields similar results in African American communities. The
      research team will conduct mixed methods research on the impact of the game on the
      performance of subsequent ACP behavior as well as explore the broad needs of African American
      communities with regards to ACP.

      Fifteen of the 50 qualified locations who can demonstrate through a screening process the
      ability attract a majority African American audience will be selected to participate in the
      research aspect of the project which will involve: 1) pre-game questionnaires to assess
      population characteristics and readiness to engage in ACP, 2) post- game questionnaires to
      assess satisfaction about the conversation game and readiness to engage in ACP, 3) post-game
      focus groups to further explore opinions about the game, the value of priming activities, and
      the broad needs of the community for encouraging ACP, and 4) 3 month follow-up phone
      interviews to assess ACP behaviors that have been performed and perceived impact of the
      priming activity. Participants from the additional 35 sites can opt-in to participate in a 3
      months follow-up phone call.

      Upon completion of this project, this collaboration is expected to have reached up to 1000
      African American individuals and 1,500 other underserved individuals and provided them with
      an enjoyable and rich experience that facilitates communication about end-of-life issues. The
      research data is expected to provide a significant contribution to the field by yielding
      information about the needs of 15 African American communities as well as to yield data
      related to the impact of the priming activity (the game) on ACP behaviors in this
      traditionally underserved group.

    <intervention_model_description>This project uses an evidence-based and effective intervention--an end-of-life conversation game called &quot;Hello&quot;--to engage and activate participants to perform advance care planning. Quantitative data will be collected before and after immediately playing the game. Focus groups also will be held immediately after the game. Three months after playing the game, participants will complete surveys and also engage in semi-structured interviews about the game and about their ACP activities.</intervention_model_description>

    <intervention_name>End-of-life conversation game called &quot;Hello&quot;</intervention_name>
    <description>To play 'Hello', players are provided 32 open-ended questions in a prearranged order and an equal number of game chips. A player reads aloud the first question. Players then individually write down their answers, and take turns sharing answers with the group (players can opt to pass). Players control how long they share, what they share, and when they are ready to proceed to the next question. During the conversation, players may choose to acknowledge others for a particularly thoughtful, poignant, or even funny comment by giving them a chip. A simple pre-game coin flip determines whether the player with the most chips 'wins' the game ('heads'), or the player with the least amount of chips wins the game ('tails').</description>
