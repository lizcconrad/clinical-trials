  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      : Pain modulation is very important after operation, particularly for women who undergo
      caesarean section. A pain-free postoperative period is essential following a caesarean
      section so new mothers may care for and bond with their neonates. The consequences of the
      improper pain management which raise the healthcare costs and prolong the recovery process.
      Intrathecal adjuvants are often administered during this procedure to provide significant
      analgesia, but they may also have bothersome side effects. Intrathecal midazolam and
      magnesium sulfate produces effective postoperative analgesia with no significant side
      effects.

      Objectives: This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was designed to compare the
      analgesic efficacy and safety of intrathecal midazolam vs. Magnesium sulfate vs plain
      bupivacaine as an adjunct to bupivacaine in pregnancy patients scheduled for elective
      caesarean section.

      The patients were randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomization list to one of
      three groups that contained 50 parturients each via www.randomization.com.

      Group C (control group): 10 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ morphine (1ml) + 2.5
      γ sufentanil (0.5ml) + 1 ml physiological saline.

      Group Mg (magnesium sulfate group): 10 mg hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ Morphine
      (1ml) + 2.5 γ sufentanil (0.5ml) + 100 mg MgSO4 (1 ml).

      Group MDZ (midazolam group): 10 mg hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.5% (2 ml) + 100γ Morphine (1ml) +
      2.5 γ Sufentanil (0.5ml) + 2mg Midazolam (0.4 + 0.6cc physiological saline (1 ml)).

      The parturients as well as the anesthetist who evaluated the protocol did not know the nature
      of the adjuvant injected in spinal anesthesia. The presented syringe contained one of the two
      adjuvants or the physiological serum in the same volume and of the same appearance. It was
      prepared by an anesthesist who was not included in the analysis of the study and was
      presented anonymously to the anesthetist in charge of the patient. A postoperative monitoring
      (PO) was performed during the first 24 hours in the intensive care unit by the anesthesist
      who did not know the nature of the injected adjuvant. All patients were kept nil per os for
      six hours prior to surgery.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The first requirement for analgesic</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperatively, the patients were observed for the duration of analgesia using the Visual Analog Scale for Pain (VAS Pain), from 0 - 10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the most severe pain imaginable) at H2, H4, H6, H10, H12, H24 at rest and coughing or mobilization until supplementary analgesia was required. The duration of effective analgesia was defined as the time interval between administration of the IT drug to the time of first analgesic request or a VAS ≥ 4. Rescue analgesics were given in the form of a paracetamol injection (1g IV) as well as nefopam (20 mg IV) injection once the VAS was recorded as 4 or more.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The sensory blocks</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>. The assessments of the sensory and motor blocks were taken at the end of each minute until the maximum level of block (T4) was achieved and were assessed using a short, beveled 22-gauge needle and tested at the mid_clavicular line on the chest, trunk, and legs on either side. The duration of the sensory block was defined as the time for regression of the sensory block from the maximum block height to the L-1 dermatome as evaluated by a pinprick.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The motor block</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperative</time_frame>
    <description>The motor block was assessed using the Modified Bromage score (1:Complete block (unable to move feet or knees); 2: Almost complete block (able to move feet only); 3: Partial block (just able to move knees); 4: Detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine (full flexion of knees); 5: No detectable weakness of hip flexion while supine; 6: Able to perform partial knee bend).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Hypotension was defined as a more than 20% decrease in the systolic blood pressure from the baseline. It was treated with IV fluids and an additional bolus of intravenous (IV) ephedrine (0.1 mg/kg) was repeated at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist at incremental doses</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bradycardia</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Bradycardia was defined as a decrease in the pulse rate to less than 45 beats per minutes and was treated with an IV injection of 0.5mg atropine sulfate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sedation Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post operative</time_frame>
    <description>The sedation scores were recorded using the observer's assessment of the Ramsay scale (Ramsay 1: Anxious, agitated, restless; Ramsay 2: Cooperative, oriented, tranquil; Ramsay 3: Responsive to commands only; Ramsay 4: Brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; Ramsay 5: Sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; Ramsay 6: No response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maternal satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours post operative</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal satisfaction concerning the anesthetic technique was evaluated by the following score:• Excellent = comfort and satisfactory analgesia• Good = average comfort and acceptable analgesia • Poor = significant and lasting discomfort.</description>
