  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to investigate the current situation of vancomycin
      (VAN)-associated acute kidney injury (VA-AKI) in China and identify the risk factors for
      VA-AKI, as well as to comprehensively examine the risk related to concurrent drug use.
      Further, the investigators assessed the outcomes of patients who developed VA-AKI and the
      risk factors for these outcomes. Finally, the investigators aimed to provide suggestions for
      improving the prevention and treatment of VA-AKI in China.
