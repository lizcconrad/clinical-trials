    <textblock>
      A Phase I Trial of BNC105P in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia(CLL). This study proposes that ibrutinib
      will have far greater efficacy when it is combined with drugs that kill the CLL cells in
      peripheral circulation, thereby preventing them from returning to the protective lymph node
      niche. The study will establish the maximum tolerated dose(MTD) of the combination of BNC105P
      with ibrutinib, characterize the pharmacodynamic effects of BNC105P alone and in combination
      with ibrutinib in CLL cells, and provide preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the
      combination in CLL.

      The study consists of a Screening Period with baseline tumor assessment before BNC105P
      administration, a Treatment Period with up to six 21-day cycles and Follow-up Period.
      Subjects will receive a total of six cycles of therapy unless treatment is discontinued

      A Phase I Trial of BNC105P in combination with BTK inhibitor ibrutinib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib inhibits the pro-survival
      BCR signaling of CLL cells in the stromal niche resulting in their egress to the periphery.
      Importantly, if administration of ibrutinib is stopped, the CLL cells rapidly return to the
      lymph node. In some patients, the drug-induced increase in circulating CLL cells has been
      seen for more than a year reflecting the fact that the cells do not readily die once they
      exit the lymph node. Resistance to ibrutinib has been observed as mutations in the
      drug-binding cysteine in its target, BTK. This resistance is likely to become far more
      prevalent as patients remain on ibrutinib for months or years. We propose that ibrutinib will
      have far greater efficacy when it is combined with drugs that kill the CLL cells in
      peripheral circulation, thereby preventing them from returning to the protective lymph node
      niche. BNC105P works through an entirely different mechanism, i.e. tipping the balance of
      pro-survival and pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member proteins toward the latter, resulting in
      cell death. This pathway of apoptosis occurs at all stages of the cell cycle which is
      important considering that the majority of peripheral CLL cells are non-cycling (in G0).

      The study consists of a Screening Period with baseline tumor assessment before BNC105P
      administration, a Treatment Period with up to six 21-day cycles and Follow-up Period.
      Subjects will receive a total of six cycles of therapy unless treatment is discontinued.

             screening.

          -  Uncontrolled immune hemolysis or thrombocytopenia (positive direct antiglobulin test
             in absence of hemolysis or history of immune-mediated cytopenias are not exclusions).

             without evidence of active viremia (negative hepatitis B DNA) they may still
             participate in the study, but should have hepatitis serologies and hepatitis B DNA

             fibrillation/atrial flutter, sick sinus syndrome, second or third degree
             atrio-ventricular blockade). A cardiology consultation may be obtained to clarify
             clinical significance.

          -  Clinical cardiac heart failure of New York Heart Association Class III or IV or left

             significant medical condition of malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic
             conditions which manifest with diarrhea, refractory nausea, vomiting or any other
             condition that will interfere significantly with the absorption of ibrutinib are
             excluded.

          -  Any condition for which participation in the study is judged by the Investigator to be
             detrimental to the patient with inter-current illness including, but not limited to an
             uncontrolled active infection; unstable angina pectoris; uncontrolled cardiac
             arrhythmia or psychiatric/social situations that would jeopardize compliance with
             study requirements.
