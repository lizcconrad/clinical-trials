    <textblock>
      A phase 2, multicenter, randomized, parallel Assigned, open-label study to explore the
      safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of DAG181/SOF combination for 12 weeks in adult
      subjects with chronic genotype 1 HCV infection.

      Approximately 120 HCV genotype 1 subjects without cirrhosis will be enrolled,
      treatment-experienced subjects are ≤20%, all subjects will be randomized (1:1) to one of the
      following two treatment groups by IWRS (Medidata Balance): a) DAG181 100 mg/ SOF 400 mg once
      daily for 12 weeks, b) DAG181 200 mg/ SOF 400 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Randomization will
      be stratified by &quot;treatment-naive&quot; or &quot;treatment-experienced&quot;.

               1. Treatment naive is defined as having never been exposed to approved or
                  experimental HCV-specific direct-acting antiviral agents or prior treatment of
                  HCV with interferon (with or without ribavirin);

                  containing interferon (IFN-α,β or Peg-IFN±RBV) that was completed at least 2
                  months prior to screening. and the subject's medical records must include
                  sufficient detail of prior virologic failure to allow for categorization of prior
                  response, as either:

             i) Non-Responder: Decrease of HCV RNA＜2 log at week 12 compared to baseline; ii)
             Partially-Responder: Decrease of HCV RNA＞2 log at week 12 compared to baseline, and
             detectable HCV RNA levels within week 12 and week 24; iii) Breakthrough/Relapse:
             Subject achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels (HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ) during treatment, but
             did not achieve sustained virologic response (SVR); iv) Intolerance: Subjects have
             discontinued interferon-based treatment due to intolerance which proved by chief
             complaint or medical records.
