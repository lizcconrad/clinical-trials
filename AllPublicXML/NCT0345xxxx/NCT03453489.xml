  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot trial studies how well telotristat etiprate works in treating participants with
      well differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm that has spread to other places in the body and
      monitored by carbon C 11 alpha-methyltryptophan (AMT)-emission tomography (PET). Telotristat
      etiprate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Studying the changes within the tumor cells via AMT-PET may help doctors better
      understand how tumors respond to treatment with telotristat etiprate.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of telotristat etiprate (telotristat ethyl) treatment in patients
      with advanced neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) using carbon C 11 alpha-methyltryptophan
      (alpha-[11C]methyl-?L-?tryptophan) (AMT)-?positron emission tomography (PET) as measured by
      changes in tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Show that NETs will have increased AMT uptake on PET, as compared to surrounding non-tumor
      tissue at baseline.

      II. Use compartmental modeling (in tumors with the left ventricle of the heart in the
      field-of-view) to measure change in AMT retention.

      III. Measure change in AMT retention as mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean).

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo AMT-PET within 7 days prior to, and 9-14 days after start of telotristat
      etiprate treatment. Participants receive telotristat etiprate orally (PO) three times a day
      (TID) for 9-14 days.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 3 months.
