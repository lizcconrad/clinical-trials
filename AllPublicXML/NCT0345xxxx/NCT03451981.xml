  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis are important disease entities as a result of their high prevalence and the
      lack of a standard mode of therapy.

      Based on the available data, the non-surgical therapy of peri-implantitis doesn't seem to be
      effective in disease resolution. Surgical access to peri-implantitis lesions facilitates the
      removal of all granulation tissue from the defect area as well as a thorough debridement and
      decontamination of exposed implant surfaces.

      Numerous approaches have been used for implant surface decontamination during peri-implant
      surgery, including mechanical, chemical and laser treatments.

    <textblock>
      Peri-implantitis, defined as an inflammatory lesion in the surrounding peri-implant tissues
      with loss of supporting bone, are important disease entities as a result of their high
      prevalence and the lack of a standard mode of therapy. Although the current epidemiological
      data are limited, peri-implantitis affects 28-56% of the subjects and 12-43% of the implants.
      Peri-implantitis, if not successfully treated, may lead to complete disintegration and
      implant loss. Based on the available data, the non-surgical therapy of peri-implantitis
      doesn't seem to be effective in disease resolution, because only limited improvements in the
      main clinical parameters have been reported and there is a clear tendency for disease
      recurrence. It is therefore recommended to consider advanced therapies, such as surgical
      interventions, when non-surgical peri-implant therapy is unable to achieve significant
      improvements in the clinical parameters. Surgical access to peri-implantitis lesions
      facilitates the removal of all granulation tissue from the defect area as well as a thorough
      debridement and decontamination of exposed implant surfaces.

      Numerous approaches have been used for implant surface decontamination during peri-implant
      surgery, including mechanical, chemical and laser treatments. Using conventional mechanical
      means, eradication of pathogens on implant surfaces with threads and often with rough surface
      structures is difficult. Treatment models, such as debridment, effectively used to treat
      teeth with periodontitis, cannot be used in the same way on rough threaded implant surfaces.
      The implant rough surface structure also provides the bacteria with ''protected areas'',
      inaccessible to conventional mechanical removal.

      A treatment protocol that may offer an advantage over traditional mechanical treatment
      includes the use of laser therapy. Data have shown that treatments with Er:YAG lasers have a
      bactericidal effect. Er:YAG laser treatment can debride the implant surface effectively and
      safely. Slightly better clinical results in terms of bleeding on probing and clinical
      attachment level have been reported by Er:YAG laser treatment as compared with traditional
      non-surgical mechanical debridement with plastic curette and pellet with saline in the
      surgical treatment of peri implantitis.

      The air abrasive method for the removal of bacterial plaque on tooth surfaces has also been
      used in the treatment of peri-implantitis, demonstrating no relevant adverse effects. Until
      recently, air-polishing devices have used a slurry of water and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)
      and pressurized air/water. A less abrasive method using an amino acid glycine has been proven
      to be effective in removing bacterial biofilm structures in deep periodontal pockets and safe
      by not causing emphysema. Moreover the use of a glycine-based powder does not seem to cause
      titanium implant surface changes.

      The aim of the present randomized controlled clinical trial will be to assess the efficacy in
      improving clinical parameters of two further methods of implant surface decontamination
      (Er:YAG laser or air-abrasive device) after mechanical and chemical cleaning during surgical
      treatment (access flap) of peri-implantitis.
