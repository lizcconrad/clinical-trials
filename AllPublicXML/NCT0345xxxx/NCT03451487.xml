      healthy volunteers.

      Acetaminophen (AAP) is the most popular used analgesic/ antipyretic drug with serious
      hepatotoxic adverse effects; suicidal or unintentional overdose of AAP-induced
      hepatotoxicity. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is thought contribute to the responsible
      reactive metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone (NAPQI) of AAP overdose-induced hepatotoxicity.
      Pharmaceutical excipients are inactive ingredients that are added to a pharmaceutical
      compound. The objective of this study was to investigate the possible response of Panadol®
      (AAP alone) and SafeTynadol® (AAP with various selected excipients combination) formulations,
      while observing the AAP toxic metabolites (AAP-Cys) circumstances change in healthy
      volunteers. According to the current safety data, could be potentially develop
      hepatotoxicity-free AAP new formulation drug.

    <time_frame>PK samples were collected at pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours post dose (a total of 13 samples per subject in each period).</time_frame>
    <description>Concentrations of acetaminophen and it metabolites (AAP-Glc、AAP-Sul、GS-Catechol、GS-AAP、AAP-Cys、AAP-NAC) in plasma will be measured by a specific and sensitive LC/MS/MS method developed in the laboratory of Clinical Pharmacokinetic Laboratory of Tri-Service General Hospital. According to the pharmacokinetic parameters of AAP and its metabolites in health subjects oral Panadol® (AAP alone) and SafeTynadol (AAP with various selected excipients combinations) to assess the safety information. The study will be conducted to validate the precision, accuracy (including with-run and between-run variation), linearity, specificity, reproducibility, limit of quantitation based on recovery studies. Assays will be performed in the laboratory of Clinical Pharmacokinetic Laboratory of Tri-Service General Hospital. Spiked samples of known concentrations will be analyzed together for quality control of the assay method.</description>
