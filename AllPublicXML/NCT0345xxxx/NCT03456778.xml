  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to utilize a real-time ultrasound modality known as
      real-time Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) to first study the viscoelastic properties of the
      Achilles tendon to understand the functional differences between normal/asymptomatic vs
      tendinotic/symptomatic tendon states. The secondary aim will be to assess the degree of
      tendon healing after percutaneous tenotomy (a minimally invasive technique that can be used
      to treat tendinosis) and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) targeting mid-substance Achilles
      tendinopathy. Utilizing a quantitative tool to assess healing response to percutaneous tendon
      fenestration and PRP injection may have significant clinical implications because it will
      provide insight into the mechanism of Achilles tendon healing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Achilles tendinopathy is a common affliction in athletes, recreational exercisers, the
      general population and even inactive people. Tendon pathology presenting clinically is most
      commonly seen in the chronic state and the exact pathogenesis of this disease has not been
      clarified scientifically.

      The first part of the study aims to establish the difference between asymptomatic and
      symptomatic Achilles tendons by correlating elastography measurements (axial and sagittal
      mean velocity and relative anisotropic coefficient) with more standard clinically based
      outcome measures. Shear Wave Elastography (SWE) will be used with a small group of patients
      affected by moderate-to-severe, chronic (&gt;6 months of symptoms) midsubstance Achilles
      tendinopathy in comparison to asymptomatic patients.

      After establishing a range of normal to severe pathologic elastography measurements the
      researchers will conduct a 12-month clinical trial to determine whether percutaneous needling
      with PRP injection improves disease-specific clinical outcomes. PRP injection is commonly
      used in clinical practice to treat chronic tendinopathy. The pathophysiology is believed to
      be mediated through a variety of growth factors, including platelet-derived growth factor,
      transforming growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor, that promote a healing response.
      One of the main advantages is that PRP is autologous and is prepared at the time of treatment
      (point of care). It has an excellent safety profile with almost no side effects. SWE imaging
      will then be used to assess degree of tendon healing following tenotomy-PRP injection.

    <description>The VISA-A scale assesses the severity of chronic Achilles tendinopathy. This 8-item, self-administered questionnaire asks about Achilles tendon pain, daily living function, and sporting activity. Total scores can range from 0 to 100, with 0 representing worst pain and function and 100 signifying no pain or limitations to function. Scores below 70 indicate the presence of Achilles tendinopathy.</description>

    <description>7 cubic centimeters (cc) of blood will be collected and processed for the PRP injection. The site to be injected will be prepared with isopropyl alcohol and then sprayed with ethyl chloride to achieve cutaneous anesthesia. Next, with continuous sonographic visualization, the skin and subcutaneous tissues overlying the posterior mid-Achilles tendon will be infiltrated with 0.5% bupivacaine and 1% sodium bicarbonate (50 milliequivalents (mEq)/50 mL) via a 25-gauge hypodermic needle. Once adequate anesthesia is achieved, a 20-gauge needle will be used to repeatedly fenestrate the tendinotic portion of the tendon along the long plane. Any calcifications within the substance of the tendon will be mechanically fragmented. When the region of interest has been treated, a PRP injection (5 cc) will be delivered. Each patient will then be provided a post-procedure care form with specific information regarding initial physical activity limitation and return to normal activity.</description>
