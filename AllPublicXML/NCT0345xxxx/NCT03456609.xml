    <textblock>
      The efficacy and safety of cancer patients in patients with gastrointestinal cancer
      (Palliative care) in patients with gastrointestinal tumor (chemotherapy) were prospectively,
      randomized blind, multicenter clinical trials. They were randomly divided into 2 groups, test
      group Shenqifuzheng injection of 500 ml, the control group 0.9% sodium chloride injection,
      500 ml, intravenous drip, 1 times a day, 14 days post, rest is 7 days, 21 days each for a
      period of treatment, observation of two procedures. At the same time, according to the NCCN
      guide and the health ministry issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer
      treatment. The main curative effect of the clinic was to evaluate the pretreatment of cancer
      due to the fatigue score of the patients before and after treatment -- the Piper fatigue
      revision scale was used to evaluate the Chinese version. Assess effectiveness and safety
      based on clinical assessment

      Factors for the purpose of this study by observing theShenqifuzheng injection before and
      after treatment in patients with carcinoma due to fatigue scale scores, the classification of
      syndromes, the quality of life score changes and related laboratory index, evaluation factors
      ginseng and astragalus injection on the digestive tract tumor (chemotherapy) in patients with
      cancer-related fatigue and quality of life improved efficacy and safety. The experimental
      group was randomly divided into 2 groups, experimental group Shenqifuzheng injection of 500
      ml. The control group was 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 500ml, intravenous drip, 1 time
      daily, 14 days for continuous use, 7 days of rest, and 1 treatment for each 21 days, and 2
      courses were observed. At the same time, according to the NCCN guide and the health ministry
      issued the diagnosis and treatment guidelines for cancer treatment.

      Main efficacy evaluation indexes before and after treatment for cancer-related fatigue rating
      - adopting the Piper fatigue scale revised Chinese version, compare the experimental group
      and the control group before and after treatment cancer-related fatigue rating difference
      have differences. Secondary efficacy evaluation index to compare the ECOG score difference
      before and after the treatment, the quality of life score difference before and after the
      treatment, TCM syndrome curative effect, single symptom curative effect of immune function,
      tumors had curative effect (if any) and chemotherapy completion. Safety assessment includes
      the observation of vital signs, blood routine, urinary routine, routine stool, liver
      function, renal function, electrocardiogram examination, and adverse reactions during the
      treatment.
