      This phase I study is designed to establish the safety, maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the ERK inhibitor ulixertinib (BVD-523) when combined
      with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.

      This phase I study is designed to establish the safety, maximally tolerated dose (MTD) and
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the ERK inhibitor ulixertinib (BVD-523) when combined
      with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib.

      Up to a maximum of 30 adult patients will be enrolled in the 5 possible dose escalation
      cohorts. These patients will have histologically confirmed advanced solid tumor disease
      refractory to standard of care therapy, or for which there is no accepted standard of care.

      Finally, 15 adult patients will be treated at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) in the
      expansion cohort involving metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have received at least
      one line of therapy in the metastatic setting.

             free for at least five years

         13. Impaired GI function or GI disease that may significantly impair absorption (e.g.,
             inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), malabsorption syndrome, small bowel resection,
