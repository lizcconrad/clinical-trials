  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double blind prospective randomized controlled trial in which the effect of single shot
      levobupivacaine 0,25% will be compared with the effect of levobupivacaine 0.25% in
      association with dexmedetomidine when performing an ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve
      block , in patients undergoing a mastectomy with axillar procedure.

      The difference in effect will be evaluated by monitoring the postoperative morphine
      consumption in both groups .

      Our hypothesis is that there is a significant decrease in morphine consumption during the
      first 24h postoperatively due to association of dexmedetomidine to the local anesthetic
      compared to the local anesthetic alone when performing a ultrasound guided modified pectoral
      nerve block. The morphine consumption will be our primary outcome parameter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women (18+, American Society of Anesthesiologists 1,2,3) undergoing a mastectomy with axillar
      procedure will be randomised and receive a ultrasound guided modified pectoral nerve block if
      they meet in and exclusion criteria and provide written informed consent.

      Using a two needle approach, ten milliliters of local anesthetic is injected under ultrasound
      guidance between the major and minor pectoral muscle and twenty milliliters between the minor
      pectoral and the serratus anterior muscle, on the side to be operated.

      Every patient receives intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia with morphine and
      dehydrobenzperidol (1mg/ml morphine, 50µg dehydrobenzperidol/ml).

      Furthermore every patient in the trial will receive ketorolac 0.5mg/kg three times a day and
      paracetamol four times 1g per day.

      When the analgesia using the intravenous Patient Controlled Analgesia regime isn't
      sufficient, the anesthetist will titrate with morphine until pain free using a protocol (a
      bolus of 2mg morphine IV every ten minutes until pain free).
