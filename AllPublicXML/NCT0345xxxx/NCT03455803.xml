      This study will investigate the changes in the reflux symptom index (RSI) and reflux finding
      score (RFS) among patients with obstructive sleep apnea after regular humidified CPAP
      therapy. Since these two diseases have strong associations then one may consider the possible
      benefits from therapy in between them.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have to stop proton pump inhibitors (PPI) therapy 1 month before enrollment
             in the study.

          -  To be eligible as LPR patients in our study, patients must have presented a RSI score
             &gt; 13 and a RFS score &gt; 7. These thresholds were highly correlated with pathological pH
             monitoring (pH &lt; 4)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Noncompliance for CPAP Use: According to the standard Medicare criteria to define CPAP
             compliance, the patients who demonstrated CPAP use ≥ 4 h/ night for ≥ 70% of the
             nights are considered compliant.

          -  Antireflux therapy during the period of the study.
