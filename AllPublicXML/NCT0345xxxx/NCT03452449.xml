  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date it is unknown how physical activity levels in adults is limited before and after
      lumbar spine surgery and if physical activity level is associated with disability and
      limitations of quality of life. The main objective is to compare physical activity
      preoperatively and 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery
      with norm data. In addition, the investigators will study the association of changes in
      physical activity, disability and quality of live.

      Patients scheduled for planned lumbar spine surgery will be contacted to participate in this
      study. All outcomes will be assessed within 1 week preoperatively and at 6 and 12 weeks
      postoperatively. Changes in outcome scores will be detected using analysis of variance.
      Association of changes in physical activity and changes in secondary outcomes will be
      detected using stepwise linear regression models.
