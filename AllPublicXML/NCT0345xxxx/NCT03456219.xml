    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effect of different dietary conducts in the nocturnal period on the
      postprandial metabolism and food perceptions of night workers of the Hospital of Clinics of
      Uberlândia, Federal University of Uberlândia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to imbalances in the circadian rhythm, shift workers may present inadequate eating
      habits, which provoke metabolic and nutritional disorders. In this crossover study the
      participants consumed, at different times and separated by 6 days interval, two meals
      pre-established at the time of night work: a control and a higher-protein. On the day of each
      intervention, the participants were evaluated for response of blood and subjective markers
      after meal (glucose, insulin, triglycerides and subjective perceptions related to ingestion
      after each meal). It is expected that the standardization of a glycemic reduction diet will
      improve the metabolic response of the workers, demonstrated in the results of the biochemical
      parameters. If this scenario is confirmed, it is still expected that the data and results
      obtained in this study may serve as subsidies for the elaboration of nutritional
      interventions consistent with the work routine at night.

    <description>To evaluate appetite, satiety and postprandial satisfaction, a visual analogue scale was applied before and after consumption of the proposed meal, with the questions, &quot;How much hunger did you have before the meal?&quot;; &quot;After the meal, how did you feel?&quot;; &quot;How much did you like the meal?&quot;, Signaling all responses on a 0 to 10 cm scale.</description>

    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected before and after (30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes) the consumption of each of the meals at nighttime (work schedule). In the first meal of the following day (standard breakfast) were determined the serum concentrations of glucose (mg/dL), insulin (mU/mL) and triglycerides (mg/dL).</description>
