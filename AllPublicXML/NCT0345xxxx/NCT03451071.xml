  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers are on the rise in the United States. Furthermore,
      greater than 90% of cervical cancer cases are attributable to HPV, and cervical cancer
      disproportionately affects women of color in both incidence and mortality. Due to low HPV
      vaccine uptake in the US, innovative approaches to vaccinating vulnerable populations are
      necessary in order to maximize the cancer prevention potential of this vaccine. The
      puerperium is a time period when women are engaged in the healthcare system and have almost
      universal access to affordable health care. Two prior studies have shown that postpartum HPV
      vaccination is acceptable to patients, and high rates of vaccination were achieved in these
      primarily Hispanic populations. However, data show that the immune response in young women is
      less robust than in adolescents, and no studies have examined immunogenicity in postpartum
      women specifically. We propose an HPV vaccination pilot study in women who receive postpartum
      care at University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) hospital. We will examine the
      acceptability, uptake and immunogenicity of the vaccine in the postpartum setting.
