  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COPD is characterised by irreversible airflow limitation that is usually progressive and
      associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response. This inflammation can be amplified
      with flare-ups that are commonly seen in COPD patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation is one of
      the most effective methods of managing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
      Pulmonary rehabilitation has been seen to induce improvements in functional capacity and
      quality.

      In healthy individuals, exercise has been shown to induce an anti-inflammatory response when
      performed regularly. However, the effects of exercise on inflammation in COPD are unclear.
      Our initial CIMPRES-COPD study has looked into the effects of short-term exercise, as part of
      pulmonary rehabilitation, on inflammation. However, this trial will examine the inflammatory
      response in COPD patients who are most active following pulmonary rehabilitation against
      those who are least active.

      This study will split participants into 2 groups according to physical activity level
      following pulmonary rehabilitation. We will recruit 40 COPD patients who provided a sample in
      the initial CIMPRES-COPD study to explore inflammatory responses in those who are most active
      and least active. By better understanding the mechanisms of how long-term physical activity
      levels affects inflammation in COPD, we could design better interventions to increase
      physical activity levels following pulmonary rehabilitation.
