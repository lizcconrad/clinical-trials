  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the preoperative assessment clinic (PAC) is to ensure optimal anaesthesia, reduce
      the morbidity associated with surgery, to increase the quality and decrease the cost of
      perioperative care 1. In addition, the PAC is an appropriate time to educate the patient on
      anaesthesia, perioperative care, and pain treatments, to reduce anxiety, to develop care
      plans, and to obtain informed consent. Moreover, a strong correlation exists between the time
      spent at the PAC and patient satisfaction2,3.

      A high variability of preoperative assessment clinic (PAC) times is a reason for waiting time
      for patient. A better match between the reserved PAC time and the real consultation time
      could improved efficiency in consultation theatre. The PAC time depends on various
      parameters. On average the preoperative assessment of patients with a higher American Society
      Anesthesiologists' (ASA) class requires more time 4. In other monocentric study, the mean
      (SD) procedure time was 13 (6) min for the physician. It was significantly longer for
      patients with a higher ASA class : 10 min for ASA I, 14 min for ASA II, 17 min for ASA III
      and 21 min for ASA IV patients. In this monocentric study, every patient had a nurse
      consultation before PAC by the anesthesiologist.

      The primary endpoint of this study was to assess the time involved in preoperative assessment
      clinic included the time during patient's health status has to be assessed (this encompasses
      a medical history and physical examination) and the time during the patient education on
      anaesthesia, perioperative care and pain treatments, to reduce anxiety, to develop care plans
      and to obtain informed consent.

    <description>total time (min) is defined by the time between patient entry and discharge from the consultation office. It integrates time for patient assessment (this encompasses a medical history and physical examination) and time for patient information on the benefits and risks of the chosen anesthetic strategy (patient education on anaesthesia, perioperative care and pain treatments, to reduce anxiety, to develop care plans and to obtain informed consent)</description>
