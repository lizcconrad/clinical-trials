  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: to search for reasons for seeking orthodontic treatment, compliance during orthodontic
      treatment, drop-out from orthodontic treatment and success of orthodontic treatment.

      Methods: evaluation before, during and at the end of orthodontic treatment. Clinical and
      diagnostic evaluation of complexity before and at the end of orthodontic treatment,
      evaluation of awareness of treatment need, impact on social and psychological aspects,
      functional disturbances, impact of malocclusion on quality of life, social interaction,
      ability to perform daily activities.

      Data will include diagnostic measurements on study casts, x-rays, and data from
      questionnaires given to children and parents. Statistical analyses will explore predictors of
      treatment success with treatment need, compliance and psycho-social domains.
