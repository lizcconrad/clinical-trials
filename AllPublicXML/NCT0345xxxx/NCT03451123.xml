  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are:

        1. Determine the percentage of patients whose surgical plan would change with FET-PET/MRI
           compared to MRI alone.

        2. Determine the percentage of patients who have residual tumor after surgery detected with
           FET-PET/MRI.

      A secondary objective of this study is:

      1) Perform preliminary correlations between the pre- and post-surgical metabolic tumor
      volumes measured with FET-PET/MRI to progression free survival.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must have a known or suspected primary brain tumor with a non-enhancing
             component with planned standard of care surgical resection. Patients with newly
             diagnosed or recurrent brain tumors are eligible.

          2. Tumors with non-enhancing regions will be defined as T2/FLAIR hyperintensity extending
             at least 0.5 cm beyond areas of enhancement as assessed by MRI.

          3. Patient must be 18 years of age or younger at the time of study enrollment.

          4. Patient must have measurable disease defined as tumor measurable in two perpendicular
             dimensions on MRI greater than 1 cm.

          5. Patient must have a life expectancy greater than 8 weeks.

          6. Patient must be able to undergo FET-PET/MRI without sedation.

          7. Females with childbearing potential must have a negative urine Î²-hCG test on the day
             of procedure or a serum hCG test within 48 hours prior to the administration FET.
             Females who have not reached menarche will not require pregnancy testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient must not be receiving an investigational or standard of care anti-cancer drug
             within 6 months prior to the FET-PET/MRI study.

          2. Patient must not have received radiation therapy within the past 6 months.

          3. Patient must not have a contraindication to contrast-enhanced MRI (e.g. renal
             insufficiency, incompatible implant).

          4. Patient must not be pregnant or breast feeding.

          5. Patient must not have been treated for another cancer within 5 years with the
             exception of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma.

          6. Patients must not have a history of brain metastases.
