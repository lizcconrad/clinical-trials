  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TREATMENT is an observational study addressing the need for knowledge and adequate diagnostic
      biomarkers in the response assessment of patients with brain metastasis. Reliable response
      assessment will be highly relevant in the coming years given the introduction of
      next-generation cancer drugs, including immunotherapy. This project uses advanced Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Vessel Architecture Imaging (VAI) to better understand the
      response to traditional stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and immunotherapy.

      Secondary objectives include:

      In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods
      to reveal parameters of traditional, immunotherapeutic, and anti-angiogenic therapy response.

      In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods
      to compare results with traditional biomarkers.

      Use existing infrastructure at Oslo University Hospital to standardize therapy monitoring.

      In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods
      to separate real tumor progression from treatment-induced pseudoprogression or radionecrosis

      In patients with brain metastases, use advanced MRI and Vessel Architectural Imaging methods
      to assess whether anti-angiogenic drugs improve delivery of chemotherapy.

             adequate parametric statistical assessments. For a perfusion MRI resolution of
             1.2x1.2x5mm, this equals a tumor volume of 0.2cubic centimeters (cc).

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status â‰¤1 (Karnofsky â‰¥60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 6 weeks

          -  Eligible for stereotactic radiosurgery

          -  Have normal organ functions per clinical guidelines

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Previously untreated asymptomatic brain metastases - or - progressive brain metastases
             after systemic therapy or prior local therapy such as radiation or surgery as defined
             by:

               1. Untreated measurable lesions in patients that have received surgery and/or SRS to
                  one or more other lesions

               2. Residual or progressive lesions after surgery if asymptomatic

               3. Patients who have had prior whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) and/or SRS and
                  then whose lesions have progressed are eligible. Lesions treated with SRS may be
                  eligible if there is unequivocal evidence of progression

               4. Progression after prior systemic therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who received major surgery must have recovered adequately from the
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.

          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or hypersensitivity to ipilimumab or any of its
             excipients (Cohorts C and D).

             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

          -  Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

          -  Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.
