  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Oxaliplatin-based doublets plus bevacizumab are standard first-line therapy options for
           patients (pts) with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Slight adjustments in
           chemo-dosage are commonly applied in routinely practice to elderly pts, but those
           modified schedules have never been standardized

        -  The addition of oxaliplatin versus no oxaliplatin to treatment with 5-fluorouracil in
           older and frail untreated pts with mCRC resulted in a non-statistically significant
           trend toward improvement in Progression Free Survival (PFS) and a lack of benefit in
           Overall Survival (OS)

        -  In elderly pts deemed unfit for an upfront combined chemotherapy a fluoropyrimide-based
           monotherapy plus bevacizumab is considered a reasonable first-line treatment

        -  Clinical definition of elderly (over 70 years old) pts with CRC that may deserve a more
           or less intensive combination therapy is still debated. The cut-off of 75 years old
           combined with ECOG PS assessment is a reasonable approach for clearly defining
           candidates to different approaches

        -  Several geriatric screening tools have been used to identify pts with a geriatric
           profile potentially predicting for overall survival and risk of toxicity. The G8
           screening tool has been already validated in pts with cancer showing the strongest
           prognostic value for OS; the CRASH score is able to stratify pts according an estimated
           risk of treatment-related toxicities

      On the basis of these considerations, we designed the present observational study of
      first-line therapy with bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin in
      previously untreated elderly pts affected by unresectable mCRC in order to evaluate its
      efficacy in real world practice (as measured by progression free survival)
