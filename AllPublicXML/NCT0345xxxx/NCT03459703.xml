  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Time-restricted feeding (TRF) is a novel type of intermittent fasting that involves eating
      within a daily period of 10 hours or less, followed by fasting for at least 14 hours daily.
      Several studies in rodents report that TRF reduces body weight, improves blood sugar control,
      and reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease—even when food intake is matched to the
      control group or no weight loss occurs. Preliminary evidence suggests that TRF may also
      increase weight loss, fat loss, and reduce the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in
      humans. This study will test whether TRF enhances fat loss and increases weight loss in
      adults with obesity, relative to conventional dieting alone. In addition, this study will
      determine whether TRF reduces risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and
      will measure the feasibility and acceptability of TRF.
