    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test the effects of the SMART-3RP (Stress Management and Resiliency
      Training Relaxation Response Resiliency Program) on quality of life, mental health,
      arrhythmia burden, and heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (PAF).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mind-body practices that elicit the relaxation response (RR) have been used worldwide to
      prevent and treat disease. The Stress Management and Resiliency Training - Relaxation
      Response Resiliency Program (SMART-3RP) is an 8-week manualized psycho-educational program
      that incorporates RR methods such as meditation or seated yoga along with cognitive skills
      building and lifestyle approaches to increase resiliency to stress. This study will use a
      randomized, wait-list controlled trial design to test the effects of the SMART-3RP on quality
      of life (QoL), mental health, arrhythmia burden, and HRV in patients with PAF. The program
      will be delivered virtually (via computer video conferencing), questionnaires will be
      completed, and physiological data as well as blood will be collected.

    <description>This is an 8-week, multimodal resiliency program that targets stress with 4 main components: mind-body skills (participants learn a variety of meditation techniques, mini relaxations, walking meditation, and yoga), traditional stress management techniques, healthy lifestyle behaviors (sleep, exercise, nutrition, and social support), and cognitive reappraisal and adaptive coping skills (borrowed from cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and positive psychology)</description>
