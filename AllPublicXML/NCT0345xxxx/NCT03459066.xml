  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spasticity is part of the syndrome motor neuron following a Stroke. It is a clinical sign of
      great complexity that generates disability, limiting the function and altering the quality of
      life of the subjects, generating great impact on families and society.

      Identify times and characteristics of appearance; as well as its predictive factors can
      support an early intervention, orienting and strengthening the work of the rehabilitation
      team.

      Determine the times of establishment, location and factors that favor the development of
      spasticity in acute stage and how it influences the functionality, quality of life and
      emotional level of post-stroke patients in hospital facilities.

      Through this proposal, it is proposed to generate a new line of research that allows the
      development of scientific evidence in the area of neurorehabilitation, specifically in the
      field of spasticity, through the identification of establishment times, affected structures
      and predominant patterns in the extremities; as well as determining factors that favor the
      development of spasticity and its impact on post-stroke functionality and quality of life.

      This information will strengthen the rehabilitative process of these subjects and the actions
      of the rehabilitation team, supporting the identification of preventive measures and
      implementing effective interventions that allow achieving better motor and functional
      results, in search of an optimal recovery.

      A correlational (non-experimental), longitudinal, prospective follow-up design will be used
      for descriptive and predictive purposes.

      The sample will consist of 150 subjects who meet the inclusion criteria, sign the informed
      consent and who will be treated during the year 2018 at the Hospital and the Clinic.

      The study will include three measurement times: Time 1, during the first 10 days of
      hospitalization (T1); Time 2, at 3 months after T1; and Time 3, at 12 months after T1.

      At each time of measurement, the study variables will be evaluated by 4 professionals trained
      in the following instruments: the Ashworth Scale to assess spasticity; To measure global
      functionality, the Barthel Index will be applied and, to assess functionality of the upper
      extremity, the Action Research Arm scale will be used; The Quality of Life Scale for
      Stroke-38 will be used to assess quality of life and emotional level. In addition, in time 1
      the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the sample will be evaluated through a
      clinical record prepared for this purpose.

    <description>Instrument used in the assessment of spasticity. Graduates the tone from 0 (no increase in tone) to 4 (rigid extremity in flexion or extension), it is based on the examiner manually moving a limb of the patient, in the whole of the possible joint range (in the clinical setting it is use 1 second to perform the complete joint travel) and perceive the resistance that a muscle offers when stretched.</description>

    <measure>Action Research Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This Instrument was constructed to determine the functional recovery of the upper limb. It is composed of 19 items grouped in 4 subtest, including each subtest: 6 items of grip, 4 items taken, 6 items of clip, 3 items of thick movement. All the items are evaluated with a scale of 4 points from 0 to 3, where 0 represents no movement and 3 normal movement for the task.</description>

    <description>Scale that assesses the level of patient independence with respect to performing Activity Daily Life. The values assigned to each activity depend on the time spent and help to carry it out.
The activities are valued differently, being able to assign 0, 5, 10 or 15 points. The global range can vary between 0, completely dependent, and 100 points, completely independent.</description>
