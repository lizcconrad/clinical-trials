      To demonstrate bioequivalence of single dose test formulation of Losartan potassium tablets
      (containing Losartan potassium 100 mg) of Pharmtechnology LLC, Republic of Belarus with
      reference Cozaar® (containing Losartan potassium 100 mg) of &quot;Merck Sharpe &amp; Dohme B.V.&quot;,

      Total 66 normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be
      administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 200 mL of water in each period as
      per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to
      administration of the study drugs and for four (4) hours after administration of the study
      drugs during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each study period.
      Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour to administration of the study drugs and
      1 hour after administration of the study drugs in each period. A total of 29 blood samples
      will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic profiling during each study period. The plasma
      concentrations of Loasartan and its carboxylic acid metabolite will be measured by a
      validated LC-MS/MS analytical method. ANOVA will be performed on log transformed
      pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and 90% confidence interval will be
      constructed for the ratio of geometric least square mean of the Test and Reference products,
      obtained from the log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded if the ratio
      estimate as well as its 90% confidence interval, both falls within the acceptable range of
      80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax, AUC0-t.
