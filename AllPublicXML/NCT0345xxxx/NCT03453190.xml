  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers want to find out if giving the drug Apremilast in combination with Clobetasol
      spray can help people clear their moderate to severe plaque psoriasis quicker than if
      Apremilast is used by itself.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People over age 18 with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who choose to be in the study and
      pass the four week screening period will visit the study center about 8 times over about 16
      weeks. All participants will be given Apremilast, a pill that you take in the morning and at
      night, and which studies have shown may reduce inflammation and improve psoriasis symptoms.
      All participants will also be given Clobetasol to spray twice daily for two weeks, then once
      daily for two weeks, then every other day for two weeks. All drugs and study visits are at no
      cost to participants.
