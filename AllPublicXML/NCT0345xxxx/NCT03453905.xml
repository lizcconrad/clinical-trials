  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with metastases to proximal femur, who are evaluated fr the risk of pathologic
      fracture in order to decide on preventive fixation vs follow-up constitute the study
      population. The patients will be randomized in two arms. First arm - the decision of
      treatment will rely on conventional decision algorithm including specialist judgement and
      Mirels' score. Second arm- the decision on treatment will be supported by CTFEA analysis of
      bone structure and quantitative simulation-based estimate of fracture risk, in addition to
      the conventional decision algorithm. Operation rates, pathologic fracture rates and
      additional secondary outcomes will be compared between the two study arms.
