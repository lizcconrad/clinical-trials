  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia can be challenging in patients with lumbar scoliosis or previous lumbar
      spine surgery. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of the ultrasound-assisted spinal
      anesthesia reduces the number of passes required to successful dural puncture compared with
      the conventional surface landmark-guided technique in patients with abnormal spinal anatomy.
