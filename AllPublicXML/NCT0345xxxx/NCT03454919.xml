  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a prospective, phase II, open-labeled, clinical trial aimed to determine the efficacy
      of palbociclib in advanced melanoma patients who bear gene aberrations in cell cycle pathways
      [including CDK4 amplification and/or CCND1 amplification and/or P16 (CDKN2A) loss]. Fifteen
      patients, if there is a response then further 45 patients will be enrolled. Totally 60
      subjects with known above-mentioned gene aberrations who comply with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled, their serum samples (at the time of the first
      administration of palbociclib and every 4 weeks afterwards) will be collected. Palbociclib
      will be given in the dose of 125 mg orally qd d1-21 every 28 days, unless disease progression
      or intolerance. All patients will be evaluated for the response to palbociclib by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) at baseline. The standard radiographic imaging
      (CT scans) will be performed every 4 weeks until the end of treatment.
