  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanized instrumentation systems stand out amongst various devices used in modern
      Endodontics. Its use in Pediatric Dentistry, its action in primary teeth, has been in the
      center of many discussions and laboratory studies. Nevertheless, up to now, a lack of
      clinical studies on this issue can be found. Our objective is to conduct a double blinded, 2
      years follow up clinical trial to compare the success of endodontic treatment in primary
      teeth using mechanized reciprocating instrumentation to the use of manual instrumentation.

    <textblock>
      With the approval of the Ethics Committee of University of São Paulo, after clinical and
      radiographic examination, patients in search for endodontic treatment in primary teeth will
      be invited to take part in the study. The participants of the study will be randomized to one
      of two groups (manual or reciprocating instrumentation). Endodontic treatment will be held by
      a specialist according to the randomized group. A blinded examiner will proceed one week, 3
      months, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months follow ups. Clinical and radiographic conditions of
      endodontic treatments will be analyzed to classify them as Success or Failure. The unit of
      analysis will be the teeth; hence, each participant may have more than one tooth included in
      the study. The randomization will be performed considering the tooth. Data analysis will
      consider the cluster nature of the sample.

      The primary outcome of the study will be the success rates according to the groups. The
      longevity of treatments will be evaluated by estimating survival rates by Kaplan-Meier and
      Cox regression. The differences between survival rates of both groups will be through Cox
      regression adjusted for the cluster nature of the sample (more than one tooth per
      participant), considering a level of significance of 5%.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Success or failure of endodontic treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>The success or failure of endodontic treatments evaluated by the time spent in the tooth arch in clinical conditions of normality. Clinical criteria for determining success are: absence of fistula, absence of painful symptoms and pathological absence of adequate mobility and gingival contour. Radiographically, the success criteria are: absence / reduction of periapical bone rarefaction in anterior and absence / bone rarefaction in the furcation area of later, maintaining the periradicular space, root resorption compatible with the eruptive phase and absence of pathological bone resorption. To evaluate the reduction of lesions or appearance of new lesions will be between the initial and follow-up radiographs. Radiographs will be scanned and the end of the bone rarefactions starting area and will be measured on a software image analysis.</description>

    <measure>Appointment duration</measure>
    <time_frame>After treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The time spent using both techniques will be measured and compared between the groups. The time will be recorded in minutes since the end of anesthesia and rubber-dam placement until the beginning of restorative procedure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of obturation provided by two different instrumentation techniques</measure>
    <time_frame>After treatment</time_frame>
    <description>After root canal obturation, a final periapical radiograph will be digitalized and analyzed, obtaining the percentage of root canal filling provided by each instrumentation technique.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Discomfort related to each instrumentation technique</measure>
    <time_frame>After treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Discomfort provided by each technique will be analyzed and compared between the groups using a validated facial scale, named Wong-Baker facial scale. This is a scale of 6 drawn faces ranging from a smiling representing no hurt face to as crying hurts worst face. Therefore, the scale has been used to evaluate pain and/or discomfort after several procedures, including dental procedures. The answers can be measured as a qualitative ordinal variable varying from 0 (no hurt) to 5 (Hurts worst). This scale has been used previously in pediatric dentistry context (Tomlinson et al., 2010).</description>
