    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study in subjects with WHO Grade III Anaplastic Astrocytoma (G3
      astrocytoma) who had progressive disease during first or second line treatment and who have
      not previously received any BEV or any experimental agents.

      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective will be to determine the efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in recurrent
      anaplastic astrocytoma patients (6-month progression-free survival)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.

        -  To evaluate efficacy of NOVOTTF-200A in the subject population.

        -  To see if the presence of ATRX, TERT promoter, IDH1 mutations and/or MGMT promoter
           methylation, confers a better response to NOVOTTF-200A.

        -  To determine if the treatment significantly modifies the patient's quality of life.
           Sponsor will use the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires:

             -  FACT-Brain (FACT-Br)

             -  FACT-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog)

      Exploratory Objectives:

        -  To determine if the presence of proneural or mesenchymal phenotype (Cytoscan analysis)
           confers a better response to NovoTTF.

        -  To determine if the in vitro sensitivity of the glioma cells derived from patient
           specimens before and after the NOVOTTF-200A treatment correlates with the patient's
           response to treatment.

    <measure>Evaluation of the safety of NOVOTTF-200A in this subject population.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>All subjects will be evaluated for safety analysis if they receive NOVOTTF-200A. Safety and tolerability of NOVOTTF-200A treatment will be based on the incidence and severity of adverse events and toxicities. Toxicities will be assessed according to the &quot;Common toxicity criteria (CTC), version 4.03&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Does the treatment significantly modify the patient's quality of life?</measure>
    <time_frame>Will be assessed at baseline and every two cycles (at the end of each even-numbered cycle of therapy) until treatment termination, an average of 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine if the treatment significantly modifies the patient's quality of life we will be using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires that include the FACT-Brain (FACT-Br), and the FACT-Cognitive Function (FACT-Cog) questionnaires. These will be completed at baseline then every two cycles.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Understand and voluntarily sign and date an informed consent document before any study
             related assessments/procedures are conducted.

          2. Males and females of age ≥18 years at the time of the signing of the informed consent
             document.

             recurrence or disease progression (defined as either a greater than 25% increase in
             the largest bi-dimensional product of enhancement, a new enhancing lesion or a
             significant increase in T2 FLAIR).

          4. Subjects with archival tumor tissue suitable for genetic testing must give permission
             to access and test the tissue; subjects without archival tumor tissue are eligible.
