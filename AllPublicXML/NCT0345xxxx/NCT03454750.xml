      Radiometabolic Therapy (RMT) with 177Lu PSMA 617 in advanced castration resistant prostate
      cancer (CRPC): efficacy and toxicity evaluation. Single-center, prospective, non controlled,
      open label, phase II trial. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the Disease
      Control Rate (DCR) and the safety as co-primary objective.

      The secondary objectives are: late toxicity, PFS, OS, biochemical response and dosimetry.

    <measure>Disease Control Rate (DCR )</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the percentage of patients who have achieved complete response, partial response and stable disease lasting for at least 6 months from therapy start. DCR will be evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the Version 1.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 30 days after the last treatment cycle</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of the Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events starts from the 1st treatment until 30 days after the last treatment cycle; Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events are evaluated according to version 4.03 CTC-AE criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the start treatment date to the date of first observation of documented disease progression or death due to any cause. Patients without tumor progression at the time of analysis will be censored at their last date of tumor evaluation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival is defined as the time from the therapy start to the date of death due to any cause or the date of last contact (censored observation) at the date of data cut-off.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male, Age &gt; 18 years.

          2. Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmation of advanced prostate
             cancer castration resistant defined according to PCWG3 criteria

          3. Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1. criteria; also patients with bone lesions
             only could be enrolled

          4. Patients with documented disease will be admitted to therapeutic phase only if the
             diagnostic PET/CT 68Ga-PSMA images demonstrate a significant uptake (tumor to
             background ratio &gt;2.5) at metastatic tumour site (or in the primary when present, or
             both)

          5. Patients with documented radiological progression (in soft tissue and / or bone) and /
             or biochemical progression (sequence of 3 PSA rising values from a screening PSA value
             ≥ 2 ng / ml) according to PCWG3 in pre-study period, refractory or unfit to
             conventional standard treatments (hormonal or chemotherapeutic treatment such as
             abiraterone, enzalutamide and docetaxel)

          6. Concomitant LHRH analogs assumption is allowed

          7. Life expectancy greater than 6 months.

          8. ECOG performance status &lt;2

             creatinine &lt; 2 mg/dL).

         10. Participant is willing and able to give informed consent for participation in the
             study

         11. Other known malignant neoplastic diseases in the patient's medical history with a

             carcinoma).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients treated with chemotherapy and 223Ra radiotherapy within 4 weeks and treated
             within 2 weeks with palliative radiotherapy.
