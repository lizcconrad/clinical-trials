      This study establishes the relationship between cervical length and whether it can be used to
      predict haemorrhage and preterm delivery in cases of placenta previa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some studies have reported an association between ultrasonographic decreased cervical length
      and the likelihood of complications as antepartum or post-partum haemorrhage requiring an
      emergency caesarean section (CS) .

      The safety of trans-vaginal scanning is not in doubt, and the technique now has widespread
      acceptance. As a consequence, the clinical presentation of placenta previa has changed and
      most low lying placentas are diagnosed during the second trimester anomaly scan.

      The objective of this study was to establish if there is a relation between transvaginal
      ultrasonographic measurement of cervical length in cases of placenta previa and whether it
      can be used as a predictor for antepartum haemorrhage or not.
