  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is a life support treatment for patients with acute
      respiratory failure. The IMV can generate adverse effects that may cause alterations in other
      organs besides the lung, creating an important problem during ICU stay, hospital stay and
      years after discharge. These consequences on morbidity and mortality have significant
      economic and social weight. In the United States the IMV represents 2.7 episodes per 1000
      habitants, with an estimated cost of $27,000 million, representing 12% of all hospital
      expenses. The overall mortality in patients with IMV is 30-35%, increasing with age.
      Therefore, patients receiving IMV are a high-risk population and with higher costs.

      A poor interaction between patient and ventilator during IMV can develop asynchronies. The
      asynchronies may present in 25% of patients. The majority of studies in ICU patients are
      limited to a evaluation of short periods of time. Asynchronies identification needs the
      application of respiratory physiology knowledge and the interpretation of respiratory signals
      from the ventilator waves. This allows identifying in an easy way different situations of
      &quot;fight&quot;, but it also difficult the identification of situation where asynchronies are less
      obvious, doing that them remain underdiagnosed. Moreover, asynchronies can be only evaluated
      during a brief period of time, and it's difficult to know their incidence during all the IMV
      period and to make adjustments to improve them.

      In our centre, it has been developed a continuous monitoring system during IMV which
      integrates, in real-time, all the information derived from digital monitors and ventilators.
      It allows a continuous and automatic detection of different events (through an intelligent
      alarm system) and quantification of asynchronies. It was demonstrated that asynchronies are
      frequent, that it can be present from the beginning of IMV, that it increase in severe
      patients under deep sedation and it can increase ICU and hospital mortality.

      The investigators can study different factors that can influence over asynchronies
      development or can improve them.

      The aim of this study is to analyze the real incidence of asynchronies of patients undergoing
      mechanical ventilation and to analyze what factors may have an association with their
      appearance.

      This factors includes factors related with the pulmonary mechanics of each patient and other
      factors such as the treatment administered, especially drugs with sedative and analgesic
      effect will be taken into account.

      This can help to implement strategies for the improvement of asynchronies.
