  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune system is composed of diverse cell types with different functions that act
      together in order to defend against infection. This pilot study will test a new technology
      for studying these many different cell types at very large numbers at the level of individual
      cells. This method will then be used to identify the cell types and functions important for
      the immune response to the highly protective yellow fever vaccine, which will improve our
      understanding of effective vaccine features.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines have had monumental impact in reducing the mortality and morbidity of infectious
      disease. However, the underlying immune mechanisms that contribute to their effectiveness are
      incompletely understood. Transcriptomics (methods that measure the activity of thousands of
      genes) studies have identified key features of responses to vaccination(see references) and
      infection(see references). However, these experiments are typically performed on
      heterogeneous cell mixtures such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC which include
      certain types of white blood cells) and therefore provide an aggregate measure of gene
      expression from the many different immune cells and their respective activities in the
      mixture. Such results can obscure important biological information, particularly in minor
      subsets of active cells. Establishing a method for immune transcriptomics at single cell
      resolution would be a highly significant advance and enable more informative and functionally
      relevant systems immunology studies with commonly used sample types (i.e. PBMC). Applying
      this high-resolution approach to Yellow Fever Vaccine (YFV), an exceptionally effective
      vaccine, is likely to identify unappreciated mechanisms that contribute to protective
      immunity.
