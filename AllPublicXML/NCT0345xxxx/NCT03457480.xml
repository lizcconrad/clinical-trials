      Objectives:

      This 5-year project is concerned with the development and evaluation of a highly innovative
      mobile phone text messaging project designed to inform young adults about risks associated
      with conventional and emerging tobacco products. The program's results can inform the Food
      and Drug Administration's (FDA) leadership, allowing them to make decisions about the text
      messages that effectively communicate risk to young consumers.

      Focus Group:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will take part in a focus group
      about participant's opinion about different tobacco products. Participant will be asked to
      answer brief questionnaires related to these products, participant's demographic background,
      health literacy, and questions about the text messages themselves. Each group will have about
      6-8 participants. This focus group will be about 2 hours.

      Participant's opinion will give researchers ideas about how to develop the text message
      campaign, provide clues about message content, and learn participant's reactions to the text
      messages.

      The focus group will be audio recorded. Audio files will be saved in MD Anderson data server
      and securely locked in the office. Audio files will be transcribed (written down) and
      de-identified within a few weeks or months and then will be destroyed 5 years after the study
      is completed. The study data will be destroyed 10 years after the study is completed.

      Length of Study:

      Participation in this study will be over after the focus group.

      Health Communication Student Review:

      If participant agrees to take part in this study, participant will review of a series of text
      messages about tobacco products. The researchers would like you to draw upon participant's
      academic training in the area of health communication to review these messages.

      Participant will complete questionnaires about participant's demographics (age, race, sex,
      and so on), health literacy, and questions about the text messages themselves. This should
      take about 4 hours to complete.

      Pre-test Text Messages:

      Participant will review a series of text messages. The text messages contain information
      about both conventional and new and emerging tobacco products. Participant will be asked 3
      questions about each text message. These questions will be about the complexity of the
      message, how participant thinks the message is framed, and how the message will appeal to the
      audience.

      Length of Study:

      Participation in this review will be over after participant completes the questionnaires.

      Youth Perception of Tobacco:

      Pre-test:

      The first part of the study involves answering questions on participant's smartphone using a
      link the study team will send participant. Participant will be asked some basic descriptive
      questions about participant, some general health-related questions, and questions about
      participant's tobacco use. This pre-test survey will take about 30 minutes to complete.

      Text Messages - first 30 day period:

      After the pre-test, participant will receive 2 text messages a day for 30 days. The text
      messages will be related to tobacco products and tobacco use. There are 8 different types of
      messages and participant will be randomly assigned (as in the roll of the dice) to 1 of the 8
      types for the 30 day period. Participant will have an equal chance of being in any group. It
      will take less than a minute per day to read these messages.

      Short Weekly Surveys:

      During the time participant is receiving the text messages, participant will receive a link
      to a short survey at the end of each week. The short survey will be related to participant's
      experiences with the text messages participant received over the previous week. These surveys
      should take about 5 minutes to complete.

      First Post-tests:

      Seven (7) days and 3 months after the 30-day text messaging period, participant will be asked
      to answer more questions on participant's smartphone using a link the study team will send
      participant. Participant will be asked participant's opinions about the text messages
      participant received. This will take about 10 minutes.

      Text Messages - second 30 day period:

      After the 3-month post-test, participant will again receive 2 text messages a day for 30
      days. The text messages will be related to tobacco products and tobacco use. There are 8
      different type of messages and participant will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 8 types for
      the 30 day period. It will take less than a minute per day to read these messages.

      Second Post-tests:

      Seven (7) days and 3 months after the second 30-day text messaging period, participant will
      be asked to answer more questions on participant's smartphone using a link the study team
      will send participant. Participant will be asked participant's opinions about the text
      messages participant received. This will take about 10 minutes.

      Reminders:

      Participant may receive up to three reminder emails, texts and phone calls for any incomplete
      short weekly surveys and up to six emails, texts and phone calls for an incomplete
      perceptions post test and for any incomplete follow up surveys.

      Length of Study:

      Participant will be on the study for up to 8 months.
