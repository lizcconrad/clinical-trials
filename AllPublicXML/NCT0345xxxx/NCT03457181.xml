  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that music listening during carotid
      endarterectomy administered the cervical plexus block will cause less anxiety, less pain, and
      greater patient satisfaction.

      Patients who decided to participate in the study were randomized by means of a
      computer-generated randomization order into 2 groups: Music Group (Group M) and Operating
      Room (OR) Noise Group (Group O). Randomization was independently carried out in both centers.

      Preoperative and postoperative State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) scores, intraoperative
      STAI responses, preoperative and postoperative numerical rating scale scores for anxiety,
      pain scores and hemodynamic parameters were recorded.
