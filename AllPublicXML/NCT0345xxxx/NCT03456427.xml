  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-assisted compression (PAC) allows the patient to participate in controlling the
      amount of compression force during mammography and is a personalized approach that has
      demonstrated successful reduction in discomfort experienced during mammography. GE
      Healthcare's Senographe Pristina, an innovative mammography platform that provides both
      two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging capabilities, offers both standard
      and patient-assisted compression modes. This study will evaluate image quality and clinical
      workflow as it relates to use of PAC with the Senographe Pristina 3D.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study population will consist of adult asymptomatic women presenting for screening 2D
      mammography. One breast of each subject will be identified as the &quot;breast of interest,&quot; which
      will undergo study-specific 3D imaging consisting of two-view (craniocaudal and mediolateral
      oblique) PA compression and image acquisition, followed by two-view technologist-controlled
      (TC) compression and image acquisition. The breast of interest will be randomly assigned to
      either the first breast imaged during the exam or the second breast imaged. TC compression
      and imaging, and procedures performed on the subject's other breast will be conducted per
      standard of care.

      Following image acquisition, 3D image quality evaluation will be conducted by MQSA-qualified
      readers. Prior to the reading session, images will be de-identified and the following
      information will be removed from the DICOM header to blind readers to the compression mode
      used during acquisition: time stamp, compression force, and breast thickness. The image sets
      will also be randomized for presentation during the image attribute reviews. Two (2) readers
      will evaluate each PAC and TC compression image set collected from each subject's breast of
      interest and assess the acceptability of image attributes, as defined in the Guidance for
      Industry and FDA Staff - Class II Special Controls Guidance Document: Full-Field Digital
      Mammography System (2012). A third reader will provide adjudication, if there is disagreement
      for a given image set's overall clinical image quality.

      Workflow data, including the incidence of technologist intervention during acquisition and
      need for repeat image acquisition, will also be collected.

      The proportion of PAC image sets that are of equal or higher acceptability than TC image sets
      will be calculated. A 95% confidence interval will be calculated using asymptotic method with
      continuity correction. The proportion of image sets indicated for repeated image acquisition
      when using PA mode or TC mode will be summarized. Other endpoint data will be summarized
      using descriptive statistics. No statistical hypothesis is being tested in this study.

    <description>The technologist will properly position the breast and apply minimum compression. The subject will be instructed to apply compression as the technologist ensures the breast tissue is in appropriate position and tautness. The technologist will then guide the subject to achieve appropriate compression level, sufficient but not excessive, and the image will be acquired. This will be done for both standard views CC &amp; MLO.</description>
