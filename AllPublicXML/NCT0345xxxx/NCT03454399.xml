  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Image quality of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) tends to get worse
      during long hours of operations. An orogastric tube (OGT) is often inserted in the beginning
      of the case, and left there for intermittent suction as needed, or removed before TEE exam to
      prevent echoic artifacts. However, if left there, the effect of suction might be limited due
      to unreliable tip position of the OG tube. If removed, stomach will be distended again. We
      devised the OG tube attached TEE for practical suction and assessed its effect on image
      quality intraoperatively.

    <textblock>
      OGT attached TEE probe is used for cardiac and liver transplantation cases. Each case is
      assigned 3 investigators who are blinded to this study design, We do image quality assessment
      by two methods; firstly, we categorize image quality as numbers based on each investigator's
      impression (1: Very bad, 2: bad, 3: acceptable, 4: good, 5: very good) and compare the
      difference in number before and after suctioning. Secondly, we evaluate consistency
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for inter-observer variability using investigator A,
      B and C. We evaluate absolute-agreement ICC for intra-observer variability using investigator
      C, who perform analysis for all images twice with a 6 to 8 months interval. This analysis was
      performed with left ventricular fraction area change using transgastric left ventricular
      short axis view.
