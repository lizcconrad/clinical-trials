      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, phase III trial in patients with
      biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Patients will receive regular standard of clinical care. The
      only study-specific procedures will the administration of 18F-DCFPyL followed by a PET/CT
      scan. Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical,
      biochemical and radiographic subject data before and after 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging by a
      central panel of experts will be captured at study completion.

      Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the differences in theoretical
      optimal clinical management afforded by 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer patients as
      proposed by a central panel of experts.

      Primary endpoint:

      1. Differences in theoretical optimal clinical management based on a review of clinical,
      histopathological, biochemical and radiographic subject data both before and after 18F-DCFPyL
      PET/CT imaging retrospectively by a central panel of experts.

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT scan positivity fraction in patients with biochemically recurrent
           prostate cancer, stratified by PSA.

        2. Immediate AE up to 90 minutes post-administration of 18F-DCFPyL.

          -  Able to understand and provide written informed consent

          -  Able to tolerate the physical/logistical requirements of a PET/CT scan including lying
             supine (or prone) for up to 40 minutes and tolerating intravenous cannulation for
             injection

        Cohort A - High risk staging (HRS): Staging of high risk not previously treated patients as
        defined by any one of the following:
