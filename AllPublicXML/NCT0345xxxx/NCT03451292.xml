  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, controlled, parallel-group, and open-label
      clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of standard medical treatment (SMT) + Albutein 20%
      administration versus SMT alone in subjects with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites. The
      study population will consist of subjects being discharged after hospitalization for acute
      decompensation of liver cirrhosis with ascites (or with prior history of ascites requiring
      diuretic therapy) with or without acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) at admission or
      during hospitalization but without ACLF at discharge.
