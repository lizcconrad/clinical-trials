    <description>The CardiAMP Cell Therapy system consists of the CardiAMP Potency Assay, the Helix/Morph intramyocardial delivery catheter system, and the CardiAMP Cell Separator. The system allows the investigator to identify patients with a high chance to respond to im autologous stem cell therapy (using the CardiAMP Cell Potency Assay), to isolate the stem cells from a bone marrow harvest at the point of care (using the CardiAMP CS system), and to percutaneously inject the autologous cells into the myocardium using the Helix/Morph delivery catheters.</description>
