  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial was designed to compare the effectiveness of radical resections of lung cancer plus
      adjuvant chemotherapies and perioperative chemotherapies in the patients with N2 non-small
      cell lung cancer

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a multi-centre real-world non-interventional observational study. The Chinese
      patients with N2 non-small cell lung cancer enrolled from 2014 to 2017 who received radical
      resections of lung cancer and adjuvant chemotherapies will be included in the study and the
      study data on patient demographic/tumor biological characteristics and clinical treatment
      will be collected to evaluate compare effectiveness of radical resection of lung cancer plus
      adjuvant chemotherapies and perioperative chemotherapies after surgeries.
