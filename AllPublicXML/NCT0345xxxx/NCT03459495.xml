  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache affects the daily quality of life of patients. It has been reported that headaches
      may be associated with neck muscles, neck movements and trigger points in the neck Drug and
      non-drug treatments can be used today in the treatment of headaches. Various physical
      therapies are applied to cranial and cervical regions in non-drug therapies. Therapeutic
      ultrasound, Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), Hotpack and manipulation are
      some of them.This is a randomised placebo- controlled trial to determine the efficacy of the
      therapeutic ultrasound in the treatment of migraine.

    <textblock>
      Evidence from controlled studies suggests that non-invasive physical therapies may help
      prevent headaches. Therapeutic ultrasound studies have generally been used in combination
      with other physical therapies.

      Therapeutic ultrasound is known to act in two different ways, thermal and non-thermal. With
      thermal effect, it is possible to reduce pain and joint joints and increase local blood flow,
      while stimulating tissue regeneration, soft tissue repair, blood flow regulation in chronic
      ischemic tissues and protein synthesis with nonthermal effect. In addition, its effect on
      inflammation accelerated repair by affecting cell activities, altering platelet membrane
      permeability, leading to the release of serotonin and accelerating wound healing.

      The aim of this study is to determine whether therapeutic ultrasound is superior to placebo
      ultrasound in the treatment of migraine.

    <description>It is commonly used to measure the severity of the patients' pain. It consists of a line 10 cm. long and marked with numbers from 0 to 10. The patient is asked to mark the point corresponding to the severity of the pain on this line in the range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).</description>

    <measure>Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire Score (MIDAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire is a brief, self-administered questionnaire designed to quantify headache-related disability over a 3 month period. The MIDAS score is based on five disability questions in three dimensions: questions one and two assess the number of missed or significant limitations to activity (defined as at least 50% reduced productivity) days due to headache in school or paid work activities (school/job dimension); questions three and four assess the number of missed or significant limitations to activity (defined as at least 50% reduced productivity) days due to headache in housework activities (housework dimension); question five assesses missed days due to headache in family, social, or leisure activities (social dimension).
0 to 5 - MIDAS Grade I, Little or no disability 6 to 10 - MIDAS Grade II, Mild disability 11 to 20 - MIDAS Grade III, Moderate disability 21+ - MIDAS Grade IV, Severe disability</description>
