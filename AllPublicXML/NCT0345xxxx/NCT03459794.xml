  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that ivermectin, a drug used to treat parasitic worm infections, interacts
      with the human innate immune system and that this contributes to its anti-parasitic effects.
      Participants will donate blood before and after being administered the normal human dose of
      the drug. We will compare the cell types present in the blood and the chemicals known to
      influence the human immune system before and after the drug is given, as well as measuring
      any changes in gene expression in white blood cells 4 and 24hrs after the drug is taken.

      Subjects will visit the UGA Clinical &amp; Translation Research Unit (CTRU) twice on consecutive
      days and blood will be drawn from them. On the first occasion they will be weighed and will
      complete the consent process. They will have been randomly assigned to the test (Stromectol)
      or control (placebo) group, with 8 participants in the test group and 4 participants in the
      control group. Stromectol will be obtained from a medical supply distributor and a placebo
      will be obtained through the UGA School of Pharmacy. Drugs will be prescribed by Jonathan
      Murrow MD. They will be stored in their original packaging at room temperature in a drug
      locker in the lab at CTRU. Participants will be identified by number and allocated to groups
      using a block randomization protocol. Randomization and drug dispensation will be done by
      CTRU. Eighteen ml of blood will drawn in a fasting state and they will be administered 150
      mcg/kg Stromectol or the equivalent number of placebo tablets immediately after blood is
      drawn. Participants will remain at CTRU for four hours after they take the drug, then another
      15ml of blood will be drawn. On the second day they will attend CTRU at the same time and the
      third blood sample will be drawn 24 hrs after administration of the drug. On each occasion
      the drawn blood will be coded by CTRU staff prior to being collected by a member of the
      Department of Infectious Diseases and taken to the laboratory (Wildlife Health G0007) for the
      isolation of leukocyte populations (peripheral monocytes, lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear
      cells (PMNs)) and for the preparation of serum. Complete blood counts will also be carried
      out. Sera will be analyzed on the Luminex for cytokine/chemokine content. RNA will be
      isolated from the cell populations for RNASeq analysis.
