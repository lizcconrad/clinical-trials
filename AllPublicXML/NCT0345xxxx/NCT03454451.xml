  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/1b open label, multicenter, dose-selection study of CPI-006, a Type 2
      humanized IgG1 antibody inhibiting enzymatic activity of CD73 and adenosine production. This
      trial will study the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of CPI-006 as a single
      agent, in combination with CPI-444, a small molecule targeting the adenosine-A2A receptor on
      immune cells, and in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 antibody against various
      solid tumors.

          2. Subjects who have received prior therapy with regimens containing
             cytotoxicT-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PDL1), or
             PD1 antagonists are NOT permitted to enroll unless all adverse events (AEs) while
             receiving prior immunotherapy have resolved to Grade 1 or baseline prior to screening.

          3. History of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids or subject has current
             pneumonitis.

          4. The use of any investigational medication or device in the 30 days prior to screening
             and throughout the study is prohibited.
