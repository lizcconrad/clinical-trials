      This study offers focal therapy for prostate cancer by using an intra-urethral
      radiotransponder temporarily placed during radiotherapy. The study aims to improve the
      risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden
      over time.

      This study offers focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer by using an
      intra-urethral radiotransponder placed temporarily during each of the 5 radiotherapy
      treatments. The study aims to improve the risk-benefit ratio of therapy for early prostate
      cancer and potentially lessen symptom burden over time while also accessing early efficacy,
      late toxicity, and overall quality of life post-treatment. Patients will be followed for 24
      months (2 years) with follow-up appointments at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.

    <description>This study will enroll patients that have a confirmed histology of prostate cancer. They will undergo a 3T MRI scan as well as a CT simulation with 16-fr Foley catheter containing dummy beacons for treatment planning purposes. The patient will then receive focal stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) at a dose of 40 gy in 5 total fractions. Patients will be followed for 24 total months with specific follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.</description>

    <intervention_name>16 French Foley Catheter</intervention_name>
    <description>A Foley catheter is a medical apparatus that creates a passageway for the drainage and collection of urine. This type of catheter is made of a pliable material that indwells into an individual's bladder by way of the urethra.
Featuring two separate channels down the tube, Foley catheters allow absolute stability and safe extraction. One channel of the catheter, by method of a balloon, is stabilized in a bladder; the other channel allows for the passage and collection of urine, by means of a leg bag or bedside drainage bag.
Foley catheters are usually constructed out of either silicone or latex.</description>
