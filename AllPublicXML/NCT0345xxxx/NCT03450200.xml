  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) is the common complication seen in the diabetic
      patients. Moreover, it will lead to another complication as disabilities and difficulties in
      activities of daily living (ADL). Most of the intervention for diabetes and diabetic
      neuropathic patients are mostly focusing on the prevention of foot ulcer. Diabetic foot care
      can prevent only for diabetes-related foot ulcer and foot amputation. It cannot be reduced
      DPN and cannot be improved the activities of daily living of the patient with DPN. Moreover,
      there is the restriction of weight-bearing exercise on the recommendation of exercises for
      the patients with DPN. Therefore, exercise program which may be suitable for all the patients
      with DPN was introduced in this study to improve ADL and decrease the neuropathic symptoms in
      the diabetic patients.

      Compliance with exercise or intervention is not only critical to get adherence but also for
      the long-term use of its. Easy to do exercise in the short duration which can able to do on
      their own in their home promote their compliance and adherence to the exercises. In this
      study, the effectiveness of exercises in the patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy was
      examined to fulfill the requirement of exercises which is simple and can be done in a short
      time. The objective of the study is to examine the effectiveness of exercise in the patients
      with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

      Randomise controlled trial was used in this study. Data collection was done at the outpatient
      diabetic clinic in North-Okkalapa General Hospital (NOGH), and University of Nursing, Yangon.
      The inclusion criteria for the participants were the patients receiving diabetic care at the
      out-patient-department of designated hospitals, able to contact via the telephone, presence
      of signs and symptoms of DPN, agreed to involve in the study (informed consent), and aged
      over 25 years. The persons who are suffering from DPN other than diabetes, severe illness of
      diabetic patients, diabetes with other comorbidities, amputation of hands and feet from any
      reasons, mental illness and alcoholism will be excluded from this study. By using a
      randomizing table, the patients who met the including criteria and had already examined the
      presence of DPN in the prevalence study of DPN were assigned intervention (n=61) and control
      group (n=60) and invited to participate in the second study. After getting informed consent,
      further assessment and examination were done on the day of data collection because some parts
      of data collection have already done in the prevalence study. Research assistants have
      trained all procedures including interviewing with the questionnaires and physical
      assessments. The instruments used in this study are Patient Neurotoxicity Questionnaire
      (PNQ), short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Behavioural Rating Scale and visual
      analog scale (0-100) as the standardized instruments in this study. Physical assessments were
      done for hand grip, pinch force, 10-g Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament (SWM) test, Timed Up and
      Go (TUG) test. A1cGEARs was used to check HbA1C level of the diabetic neuropathic patients.
      Finger counting time also recorded by using the stopwatch.

      The participants in the intervention group learned the exercise program by demonstration,
      using audio-visual aids. Hand and finger exercises and foot exercises were used as the
      intervention in this study. The intervention was developed by modifying some exercise for
      arthritis and other neuropathy. The permission to use some parts of their exercise has
      already got from the responsible person of the sources. The exercises lasted 10 minutes for
      all of the exercises completely. Health education about foot care was provided to the control
      group and the intervention group. The data collection points were before the intervention,
      immediately after the intervention (eight weeks), and follow-up eight weeks after the
      intervention.

      This study had already obtained ethical clearance from Nursing Science Ethical Review
      Committee, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Okayama University, Japan with the review
      number of D16-07, University of Nursing, Yangon, and Department of Medical Research (Lower
      Myanmar) with approval number Ethics/DMR/2017/048.
