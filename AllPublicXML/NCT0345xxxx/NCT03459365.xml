      The effect of Euflexxa therapy for knee osteoarthritis on levels of inflammatory and
      degenerative synovial fluid bio-markers in patients with knee osteoarthritis
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FLEXX trial was the first well-controlled, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study
      evaluating the efficacy of Euflexxa (1% sodium hyaluronate) therapy for knee osteoarthritis.
      Five-hundred-and-eighty patients were randomized to receive either Euflexxa or normal saline.
      There were significant improvements in the Visual analogue scale score Osteoarthritis
      Research Society International responder index, HRQoL, and function at 26-week follow-up.1
      However, the FLEXX trial did not evaluate changes in synovial fluid bio-marker levels. The
      present study will be a prospective pilot study of 25 subjects who will receive
      intra-articular Euflexxa. The primary objective of this study is to prospectively determine,
      at 6-weeks, and 6-months post treatment, the changes in levels of synovial fluid biomarkers
      from pre- to post-injection in patients who receive Euflexxa. In addition, we will assess
      patient reported pain and patient reported outcomes up to 2 years from initiation of study.
