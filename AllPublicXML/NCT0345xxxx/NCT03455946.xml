  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DASH diet is a proven behavioral strategy to reduce blood pressure, however, national
      adherence rates are poor. Using digital health tools may help to improve adoption of the DASH
      diet. Digital health approaches capitalize on the ubiquitous utilization of mobile
      technologies and have broad dissemination potential. There have been few efforts to test a
      DASH intervention via digital, and none using voice-activated technologies (e.g, Amazon
      Alexa). This proposal will enroll up to 20 participants to leverage a commercial diet
      tracking application, an existing intervention technology platform and the Amazon Echo Dot to
      test the feasibility of using DASH Cloud, a digital health intervention, with the Amazon
      Alexa personal assistant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Digital health approaches are promising intervention channels for improving DASH diet
      adherence. Almost all Americans own a mobile phone and 97% of mobile phone owners use text
      messaging. Digital health approaches can capitalize on the ubiquity of mobile technologies
      and allow investigators to reach affected populations with highly personalized content at low
      cost. Despite this ubiquity, interventions using text messaging for hypertension
      self-management primarily rely on reminders for tracking and medication adherence without
      diet and physical activity behaviors or feedback. As such, they are less effective.
      Investigators will establish the feasibility of a novel digital health-based approach for
      disseminating the DASH diet using the Amazon Alexa personal assistant. The data from this
      pilot feasibility trial will set the foundation for a larger, fully-powered R01 grant to
      examine whether DASH Cloud using Alexa can improve health outcomes. The primary aim of this
      proposal is to test the feasibility of the DASH Cloud intervention using Amazon Alexa.

    <description>Participants will download and install the Alexa and Nutritionix application (&quot;app&quot;) onto their smartphone and study staff will setup the study-specific account to send data to Duke's software system called Prompt. Participants will be instructed to invoke through voice their dietary intake daily for three months using the Nutritionix app through the Amazon Alexa personal assistant. DASH Cloud will access participant's dietary intake data through the Nutritionix application programing interface (API) for three months. Participants' data will automatically be uploaded from the Nutritionix app via the API that links the device with DASH Cloud. DASH Cloud will run an algorithm and send a daily or weekly feedback text message with a score reflecting DASH adherence for the prior days or week's food consumption using a previously validated scoring system.</description>
