  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients requiring prolonged time on the ventilator are susceptible to a wide range of
      clinical complications and excess mortality. It is therefore imperative for them to wean at
      the earliest possible time.

      Respiratory muscle weakness due to disuse of these muscles is a major underlying factor for
      weaning failure. Surprisingly, there is not much known about the impact of critical illness
      and MV on the expiratory abdominal wall muscles.These muscles are immediately activated as
      ventilation demands increase and are important in supporting respiratory function in patients
      with diaphragm weakness. Weakness of expiratory abdominal wall muscles will result in a
      decreased cough function and reduced ventilatory capacity. These are considerable causes of
      weaning failure and (re)hospitalisation for respiratory complications such as pneumonia.

      Recent evidence shows that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used as a safe
      therapy to maintain skeletal muscle function in critically ill patients. This study will be
      the first to test the hypothesis that breath-synchronized NMES of the abdominal wall muscles
      can prevent expiratory muscle atrophy during the acute stages of MV.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-40% of intubated patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) take more than
      one attempt to wean from mechanical ventilation (MV). 6-14% of intubated patients take longer
      than 7 days to wean from MV. Patients requiring prolonged time on the ventilator are
      susceptible to a wide range of clinical complications and excess mortality. It is therefore
      imperative for them to wean at the earliest possible time.

      Respiratory muscle weakness due to disuse of these muscles is a major underlying factor for
      weaning failure. It is known that diaphragm strength rapidly declines within a few days after
      the initiation of MV. Surprisingly, there is not much known about the impact of critical
      illness and MV on the expiratory abdominal wall muscles.These muscles are immediately
      activated as ventilation demands increase and are important in supporting respiratory
      function in patients with diaphragm weakness. Weakness of expiratory abdominal wall muscles
      will result in a decreased cough function and reduced ventilatory capacity. These are
      considerable causes of weaning failure and (re)hospitalisation for respiratory complications
      such as pneumonia.

      Recent evidence shows that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) can be used as a safe
      therapy to maintain skeletal muscle function in critically ill patients, e.g. by stimulating
      quadriceps muscles in patients receiving MV.

      This study will be the first to test the hypothesis that exhalation synchronized NMES of the
      abdominal wall muscles can prevent expiratory muscle atrophy during the acute stages of MV.
      The investigators hypothesize that this approach will improve respiratory function and
      thereby will reduce the amount of time it takes to wean patients from mechanical ventilation.
