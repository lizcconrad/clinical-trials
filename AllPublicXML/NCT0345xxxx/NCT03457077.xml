  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the neural mechanisms underlying both spontaneous behavior change and
      behavior change in response to a brief intervention among problem drinkers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although problem drinkers (PD) are a less severe, highly prevalent sub-type of alcohol use
      disorder (AUD) who are more likely to undergo reductions in alcohol use, compared to more
      severe AUD, the underlying mechanisms that maintain PD, as well as the mechanisms that
      underlie both spontaneous and treatment- related behavior change in this population, are not
      well understood. This proposal takes a lab to life approach by combining functional
      neuroimaging (fMRI), ecological momentary assessment (EMA), and brief interventions (BI) in
      non-treatment seeking PD to test whether heightened incentive salience (reactivity) to
      alcohol cues and impaired ability to regulate cue-induce craving are the mechanisms that
      characterize PD, and play a role in behavior change vs. persistence of behavior. Identifying
      these mechanisms is critical for testing and understanding treatments and uncovering who is
      most likely to respond to interventions.
