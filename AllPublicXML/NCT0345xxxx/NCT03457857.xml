  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to assess the impact of two skincare regimens on the cutaneous microbiome and
      skin physiology of healthy male and female infants, ages 3-6 months using clinical,
      instrumental, D-Squame tape, microbiome and parental assessments over a five-week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skin cleansing has been demonstrated as a simple strategy to help keep skin healthy. There
      are many types of cleansing and moisturizing routines that have been shown to have different
      effects on the skin barrier such as reducing sebum and exogenous contaminants, controlling
      odors, and affecting the skin microbiome.1 A previous study in an adult population showed
      that use of a mild surfactant cleanser had less of an impact on the skin barrier than a
      liquid castile soap (data on file ).2 Because infant skin differs from an adult's in
      structure, function, and composition3, cleanser and/or lotion regimens may impact the skin
      barrier of infants differently.

      There is very little information in the literature on how the use of product regimens impacts
      the cutaneous microbiome and skin physiology of adults1 and even less about how it impacts
      the skin of children.

      This study will explore the impact that the use of two regimens - one cleansing and the other
      cleansing and moisturizing - has on the holistic skin barrier of infants ages 3-6 months.

      The IPs are a baby wash and a baby lotion, which are both cosmetic body products. The
      auxiliary product is a commercially available, cosmetic baby body wash.

    <intervention_model_description>The duration of this trial will be approximately 5 weeks and will consist of a screening visit followed by an approximately 1-week (7-day) washout period; a 4-week (28 day) treatment period with visits conducted at baseline (Day 0, ± 2 days), week 2 (Day 14, ± 2 days), and week 4 (Day 28, ± 2 days); and a regression period with a visit 3-5 days after the week 4 visit.
During the one week washout period, subjects will use a commercial available Baby Wash at least 3x per week.
For the next 4 weeks, subjects will be randomly assigned to use one of two IP regiments. Subjects in Group 1 will use the Baby Wash &amp; Shampoo at least 3x per week, but no more than once daily. Subjects in Group 2 will use the Baby Wash &amp; Shampoo at least 3x per week, but no more than once daily, plus the Baby Lotion at least once daily. The lotion should be applied after bathing (as applicable).
At Visit 4, subjects will begin a 3-5 day regression period.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study will be evaluator-blinded, so the PI/expert graders will not know which group (Group 1 or Group 2) each subject is in. Personnel dispensing the IPs or supervising IP use will not participate in the evaluation of subjects in order to minimize potential bias. IPs will be kept separate from the site personnel involved in assessing or evaluating the subjects, and subjects will be instructed not to discuss their assigned IPs with the PI/expert graders or other subjects.
To keep the evaluator blinded, the study staff will keep the grading forms separate from the bulk of the source documents so the evaluator will not have access to the sheets that indicate randomization and the study staff will instruct the subjects/LAR to not say anything about what product they are using.</masking_description>
