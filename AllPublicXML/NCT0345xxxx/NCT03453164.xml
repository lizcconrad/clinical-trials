      This study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody), which is
      approved as tertiary therapy, and neoadjuvant short-term limited local radiotherapy in
      patients with unresectable recurrent gastric cancer who progressed (SD or PD) after standard
      treatment (primary and secondary chemotherapy) and have more than one lesion assessable in
      diagnostic imaging (one lesion must be &gt;=2cm).

    <textblock>
      In patients with unresectable recurrent gastric cancer who progressed (SD or PD) after
      standard treatment (primary and secondary chemotherapy) and have more than one lesion
      assessable in diagnostic imaging (one lesion must be &gt;=2cm), localized short-term
      radiotherapy of 22.5 Gy/5 fractions/5 days will be applied to a symptomatic lesion or the
      largest asymptomatic lesion suitable for irradiation (Day 1-5). Nivolumab will be
      administered starting from Day 15-22 at a dose of 3 mg/kg (body wait) every 2 weeks to a
      total of 6 courses (end of intervention).

      The patients will be observed up to Day 180±14 and evaluated on Day 180±14 (end of study).
