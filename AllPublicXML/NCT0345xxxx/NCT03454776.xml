      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of the Unloader one brace on the clinical
      symptoms of patients with knee OA by comparing a functioning brace with a dummy. The dummy
      will be manufactured by Össur and has the same look as the real brace, but lacks the
      fundamental tightening effect of the straps of the real brace (an insert of elastic bands
      assures this), thereby nullifying its unloading capabilities. In a recent trial by Dr.
      Ingvarsson, the brace seemed to lessen the pain from knee OA, but no randomised, controlled
      studies have been conducted. This is mandatory if the effect of the brace and its use as an
      accepted treatment for knee OA is to be advocated for general use.

    <description>EQ-5D comprises two distinct self-report elements, providing three principal approaches to analysis(1) the EQ-5D profile: the patients' self reported health on the dimensions/levels of the descriptive system (2) the EQ-VAS: the patients' own global rating of their overall health, on a scale from 0 (worst possible health) to100 (best possible health)• Both types of data can be the focus of analysis, plus(3) Profiles can be summarized using 'value sets' (EQ-5DIndex) which reflect the preferences of the general public.</description>
