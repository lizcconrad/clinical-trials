      This pilot phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy works in
      treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or
      progressive tumors that have spread to the liver. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.
      Liver-directed therapies such as radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization,
      yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization, and cryoablation may help to shrink tumors that are
      not being directly targeted. Giving pembrolizumab and liver-directed therapy may work better
      in treating patients with well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors and symptomatic and/or
      progressive tumors that have spread to the liver.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the best observed overall response rate (ORR) in lesion(s) not targeted for
      liver-directed therapy (abscopal effect) to pembrolizumab plus liver-directed therapy
      according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for patients with
      metastatic well-differentiated (World Heath Organization [WHO] grade 1 or 2) neuroendocrine
      tumors (WD-NETs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab in combination with
      liver-directed therapies in this patient population.

      II. To evaluate duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination
      with liver-directed therapies.

      III. To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) in subjects treated with pembrolizumab in
      combination with liver-directed therapies.

      IV. Best observed radiographic ORR per modified RECIST (mRECIST) in lesions targeted for
      liver-directed therapy.

      V. Duration of response in lesions targeted for liver-directed therapy by mRECIST.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 35 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with up to 6 liver lesions, largest being no larger than 4 cm
      who have &lt; 25% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors, undergo computed tomography
      (CT)-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose
      of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP II: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver
      lesions, largest being no larger than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75% liver parenchyma replacement by
      tumors, undergo transarterial embolization (TAE) over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first
      dose of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP III: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with any number of liver
      lesions, largest measuring more than 5 cm, who have &lt; 75% liver parenchyma replacement by
      tumors, undergo yttrium-90 microsphere radioembolization (RE) 3-15 days following the first
      dose of pembrolizumab.

      GROUP IV: Patients receive pembrolizumab as in Group I. Patients with up to 6 liver lesions,
      largest being no larger than 4 cm who have &lt; 25% liver parenchyma replacement by tumors,
      undergo CT-guided cryoablation over 2-3 hours, 3-7 days following the first dose of
      pembrolizumab.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3-6
      months thereafter.

    <measure>Best observed overall response rate (ORR) evaluated according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>At 27 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The point estimate and 95% confidence interval of overall response rate will be obtained for each of the three liver-directed therapy groups (radiofrequency ablation, transarterial embolization, radioembolization) separately. The point estimate and 90% confidence interval of overall response rate will be obtained for each of the four liver-directed therapy groups separately. Assuming the abscopal overall response rate (RECIST version [v.] 1.1) is 25% for each patient group, with 8 patients in each group, there is 80% of power to detect partial response rate significantly different from 1% at alpha of 0.1 by a directional binomial test.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of adverse events evaluated according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.0</measure>

    <description>Adverse events occurring from the start of treatment until 30 days after the end of treatment will be summarized by maximum toxicity grade. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including adverse experiences (AEs), laboratory tests, and vital signs. The toxicity grade for laboratory data will be calculated using CTCAE v4.0 and the lab data will be summarized according to the subject's baseline grade and maximum grade for each cycle of therapy. All treatment related adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v4.0. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug and serious adverse events will be summarized similarly. Adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation will also be summarized. Safety analysis will include a tabulation of all toxicities by grade. The frequency of toxicities will be tabulated separately for each cohort. Count of AE will be provided.</description>
