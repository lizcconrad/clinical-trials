  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total mesorectal excision and neoadjuvant radio-chemotherapy have revolutionized the
      management of rectal cancer allowing an increase in survival (between 55 and 68% at 5 years)
      and allowing a decrease of local recurrence (under 10%) and allowing to push the limits of
      sphinctyer saving procedures.

      Parallel to the oncological findings, evaluating quality of life and functionnals sequelae
      has become a priority as highlighted by the second axis of &quot;plan cancer 2014-2019&quot;.

      The prevalence of digestive functional sequelae decrease during the first two years after
      surgery. However, these results are difficult to analyse due to the heterogeneity of used
      scores in medical litterature. The low anterior resection syndrom associate poly-exoneration,
      gas and / or stool incontinence, urgency and stool splitting.

      The score of low anterior resection &quot; LARS score &quot; validated in Danemark in 2012 allow us to
      understand the complexity of these sequelae and to measure their impact on the quality of
      life of patients, that's why he is currently recommended.

      In the long term, almost two out of three patients suffer from this syndrom, with half of the
      patients in a severe form.

      However, its prevalence and severity are often underestimated by practitioners. It leads to
      inappropriate therapeutic measures. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of
      digestive and genito-urinary sequelae on quality of life from validated scores in patients
      operated curatively of rectal cancer using a population study.

      This study should include 676 patients with rectal cancer treated in calvados and alive at 2
      years of their proctectomy without local or general recurrence.

It is a scale to evaluate the generic quality of life after cancer. There are 30 questions : 28 questions with 4 possible answers from 1 to 4 and 2 questions to evaluate the physical state and global quality of life with answers between 1 and 7. For each answer, 1 is the worst outcome and 4 is the best except for the 2 last questions where 7 is the best outcome. Minimum (worst outcome) is 30 and best outcome is 126. The total is reported to a score of 100 points which is the best outcome.</description>
