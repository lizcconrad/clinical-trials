  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Zalviso® Sufentanil Sublingual Tablet System (SSTS) (Grünenthal Italia, Milan, Italy) is
      a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system approved in September 2015 by the European
      Commission for the management of acute moderate-to-severe pain in adult patients in a
      hospital setting. This preprogrammed drug/device combination product delivers a fixed dose of
      15 mcg of sufentanil tablets as needed, in a non-invasive sublingual dosage form.

      Multimodal analgesia is defined as the administration, by one or more routes, of various
      analgesic medications with different mechanisms of action, thereby providing superior
      analgesia with fewer side effects. To improve pain control and patient satisfaction,
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) techniques have been developed, i.e. any delivery system
      which allows patients to self administer predetermined doses of analgesic drug to relieve
      pain. Over the past decades, intravenous (IV) PCA with morphine has been the gold standard
      for acute pain control. In our clinical practice, though, not only IV-PCA pumps were
      frequently prone to technical problems, but also patients and caregivers were not often able
      to understand or activate them, thus raising important safety issues and profoundly affecting
      the management of pain control. As a consequence, IV-PCA eventually fell into disuse,
      although no alternative has emerged until recently. The SSTS should go beyond the
      above-quoted limitations: it is a non invasive, patient-controlled and easy to use device,
      with an effective and safe opioid profile. It is, in our thinking, a promising technology.

      The aim of this retrospective analysis is to examine the role of the SSTS for management of
      pain after vertebral surgery, as part of a multimodal approach.
