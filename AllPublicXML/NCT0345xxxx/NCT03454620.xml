      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of GC1118 in combination
      with irinotecan or FOLFIRI in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D)

      A Phse 1b/2a, dose-finding, open-label, prospective study

      This study consists of the Phase 1b part designed to determine the MTD and RP2D of GC1118
      when administered in combination with irinotecan or FOLFIRI to patients with recurrent
      metastatic solid tumors and the Phase 2a part designed to assess the efficacy of GC1118 in
      combination with FOLFIRI as second-line therapy for recurrent/metastatic colorectal cancer
