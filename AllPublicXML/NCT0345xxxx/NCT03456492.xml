  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium concentration &lt;135 mmol/L that occurred at least
      once during a patient's hospital stay from admission to discharge. Elderly patients with
      fragility fractures are particularly susceptible to hyponatremia because of their impaired
      physiology, multiple comorbidities (such as hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hepatic
      cirrhosis, renal disease, and congestive heart failure), polypharmacy (e.g.,
      antihypertensives, antidepressants, and antiepileptics), hospitalization, perioperative fluid
      restrictions, and homeostatic stress from the fracture itself and the subsequent surgery. The
      aim of this study is to compare incidence of hyponatremia in elderly patients (&gt;70 years)
      with hip fractures (case group) to incidence of hyponatremia in elderly patients(&gt;70 years)
      undergoing joint replacement or prostate surgery(control group).

      These patients are also at a higher risk of the complications of hyponatremia such as brain
      injury, the main result of acute symptomatic hyponatremia and associated with significant
      morbidity and mortality. Severe hyponatremia (i.e., a serum sodium concentration &lt;125 mmol/L)
      ), if unrecognized in its first stages and left untreated, has a high rate of mortality; for
      this reason, an accurate clinical assessment must be made, focusing on fluid status,
      examining the potential etiology, and conducting the appropriate investigations. In
      approximately 50% of patients, chronic hyponatremia results from inappropriate antidiuretic
      hormone secretion. Chronic mild hyponatremia is usually asymptomatic and is traditionally
      regarded as benign. However, it is associated with a lower bone mineral content and density
      in nearly all regions of the hip, with more pronounced losses in the trochanteric and femoral
      neck regions. It can also lead to osteoporosis, abnormal gait patterns, cognitive impairment,
      bone demineralization, respiratory failure, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, falls, and
      fractures. Compared to normonatremic individuals, hyponatremic individuals are known to have
      a longer time from admission to surgery.
