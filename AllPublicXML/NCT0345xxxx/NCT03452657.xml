      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreous
      ranibizumab treatment versus sham injections for prevention of high-risk DR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center, sham-controlled clinical trial. In
      this trial, 118 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects with signed informed consent are screened
      and assigned randomly (1:1) to one of the following parallel groups: Group A-Intravitreous
      0.5 mg ranibizumab injections and Group B-sham injections. All participants have visits at 0
      month, 1 month, and 2 months, followed by visits every 3 months thereafter through 1 year.
      The main efficacy and safety outcomes assessment will be finished at the end of 12 months.

          6. Occurrence of adverse events or serious adverse events (subjects that need
             hospitalization or prolongation of hospital stay due to adverse events, without
