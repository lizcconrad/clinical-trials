    <textblock>
      A retrospective study including 22 patients who have undergone amniotic membrane transplant
      in our unit up till 2016. Confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence
      tomography (ASOCT) were performed to assess the retention of amniotic membrane and to detect
      any corneal structural changes. Comparison was made with 5 controls who had bullous
      keratopathy awaiting endothelial keratoplasty.

      This retrospective cohort study (CREC Ref No.: CRE-2013.687) was approved by the Joint
      Chinese University of Hong Kongâ€”New Territories East Cluster Clinical Research Ethics
      Committee. All patients who had AMT done due to symptomatic bullous keratopathy at the Prince
      of Wales Hospital and Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (from 1998 onwards till June
      2016) were invited back for confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence
      tomography (ASOCT) at the clinic by the principal investigator (GS) from October to November
      2016.
