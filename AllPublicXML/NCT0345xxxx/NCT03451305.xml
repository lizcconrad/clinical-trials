  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vertebroplasty in the symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture has become increasingly
      popular. However, there have been some limitations in restoring the height of the collapsed
      vertebrae and in preventing the leaking of cement. In the severely collapsed vertebrae of
      more than two thirds of their original height, vertebroplasty is regarded as a
      contraindication. We tried postural reduction using a soft pillow under the compressed level.
      This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the combination of postural
      reduction and vertebroplasty for re-expansion and stabilization of the osteoporotic vertebral
      fractures. single level vertebral compression fracture were treated with postural reduction
      followed by vertebroplasty. We analyzed the degree of re-expansion according to the onset
      duration.
