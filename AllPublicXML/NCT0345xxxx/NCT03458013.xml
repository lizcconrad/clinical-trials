  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: there is a need for psychosocial symptom management in hand therapy which has been
      understudied. Mindfulness-based interventions are used to address psychosocial symptoms in
      other settings such as chronic injury but have yet to be implemented or explored for patients
      in acute outpatient rehabilitation.

      Intervention: a supplemental mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) will be provided to the
      experimental group while the control group will receive standard care. The MBI will begin
      with an explanation of the purpose of a mindfulness, how mindfulness relates to hand therapy,
      and lead to a 20-minute guided meditation using an audio recording.

      Objectives: to establish the feasibility of providing a MBI in hand therapy and evaluate
      preliminary effects of the MBI on patients' stress, anxiety, and depression.

      Population: adult patients at an outpatient hand therapy clinic in the Los Angeles area who
      have received a traumatic injury (e.g., tendon laceration, compound fracture, finger
      amputation).

      Methodology: the study will use a mixed-methods, non-randomized, 2-group, comparative trial
      design with 40 participants in total. Quantitative data on psychosocial outcomes, including
      salivary cortisol, will be collected once a week for 4 weeks while patients are attending
      hand therapy and qualitative interviews will be conducted at the end of the study.

      Study arms: the experimental group (n = 20) will receive the MBI just before regularly
      scheduled standard care visits. The control group (n = 20) will receive only standard care.

      Outcomes: this pilot study will be used to inform a future fully powered trial on
      mindfulness-based interventions in hand therapy. Feasibility and preliminary psychosocial
      effects of MBIs will be evaluated and used to inform future work.

      Analysis: (1) A repeated measures ANOVA for intervention group, time, and time by
      intervention group effects on the psychosocial outcomes (i.e., Cortisol, Anxiety, Depression,
      and Pain Catastrophizing). (2) A descriptive qualitative process will be used to analyze
      themes in participant interview responses.

    <measure>Change in Baseline Salivary Cortisol Across 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cortisol is a bio-marker for stress (Aardal &amp; Holm, 1995). Normal values in healthy adults are sensitive to time of day, but range from 3.5 to 27.0 nmol/l in the morning. Higher salivary cortisol levels are an indicator of higher levels of stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in Baseline State Anxiety Across 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: State subscale (Spielberger, Vagg, Barker, Donham, &amp; Westberry, 1980) is scored positively (higher scores equate to higher anxiety) with a minimum score of 20 and a maximum score of 80. Normative data for this scale indicates that a cut point score of 40 and above is considered clinically relevant.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Depression Across 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression scale (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), is a 20-item depression scale that is positively scored (higher scores equate to higher depression) ranging from 0 to 60. It is intended for use with the general population with a conservative off is score being greater than 16.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Baseline Pain Catastrophizing Baseline Across 4 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995) measures an individual's exaggerated negative psychological response to pain or the anticipation of pain. The scale is scored positively across 13 total items composing 3 subscales: rumination, magnification, and helplessness. These subscales are added together to get the total score from 0 to 52. The middle 50% of scores on this scale fall between 10 and 30 points.</description>
