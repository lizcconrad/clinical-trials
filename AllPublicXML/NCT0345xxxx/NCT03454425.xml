      A Prospective, Randomized, Sham Controlled Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of
      ExAblate Subthalomotomy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease motor features.

      The objective of this prospective, randomized, double-blind (to subjects, examining
      neurologists and external video-based examination by Movement Disorders neurologist),
      single-site, two-arm study (ExAblate treated arm Vs ExAblate Sham treated control arm) is to
      confirm the efficacy of ExAblate Model 4000 Type 1 System for the treatment of Parkinson's
      disease (PD) motor features and to further demonstrate safety.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women age 30 years or older

          2. Subjects who are able and willing to give consent and able to attend all study visits.

          3. Subjects with a diagnosis of PD by UK Brain Bank Criteria as confirmed by a movement
             disorder neurologist at the site.

          4. Predominant motor features/disability from one side of the body (i.e asymmetry index &gt;
             1.5) as determined by a movement disorders neurologist.

          5. Motor clinical features non-optimally controlled by an adequate medical treatment
             prescription. An adequate medication prescription is defined as a therapeutic dose of
             each medication or the development of side effects as the medication dose is titrated.

          6. No major changes in pharmacological regime for PD should be done for the 30 days prior
             to procedure.

          7. Topographic coordinates of the subthalamic nucleus are localizable on MRI so that it
             can be targeted by the ExAblate device.

          8. Able to communicate sensations during the ExAblate MRgFUS treatment Inclusion and
