  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemically healthy periodontitis patients were recruited in this single-blind, split-mouth,
      randomized controlled clinical trial. After SRP, PDT was applied at probing depth (PD) ≥ 4 mm
      at test quadrant. At baseline, 3rd month and 6th month, clinical parameters and cytokine
      pattern in gingival crevicular fluids (GCFs) were analysed.

      Periodontal parameters and cytokine IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, MMP-8 levels were analysed.

    <masking_description>Allocation of test and control quadrants were done randomly by asking each study participant to choose either numbers &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;. Number &quot;1&quot; defined quadrants 1 and 3 as the test quadrants while number &quot;2&quot; referred to quadrants 2 and 4 as the test quadrants. The remaining quadrants served as the control quadrants.</masking_description>

    <description>After isolating the test quadrants with cotton roll, toluidine blue was applied into the deep pockets (PD ≥ 4mm) at the test quadrants for 10 seconds, followed by inserting a perio tip (15 or 21 mm depending on the depth of the pocket) that connected to a LED emitting device, and light was emitted for 20 seconds. Toluidine blue in the deep pocket was removed by injecting normal saline into the pocket.</description>
