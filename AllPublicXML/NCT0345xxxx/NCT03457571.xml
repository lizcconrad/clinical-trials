  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn´s disease or ulcerative colitis, have
      recurring episodes of abdominal pain, diarrhea and loss of weight. Besides this other
      clinical symptoms are possible e.g. deficiency syndromes such as iron deficiency. Iron
      deficiency usually attended by symptoms like hair loss, pale skin, loss of concentration or
      fatigue. In some cases iron deficiency can lead to neurological manifestations such as
      restless-legs-syndrome (RLS). Restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorders which is
      accompanied by substantial urge to move legs or other parts of the body and unpleasant
      sensations.

      Aim of this study is to to investigate the prevalence of RLS in patients with inflammatory
      bowel disease and furthermore evaluate the effect of iron supplementation in patients with
      iron deficiency and concomitant RLS.

    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological disease significantly impacting live
      quality. Two recent studies from North America and Japan revealed a surprisingly high
      prevalence for RLS in Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis (30% and 21%, respectively). The
      underlying cause for this high prevalence remains elusive at this point.

      To address this gap, a cohort of 353 IBD patients from a tertiary IBD centre was
      prospectively evaluated by our IBD team as well as by the colleagues from neurology. IBD
      patients (age ≥ 18 years) presenting at our IBD outpatient clinic (tertiary referral center)
      between February 2014 and February 2015 were prospectively recruited for the study after
      written consent. The study was approved (16 January 2014) by the ethics committee of the
      Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin (reference EA4/132/13).
      Patients were screened for symptoms of iron deficiency (ID) and RLS by a self-developed
      questionnaire and explored for RLS symptoms by a gastroenterologist. When at least one
      symptom of RLS was present, patients were referred to a neurologist for RLS or differential
      diagnosis.

      Additionally patients with RLS symptoms were screened for iron-, folic acid- and vitamin
      B12-deficiency. If a deficiency was detected, patients were substituted. In patients with
      deficiencies, follow-up visits were scheduled at week 4 and 11 after starting
      supplementation. Follow-up visits were conducted by the neurologist and the IRLS was
      performed in all patients at each visit.
