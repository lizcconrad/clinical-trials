  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to understand the effect of a caffeine intake, sleep habits, anxiety
      about surgery, alcohol intake and smoking status upon the dose of the anaesthetic drug,
      propofol, required for anaesthetic induction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that modifiable environmental factors may cause reversible
      changes in a patients neurobiology which affect their responsiveness to anaesthetic drugs.
      Such factors may include chronic caffeine intake, chronic sleep deprivation, acute anxiety
      about surgery, alcohol intake and smoking. Investigation of the relationship between such
      factors and the dose of anaesthetic required for loss of consciousness may not only allow for
      better prediction of dose requirements but may also allow for optimisation of patients prior
      to undergoing general anaesthesia with a view to decreasing anaesthetic dose requirements and
      the complications associated with this.

      To address this questions, the investigators will be asking patients admitted for any day
      case surgery at Chelsea &amp; Westminster hospital to complete five short questionnaires and a
      demographic sheet addressing 1) Caffeine intake 2) Sleep habits 3) Anxiety about the
      operation 4) Alcohol intake 5) Smoking status.

      This will then be compared to the amount of the anaesthetic drug Propofol required and the
      time taken to induce loss of consciousness prior to surgery. Loss of consciousness will be
      measured subjectively by loss of eye opening response and loss of verbal response when a
      patient is asked to count backwards from 100.

      The investigators also wish to investigate whether these same 5 factors affect patient
      reported postoperative pain and analgesia requirements. As such the investigators will also
      ask participants to rate their level of pain whilst at rest and whilst coughing at two time
      points after the operation (1hr and 3hrs postoperatively). We will also record how much
      patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is requested and received in the postoperative period.
