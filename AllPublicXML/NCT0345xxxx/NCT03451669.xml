  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports in the past of using thermal cameras to demonstrate flow in the
      tubing as a surrogate of proper shunt function. This was shown to have almost 90% accuracy at
      determining proper functioning but required expensive equipment that was not universally
      available. There is now smart phone based thermal camera technology (Flir One:
      http://www.flir.com/flirone/) that could make this technique widely available for health care
      use. The goal of the study is to determine if this device can demonstrate flow in the distal
      tubing of a VP shunt.
