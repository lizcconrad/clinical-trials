  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and acute performance of the THERMOCOOL
      SMARTTOUCH® SF-5D catheter used in combination with the nMARQ™ Multi-Channel RF Generator
      with TGA mode in the treatment of Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (PAF) during standard
      electrophysiology mapping and RF ablation procedures.

      The QDOT-FAST study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, interventional clinical
      study.
