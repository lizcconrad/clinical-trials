      This is a phase 1, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of oral TP-271 in healthy
      adult subjects. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 50 years who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

      This is a phase 1, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending-dose study to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of oral TP-271 in healthy
      adult subjects. Male or female subjects aged 18 to 50 years who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in this study.

      Up to 5 cohorts of 8 subjects each (up to a total of 40 subjects) will be enrolled. Subjects
      in each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive multiple oral doses of TP 271 or placebo.
      Every effort will be made to dose all subjects in a cohort on the same day.

      Doses of study drug will be administered orally either once daily in the morning or twice
      daily in the morning and evening from Days 1 to 7. In all subjects, the morning dose will be
      administered following an overnight fast (minimum 8 hours) of food and all beverages, except
      for water. For subjects in Cohorts D and E only, the evening dose will be administered
      following a minimum 3-hour fast of food and all beverages, except for water. Fasting in all
      cohorts will continue for at least 2 hours following each study drug administration.

      During the Screening Period (within 28 days prior to the subject receiving study drug), each
      subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date an ICF prior to
      undergoing any study-related procedures.
