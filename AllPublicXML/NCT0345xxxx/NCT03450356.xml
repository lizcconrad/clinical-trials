  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Goal of the current project is the development of a German-language test battery for a
      realistic investigation of core areas of social issues Cognition (emotion, perspective
      taking). This test battery should be used in the investigation of patients with
      neuropsychological disorders. Investigators plan to establish a German-version of the TASIT
      that is more sensitive and shorter in administration than the original TASIT.
