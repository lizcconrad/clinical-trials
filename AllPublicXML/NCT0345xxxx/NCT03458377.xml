  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses what impact has on colonoscopy quality the implementation of a telephone
      educational intervention carried out individually on the patient in the days before the test.
      Half of the study patients will receive the educational intervention and the other half will
      not.

    <textblock>
      A high-quality colonoscopy is an examination in with patients receive an indicated procedure,
      correct and relevant diagnoses are recognized or excluded, any therapy provided is
      appropriate, and all steps that minimize risk have been taken.

      But quality also refers to pre-procedure and post-procedure quality issues such as
      information, booking, choice, privacy, dignity, aftercare and satisfaction of patients. All
      those issues can negatively affect the willingness of patients to perform the test and the
      possibility of preparing adequately. And what is more, it can diminish the quality of the own
      exploration, the satisfaction of the patients and their adherence to programs of endoscopic
      follow-up.

      An action on these colonoscopy non-technical issues with a telephone educational intervention
      performed by the gastrointestinal endoscopy nurse can positively improve all (pre, intra and
      post-procedure) colonoscopy quality indicators.

Two groups. One of them will receive an complete educational telephone call 7 days before de procedure in addition to the information received from the primary care center on the day of the request for the test. The inclusion in each one of the groups will be done through a randomization sheet.
The intervention includes educational aspects:
Explanation of the importance of making the test. Guidelines for the usual medication of the patient. Definition of fasting, explanation of colon cleansing adjusted to the presence of predictors of poor basic preparation. Explanation of the endoscopic procedure with the elimination of erroneous concepts of the patient with respect to the procedure. Explanation of norms of action subsequent to the endoscopy. Management of scheduling, destined to improve the adherence of the patient for the test.</intervention_model_description>
