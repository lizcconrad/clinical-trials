  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a novel pressure monitoring device that hooks to standard
      urinary catheters. The investigators will be testing how the pressure measurements recorded
      with this device compare to the gold standard measurement of urodynamics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For patients with neurogenic bladder, regular monitoring of bladder pressure and capacity is
      a critical component of maintaining renal and urinary health. This monitoring is currently
      done by in-office urodynamics testing (UDS). This testing is done intermittently, leaving
      open the possibility of worsening of bladder function and renal deterioration between testing
      sessions.

      This study utilizes a novel pressure monitoring device which is portable and hooks to the end
      of a standard urinary catheter. The investigators will be investigating if this device can
      achieve similar pressure measurements as UDS. The investigators hope is that this device will
      provide similar measurements to UDS, and can be developed as a home bladder-pressure
      monitoring tool.

      This study will enroll children with neurogenic bladder who are currently undergoing UDS as
      part of their regular care. The measurements will be taken as part of the standard UDS
      protocol (with insertion of the UDS catheter) and will then be compared to the values
      obtained with UDS testing.
