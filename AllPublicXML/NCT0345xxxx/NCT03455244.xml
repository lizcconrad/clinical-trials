      This is a prospective, observational, single-center, single-arm, clinical trial designed to
      assess the efficacy of FFRangio in measuring FFR obtained from angiography compared to
      Invasive FFR for diagnosing hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis in Multi-Vessel
      Disease.

    <intervention_name>FFRangio</intervention_name>
    <description>FFRangio is a non-invasive image-based software device that provides physicians with a quantitative analysis of functional significance of the coronary lesion, similar to invasive FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve), and a qualitative three-dimensional model of the demonstrated coronary arteries, during routine PCI procedure. The CathWorks FFRangio software device is able to perform all required processing and calculations, based only on angiography images and hemodynamics information that are acquired during the coronary catheterization procedure.
The CathWorks FFRangioTM technology does not require any additional use of invasive devices, or any additional vasodilation treatment, as required by other known FFR techniques.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Subjects with stable angina, unstable angina or NSTEMI who are referred to coronary
        angiography, have multi-vessel coronary artery disease and have an invasive FFR measurement
        at two lesions at minimum. Each subject will undergo both the standard invasive FFRs and
        the investigational FFRangio.

             50% in two main vessels (LAD, LCX and/or RCA) each and in whom invasive FFR is being
             assessed at these stenoses.

          -  Patients undergoing invasive FFR with Adenosine, ATP or Papaverine used as hyperemic
             stimulus.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindication for FFR examination or administration of vasodilators.

          -  Clinical presentation of an acute infarct (STEMI) or presented with STEMI in past
             year.

          -  CTO in a target vessel.

          -  Prior CABG, valvular surgery, TAVI/TAVR, or heart transplantation.

          -  Known LVEF ≤45%.

          -  Arteries supplying akinetic or severe hypokinetic territories if already known based
             on prior imaging.

          -  TIMI Grade 2 or lower at baseline.

          -  Target lesions involve Left Main (stenosis ≥50%.)

          -  In-stent restenosis in a target vessel.

          -  Heavily diffused atherosclerosis diseases defined as the presence of diffuse, serial
             gross luminal irregularities present in the majority of the coronary tree.

          -  Target coronary vessels are supplied by major collaterals.

          -  Lesion is in ectatic segment which includes dilatation in diameter at least 1.5 times
             that of the adjacent normal coronary artery.

          -  Coronary angiograms not acquired per instructions as defined in the Study Protocol.
