  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label randomised controlled clinical trial will compare the safety, tolerability,
      therapeutic efficacy and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of arterolane-piperaquine,
      arterolane-piperaquine plus mefloquine versus artemether-lumefantrine.in children with
      uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Kilifi, Kenya. This study will also provide an up to date
      insight on the current presence of antimalarial resistance in this site.

      In addition, all children will be treated with a single low dose of primaquine, dosing is age
      based.

      The investigators will recruit 219 patients aged 2 years to 12 years with acute uncomplicated
      falciparum malaria in Kilifi County Hospital.
