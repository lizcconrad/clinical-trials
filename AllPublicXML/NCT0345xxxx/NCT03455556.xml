    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the best dose and side effects of anetumab ravtansine when
      given together with atezolizumab and how well they work in treating participants with
      non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Monoclonal
      antibodies, such as anetumab ravtansine and atezolizumab, may interfere with the ability of
      tumor cells to grow and spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the recommended phase II dose of anetumab ravtansine combined with
      atezolizumab in advanced MSLN+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). (Phase I) II. To determine
      the confirmed response rate for the combination of anetumab ravtansine and atezolizumab in
      MSLN+ 2nd line NSCLC. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe adverse events and toxicities of the combination treatment of anetumab
      ravtansine and atezolizumab. (Phase I) II. To identify preliminary evidence of clinical
      activity (i.e. response, timed endpoints, etc.) (Phase I) III. To determine the
      progression-free survival (PFS) and the 1-year PFS rate for the combination of anetumab
      ravtansine and atezolizumab in 2nd-line NSCLC. (Phase II) IV. To determine the overall
      survival of anetumab ravtansine combined with atezolizumab in second-line therapy of NSCLC.
      (Phase II) V. Adverse events will also be summarized as well. (Phase II)

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine using flow cytometry the levels of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death
      (BIM) in circulating CD8+ CD11a+ PD-1+ T-cells, in peripheral blood samples collected from
      patients prior to initiation of therapy (baseline) and correlating these with confirmed
      response rate during and following treatment with the combination regimen.

      II. To determine tissue MSLN and PD-L1 expression and correlate with response to combination
      therapy with atezolizumab and anetumab ravtansine.

      III. To correlate baseline serum soluble PDL-1 (sPDL-1) with response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of anetumab ravtansine followed by a phase
      II study.

      Participants receive anetumab ravtansine intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and atezolizumab
      IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.

                       dermatologic manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis
                       would be excluded) are permitted provided that they meet the following
                       conditions:

                         -  Patients with psoriasis must have a baseline ophthalmologic exam to
                            rule out ocular manifestations

                         -  Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA)

                         -  Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency
                            topical steroids (e.g., hydrocortisone 2.5%, hydrocortisone butyrate
                            0.1%, flucinolone 0.01%, desonide 0.05%, aclometasone dipropionate
                            0.05%)

                         -  No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the last 12
                            months (not requiring psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation [PUVA],
                            methotrexate, retinoids, biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors;
                            high potency or oral steroids)

          -  History of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, pneumonitis (including drug induced),
             organizing pneumonia (i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans, cryptogenic organizing
             pneumonia, etc.), or evidence of active pneumonitis on screening chest computed
             tomography (CT) scan; note: History of radiation pneumonitis in the radiation field
             (fibrosis) is permitted

          -  Severe infections =&lt; 4 weeks prior to registration, including, but not limited to,
             hospitalization for complications of infection, bacteremia, or severe pneumonia

          -  Signs or symptoms of infection =&lt; 2 weeks prior to registration

          -  Major surgical procedure =&lt; 28 days prior to registration or anticipation of need for
             a major surgical procedure during the course of the study

          -  Patients with corneal epitheliopathy or any eye disorder that may predispose the
             patients to this condition as judged by an ophthalmologist

               -  Note: Low grades of superficial punctate keratitis, within the range seen in the
                  normal population, should not lead to the exclusion of the patient

          -  Non-healing serious wound, ulcer, or bone fracture unrelated to the primary tumor

          -  Previous assignment to treatment during this study; patients permanently withdrawn
             from study participation will not be allowed to re-enter the study

          -  Substance abuse, psychological, or social conditions that may interfere with the
             patient's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results
