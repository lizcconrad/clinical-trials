    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-site, open-label, single-arm intervention study in
      African-American/Black subjects with HFrEF nested in the Henry Ford Heart Failure
      Pharmacogenomics Registry, and will be conducted at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit,
      MI.

      There will be a 7-day screening period, a 57-day open-label treatment period, and a safety
      follow-up at day 87 or 30 days after the last administration of the investigational product.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of adding ivabradine therapy to the
      standard of care (SOC) in African-American/Black subjects with HF and reduced ejection
      fraction (HFrEF) on changes in heart rate (HR) from baseline (SOC alone). Changes in HR from
      baseline will be correlated with the genetic background of the studied population, as well as
      with the changes from baseline in activity level of the subjects, as measured by both a
      standard 6-minute walk distance and an accelerometer device.

      The primary hypothesis is that ivabradine effectively reduces HR between baseline and day 57
      in African-American/Black subjects. Because mean reductions of approximately 5 beat per
      minute (bpm) have been observed in the overall placebo-treated subjects in the SHIFT study as
      well as in the placebo-treated subjects of the subgroup analysis of
      non-African-American/Black subjects enrolled in the SHIFT study, we will test whether the
      mean reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm, and estimate the degree to which the mean
      reduction with ivabradine exceeds 5 bpm.

    <description>5mg Ivabradine: On day 1, eligible subjects with confirmed sinus rhythm and HR ≥ 70 bpm will be enrolled into a 57-day open-label treatment period. The starting dose of ivabradine is 5 mg twice daily (BID).
2.5mg Ivabradine: In subjects with a history of conduction defects, or in subjects in whom bradycardia could lead to hemodynamic compromise, therapy is to be initiated at 2.5 mg BID.
Changes in HR from baseline will be correlated with the genetic background of the studied population, as well as with the changes from baseline in activity level of the subjects, as measured by both a standard 6-minute walk distance and an accelerometer device.</description>
