  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) has been proposed as an indicator of arterial tone that
      can predict norepinephrine-dependent arterial pressure. Eadyn is calculated using the ratio
      of respiratory pulse pressure variation (PPV) over the respiratory stroke volume variation
      (SVV). Guinot et al demonstrated a decrease in the duration of norepinephrine treatment with
      the use of Eadyn. To date, studies that have validated Eadyn at bedside have used cardiac
      output (CO) calibrated pulse contour analysis (PiCCO™, Pulsion™) or oesophageal doppler. Such
      monitoring systems need dedicated and specific arterial line and venous access that may limit
      their use at bedside. In addition to CO calibrated pulse contour analysis, CO uncalibrated
      pulse contour analysis has been developed and is considered less invasive. Nevertheless, one
      limitation of the latter CO monitoring is inaccuracy of CO measurement in patients who are
      being treated with norepinephrine. These limitations may affect the predictability of Eadyn.
      We conducted a prospective study in a university hospital ICU. Patients with vasoplegic
      syndrome for whom the intensive care physician planned to decrease the norepinephrine dosage
      were included. Hemodynamic and uncalibrated pulse contour analysis (Volume view, FloTrac,
      Edwards Lifescience, Irvine) values were obtained before and after decreasing the
      norepinephrine dosage. Responders were defined by a &gt;10% decrease in mean arterial pressure
      (MAP).

      -  Background : Dynamic arterial elastance (Eadyn) has been proposed as an indicator of
           arterial tone that can predict norepinephrine-dependent arterial pressure. Eadyn is
           calculated using the ratio of respiratory pulse pressure variation (PPV) over the
           respiratory stroke volume variation (SVV). Guinot et al demonstrated a decrease in the
           duration of norepinephrine treatment with the use of Eadyn. To date, studies that have
           validated Eadyn at bedside have used cardiac output (CO) calibrated pulse contour
           analysis (PiCCO™, Pulsion™) or oesophageal doppler. Such monitoring systems need
           dedicated and specific arterial line and venous access that may limit their use at
           bedside. In addition to CO calibrated pulse contour analysis, CO uncalibrated pulse
           contour analysis has been developed and is considered less invasive. Nevertheless, one
           limitation of the latter CO monitoring is inaccuracy of CO measurement in patients who
           are being treated with norepinephrine. These limitations may affect the predictability
           of Eadyn.

        -  Purpose : To date, no study has evaluated the ability of Eadyn measured by uncalibrated
           pulse contour analysis to assess arterial pressure response to a decreased dose of
           norepinephrine. We tested the hypothesis that Eadyn calculated from uncalibrated pulse
           contour analysis predicts the arterial-pressure response to a norepinephrine decrease in
           patients treated with norepinephrine

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion criteria were all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of vasoplegic syndrome,
        treated with norepinephrine, for whom the attending physician decided to decrease the
        norepinephrine dosage. The vasoplegic syndrome was defined as persistent arterial
        hypotension with normal or high cardiac output and low systemic vascular resistance

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Exclusion criteria were patients treated with epinephrine and/or dobutamine, arrhythmia,
        intra-abdominal hypertension and patients younger than 18 years.
