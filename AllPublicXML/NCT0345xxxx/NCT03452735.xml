  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Etiopathogenesis of Chronic inflammatory rheumatisms (CIR) includes genetic, autoimmune and
      environmental factors. Their impact on the quality of life is important, leading to a
      sometimes severe disability. Thus they are likely to affect female fertility through several
      mechanisms, including autoimmune since the association between immunity and fertility has
      already been demonstrated in other autoimmune diseases.

      This study wants to evaluate and compare the birth rate between CIR and control group.

      Data collection will be carried out using a questionnaire submitted to women in charge of the
      rheumatology department of the University Hospital of Toulouse and having agreed to
      participate:

        -  women with Rheumatoid arthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis or Chronic
           juvenile arthritis for the chronic inflammatory rheumatism group

        -  women with a mechanical rheumatic pathology for the control group

      The primary endpoint was birth rate after spontaneous or induced pregnancy in patients who
      attempted to procreate, in the CIR group and in the control group.
