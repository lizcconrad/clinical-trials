  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if pre-warming of arthroscopic fluid reduces
      immediate post-surgical pain in hip arthroscopy patients. The investigators hypothesize there
      will be a significant decrease in the Visual Analog Score (VAS) measured 30 minutes
      post-operatively in the warmed fluid group compared to the control group. Secondary outcome
      measures to be collected will include VAS scores 60 minutes after surgery and on
      post-operative day (POD) one. Additionally, the investigators will collect post-operative
      temperature measured 30 and 60 minutes post-operatively as well as morphine equivalent dosing
      in PACU and at the two-week follow up visit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last two decades, hip arthroscopy for the treatment of femoral acetabular impingement
      has increased rapidly. Currently, over 30k hip scopes are performed annually in the United
      States (incidence 1.06 per 10K). Due to anatomical differences, hip arthroscopy procedures
      have the potential for significant fluid extravasation when compared to knee arthroscopy. A
      2011 study on hip arthroscopy showed on average 9.68 liters of fluid were used for a standard
      hip procedure; of that 1.13 liters absorbed into the surrounding soft tissues. A recent
      systematic review and meta-analysis showed warming of arthroscopic fluids significantly
      decreased the risk of hypothermia during hip arthroscopy. Additionally, active warming has
      been shown to decrease the rate of surgical site infection during numerous procedures. In
      total knee arthroplasty patients, a forced air warming gown significantly reduced narcotic
      pain consumption compared to standard care. However, the benefits of active warming for
      decreasing post-operative pain has not been studied in hip arthroscopy patients.
      Specifically, the investigators were interested in the roll the pre-warming arthroscopic
      fluid plays in post-operative pain after hip arthroscopy. The purpose of this study is to see
      if pre-warming of arthroscopic fluid reduces immediate post-surgical pain and narcotic
      consumption in hip arthroscopy patients.

    <time_frame>Pre-operatively, 30 and 60 minutes after completion of surgery, Post Op Days 1 and 14.</time_frame>
    <description>A Visual Analog Score (VAS) will be measured pre-operatively, 30 and 60 minutes after patient arrival in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). Additionally, VAS will be collected in the clinic on post-operative day (POD) 1 and POD 14. The visual analog scale measures subject reported pain on a scale of 0-100 with a score of 0 indicating no pain and 100 indicating the worst pain possible.</description>

    <measure>Morphine Equivalent Dosage (MED)</measure>
    <time_frame>After completion of surgery and at the 2-week Post Operative Visit</time_frame>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Hip Outcomes Score (HOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The HOS has been validated in patients with femoral acetabular impingement and has two subscales (Activities of Daily Living and Sports). The ADL subscale contained 19 items pertaining to basic daily activities, and the sports subscale contained 9 items pertaining to higher-level activities. The ADL and sports subscales are scored separately. The response to each item on the ADL subscale is scored from 4 to 0, with 4 indicating &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 0 indicating &quot;unable to do.&quot; The scores for each of the items are added together to obtain a total. The total number of items with a response is multiplied by 4 to obtain the highest potential score. The item score total is divided by the highest potential score. This value is then multiplied by 100 to obtain a percentage. The sports subscale is scored in a similar manner, with the highest potential score being 36. A higher score represents a higher level of physical function.</description>

    <measure>Veterans Rand 12 (VR-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The Veterans RAND 12 Item Health Survey (VR-12) is a brief, generic, multi-use, self-administered health survey comprised of 12 items. The instrument is primarily used to measure health related quality of life and to estimate disease. The 12 items in the questionnaire correspond to eight principal physical and mental health domains including general health perceptions; physical functioning; role limitations due to physical and emotional problems; bodily pain; energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The 12 items are summarized into two scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS). PCS and MCS summary scores are standardized using a t-score transformation and normed to a U.S. population of a score of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. The subscales are not combined or averaged for a total score. A Higher score represents a higher function.</description>
