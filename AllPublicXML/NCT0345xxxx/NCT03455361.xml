  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical evaluation of osteointegration of bone level implants (Stark conical screw implants,
      with V-Blast surface treatment), placed without sufficient primary stability.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      26 Implants were placed with a unique operative protocol in 4 private offices. A detailed
      informed consent was obtained from all patients. Surgical guides were used to achieve the
      idea implant position and axis.

      Osteotomy drills were used in the sequence recommended by the implant manufacturer. Bone type
      was assessed by CT examinations using the classification proposed by Rebaudi.

      All implants were tested by applying a lateral mild load with a probe in order to verify
      mobility immediately after placement.

      Parameter used to assess a low primary stability were:

        -  insertion torque lower than 10 N / cm

        -  slight mobility of implant upon application of lateral load of 250 g After surgery,
           patients were instructed not to chew or to wear their removable dentures in the treated
           areas.

      Follow-up post-operative visits were scheduled at 1 and 4 weeks. At 4-6 months after
      placement a periapical radiograph was taken, a torque/countertorque test of 30 Ncm was
      conducted and osteointegrated implants were restored. Patients were recalled, examined, and
      periapical radiographs were taken for a minimum of 6 months.

        the sample is composed by patients who had received Stark bone level V-Blast implants in 4
        private offices in Italy. The same surgical protocol was used for all implants and a
        detailed informed consent was obtained from all patients, and included in their respective
        charts.

        For the study objective were enrolled patient who didn't achieved primary stability at the
        placement: 26 patient
