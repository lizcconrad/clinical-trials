  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      studies suggest that off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery is associated with improved
      outcomes when compared to on-pump coronary artery bypass. many studies have shown that
      off-pump coronary bypass surgery reduces patient morbidity and mortality.

      manipulation of the coronary arteries during cardiac surgery can stimulate the adjacent
      post-ganglionic sympathetic fibers and mimic stellate ganglion stimulation ,stellate ganglion
      block (SGB) can interrupt this reflex by decreasing the efferent cervical sympathetic
      outflows.

      when adopting off-pump surgery , the cardiac surgery team must adopt new techniques to handle
      a beating heart and the variations in hemodynamics that can occur when performing this type
      of procedure the incidence rate of cardiac arrhythmia occurring during and after surgery is
      one of the major complication in open heart surgery. in addition , intraoperative hemodynamic
      disorders, caused by changes in plasma levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine after
      surgical stimulation , are some of challenges for patients undergoing off-pump coronary
      artery bypass surgery. hemodynamic disruption leads to myocardial ischemia, resulting in
      increased incidence of cardiovascular events and mortality.

      stellate ganglion is formed by the fusion of inferior cervical and first thoracic sympathetic
      ganglia and is located behind the subclavian artery and anterior to the first rib. the
      inferior cervical cardiac nerves arise from the medial aspect of the stellate ganglia and
      provide the cardio-accelerator nerve fibers to the cardiac plexus. stellate ganglion
      stimulation augments peak systolic pressure, and the enhanced myocardial contractility is
      secondary to stimulation by postganglionic nerve fibers which traverse from stellate ganglion
      down the great vessels and along the coronary arteries into the myocardium.the blockage of
      inferior cervical cardiac nerves is responsible for the bradycardia seen following SGB. SGB
      has been shown to prevent and control perioperative hypertension induced by increased
      sympathetic activity.

    <description>After induction of general anesthesia, patients will receive a stellate ganglion block using a standard and well described paratracheal technique, The patient's head will be extended and a 4-5-cm, 22-gauge needle inserted at the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle just below the level of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the transverse process of C6 or C7. After advancing to the transverse process the needle will be withdrawn 2-3 mm prior to injection. A negative aspiration test will be performed in two planes before a 1-ml test dose is used to exclude unintentional intravascular injection (vertebral or subclavian arteries) or subarachnoid injection into the dural sleeve.4 A total of 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected.</description>
