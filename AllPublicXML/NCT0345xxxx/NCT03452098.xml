  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A case-series review was performed on five collegiate athletes with osteochondral lesions of
      the knee at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). All subjects received surgical
      intervention to treat the defect. The surgeries performed were either an Osteoarticular
      Transfer System (OATS) procedure and/or a Microfracturing procedure. Subjects were treated
      post-operatively by the CSUN team physical therapist and/or athletic trainers at CSUN. This
      paper seeks to provide information about osteochondral defects of the knee, the surgical
      interventions, and a protocol for post-operative treatment and rehabilitation of such
      injuries.
