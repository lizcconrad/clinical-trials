      232 women underwent transvaginal mesh repair (TVM)with /without transvaginal hysterectomy for
      symptomatic POP, including group A（accepted herniamesh polypropylene mesh， 117
      patients)；group B （underwent biological graft of cook，115 patients)；follow-ups for six months
      and one year after the surgery and a questionnaire about the life habits associated with
      relapse.

      We prospectively study a total of 232 women who underwent transvaginal mesh repair (TVM)with
      /without transvaginal hysterectomy for symptomatic POP, the patients into two groups :group A
      was accepted herniamesh polypropylene mesh(117)；group B underwent biological graft of
      cook(115)；Each patient underwent an interview that included a POP-Q which was quantified
      according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POPQ) system;follow-ups for six months
      and one year after the surgery and a questionnaire about the life habits associated with
      relapse.
