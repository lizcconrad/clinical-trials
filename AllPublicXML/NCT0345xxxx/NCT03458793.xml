  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to examine the feasibility of a Physical Activity
      Intervention for Loneliness (PAIL) in community-dwelling older adults. The research is a
      feasibility study designed as a two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a wait-list
      control group (intervention will be offered at 12 weeks to control group).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After an initial screening for the eligibility based on current physical activity and levels
      of loneliness, up to 40 eligible participants will be randomised into the experimental or
      control group. Participants in the intervention group will be offered a 12-week outdoor group
      walking and health education workshops intervention. Each session will be performed once
      weekly for up to 90 minutes per session. Participants in the control group will be asked to
      maintain their current level of physical activity. Baseline and immediate post-intervention
      assessments will include anthropometry (height, weight, BMI), assessment of the resting blood
      pressure, physical activity for a 7-day period using accelerometer, questionnaires to assess
      loneliness, social support, social networks, social contacts, anxiety and depression, and
      expected outcomes of, and barriers to, exercise. Focus groups with participants will be
      conducted at 4 weeks mid-point and post-intervention to assess how the intervention might be
      improved; focus group transcripts will be thematically analysed using a phenomenological
      approach.

    <masking_description>Computerised randomisation will be performed by an external researcher not involved in the delivery of the intervention or outcome assessment. Participants who will be assessors of their psychosocial outcomes using self-report questionnaires will be blind to the allocation concealment at the time of completing the initial questionnaires. Intervention providers who will be responsible for outcome assessments will not be blind to the intervention assignment as this would not be possible given the study and walks will be conducted by the PhD student.</masking_description>

    <measure>Loneliness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Loneliness will be assessed using the 8-item UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) Loneliness Scale (UCLA-8) (Hays and DiMatteo, 1987). Items will be rated on the 4-grade Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 4 (often). The total scoring is ranged from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 32 with the higher score indicating more loneliness considered to be a worse outcome. Questions &quot;I am an outgoing person&quot; and &quot;I can find companionship when I want it&quot; will be reverse scored.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social support</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be assessed using the 20-item Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOSSSS) (Sherbourne and Stewart, 1991). The questionnaire will consist of 20 items including the assessment of a structural social support (number of close friends - item 1) and assessment of functional social support (items 2-20). Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaire using the five-point Likert scale ranging from low social support &quot;None of the time&quot; (1 point) to a high social support &quot;All of the Time&quot; (5 points). The total score will be calculated as the sum of the scores. Higher scores of support will show better social support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social networks</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Social networks will be assessed using the 6-item Lubben's Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) (Lubben et al., 2006).LSNS-6 has total 6 items divided into two subscales: family and friendship (three items for each). The total score will be calculated by sum of the six items with scores ranging from 0 to 30. A sum of scores for six items less than 12 will indicate that the respondent had fewer than two people for social interactions. Similarly, a cut-point score of 6 on the three-item will indicate as being at risk for social isolation (Lubben et al., 2006). The family subscale will indicate that the participants had less than two family members to perform social interactions, similarly for the friendship subscale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression and anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Depression and anxiety will be assessed using the 14-item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983).The questionnaire consists of 14 items with the assessment on four-point scale (0-3). The maximum total score for each subscale will be 21 points. The cut-offs for the total score for each sub-scale will be: 0-7 - normal, 8-11 - mild, 12-14 - moderate, 15 and over - severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy for exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy for exercise will be measured using the revised 9-item Self-Efficacy for Walking/Exercise Scale (SEE) in a paper-and-pencil format (Resnick and Jenkins, 2000). Using numbers from 0 (not confident) to 10 (very confident) participants will be asked to rate their confidence in their ability to walk/exercise for 20 minutes three times per week (Resnick and Jenkins, 2000). The scoring will be calculated by summing the numerical ratings for each response and dividing by the total number of items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction with level of social contacts</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Satisfaction with level of social contacts will be measured with the question &quot;How satisfied are you with your social contacts?&quot; (Fokkema and Knipscheer, 2007). Participants will rate their answer on a scale from 0 (entirely dissatisfied) to 10 (entirely satisfied).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Expected outcomes and barriers for exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Expected outcomes and barriers for exercise will be administered using the Expected Outcomes and Barriers for Habitual Exercise scale (Steinhardt and Dishman, 1989). Participants will be replying using the five-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;Strongly disagree&quot; (1 point) to &quot;Strongly agree&quot; (5 points). Scoring for each subscale will be provided by summing all numerical ratings for each item and divided by the total number of items. The total score of expected outcomes and barriers for exercise will be ranged from 1 point (low) to 5 points (high).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Accelerometry</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be measured using ActivPAL accelerometers (PAL Technologies Ltd. Glasgow, UK). Data will be exctracted for average step counts (steps/day), time stepping (hours), time sitting/lying (hours), and energy equivalent (METs) and analysed as continuos variable for pre-to post-intervention differences.</description>

             9) on the 3-item loneliness scale for the phone screening by Hughes et al., (2004);

          5. moderate to severe cognitive disability or clinical diagnosis of dementia;

          6. physical disability (i.e. SPPB score less than 9);

          7. severe frailty or any chronic health condition that precludes participation in the
             physical activity intervention and significantly limits the physical mobility of the
             participant (i.e. hospital settings/ non-ambulatory regime);

          8. cognitive disability (i.e. less than 14 points on MOCA);

          9. not able to give written informed consent;

         10. not English speaking that precludes taking pen and paper tests.
