  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) was introduced by Jalan and Williams in
      2002 to describe the acute deterioration in liver function over 2 to 4 weeks in a patient
      with well-compensated cirrhosis associated with a precipitating event (hepatotoxic:
      superimposed hepatitis viral infection, drug-induced liver injury, hepatotoxins, or excessive
      alcohol consumption; extra hepatic: variceal bleeding or sepsis), leading to severe
      deterioration in clinical status with jaundice and hepatic encephalopathy and/or HRS.
      Following this concept, several proposals for the diagnostic criteria of ACLF have been
      suggested.

      There may be regional differences in etiology, pathogenesis, and natural course of ACLF,
      which may in turn influence the overall outcome of this syndrome. So, proper diagnosis of
      ACLF and its precipitating factors in our locality enable us for proper management of these
      cases and dealing with these precipitating factors to be avoided later on in patients with
      liver cirrhosis

      Aim of the work:

      To identify the pattern of acute on chronic liver cell failure (ACLF) within 28 days
      including prevalence, percipitating factors, and outcome.

      Patients and methods

      Type of the study: Prospective hospital based study

      Site of the study: Tropical Medicine and Gastroenterology Department, Al-Rajhi University
      Hospital, Assiut University Hospitals, Assiut, Egypt. Written consent will be obtained from
      all the participants or their relatives before enrollment.

        CLD patients with HCV related etiology who will admitted to our hospital with picture of
        acute decompensation and deterioiration of pre-existing liver condition (defined by the
        development of ascites, encephalopathy, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and/or bacterial
        infection) associated with either a single organ failure (single renal failure or other
        single non-renal organ failure if associated with renal and/or brain dysfunction) or
        multiple organ failures) to meet the criteria of EASL-CLIF definition .
