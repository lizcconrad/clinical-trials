  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radium-223 chloride is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical with proven survival benefit in
      patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to bone. Beta-emitting
      radiopharmaceuticals have proven efficacy for palliating malignant bone pain. Nowadays,
      rhenium-188-HEDP is used in clinical practice for pain relief and palliative care. Several
      studies suggest that also rhenium-188-HEDP has the potential to improve overall survival. The
      purpose of this study is to investigate if treatment with rhenium-188-HEDP results in
      improvement of overall survival compared to treatment with radium-223-chloride.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to compare rhenium-188-HEDP (a beta-emitting
      radiopharmaceutical) with radium-223-chloride (an alfa-emitting radiopharmaceutical), in
      patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer metastatic to bone, with overall survival
      as primary endpoint.

      For radium-223-chloride, an overall survival benefit has been proven in a large randomized
      phase III trial. Although such a trial has never been performed for rhenium-188-HEDP, some
      trials in literature suggest a survival benefit for rhenium as well.

      Rhenium has some advantages compared to radium. Firstly, it is easily available as it can be
      produced in the hospital. Secondly, the costs of rhenium are significantly lower compared to
      radium. Lastly, rhenium seems to have a favorable pain response. However, no randomized
      trials have been performed to confirm this.
