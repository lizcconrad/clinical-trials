  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheters are frequently used for monitoring haemodynamic status and rapidly
      delivering fluid therapy during the peri- and postoperative periods. Indwelling central
      venous catheters are typically used 7-14 days postoperatively for additional monitoring and
      treatment, but patients may develop asymptomatic catheter-related thrombosis, leading to
      life-threatening pulmonary embolism and death. Early detection helps to avoid such
      complications. This prospective observational study investigated the risk factors associated
      with catheter-related right internal jugular vein thrombosis in pediatric patients. The study
      enrolled 80 pediatric patients who were scheduled to receive central venous catheter. To
      detect thrombus formation, Doppler ultrasound examinations from the thyroid cartilage level
      to the supraclavicular region were used after CVC placement and on each of the following days
      until the catheter was removed.

          -  patients with thrombocytopenia

          -  patients with a history of right internal jugular vein thrombosis

          -  patients who presented right internal jugular vein thrombosis or stenosis on
