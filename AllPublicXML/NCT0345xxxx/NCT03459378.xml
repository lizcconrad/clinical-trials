  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a retrospective single-centre study. Research data will be acquired
      via patient histories stored in the hospital data system. Data of patients who received a
      Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) at the University Hospital Graz between
      1.1.2004 and 31.12.2017 will be included into the study. The aim is to investigate the
      outcome (transplantation free survival, time to (re)occurrence of ascites, occurrence of
      hepatic encephalopathy) of patients with portal hypertension after TIPS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The implantation of a Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) is a valuable
      measure to reduce portal hypertension and prevent portal hypertension-related complications.
      It can be used as a symptomatic treatment in patients with chronic portal hypertension as
      well as for the treatment of active variceal bleedings or large gastrointestinal varices that
      go along with threatening bleeding danger.

      However, this invasive procedure carries a high risk for complications. 30-days mortality
      after TIPS implantation amounts between 4% and 45%.

      A common complication is the (initial) manifestation or deterioration of hepatic
      encephalopathy, which occurs in 33-46 % after TIPS implantation.

      Other complications that are directly related to the intervention are bleeding, infections
      and stent migration.

      Aim of this retrospective single centre study is to investigate the long-term outcome after
      TIPS implantation with regard to transplantation free survival and time to (re-) occurrence
      of portal hypertension-related complications, especially ascites and hepatic encephalopathy.

      Intervention-related complications as well as long-term effects should be evaluated to
      facilitate the decision for or against TIPS.
