  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The JADE wRAP™, a wrist worn cuff to measure blood pressure and its supporting software
      platform is currently at the final alpha prototype stage of development and is not intended
      for sale.

      There are minimal risks with using the JADE wRAP™ device; however, the likelihood of these
      risks has been reduced through design limitations on electrical power delivered to the device
      and of the pressure delivered to the cuff portion. Patients should experience little to no
      discomfort from the inflation of the JADE wRAP™ cuff.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate the JADE wRAP™ in adult patients (≥18 years of age)
      according to American National Standard, ANSI/AAMI/ISO 81060-2:2013, Non-invasive
      sphygmomanometers — Part 2: Clinical investigation of automated measurement type.

      The study is intended to be a simple validation of blood pressure parameters only (Systolic
      and Diastolic). This study is not intended to yield any other special information.

      OBJECTIVES

      1) To validate the JADE wRAP™ for systolic and diastolic blood pressures compared to the
      reference standard mercury sphygmomanometer.

      The data collected from this study is for internal purposes only and should assist in further
      developing the device and supporting platform to a beta stage.
