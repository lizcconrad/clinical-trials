  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot phase II trial is to identify the molecular and genetic mechanisms
      by which statins influence breast cancer cell proliferation. Simvastatin may stop the growth
      of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and reduce the
      aggressiveness of breast cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the relationship between short-term use of oral simvastatin on change in
      expression of Ki-67 as a candidate biomarker of breast tumor proliferation among women with
      clinical stage 1 or 2- primary invasive breast cancer.

      II. Evaluate the relationship between short-term use of oral simvastatin on changes in other
      candidate predictive markers of breast tumor proliferation (cyclin D1 and P27), changes in a
      marker of apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 [CC3]), changes in a marker of inflammation
      (c-reactive protein [CRP]) and as novel additional biomarkers changes in the composition of
      the plasma membrane (lipid rafts) and changes in activation of signaling markers
      (phosphorylation [p]Akt, pMAPK, pEGFR, PHER2).

      III. To conduct exploratory analyses comparing the effect of statins on breast tumor
      proliferation and apoptosis in groups defined by tumor expression of hydroxymethylglutaryl
      co-enzyme A (CoA) reductase (HMG-CoA), estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)
      status, HER2neu, and tumor grade.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive simvastatin orally (PO) daily for 2-4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
