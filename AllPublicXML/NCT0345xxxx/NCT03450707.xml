      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of
      intravenous thiamine (vitamin B1) on lactate, cellular oxygen consumption, global oxygen
      consumption and biomarkers of neurologic injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to investigate the effect of
      intravenous thiamine (vitamin B1) on lactate, cellular oxygen consumption, global oxygen
      consumption and biomarkers of neurologic injury after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).
      Patients who have sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after OHCA and have a
      lactate of 3 or greater will be eligible for the study. Enrolled patients will be randomized
      to intravenous thiamine 500mg twice daily for 5 doses or matching placebo (100cc normal
      saline). Blood will be drawn at several time points and patients will be connected to a
      noninvasive monitor for continuous measurement of global oxygen consumption. The primary
      endpoint is change in lactate level. Secondary endpoints include change in pyruvate
      dehydrogenase activity, change in cellular and global oxygen consumption, change in NSE and
      S100 (biomarkers of neurologic injury) and CPC-E score (a score that assesses neurologic and
      functional impairment) at hospital discharge, 30 and 90 days.

    <masking_description>A randomization list was prepared by an independent statistician using 1:1 randomization in blocks of four. This list will be provided to the research pharmacy, and the research pharmacy will be the only unblinded people involved with the study, and will have no patient contact or role in the analysis or other aspects of the study. Thiamine is colorless and odorless, and the 500mg dose is mixed in 100mL of normal saline. Placebo will be 100mL of normal saline and is indistinguishable in appearance from thiamine. Study team, clinical team and patient and family will all be blind to the allocation.</masking_description>

    <description>Patients randomized to the thiamine arm will receive thiamine 500mg in 100mL of normal saline intravenously every 12 hours for 5 doses. Patients will be connected to a noninvasive monitor for measurement of global oxygen consumption (VO2) for at least 48 hours or until extubated, whichever comes first. Blood will be drawn at 0,6,12,24,72 and 168 hours for measurement of lactate, thiamine level, pyruvate dehydrogenase, NSE, S100 and other markers of organ injury. CPC-E score will be assessed prior to hospital discharge and at 30 and 90 days to evaluate differences in neurologic and functional impairment.</description>
