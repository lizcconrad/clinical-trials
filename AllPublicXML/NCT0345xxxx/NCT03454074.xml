  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An accumulating body of research indicates that activities such as exercise, active cognitive
      and social engagement, good sleep hygiene, stress reduction and proper nutrition are
      associated with the maintenance of cognitive health. Emerging data also suggests that healthy
      lifestyle behaviors may promote brain plasticity. Despite nationwide efforts to raise public
      awareness about brain health, there remains a gap concerning how to best promote behavioral
      change and help at-risk middle-aged and older adults adopt effective, evidence-based brain
      health behaviors into their everyday lives to maximize cognitive health. The objective of
      this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 7-week group brain fitness intervention (B-Fit)
      for increasing preventative brain health behaviors and enhancing cognitive health in
      participants at-risk for cognitive impairment. We will also examine mechanisms of action of
      the B-Fit intervention through tracking of behavioral responses in the real-world environment
      using wearable sensors.

      Participants will be middle-aged and older adults. Participants will be randomized to one of
      three conditions (B-fit, education only, wait-list). Outcome measures will be administered at
      baseline, post-treatment and at a one-year follow-up. Participants will also be asked to wear
      an actigraph for 7 days at baseline, post intervention and follow-up. One or two clinicians
      will lead the intervention groups, which will each have 8-12 group members. Both the B-Fit
      and education control conditions will meet 2 hours per week for 7 weeks. Participants in both
      conditions will receive identical educational materials provided in the form of weekly
      learning packets and presented to the group by the study clinician(s). At the first meeting,
      group members will be presented with an overview of the brain, cognitive aging, mild
      cognitive impairment, and dementia. Each subsequent group meeting will cover a specific
      topic. The topics will be presented to all groups in the following order: cognitive
      engagement, exercise and cardiovascular risk factors, nutrition, social engagement, sleep and
      stress reduction, and compensatory strategy use. The control condition will include
      presentation of the educational materials followed by expanded discussion about the materials
      among group members. In contrast, each meeting of the B-Fit intervention will follow a highly
      structured format. The format is designed to aid participants in identifying and setting
      realistic and valuable individualized brain health goals and in obtaining group support
      through problem-solving, modeling and encouragement.

    <description>(Subjective Measure) Healthy Aging Activity Engagement Scale (HAAE): participants use a 5-point Likert scale to rate level of agreement with engagement in healthy brain behaviors during the past week from strongly disagree (0) to strongly agree (5). Scores range from 32 to 160, with higher scores representing greater engagement in positive health behaviors.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in activities captured by actigraphs and measured using a behavior change detection approach at baseline compared to post-test (appr. 2 months) and follow-up (appr. one-year).</time_frame>
    <description>(Objective Measure) Participants will wear an Actigraph for 1 week to capture objective data in the form of activity times, activity durations, mobility, activity level and sleep/time quality. We will apply the behavior change detection approach (BCD) to detect the magnitude of health-related changes in behavior patterns and to describe the nature of the changes (e.g., increased afternoon activity).</description>
