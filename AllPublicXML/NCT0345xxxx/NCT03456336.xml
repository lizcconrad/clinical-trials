      Estimate the risks and benefits of active treatment versus expectant management of a
      symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (sPDA) in premature infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic randomized multicenter, effectiveness study comparing active treatment of
      a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (sPDA) to expectant management. We hypothesize in
      premature infants with a sPDA, expectant management reduces the incidence proportion of death
      or BPD by 10% (from 50% to 40%) when compared to active treatment.

      Participants with a sPDA allocated to the active treatment arm will receive intravenous
      administration of indomethacin or ibuprofen (depending on center preference). The decision to
      ligate will be left to the clinical team. Participants with a sPDA allocated to the expectant
      management arm will receive supportive care at the clinical team's discretion and will
      receive indomethacin/ibuprofen or ligation if the infant develops cardiopulmonary compromise.
      The decision to ligate will be left to the clinical team.

      The primary endpoint for the study will be death or BPD (as assessed by the physiologic
      definition) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA).
