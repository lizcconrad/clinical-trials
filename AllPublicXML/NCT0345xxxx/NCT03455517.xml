  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young
      patients with Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia (CLL). However, patients with a mutation known as
      IGVH unmutated and patients with a particular characteristic known as 'disrupted TP53' show
      an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of survival. Venetoclax as a single agent or combined
      with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory patients with IGVH unmutated
      CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of clinical responses.

      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) is the gold treatment for fit and young
      (age ≤65 years) patients with CLL. However, IGVH unmutated patients and patients with
      disrupted TP53 show an inferior outcome after FCR in terms of PFS and OS. Venetoclax as a
      single agent or combined with rituximab is an effective treatment for relapsed/refractory
      patients with IGVH unmutated CLL and/or del(17p) and is associated with a high rate of
      clinical responses and MRD-negative responses. The achievement of a MRD negative response in
      CLL is the best treatment endpoint since it is associated with an improved PFS.

      In treatment-naive patients with unmutated IGVH and/or disrupted TP53 the venetoclax and
      rituximab combination could be a more effective regimen than FCR with a 15% increase in the
      CR rate.

Step 2. All patients will receive 6 courses of the VR combination.
Step 3. After 6 courses of VR combination:
3a. Patients with no response will be off treatment; 3b. Patients with clinical response (CR or PR) after 6 courses of VR combination will receive venetoclax as a single agent for 6 months. Then, patients will be observed clinically until disease progression or until month 36.</description>
