  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PU) represent a major health issue because of their high incidence and of
      their important consequences. There is an important risk of pressure ulcer acquisition for
      ICU patient with acute organ failure.

      Specific risk factors identified in ICU are immobility, which accentuates the effects of
      friction and shears, as well as mechanical ventilation and the use of vasopressors.

      A repositioning schedule is a guideline for pressure ulcer prevention, but repositioning
      frequency remains unknown.

      Adaptation of the repositioning schedule to pressure ulcer risk assessment using Braden scale
      should decrease emergence of pressure ulcer. This could limit their important consequences
      for ICU patients which add to their brittle clinical condition (infection, increased length
      of stay, mortality…).

  <detailed_description>

      This study will assess feasibility, efficacy and tolerance of a repositioning schedule
      applied to ICU adult patients. The repositioning schedule will be daily adapted to pressure
      ulcer risk of the patient assessed with Braden scale.

      If results of this pilot study show improvement by the application of the repositioning
      schedule, they will argue the realization of a multicenter randomized clinical trial. This
      larger study will assess the expected decrease of pressure ulcers incidence due to the
      schedule and of its benefit-risk ratio.

      This is a one-center prospective pilot study which includes two one-month consequential
      periods:

        -  During the first period, care will be delivered according usual practice. It is an
           observational phase.

        -  The second period will begin with medical and nurse staff training. Then, care will be
           delivered according the repositioning schedule. It's an interventional phase.

      The procedure will be prescribed every day on patient's prescription by the doctor in charge
      (that will be filed with medical record).

      - During the two periods: Every morning, inclusion and non-inclusion criteria will be sought
      for every patient intubated for at least 24 hours. This evaluation will be made by a nurse
      during daily medical staff meeting.

      Eligible patients will be informed. Their consent will be collected and they will be included
      in the study. Patient characteristics (age, gender, BMI, simplified acute physiology score
      SAPS II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score, length of mechanical ventilation,
      length of stay and mortality in ICU) will be taken from the PMSI. Those data are usually
      daily collected.

      During the second period: data about Braden scale, positioning schedule, different positions
      applied, possible adverse events during positioning and presence of pressure ulcer will be
      collected by caregivers and nurses caring the patient.

      Those data will be collected on the &quot;daily positioning sheet&quot; made available in patient's
      room. Skin condition will be evaluated on the 28th day, or when leaving ICU wall, or at death
      if it occurs before. Clinical research technician will control concordance between
      repositioning data and position applied by caregivers and nurses and those recommended by the
      schedule.

    <description>To assess the clinical safety of the positioning schedule : the clinical safety will be assessed by the percentage of adverse events occurrence during when positioning the patients.
Adverse events are defined as accidental removal of invasive devices (breathing tube, catheter, chest tube, gastric tube, urinary catheter) and an instability (hemodynamic or respiratory) requiring positioning discontinuation. Caregivers monitor vital parameters during positioning and discontinue the positioning if hemodynamic or respiratory instability occurs, according to nurse's clinical evaluation. Adverse events will be notified on the &quot;daily positioning sheet&quot; and on the &quot;positioning sheet stay&quot; by caregivers charge positioning the patient.</description>

    <description>Applying repositioning schedule daily adapted to pressure ulcer risk assessed with Braden scale. Then, the nurse will applied oil for PU prevention and repositioning which frequency will be defined by the Braden score. The positions will be the semi-fowler 30-30, the half-sitting position with a 45° angle position and patient lying on their back with the head up with a 30° angle for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention.
Repositioning schedule will be applied according to the daily medical prescription. When physician allows to sit the patient on a chair, this have to be done by raising feet on a stool. Therefore, patients will stay in that chair as long as defined by positioning schedule. When patient is returned to bed, same positions as described above will be used alternately. In the time of positioning care, oil usually used for PU prevention will be applied on the skin of the areas of high risk of PU (heels, sacrum, elbows, trochanter, knees) and bone projections.</description>
