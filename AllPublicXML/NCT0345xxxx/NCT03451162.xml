  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This first-in-human, Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study will evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, and PK of DHES0815A as a single agent in participants with advanced
      and/or metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer for whom established treatment has proven
      ineffective or intolerable or is unavailable. The study may include a dose-expansion cohort
      (based on an ongoing assessment of the totality of data obtained in this study) to further
      assess safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary anti-tumor activity.
