  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to characterize the effect of Prolia® (denosumab, AMG 162; Human
      Monoclonal Antibody to RANK, Ligand) on indices of bone strength in type 2 diabetes (T2D).
      The investigational plan involves administration of Prolia® or identical placebo for 12
      months as a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 66 T2D postmenopausal women
      assigned to Prolia® or placebo. The study will include assessment of different measures of
      bone quality: skeletal microarchitecture, including measurement of skeletal cortical pores;
      bone mineral density; bone material quality, and accumulation of advanced glycation
      endproducts (AGEs) in collagen. This information will help to determine whether Prolia®
      treatment in type 2 diabetes has skeletal benefits.

      Objective #1: To determine whether Prolia® treatment in T2D decreases skeletal cortical
      porosity over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

      Prolia® has particular appeal for T2D because in postmenopausal osteoporosis it reduces
      cortical porosity at the proximal femoral shaft and at the distal radius, thus potentially
      reversing a proposed mechanism for increased diabetic fractures. Columbia University's
      ownership of high resolution, second-generation QCT technology, HR-pQCT XCT2, with an
      isotropic resolution of 61 µm makes such evaluations possible. HR-pQCT will be performed with
      the XtremeCT2 (Scanco Medical, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at baseline, 6 months and 12-month
      visits. This high speed in vivo CT scanner uses a microfocus x-ray source (60 µm spot size,
      68 kVp, 100 W). The scans will be analyzed for volumetric BMD and bone microarchitecture,
      including cortical porosity (Ct.Po). It is expected that reductions in cortical porosity with
      Prolia® treatment in T2D will be detectable.

      Objective #2: To determine whether Prolia® treatment in T2D decreases bone resorption over 12
      months to a greater extent than placebo.

      In postmenopausal women without T2D, Prolia® decreases bone resorption, yet it is unknown if
      this effect occurs in T2D. Blood will be collected at baseline, and 3, 6 and 12 months to
      measure the collagen degradation product s-CTX (serum C-telopeptide) as a marker of bone
      resorption, as well as serum TRAP-5b, an enzyme derived from resorbing osteoclasts. It is
      expected that reductions in s-CTX and TRAP-5b with Prolia® treatment in T2D will be
      detectable.

      Objective #3: To determine whether Prolia® treatment in T2D increases areal bone mineral
      density (aBMD) by DXA over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

      In postmenopausal women without T2D, Prolia® increases aBMD, yet it is unknown if this effect
      occurs in T2D. aBMD by DXA will be measured at baseline, 6 and 12-month visits. DXA will be
      performed at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip and radius on a Hologic QDR4500. It is
      expected that increases in aBMD with Prolia® treatment in T2D will be detectable.

      Objective #4: To determine whether Prolia® treatment in T2D increases bone material strength
      over 12 months to a greater extent than placebo.

      Recent evidence suggests that fracture risk is increased in T2D because of abnormal bone
      material properties. Impact microindentation (IMI) of the cortex is a research tool that
      estimates bone material strength in humans. At baseline and at 12 months, following local
      anesthesia, IMI will be done with the OsteoProbe® to create microindents over the shaft of
      the tibia and provide a measure of bone material strength (bone material strength index
      [BMSi]). The BMSi measurement reflects the ability of bone to resist microcrack generation.
      It is expected that increases in BMSi with Prolia® treatment in T2D will be detectable.

      Objective #5: To determine whether Prolia® treatment in T2D reduces AGEs in collagen over 12
      months to a greater extent than placebo.

      Decreases in bone material strength in T2D might be due to the accumulation of AGEs in
      collagen. Because skin AGEs are similar to bone AGEs, skin autofluorescence (SAF) can be a
      reflection of bone AGEs. At baseline, 6 and 12 months, SAF is measured with the AGE Reader
      (DiagnOptics Technologies BV), a device that uses the characteristic fluorescent properties
      of certain AGEs to estimate the AGE levels in the skin. It is expected that decreases in SAF
      with Prolia® treatment in T2D will be detectable.
