    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective, single-arm study, aimed to observe the safety and
      effectiveness of ImageReady™ MR conditional defibrillation system in a Chinese population.It
      will enroll 20 subjects in 5 sites in China.The primary safety endpoint is MR scan-related
      Complication-free rate between the MR Scan and the MRI + 1 Month Visit. The primary
      effectiveness endpoints include:1.Abnormal increase in RV shocking impedance from the pre-MR
      scan to the 1 Month post-MR scan. 2.Increase in RV pacing threshold from the pre-MR scan to
      the 1 Month post-MR scan. 3.Decrease in RV sensed amplitude from the pre-MR scan to the 1
      Month post-MR scan. 4.Increase in LV pacing threshold from the pre-MR scan to the 1 Month
      post-MR scan. 5.Decrease in LV sensed amplitude from the pre-MR scan to the 1 Month post- MR
      scan.
