  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first prospective study on digestive affections in an homogeneous cohort of
      hematological patients. These affections are unknown in neutropenic patients with digestive
      symptoms after induction or consolidation courses pour AML although causing high
      morbi-mortality rates (infections, denutrition, loss of autonomyâ€¦).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate incidence of NE by clinical signs and with a systematic
      CT scan performed at day 5 of fever during aplastic period. An early diagnostic could
      decrease complications and evaluate gravity criteria which could imply surgery therapy.

      The physician will performe a CTscan with injection during the induction and/or every
      consolidation, at the same time as the thoracic CTscan (to research an invasive fungal
      bronchopulmonary infection), in front of a febrile neutropenia with persistent fever after 5
      days of antibiotics and presence of digestive signs.

      The clinical, microbiological, radiological symptoms will be registered at every time of
      febrile neutropenia with digestive symptoms at induction and each consolidation courses. The
      patient will be get out of the study when the AML is refractory, hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation is required or if whenever he want. The last visit will be at the end of
      consolidation courses.

    <description>The main assessment criteria is the arisen of EC in the CT scan with injection realized at day 5 of fever under antibiotics for every inclusive patient, with febrile neutropenia, and presenting digestive symptoms during the period of aplasie post-chemotherapy after exclusion from the other diagnosis (infectious colitis and other abdominal syndromes).</description>

    <description>Systematic realization during the induction and/or every consolidation of a CTscan with injection, at the same time as the thoracic CTscan (to research an invasive fungal bronchopulmonary infection), in front of a febrile neutropenia with persistent fever after 5 days of antibiotics and presence of digestive signs.
Statement of the information characterizing the digestive affection: clinical symptoms, microbiological, characteristic, realized additional explorations, infectious complications and specific therapeutics.
The abdominal scanner will be repeated in case of suspicion of complication or clinical worsening. In case of EC, the abdominal scanner will be realized before beginning the next cycle of AML treatment to evaluate digestive remission. Finally, a CT scan, will be performed when digestive disease, digestive neoplasia or digestive symptoms are noted at AML diagnosis.</description>
