      The long term objective is to develop a gel to be used as a male contraceptive.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, phase IIb, open label, single arm, multicenter study. The study
      protocol consists of a screening phase lasting 4 to 8 weeks, a suppression phase estimated up
      to 20 weeks, a 52-week maintenance/efficacy phase, and a 24-week (estimated) recovery phase.

      The study will involve approximately 420 couples recruited throughout the CCTN that meet
      eligibility criteria. The nine sites propose to enroll up to 420 couples (about 30 to 60
      couples per site) with a goal of obtaining 200 couples completing the contraceptive efficacy
      phase of the study. The study has four phases (screening phase, suppression phase, efficacy
      phase and recovery phase) with monthly visits to provide the male participants with the
      NES-8/T-62 gel, to encourage adherence, to monitor for possible side effects, and to quantify
      semen parameters. The female will be contacted monthly and come in for a visit every three
      months.

    <description>The combined gel is a transdermal treatment that will be applied daily for 52 weeks to a male subject's arms and shoulders. The formulation will be a hydro alcoholic gel containing about 1.43% T (14.3 mg T/g gel). About 9 to 14% of the steroid (T or NES) in the gel applied is available to the body. The amount of gel to be applied each application will be approximately 5 mL in volume. The gel application volume will contain 62 mg of T that will deliver approximately 6 mg T to the body per day.
