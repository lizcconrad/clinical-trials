      The aim of modern anaesthetic practice is to insure the rapid recovery of patients with fewer
      complications and earlier hospital discharge.

      Thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA) has been established as a cornerstone in the perioperative
      care after thoracic and major abdominal surgery providing most effective analgesia. beyond
      its analgesic properties, TEA's effects on the postoperative neurohumoural stress response,
      cardiovascular Pathophysiology, and intestinal dysfunction have been in the focus of both
      clinical and experimental investigations for years.

    <description>intra and post operative TEA infusion of (bupivacaine +fentanyl 2 mic/ ml+ dexmedetomidine 0.5 mic/ ml) Under strict aseptic precautions thoracic epidural was performed using a 16 gauge,Tuhy epidural needle by a paramedian approach. T8-T9 inter space was chosen for the injection. Skin at insertion site was anesthetized by 3 ml of lidocaine 1%, the epidural space was identified by the loss of resistance technique, the catheter was introduced approximately 2-4 cm into the epidural space, epidural test dose consisted of 3 ml of lidocaine 2 % with 1: 200,000 adrenaline.</description>
