  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a recent study, investigators provided the first neuroscientific data on social
      facilitation. This neuroimaging study, performed in the macaque monkey, shows a marked
      improvement in performance in a simple task when a congener is present compared to when the
      animal performs the task alone. This social facilitation is accompanied by a significant
      increase in brain activity within the fronto-parietal network of attention. No variation in
      activity, however, is observed in the cerebral network of motivation. These results argue in
      favor of the implication of attentional processes in the phenomenon of social facilitation.
      The challenge now is to determine whether social facilitation is always based on the
      attention network (whatever the task) or, alternatively, whether it increases activity in any
      cerebral circuit involved depending on the task performed and the population studied. This
      hypothesis, which the investigators have named the &quot;multi-mediator model of social
      facilitation&quot;, has the advantage of reconciling the attentional and motivational theories of
      social facilitation, which are not mutually exclusive. This hypothesis also provides an
      explanation for the pervasiveness (across species and different ages for humans) of social
      facilitation. The main objective of SOFEE is to gather neuroscientific evidence to support
      the multi-facilitator model of social facilitation.

      The main objective is to study the effect of the presence of others on cognitive performance
      and its evolution during development by behavioral and neural measures. The secondary
      objective is to identify factors (psychological characteristics such as personality traits)
      explaining individual, behavioral and neural differences, sensitivity to the presence of
      others.

    <description>Part 1: to determine the cognitive capacity, the subjects undergo different neuropsychological tests To determine individual characteristics children, adolescents and adults complete self-assessment questionnaires .
Adults spend a semi-directive interview. Part 2: while the subject 1 (S1) is installed in the MRI, he perform behavioral tasks with the subject 2 (S2) (familiar peer of the same age ± 2 years) installed in an adjacent room, alternating periods when S1 is observed by S2 (condition &quot;Social&quot;) and periods when S1 is not observed by S2 (condition &quot;Alone&quot;).</description>
