      Performance Assessment of the PMD-200, a Novel Pain Monitor, in Subjects at Neurointensive

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is design to further demonstrates the performance of the Nociception Level
      (NoL) Index in neurological impaired anesthetized patients under general anesthesia, by
      evaluating its response to controlled changes in the levels of noxious stimuli/analgesia, and
      to correlate the NoL response to the EEG derived pain score. Validating the performance of
      the NoL Index may provide a tool to monitor the pain/nociception in this population.

      In this study, the PI plan to demonstrate that the NoL Index is a continuous index. It is
      anticipated that a higher level of nociception will correspond to a higher NoL index. On the
      other hand, it is anticipated that higher levels of analgesic agent for the same noxious
      stimulus will lead to a lower NoL index.

      The participants will be monitored as in a typical ICU and according to the local guidelines
      by various types of monitoring devices, such as: vital signs, pulse oximeter, Bispectral
      Index (BIS), Electroencephalography (EEG) etc.

    <description>Subjects under anesthesia that are expected to stay for at least 24 hours in the ICU/NICU will be monitored by the PMD-200 device. An EEG monitor device will be connected to the patient and display the Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF) signals and values on the subject monitor.</description>

    <description>the patients will be monitored by PMD-200. The technology consists of measurements of a number of nociception-related physiological parameters that corresponds with the autonomic nervous system's response to noxious stimuli, and using the company's proprietary algorithms, 'translating' these measurements into an index that represents the nociceptive response, the NoLâ„¢ (Nociception Level) Index. The NoL index is a relative index from 0 to 100, while 0 is &quot;no pain/nociception&quot; and 100 is &quot;extreme pain/nociception&quot;.</description>
