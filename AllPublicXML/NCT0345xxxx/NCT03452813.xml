    <textblock>
      The TCSD Study will identify disparities in transitions of stroke care and key factors
      associated with effective transitions of care through structured telephone interviews to
      evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions
      and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home in 2,400 participants across 6
      comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) in Florida. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance
      Index (TOSC PI) correlated with 90-day rehospitalization will be derived and validated.

      The TCSD Study will identify disparities in transitions of stroke care and key factors
      associated with effective transitions of care through structured telephone interviews to
      evaluate medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, utilization of rehabilitation interventions
      and medical follow-up 30 days after hospital discharge to home in 2,400 participants across 6
      comprehensive stroke centers (CSC) in Florida. A novel Transitions of Stroke Care Performance
      Index (TOSC PI) will be derived and validated. The primary outcomes are the TOSC PI and
      90-day readmission. Other stroke outcomes include stroke disability, recurrence,
      cardiovascular events, and death at 3 months. Outcomes will be collected through telephone
      interviews and review of patient charts. Predictors of disparities in transition of care and
      outcomes will be evaluated using baseline in-hospital data during acute stroke
      hospitalization obtained from the Florida Stroke Registry and Social Determinants of Health
      obtained through novel data collected from publicly available records. Based on identified
      predictors of disparities in TOSC, we will develop and demonstrate feasibility of initiatives
      for interventions to reduce disparities in TOSC that target systems of care with a TOSC
      disparities dashboard, and health care providers with a training module for enhanced
      education and support at discharge and during follow-up. We will evaluate any temporal
      improvements in the TOSC Performance Index and outcomes before and after the interventions.

    <description>Transitions of Stroke Care Performance Index (TOSC-PI) is a novel score that will be developed based on the results of this study to predict effective transitions of care, and will be composite score that includes medication and lifestyle adherence, diet, tobacco and alcohol cessation, exercise, utilization of rehabilitation services, and medical follow-up after discharge. The index will be calculated as the points achieved over the total for which the participant is eligible. High scores indicate successful transition of care, while low scores reflect inadequacies and gaps in transitions of care.</description>

        The TCSD-S participating study sites (SS) include 6 Comprehensive Stroke Centers (CSC) that
        currently participate in the Florida Stroke Registry will be Study. The SS will identify
        and consent participants and collect TOSC performance metrics and outcomes. A total of
        2,400 ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage participants from 6 Florida CSC that are
        discharged directly to home will be enrolled in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage patients age &gt;/=18 years that are
             discharged directly to home with a modified Rankin Scale &gt;/= 1.

        Final diagnosis of ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, included in the Get With
        The Guidelines- Stroke (GWTG-S) database.

        Patient or legally authorized representative provides consent Available by phone and
        willing to receive two follow-up calls.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cases with subarachnoid hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke not
             otherwise specified, no stroke related diagnosis, and admission for elective carotid
             intervention will be excluded.

        Prisoners will be excluded. The purpose of the project is to study the hospital-to-home
        transition of stroke care.

        Discharged to inpatient rehabilitation, nursing home, subacute rehabilitation facilities or
        assisted living facilities. These facilities support medication adherence, provide
        prescribed diets, often provide in-house medical follow-up, and therefore disparities in
        TOSC are less likely to be detected and not amenable to the proposed interventions.

        Modified Rankin Scale of 0 after stroke. These individuals usually do not require any
        rehabilitation interventions and to avid the inclusion of predominately mild stroke
        patients.

        Unable to obtain consent from patient or legally authorized representative. Unavailable or
        unwilling to participate in the 30 and 90 day follow up telephone calls.
