  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DETECT'CHUTE CLINIBED is a smart carpet equipped with several sensors. Positioned at the foot
      of the bed, this system allows detecting i) patient fall out of the bed and ii) when patient
      is not back to bed after a certain time. When one of these two events is detected, the system
      then sends a short message syteme (SMS) and/or an email to the medical staff. The aim of this
      clinical study is to test the system ability to detect and transmit alarms for both those
      events.

      In this clinical trial, the investigators will therefore test the alarms positive and
      negative predictive values for both the events.

    <description>The DETECT'CHUTE carpets will be positioned at night at the foot of the bed and set in motion by the nursing staff as soon as the elderly person goes to bed for the night. They will be withdrawn the next morning after the resident's rise. Each patient will benefit from the mat for 1 month.</description>
