    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess subjects' perceptions of environmental conditions and
      their preferences, and to expose subjects to varied environmental conditions as well as to
      assess their perception and feedback to these conditions. Another aim of this study is to
      explore potential patterns, factors of influence, and factors of reference in relation to the
      objectively assessed quality of the imagining examination and/or the perception of the
      patient. Finally, another aim of this study is to explore the feasibility of innovative
      biofeedback response capturing methodologies and technologies to guide the design of specific
      clinical investigations or trials.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremendous technological advances have occurred in recent years that enable easily controlled
      lights, sound, temperature, airflow as well as sensatory experiences such as smell or
      vibrations. While in some fields, these technologies are readily used, their potential
      application within healthcare environments has not yet been studied. In this study, we want
      to investigate how environmental factors including light, sound, temperature, smell, and
      sensatory experiences such as vibration are being perceived by subjects to develop
      environmental strategies using those components to create a more relaxing, and comforting
      experience for patients prior, during and after an imaging examination and for staff working
      in such environments. This data that will also guide to encourage changes of patient staff
      facility interactions to further improve the healthcare experience and quality of imaging
      examinations. To get a complete set of data, we plan to include volunteer participants,
      patients scheduled for imaging examinations, and staff working in the healthcare environment.
      This study has up to three different components: A, filling out survey forms to learn more
      about the perception of experience factors B, participating in facility experiences that may
      expose subjects to different facility factors and will then assess responses using additional
      survey forms or electronic measurement and data capture devices and C, during an imaging
      study the environment experience may be altered and assessments will be done to determine how
      relaxed the subject remains during the imagining study and the degree of motion induced
      artifacts. Feedback data will be obtained through survey tools as well as available consumer
      grade wearable devices that can continuously capture physiological parameters such as heart
      rate, motion, body perspiration and muscle tension. Only participants in the patient, staff,
      or volunteer populations who are not receiving an MRI imaging examination will participate in
      utilizing the wearable devices, as the wearable devices are not compatible with the MRI
      system. Patients receiving a PET/CT examination will be able to utilize a wearable device.
      For patients scheduled for an imaging examination the findings and perception of
      environmental factors will be compared with the image quality of the imaging examination and
      the feedback responses.

    <measure>Feasibility of the use of voice activation within the imaging environment</measure>
    <time_frame>We will be observing the feasibility of voice activation through study completion, on average 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>We are observing how practical and beneficial it is to use voice activation technologies such as Amazon Echo, Google home or similar devices within the imaging environment. For instance, we will observe how user-friendly, time-consuming, etc. the use of voice activation technology is within an imaging setting for assessing participant preferences.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Temperature</measure>
    <time_frame>Temperature of the environment and of each participant may be monitored from the time the participant begins the environmental experience until the participant completes study procedures, up to roughly 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>We will use infrared detector camera technology to assess the skin temperature of subjects at different body regions and changes during the observational period. This will also be used to determine the temperature of the surroundings as well, for example, to determine the relative temperature of the chair and the imaging bed. Infrared cameras installed alongside the normal surveillance cameras to monitor patients during the imaging examination may also be used to monitor the temperature of the surroundings as well as the body to determine if that may be the reason for motion.</description>

    <measure>Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Motion of each participant may be monitored from the time the participant begins the environmental experience until the participant completes study procedures, up to roughly 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>We will use short wave radar to perform positional monitoring of subjects during the observational period. This short-wave radar will be used as a means to assess motion and detect subject movement in a room that we hope to correlate to their level of comfort and relaxation. Short wave radar is also technically able to detect very miniscule motion including blood flow and pulse rate, which would allow us to move away from wearable devices to remote sensing devices further hoping to increase patient comfort. No short wave radar devices will be used during the imaging examination.</description>

    <measure>Quality of imaging study</measure>
    <time_frame>Image quality will be assessed after SOC images are collected from patient participants through study completion, on average 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient participants who have given authorization for a blinded review of their imaging study will have their imaging study reviewed on a radiological image review workstation and assessed by an experienced reader of imaging studies in regard to the presence and severity of artifacts. Those findings will be recorded both in a structured and free text form using a survey tool. We anticipate that in this exploratory study observations will be made that will lead to the need to further detail and/or refine structured recording of the findings.</description>
