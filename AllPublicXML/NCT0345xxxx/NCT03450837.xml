  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).
      The illicit use of these substances also leads to a remarkable decrease in high-density
      lipoprotein (HDL) plasma concentration, which could be a key factor in the atherosclerotic
      process. The investigators tested the functionality of HDL by cholesterol efflux and
      antioxidant capacity and its association with CAD in young men.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty strength-trained AAS users (AASU) age 29±5 yr, 20 age-matched strength-trained AAS
      nonusers (AASNU), and 10 sedentary controls (SC) were enrolled.

      HDL concentration and functionality by measuring the 14C-cholesterol efflux mediated by HDL
      and the ability of HDL in inhibiting LDL oxidation were evaluated.

      Coronary artery was evaluated with coronary computed tomography angiography.

    <intervention_name>Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography</intervention_name>
    <description>To assess coronary artery plaque and calcification, all participants underwent coronary computed tomography angiography according to the guidelines of the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT). All CT scans were acquired in a 320-row detector scanner (AquillionOneTM - Toshiba Medical Systems Corporation, Otawara, Japan) with 0.5-mm thick slices. Acquisition protocol included coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) and coronary CTA. CACS protocol utilized a 370-ms tube rotation, 120-kV tube voltage, 300-mA tube current, and 320x0.5-mm collimation with 3-mm slice thickness reconstructed images, one heart beat acquisition during diastole.</description>

    <description>Macrophages were incubated with DMEM (Low Glucose, Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) containing 1 mg fatty acid free albumin (FAFA) (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) plus 50 μg acetylated LDL/mL and 0.3 μCi 14C-cholesterol/mL (Amersham Biosciences, UK) for 48h. After washing with PBS/FAFA, cells were incubated in the presence or absence of HDL (50 µg/mL) for 8h. The amount of radioactivity present in the medium at the end of the HDL incubation period will indicate albumin-mediated cholesterol efflux with albumin alone and total efflux with albumin + HDL. Thus, specific HDL-mediated efflux will be calculated, subtracting the albumin-mediated efflux from total efflux</description>
