  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) of an extended
      artemether-lumefantrine (AL) dosing regimen in HIV-infected children on efavirenz (EFV)-based
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) that is designed to improve the PK exposure and treatment
      efficacy of this artemisinins-based combination therapy (ACT) regimen. Our overarching goal
      is to inform the best treatment guidelines for young children in Africa. HIV-infected and
      HIV-uninfected children will be enrolled for intensive PK studies, as well as additional
      children for population PK studies to enhance association analyses with clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective multi-site study to evaluate the PK/PD of extended duration AL in
      HIV-infected children on EFV-based ART and HIV-uninfected children not on ART. AL is the
      first-line treatment for malaria in Uganda. No change in standard of care treatment will be
      made for the purposes of this study except for the extension of AL to 5-day dosing. This
      study will enroll a) HIV-infected children, and b) HIV-uninfected children. All participants
      may be enrolled through Tororo District Hospital (TDH) or Masafu General Hospital (MGH) in
      Busia, or other referral centers the area. we will use a sequential design where children
      will be randomized to either 3-day or 5-day AL and then can be crossed-over to the alternate
      AL regimen for subsequent episodes of malaria, should they occur. Conservatively, assuming
      each enrolled child participates for only a single episode of malaria, up to 60 (30
      HIV-infected on 3-day and 30 HIV-infected on 5-day) and 100 (50 HIV-uninfected on 3-day and
      50 HIV-uninfected on 5-day) subjects will be enrolled for each of the intensive study groups.
      Up to 100 (50 HIV-infected on 3-day and 50 HIV-infected on 5-day) and 120 (60 HIV-uninfected
      on 3-day and 60 HIV-uninfected on 5-day) subjects will be enrolled for each of the population
      study groups. Comparisons of AL PK exposure will be made among and between a) HIV-infected
      children with malaria receiving EFV-based ART and b) HIV-uninfected children who are not on
      ART. Comparisons will be based on an intensive PK design for AL area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) estimations. Population PK study will be combined with
      intensive PK studies to allow for optimal PK-outcomes assessments.
