      The aim of the study is to investigate the factors influencing hemoglobin variability with
      inflammatory and nutritional parameters and its associations with all-cause mortality among
      hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluctuation in hemoglobin levels that is known as hemoglobin variability during treatment
      with ESA is a well-documented phenomenon. Several factors have been found to affect
      hemoglobin variability, including drug related, such as pharmacokinetic parameters,
      patient-related differences in demographic characteristics and factors affecting clinical
      status, as well as clinical practice guidelines, treatment protocols and reimbursement
      policies. Inflammation is also an important factor associated with hemoglobin variability,
      and the consequences of persistent inflammatory activity are far-reaching in affected
      patients.

      In present study, the factors influencing hemoglobin variability with inflammatory and
      nutritional parameters and its associations with all-cause mortality among hemodialysis
      patients are investigated.

          -  on chronic hemodialysis treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients had a minimum of six hemoglobin measurements within a 6- month period,
             and they were excluded if they received a kidney transplant during this period or
             those who had blood transfusions during the baseline period.

          -  Patients with serum ferritin&lt;100 Î¼g/L were also excluded from the study because of
             reimbursement of our country.
