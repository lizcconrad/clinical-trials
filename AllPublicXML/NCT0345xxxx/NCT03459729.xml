      A Window of Opportunity Clinical Trial. This study design permits examination of effects of
      an oral agent on cancer patients during the &quot;window&quot; between diagnosis of their cancer and
      their definitive cancer surgery. Similar to a phase 0 study, the trial design permits
      examination of the biologic effects of an agent; in this study pharmacokinetic properties
      will be examined.

      RATIONALE: Establishing the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile for Antitumor B Key Active
      Component (ATB-KAC-α) is a critical initial step before future clinical trials can be
      performed that examine anti-cancer and cancer preventive effects of ATB-KAC-α.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To examine the pharmacokinetic properties of ATB-KAC-α.
