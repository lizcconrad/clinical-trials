  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to establish that a memory retraining protocol, originally
      developed for English-speakers, and translated into Spanish, is effective.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study will be conducted to carry out this validation and resolve any methodological
      concerns in the translated protocol. 20 Spanish-speaking Hispanics at least one year
      post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) and 20 Spanish-speaking Hispanics with multiple sclerosis
      (MS), both with an objective deficit in learning and memory will be recruited. Baseline
      assessment includes neuropsychological evaluation using traditional measures as well as
      completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday memory and everyday
      functioning. Subjects are randomly assigned to either the experimental or control groups.
      Experimental and control treatments includes two 45-60 minute sessions, twice per week, for 5
      weeks. Follow-up assessment includes a neuropsychological evaluation using traditional
      measures as well as completion of a number of questionnaires designed to measure everyday
      memory and everyday functioning. Protocol efficacy will be determined by improvements between
      baseline and follow-up on an objective measure of learning and memory.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  between the ages of 18 and 65

          -  Spanish is my dominant language, and I have had a traumatic brain injury or I have
             multiple sclerosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder I or II

          -  MS subjects: Individuals with a history of head injury, stroke, seizures, or any other
             significant neurological history will not be included in the study.

          -  TBI subjects: Individuals must have sustained a TBI at least one year prior to
             enrollment in the study protocol. Individuals with a history of significant
             neurological insult other than TBI (e.g. premorbid epilepsy, multiple sclerosis,
             Alzheimer's disease) will not be included in the study.
