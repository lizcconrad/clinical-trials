    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, controlled study, with the primary objective to demonstrate
      non-inferiority of Hemopatch compared to TachoSil in postoperative air leak duration after
      pulmonary resection, and with the secondary objective of evaluating the safety of Hemopatch
      compared to TachoSil.

          -  Patients undergoing emergency surgery

          -  Patients on chronic use of steroids

          -  Female patients of childbearing potential with a positive pregnancy test or intent to
             become pregnant during the clinical study period

          -  Female patients who are nursing

          -  Patients with exposure to another investigational drug or device clinical trial within
             30 days prior to enrollment or anticipated in the 30 day study period till the End of
             study visit.

          -  Patient has a clinically significant concurrent medical condition (e.g. concomitant
             illness, drug/alcohol abuse) that, in the opinion of the investigator, could adversely
             affect patient's safety and/or compliance with study procedures

          -  Patient is a family member or employee of the investigator

        Intraoperative-

          -  Patients with serious complications during surgery, including the need for
             adhesiolysis, and pneumonectomy.

          -  Patients who were treated with any surgical sealant

          -  Major intraoperative complications that require resuscitation or deviation from the
             planned surgical procedure

          -  Patients with any other intraoperative findings identified by the surgeon that may
             preclude the conduct of the study procedure
