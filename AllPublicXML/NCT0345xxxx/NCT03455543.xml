      Part A of this trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial. Part A will evaluate PEMF treatment compared to sham treatment in
      patients with painful diabetic distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) when treatment
      is administered 30 minutes twice daily through a 120-day period (4 months). Part B is a
      2-month open-label active treatment extension period designed to collect longer-term data on
      pain, medication use, quality of life and safety (Part B).Part B of this trial is a an
      extension period upon completion of Part A.

      Part A of this trial is a multi-center, prospective, double-blinded, sham-controlled,
      randomized clinical trial conducted on subjects with painful diabetic distal symmetric
      peripheral neuropathy. Part B of this trial is a 2-month single-arm, open-label, active
      treatment extension period upon completion of Part A.

      Eligible subjects will include those between 22 and 80 years of age with documented Type 1 or
      Type 2 diabetes having persistent pain related to diabetic neuropathy in the lower
      extremities, despite previous treatment(s). Subjects will be assessed with the Toronto
      Clinical Neuropathy Score at screening, to evaluate the severity of peripheral neuropathy for
      inclusion.

      Eligible subjects will be entered into a 14-day ePRO diary run-in period to collect average
      baseline pain scores related to their diabetic neuropathy in the lower extremities, diary
      compliance, and analgesic consumption (maintenance and prn prescribed peripheral neuropathic
      pain medication pill counts). Subjects will collect electronic patient-reported outcome
      (ePRO) data each morning around the same time during the run-in period. Only those subjects
      having a mean pain intensity in the lower extremities of ≥4 and &lt;9 on an 11-point numeric
      pain rating scale (NPRS) and a diary compliance score of ≥ 70% during the 14-day run-in
      period will be eligible.

      Subjects will return to the clinic at Baseline (Day 0) for review of eligibility, diary
      compliance, average baseline diabetic neuropathic pain score of ≥4 and &lt;9 (calculated as the
      average of the last 7 days preceding the enrollment visit), and review of stable analgesic
      pain consumption profile during the 14-day run-in period. Qualified subjects based on diary
      compliance and average pain score will be randomized 1:1 (active: sham) and will be
      instructed to self-treat twice daily (morning and evening; 8am ± 2 hours and 8pm ± 2 hours)
      for 120 days. Subjects will record electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) data following
      each morning treatment for 120 days. Subjects consenting to distal thigh and distal leg skin
      biopsies during the Screening visit will have biopsies collected and sent to the central
      laboratory for assessment. All subjects will have a baseline Skin Perfusion Pressure (SPP),
      Sural Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), and will complete
      the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAIQ), and NeuroQoL.

      Subjects will receive a telephone call at Day 7 to ensure compliance to treatment and diary
      completion, provide follow-up information on the biopsy sites (if applicable), complete a
      blinding assessment as well as be assessed for safety and concomitant medication changes.

      At Month 1 subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant
      medication changes, review device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary
      completion, and Patient Global Impression (PGI). Treatment satisfaction will also be
      assessed.

      At Month 2 subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant
      medication changes, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be supplied
      to the site) and ePRO diary completion, quality of life outcomes (WPAIQ and NeuroQoL),
      Patient Global Impression (PGI), and interim visit measurements of SPP.

      At Month 3, subjects will return to the clinic for evaluation of safety, concomitant
      medication changes, review device usage (reports will be supplied to the site) and ePRO diary
      completion, and Patient Global Impression (PGI). Treatment satisfaction will also be
      assessed.

      At Month 4 (end of Part A / start of Part B), subjects will return to the clinic for
      evaluation of safety, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be
      supplied to the site), HbA1c, concomitant medication changes, weight, quality of life
      outcomes (WPAIQ and NeuroQoL), PGI, final measurements of SPP, NCS, QST and be assessed to
      determine their Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Score. Those subjects who consented and had
      biopsies collected at the Enrollment visit, will have their end of study biopsies during this
      visit and samples sent directly to the central laboratory for assessment. Subjects will
      return the study device and complete a blinding assessment.

      Subjects that complete Part A will continue into the open-label extension period (Part B).
      All subjects will be given an open-label active device. Subjects will continue to record ePRO
      data following each morning treatment and will be reminded of the 150-day (Month 5) phone
      call.

      At Month 5, subjects will receive a telephone call to ensure compliance to treatment and
      diary completion, and to be assessed for safety and concomitant medication changes.

      At Month 6 (end of open-label treatment extension), subjects will return to the clinic for
      evaluation of safety, NCS, treatment satisfaction, review of device usage (reports will be
      supplied to the site), concomitant medication changes, quality of life outcomes (NeuroQoL),
      and will return the study device.
