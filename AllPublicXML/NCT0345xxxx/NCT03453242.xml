    <textblock>
      The study of this study is to evaluate the age influence on cortical bone strength properties
      by two methods:HR-pQCT (HighResolution-peripheral quantitativeComputedTomography) and
      ultrasound. The main objective consists in the evaluation of the age influence on cortical
      thickness at 1/3 distal radius measured by US.

      The study of this study is to evaluate the age influence on cortical bone by two methods:
      HR-pQCT and ultrasound.

      84 patients will be measured. The cohort will be:

        -  21 women less than 70

        -  21 women more than 70

        -  21 men less than 70

        -  21 men more than 70 Measurement will be performed at radius and at tibia (ultra-distal
           and distal). For all the sites one measurement will be performed by HR-pQCT to get
           reference values of thickness and BMDs. For the distal positions and additional
           measurement will be performed by an innovative ultrasound device that estimates cortical
           thickness and porosity.

      The participation to the study implies only a participation of one hour from the patient
      (30min for HR-pQCT measurements, 30 min for US).

      The main objectives consist in :

        -  evaluating the age influence on cortical thickness at 1/3 distal radius measured by US

        -  evaluating the age influence on cortical thickness at distal tibia measured by US

        -  comparing porosities values measured by US to vBMD obtained by HR-pQCT

        -  comparing cortical thickness values measured by HR-pQCT at 1/3 distal radius position to
           ultra-distal radus position and to the tibia

        -  comparing vBMD values measured by HRpQCT at 1/3 distal radius position to ultra-distal
           radius position and to the tibia
