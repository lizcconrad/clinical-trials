  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Canada the prevalence of spinal cord injury (SCI) is approximately 85,556, with incidence
      rates of traumatic and non-traumatic SCI at 1,785 and 2,286 cases per year, respectively.
      Common secondary health conditions experienced by individuals with SCI include psychological
      distress and pain. Appropriate management of these secondary conditions, through a
      multidisciplinary approach, is imperative as they have been shown to contribute to slower
      recovery, increased negative outcomes, and greater rates of rehospitalizations and health
      care utilization. However, resource limitations can restrict the ability of service providers
      to deliver these integrative biopsychosocial approaches in the community. In Canada over 37%
      of individuals with SCI expressed a need for emotional counselling; of these, only 43% felt
      that these needs were met. Transportation can also be a significant issue for persons with
      SCI, with 87% and 73% respectively expressing a need for short- and long-distance
      transportation. Guided internet delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) program offers
      an alternative approach for psychosocial service delivery in the community. The program
      provides online structured self-help modules based on the principles of cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT) in combination with guidance from a coach through weekly emails and telephone
      calls. ICBT has shown to have a greater reduction in levels of anxiety and depression post
      treatment compared to a waitlist control group, and these levels were maintained at both 3
      and 12 month follow-ups. ICBT was shown to have similar effects to face-to-face CBT. These
      studies demonstrate that guided ICBT is a safe and effective alternative to face-to-face
      interventions and it may be beneficial for under serviced populations. Hence, examination of
      its effectiveness is warranted in the SCI population which faces various psychological and
      somatic secondary issues. Participants with SCI will receive a 8 week guided ICBT program
      called the Chronic Conditions Course for persons with SCI. The program is completed over 8
      weeks with once a week guidance from a coach. The guided course consists of five lessons, &quot;Do
      It Yourself&quot; activities, and case vignettes adapted from persons with SCI. The course also
      provides guidance and resources on other essential skills for persons with SCI, including
      communicating with health care professional, managing chronic pain, and sleep hygiene.
      Psychosocial outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and at 3 months. Data on
      intervention usage and satisfaction measures will also be examined through a qualitative
      interview. Caregivers of participants will be asked to complete self-report measures and a
      qualitative interview regarding their caregiver burden.
