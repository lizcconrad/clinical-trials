  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous studies dealt with the hospital doctors' work but little is known about the work of
      ICU doctors, especially concerning the medical time spent outside the Intensive Care Unit
      (ICU) which is a significant workload that has never been evaluated to date. The main
      objective of our study was to evaluate the time spent by ICU doctors outside the unit, for
      the management of their patients during the IHT and for the care of patients in other
      departments. Secondary objectives were to describe the organization and distribution of
      medical time outside the intensive care unit.

      In this observational study, which took place during 5 years, from January 2012 to December
      2016 in the medical ICU of the &quot;Nouvel Hôpital Civil&quot; at the University Hospitals of
      Strasbourg, every day after the morning medical staff, the anonymized information were
      collected in a register.
