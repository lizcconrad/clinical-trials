  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunctions radial arterial catheter are frequent. This was a prospective, randomized
      observational study monocentric in ICU in France. Patients are randomized in 2 groups : One
      to less than 4 four centimeters to the wrist joint (Group A) and the other, to more than four
      centimeters to the wrist joint. (Group B). The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter
      dysfunction (defined by the impossibility of taking blood from the catheter and / or the
      impossibility having a reliable blood pressure curve). Investigators compared also the
      incidence of infection, satisfaction of doctors and nurses, the numbers of days with catheter
      and the cause of withdrawal.
