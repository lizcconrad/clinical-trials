    <textblock>
      Drug-eluting stent (DES) has been the primary choice for in suit coronary lesions treatment.
      In comparison to bare-metal stent (BMS), it evidently decreases the rate of restenosis.
      However, in recent years in-stent restenosis or thrombogenesis caused by acquired stent
      malapposition in the late stage or by new in-stent atherosclerotic plaques was oberved, which
      possibly was associated with chronic inflammation stimulation because of residual
      intravascular metal or polymer coating. Through being expanded around 30 to 60 seconds,
      drug-coated balloon (DCB) can ensure adequate paclitaxel enter the artery wall, which can
      inhibit smooth muscle cells hyperplasia without remaining any foreign body. In recent small
      sample trials, they showed that sole DCB treatment had a good long-term effect when
      pre-treating ideal in suit coronary lesions (defined as residual stenosis&lt; 30%, without
      dissection severer than type C, anterograde flow TIMI III). In PEPCAD I trial, the rate of
      major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was 6.1% in the first 12 months and persistent to
      3-year follow up. Small sample prospective observational study from Korea, like Shin, showed
      that in the in suit coronary lesions with the fractional flow reserve (FFR)&gt;0.85 after
      percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the FFR kept unchanged in the 9-month
      follow up after DCB treatment and there was not MACE happened. However, so far randomized
      controlled trials with large sample to confirm their non-inferiority compared with DES when
      treating relatively larger in suit coronary lesions are lacked. Meanwhile, a number of
      doctors worried about acute cardiovascular occlusion and long-term restenosis. In this study,
      we assume that in the in suit coronary lesions with FFR&gt;0.85 after PTCA pre-treatment, DCB
      treatment is not inferior to DES treatment regarding to middle- and long-term functional
      recovery.
