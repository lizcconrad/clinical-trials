  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to investigate the potential clinical benefit of G1T48 as an oral selective
      estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative
      metastatic breast cancer.

      The study is an open-label design, consisting of 2 parts: dose-finding portion (Part 1), and
      expansion portion (Part 2). Both parts include 3 study phases: Screening Phase, Treatment
      Phase, and Survival Follow-up Phase. The Treatment Phase begins on the day of first dose with
      study treatment and completes at the Post-Treatment Visit. Approximately, 96 patients will be
      enrolled in the study.
