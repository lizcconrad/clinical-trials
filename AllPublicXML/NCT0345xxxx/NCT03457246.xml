  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmétique has commercialized a cosmetic product (D-pigment rich texture)
      for treatment of hyperpigmentation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      D-pigment after laser therapy, through its action on peri-lesional areas, in obtaining better
      cosmetic effect.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many studies have shown the efficacy of topical products such as hydroquinone, tretinoin,
      ascorbic and phytic acid... The combination of topical agents has shown better improvement of
      lentigos aspect. Many physical therapy such as chemical peels, cryosurgery, dermabrasion, and
      pigment-specific lasers show good results.

      The combination of physical and topical therapies may be beneficial to patients. For example,
      the use of combination topical therapy may be used after cryotherapy as a maintenance therapy
      to diminish the risk of relapse. Laser therapy is very efficient on visible lesion, but not
      to prevent lesions apparition. A cosmetic topical depigmenting product may be a support of
      laser therapy, to prevent lentigos apparition in peri-lesional areas.

      Furthermore, Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) is a common adverse effect seen with
      laser, occurring in approximately 35-40% of patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I-III.
      Another study related that 28% of study population has post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. A
      cosmetic topical depigmenting product may be a support of laser therapy, to prevent possible
      laser side effect.

      Pierre Fabre Dermo-Cosmétique has commercialized a cosmetic product (D-pigment rich texture)
      for treatment of hyperpigmentation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of
      D-pigment as a support of a laser therapy, through its action on peri-lesional areas.

      The expected effect is to show the efficacy of D-pigment in post laser long-term treatment,
      having a more homogenous skin colour on the D-pigment hand versus the moisturizer hand. The
      subjects will benefit from a strengthened follow-up by the investigator (one visit every 3
      months). After the completion of the study, a complete hands laser treatment will be done for
      each subject and D-pigment tubes will be offered to the subjects for a 6 months application
      period.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline skin color homogeneity at 12 months by blinded evaluation from standardized photos.</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed at 12 months versus baseline.</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring homogeneity will be assessed through 2 Visual Analogue Scales. One VAS grades the surface affected by lentigo on observed area, no lentigo corresponding to 0 and area completely hidden by lentigo to 10.
The second VAS grades differences between lighter and darker skin of areas, same color skin corresponding to 0 and extremely dark lentigo to 10.
Sum of the two VAS (0 to 20) represents the homogeneity of the skin color Blinded evaluation.
During all the visits, an investigator will take photos. After visits, photos will be renamed and resampled. The investigator who will evaluate the parameter may be independent from that one who took photos.
Each parameter will be evaluated by the same person avoiding thus quotation bias. They will be evaluated on each area blinded from product applied and from time evaluated.
The appraiser will quote at the same time the pictures obtained for one subject, for one hand, at Baseline and at 12 months.</description>
