  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The TeamOBS study is an observational study. We analyze actually recordings of obstetric
      emergencies to get an even better understanding and knowledge of the association between the
      communication and cooperation and the quality of the performance of the interdisciplinary
      team.

      Background:

      In obstetric emergency situations (OES) inadequate non-technical skills (NTS) are the leading
      causes of substandard care.

      Aim:

      Based on live audio and video (AV)-recordings of real (OES) the aim is to describes how the
      NTS and the clinical performance are related.

      Method:

        1. Inclusion of the teams. OES teams from the delivery ward at two Danish hospitals, Aarhus
           University Hospital and Horsens Regional Hospital are AV-recorded are collected and
           saved for analyzing with consent from all participant.

        2. Develop a scoring tool to rate clinical performance in OES. 12 Ekspert Senior
           Obstetricians from different maternity units in Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and
           Iceland volunteered to join the Delphi panel and develop a clinical performance tool.

        3. Rate clinical performance. Using the developed tool in 2) to rate live teams

        4. Rate NTS Recording of teams will be rated by the validated list: Assessment of Obstetric
           Team Performance with the validated tool from Pamela Morgan: AOTP. Furthermore important
           observations will be code. Video assessments is planned for 2016-2018

        5. Explore the association between clinical performance and NTS in OES. Results from 3) and
           4) will be compared.

      Discussion:

      We expect that this study will add to the knowledge of NTS and the effect on clinical
      performance in OES.

        Participants in the study will include working staff (junior and senior doctors, midwifes
        and other health personal) in the maternity wards of two hospitals in Central Region
        Denmark: Horsens Regional Hospital and Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby. Video recording
        in simulation as well in reality will take place in both hospitals. Approximately 200
        different teams each of 3-5 persons will participate in the study. In the live emergency
        scenarios

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Video recordings of emergency situations in simulation aswell live will include management
        of every day situations as well as rare emergencies, with the inclusion criteria of
        obstetric teamwork: &gt;2 healthcare personal present and one of them an obstetrician. The
        five situations in are study are the following:

          1. Eclampsia,

          2. Post-partum haemorrhage,

          3. New -born resuscitation (Apgar â‰¤ 7/5 min),

          4. Shoulder dystocia and

          5. Instrumental delivery. The situation can be included if a video recording is capture
             of the event and all participant in the video have given informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Absent informed consent.
