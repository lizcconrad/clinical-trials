        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Completed activities up to and including Visit 10 (Study Completion) of INS011-16-
             085.

          2. Patient and/or parent(s)/caregiver(s) fully comprehend the informed consent form (ICF)
             and assent form, understand all study procedures, and can communicate satisfactorily

          4. Psychotropic treatment will be permitted if the subject has been on a stable dose
             during the INS011-16-085 and does not anticipate a dose change during the course of
             the study.

          5. Growth hormone treatment will be permitted if the subject has been on a stable dose
             during INS01-16-085.

          6. Any other treatment including thyroid hormones should be stable prior to entering the
             INS011-17-113 study.

          7. In the opinion of the investigator, the parent(s)/caregiver(s) is (are) willing and
             able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedules, including venipuncture,
             and the visit schedules.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient or parent(s)/caregiver(s) have commitments during the study duration that
             would interfere with attending all study visits.

          5. History of clinically significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, neurologic,
             hematologic, endocrine, oncologic, pulmonary, immunologic, psychiatric, or
