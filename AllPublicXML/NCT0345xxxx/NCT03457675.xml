      This research study is for participants that have been diagnosed with intractable Obsessive
      -compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a persistent and oftentimes disabling disorder marked by
      unwanted and distressing thoughts (obsessions) and irresistible repetitive behaviors. OCD
      affects 2-3% of the US population, and is responsible for substantial functional impairment
      and increased risk of early death.

      The only established first-line treatments for OCD are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      with exposure/response prevention and certain medications. About 30-40% of patients fail to
      respond and few experience complete symptom resolution. Up to 25% of patients have difficulty
      tolerating CBT and the risk of relapse after therapies remains large. For the most severe
      cases, neurosurgery (surgery in the brain), has long been the option of last resort.

      In this study the investigators want develop an adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) system
      to use in subjects with intractable (hard to control) OCD. Deep brain stimulation remains
      investigational for OCD patients and is not considered standard therapy. DBS involves the
      surgical implantation of leads and electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which are
      thought to influence the disease. A pack implanted in the chest, called the neurotransmitter,
      keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain through a wire that connects the
      neurotransmitter and electrodes. It is believed deep brain stimulation may restore balance to
      dysfunctional brain circuitry implicated in OCD. The goal of this study is to enhance current
      approaches to DBS targeting in the brain and to use a novel approach to find a better and
      more reliable system for OCD treatment.

      Phase Ia is to gather data to eventually develop a prototype adaptive DBS system for
      intractable OCD that uses signals from the brain to automatically adjust the DBS stimulation
      factors. The overall goal is to improve symptom management and reduce stimulation-induced
      behavioral side effects.

      RECRUITMENT:

      Potential participants will be referred to our program by their treating clinicians, who will
      be made aware of our study through direct clinician-clinician letters and emails. Subjects
      will also learn of the study through consumer advocacy groups such as the International OCD
      Foundation (IOCDF) and local support group meetings.

      ENROLLMENT:

      A subject is considered enrolled upon signing informed consent, deemed eligible to be
      screened by the investigator. Decision-making capacity, which includes understanding,
      appreciation, reasoning and ability to express a choice, will be assessed as part of the
      informed consent process. The informed consent process will include discussions with the
      patient's family and referring clinician. Medical records will be carefully reviewed to
      determine adequacy of past treatments including CBT.

      SCREENING:

      Potential subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and willing to participate in the
      study as demonstrated by signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study and
      undergo screening.

      After the participant signs the required documents, he/she will undergo two baseline
      evaluations spaced over an approximate 1 month period. Diagnostic and screening ratings are
      completed, followed by complete medical, neurological and neurosurgical evaluations. The
      raters will be trained and certified in the use of the clinician-administered scales of the
      study. The purpose of the screening evaluations is to demonstrate that subject is in a stable
      clinical situation including a stable medical regimen, and are severely symptomatic. If this
      is the case, and they continue to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria, the participant will
      proceed to treatment (surgery to implant the DBS system. Final selection of candidates will
      be made by consensus of the multi-disciplinary investigator team (&quot;Project Advisory
      Committee&quot;).

      TREATMENT:

      Subjects treated in Phase 1a will undergo a single stage DBS surgery, in which bilateral deep
      brain leads will be implanted under conscious sedation, followed by implantation of a single
      Implantable NeuroStimulator (INS), Activa PC+S, under general anesthesia.

        1. A stereotactic headframe will be applied to the subject on the morning of surgery, and
           an intraoperative stereotactic reference CT will be performed. The initial target point
           within the ventral striatum will be chosen based on the subject's specific anatomy and
           intraoperative CT that is fused with the preoperative 3T MRI scan. The surgical
           trajectory will also be planned in order to avoid prominent vessels and ventricles.

        2. The subject will be positioned and prepped. Conscious sedation will be initiated by the
           anesthesiologist.

        3. Following incision and burr hole placement, a burr hole electrode locking mechanism will
           be secured to the skull with two screws.

        4. The target coordinates for the ventral striatum target will be set.

        5. The Model 3387 DBS electrode (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) will be inserted
           through the guide tube to the target point. An intraoperative CT will be obtained to
           confirm position of the DBS electrode. Sedation will be withdrawn.

        6. Test stimulation will be performed to a) assess for stimulation-induced side effects and
           b) monitor for acute changes in behavior to assess anxiety, arousal, and mood. If there
           are no side effects, the lead will be secured to the skull with the burr hole cap. The
           free end of the leads will be left out and the incision will be closed.

        7. The headframe will be removed and general anesthesia will be induced. The pulse
           generator will then be implanted and connected to the brain lead via extension cables.

        8. If no complications occur, it is expected that the subject will be observed overnight in
           a Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and regular room setting before discharge the
           following day.

        9. The subject will return to the neurosurgery clinic for post-operative evaluation
           according to normal clinical protocol (suture removal/wound surveillance).

      One to two weeks after surgery the subject will return to the clinic for a routine
      post-operative examination. tThe subject will also be seen at the Baylor Psychiatry Clinic at
      Jamail Specialty Center where psychiatric measures will be collected to establish
      post-surgical baseline and recording completed. One week after the recording visit,
      programming of the DBS device will occur.

      Post-surgical 1.5 rs-fMRI scans will also be performed to ensure safety.

      Participants will be asked to keep their current medications constant for the first 6 months
      post-surgery. However, clinical circumstances which mandate changes will be allowed and
      notated should this occur.

      Provocation Tasks:

      The Provocation OC task (Provoc) and the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) will be used to
      start OC-related distress and distress unrelated to OCD (e.g., performance anxiety),
      respectively. Three sessions will be videotaped with Automated Facial Affect Recognition
      (AFAR) system concurrent to recording of local field potentials (LFPs) from VS and scalp
      electroencephalography (EEG).

      Ambulatory Recording:

      Behavioral states will be assessed using both Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) analysis
      and patient-initiated reports. Subjects will be given a customized AppleWatch and iPhone to
      log subject-perceived states at various times throughout the day.

      Subjects will be notified throughout the day to perform a 3-minute, 5-point Likert rating of
      their OCD-related distress, mood and anxiety levels. Additionally, the system will allow
      manual labeling of OCD compulsions by the user.

      CBT Augmentation:

      Starting at 6-months, subjects will receive a two-month (15 session) cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT) course. Subjects already receiving stable CBT will be allowed to continue it
      during the study. Participants will be encouraged at study visits to actively confront OC
      triggers while refraining from ritual engagement. Subjects, especially those who are still
      habitually avoiding, will be given the opportunity to derive maximal clinical benefit by
      receiving a two-month &quot;refresher&quot; course of CBT prior to entering the double-blind
      discontinuation phase at 9 months.

      Blinded Discontinuation:

      The purpose of the one-month blinded discontinuation period is to confirm clinical benefit.
      The decision whether to reinstate active DBS at the end of the discontinuation will be based
      on clinical considerations in discussion with the subject and significant others. The
      benefits and discomforts will be carefully weighed in arriving at a long-term plan.

      Long-Term Follow-Up:

      After the 18 months of the study, the device will remain implanted in those subjects who are
      doing well clinically. For subjects who are not responsive, it will be explanted, if the
      surgical risks of explantation are deemed acceptable by the treatment team. The follow-up
      management will be arranged on a case-by-case basis, depending on geographic location and
      desires of the subject, and DBS therapy management by our team will be guaranteed for at
      least two years if subjects continue to receive DBS therapy and do not arrange alternative
      management during that period. The investigators are committed to following all subjects
      beyond the period of time outlined in the formal 18-month study period, but will defer
      medication and ongoing psychotherapy management to their primary treating clinicians.

      Subjects will be encouraged to enroll and participate in long-term follow-up studies to
      monitor the continued safety of this system. Only subjects who complete their 6-month visit
      will be allowed to participate in the long-term follow-up study with active stimulation.
      Attempts will be made to collect all device-related adverse events in all willing
      participants at 6-month intervals after they exit the currently proposed study.

      Subject participation is anticipated to continue for a minimum of 18 months.
