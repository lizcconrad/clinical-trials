  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research aims to establish a panel of inflammatory biomarkers of the early (Histamine,
      Tryptase, ProstaglandineD2) and late (Interleukin-4, Interleukin-5, Interleukin-6,
      Interleukin-13, Eotaxin, Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF), (Macrophage Inflammatory
      Protein-1beta (MIP1ß)) phase response to nasal bolus allergen challenge (NAC) in subjects
      with out-of-season seasonal allergic rhinitis, suitable for future application in drug
      intervention studies of novel anti-allergy therapeutics.

      Biomarkers will be sampled by nasal filter paper (NFP) adsorption and lavage (NLF) prior to
      and following NAC. Samples from initial subjects (Cohort A; n~6) will be used primarily for
      validation of biomarker assays in nasal filter paper eluates. Validated biomarker assays will
      be applied to analyze biomarker changes in a further cohort of subjects (Cohort B; n~12) with
      the aim of fully defining the optimum panel and sampling time points for future studies.

                  pregnant, including any female who is pre-menarchal, or post-menopausal with
                  documented proof of hysterectomy or tubal ligation, or meets clinical criteria
                  for menopause and has been amenorrhoeic for more than 1 year prior to the
                  screening visit).

               -  Of childbearing potential and using a highly effective method of contraception

                       complete abstinence from intercourse from two weeks prior to Visit 2
                       procedures until at least 72 hours after NAC)

                    -  implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormonal IUDs or

             corticosteroids or leukotriene antagonists.

          4. Absence of significant current symptoms of allergic rhinitis consistent with being out
             of season for their principal allergen (eg grass).

          5. Skin prick test positive for mixed grass pollen allergen at Visit 1 or within one year
             prior to screening.

          2. Spirometry showing FEV1 &lt;80% predicted

          3. Subjects who have smoked more than 5 cigarettes in the last 6 months or have a smoking
             history of ≥10 pack years.

          4. Upper or lower respiratory tract infection in the prior 4 weeks.

          5. Nasal or lung provocation procedure (eg, allergen challenge) conducted in the prior 4
             weeks.

          6. Significant nasal deformity, recent nasal surgery or obstructing nasal polyps.

          7. History of anaphylaxis (any cause), or previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to
             any of the test agents for SPT or NAC.

          8. Recent participation in a study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) which
             could interfere with markers evaluated in this research

          9. Use of any medications according to section 5.2 in the period indicated before Visit 1
