      We are going to do 2d ultrasound to compare between hadlock's formula and thigh soft tissue
      formula in expecting the after birth fetal weight and to find which of these formulas to be
      more accurate

      We are going to do 2d ultrasound to 200 pregnant women between 38 weeks to 40 weeks singleton
      pregnancy in Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital to measure the expected fetal weight by
      hadlock's formula and thigh soft tissue formula and then we are going to measure the actual
      fetal weight after birth of these 200 fetuses and to find out which formula to be more
      accurate in estimation of fetal weight
