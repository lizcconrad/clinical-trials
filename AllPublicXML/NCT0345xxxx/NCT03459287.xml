      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RBC transfusion for
      support of acute anemia in cardiovascular surgery patients based on the clinical outcome of
      renal impairment following transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) treated with the INTERCEPT
      Blood System (IBS) for Red Blood Cells compared to patients transfused with conventional
      RBCs.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, active controlled,
      parallel-design, non-inferiority study.

      Screening/Recruitment In order to minimize the number of patients who enroll in the study but
      do not require RBC transfusion, only patients with a relatively high likelihood to receive a
      RBC transfusion as determined by the Investigator (e.g., patients receiving aspirin,
      clopidogrel (or analogs) and/or GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), or patients with a TRUST Score of &gt;3
      will be eligible for enrollment. Patients ≥ 11 years of age undergoing complex cardiac
      surgery will be identified through pre-operative scheduling procedures in advance of their
      operations.

      All potentially eligible patients will be approached for study consent prior to their
      surgical procedure. Subjects who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and
      undergo screening. Screening data collection and procedures will include:

      Demographics (age, sex), vital signs, height, weight, EKG, type of scheduled surgery, need
      for irradiated blood products, medical and surgical history, transfusion history, physical
      examination, concomitant medications, complete blood count, blood type, blood chemistry,
      coagulation panel, troponin, DAT test, immune reactivity to IBS RBCs, and pregnancy test
      (when applicable). All TRUST components will be collected on the CRF.

      Randomization and Blinding Potentially eligible subjects will be screened and will be
      considered for randomization. If a subject is screened and receives a red cell transfusion
      prior to randomization, that subject will no longer be considered for randomization, and
      their participation in the study will end. An Interactive Web Response System will be used
      for electronic randomization of eligible patients. Randomization (in 1:1 ratio for
      Test:Control) stratified by site, pre-existing renal impairment (baseline sCr ≥1.2mg/dL), and
      cardiac surgery type will be employed. Randomized subjects who do not receive any study RBC
      transfusions during surgery or within the first 48 hours after completion of surgery,
      hospital discharge, or death, whichever occurs first, will be replaced.

      Screening will include documentation of the patients' pre-surgical exposure to radiographic
      contrast media, number of prior pregnancies (females), complete blood count, blood
      chemistries, blood type, DAT, IAT, RBC antibody screen, and the presence of antibodies to
      INTERCEPT RBC. Data may be derived from the medical record where performed within 7 days of
      screening.

      At screening, the subject's eligibility status will be entered into the electronic data
      capture system (EDC). On the day before or day of scheduled surgery, eligible subjects will
      be enrolled and randomized with a 1:1 ratio for Test: Control within each randomization
      stratum. Only appropriate blood bank staff will be able to access the treatment arm
      assignment. RBC unit labels will be identical for Test and Control products. Operating room
      staff, surgical staff, ICU staff, and others caring for participating patients, as well as
      the sponsor (and delegates) will be blinded to treatment assignment. Unblinded monitors will
      monitor the production of the RBC components.

      Treatment Randomized subjects will be transfused with Test or Control RBCs during surgery
      (Day 0) through Day 7 post surgery, hospital discharge, or death, whichever is first, as
      clinically indicated and determined by the treating physician. Treatment assessments will be
      divided into an acute surgical care period starting the day of surgery until Day 7, hospital
      discharge, or death, whichever is first, during which study RBC (Test or Control) are
      administered, a post-surgical follow-up period of a minimum of 28 days after the last study
      transfusion to collect additional safety data, clinical assessment at day 30 and day 75 (±15)
      after the last study transfusion for mortality and RRT status, and collection of samples for
      serological screening for antibodies specific to IBS at end of study (75 (±15) days).

      In all patients anesthesia and surgical procedures will be performed according to the local
      standards of the institution. Study RBC components will be ordered and administered to study
      subjects by their treating physicians, also according to the local standards of care.
      Following the study treatment period, subjects may receive conventional RBC components if
      additional transfusions are needed, as indicated by their treating physician.

      Study Assessments: Monitoring and Follow-up Acute Surgical Care Period (Pre-operative to
      Post-operative Day 7) Hemodynamic and laboratory measures will be assessed pre-operatively
      (Day -1) and daily from post-operative Day 1 through post-operative Day 7, hospital discharge
      or death, whichever occurs first. If a subject is discharged prior to Day 7 but returns to
      the study site for standard care on Day 7, attempts will be made to perform phlebotomy on
      that day for a complete blood count and sCr determination. Randomized subjects who do not
      receive an RBC transfusion either during surgery or within the first 48 hours after surgery,
      hospital discharge, or death, whichever occurs first, will not be followed any longer and
      will be replaced.

      Hemodynamic parameters that will be monitored include heart rate, blood pressure, mean
      arterial pressure, central venous pressure (CVP), peripheral oxygen saturation via pulse
      oximetry probe, arterial PO2, FiO2 and arterial oxygen saturation (as available in the
      medical records).

      Laboratory parameters that will be monitored include BUN, creatinine, ALT, fibrinogen,
      bilirubin, troponin-I, lactic acid, hemoglobin and platelet counts. A blood sample for sCR
      will be taken at 48 (±4 hours) after completion of surgery, and sCr will be determined on a
      daily basis during the acute surgical care period up to 7 days post-surgery. Other parameters
      will be collected on a daily basis as available in the medical record. Laboratory parameters
      will be measured by a CLIA accredited local laboratory.

      The use of radiographic contrast media will be documented starting 7 days prior to surgery,
      as will details related to the specific surgical procedure (type of procedure, start and end
      times, RBC components transfused, all other blood components transfused, estimated blood loss
      from the surgical procedure, concomitant medications, intraoperative cell recovery and
      reinfusion, hemodilution procedures, and nadir temperature. Additionally, daily estimated
      blood loss from chest tube(s) and from other sources, and day of chest tube removal will be
      recorded.

      Transfusion reactions, AEs and SAEs will be documented on a daily basis from the time of
      randomization through post-operative and as available through day 28 after the last study
      transfusion.

      Blood samples for detection of antibody to IBS RBC will be collected at Day 28 (± 3 days
      window) and Day 75 (±15 day window) following the last study transfusion.

      Post-operative Day 8 to 28 Days After Last Study Transfusion Subjects will be monitored for
      transfusion reactions, AEs and SAEs as available following the 7-day treatment period,
      through 28 days after the last study transfusion or death, whichever occurs first, according
      to the local standard of care. In an outpatient setting, weekly telephone surveillance calls
      to the subject will be performed in order to collect safety events until the next follow-up
      visit.

      28 (± 3) Days After Last Study Transfusion or Premature Discontinuation Subjects who have
      been discharged should be scheduled for the follow up visit 28 (±3) days after the last study
      transfusion to obtain additional safety information, including patient-reported AEs, SAEs,
      laboratory studies including sCr ,DAT/ IAT and RBC allo-antibodies; a sample for HLA
      antibodies and antibodies specific to IBS RBC will be obtained, either in hospital or at
      clinic visit. All randomized subjects who receive any study RBC transfusion must have their
      vital status documented at this visit, or earlier if the subject dies prior to the visit.
      Mortality and the need for RRT through Day 30 post-surgery will also be documented.

      If a subject has been discharged, other safety information (e.g., AEs and SAEs) may be
      obtained through medical records, the subject's physician, or a telephone interview with
      either the subject or a family member.

      End of Study (75±15 Days After last Study Transfusion) On 75±15 days after the last study
      transfusion (End of Study), serum samples for antibodies specific for IBS RBC will be
      obtained, either in hospital, at a clinic visitor or offsite. Mortality and the need for RRT
      will be assessed.

      Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) The study data and safety will be monitored by an
      independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). The primary mission of the DSMB is to
      ensure patient safety and protocol compliance for data collection. The DSMB will be assembled
      by the Sponsor and composed of transfusion medicine, intensive care and/or cardiac surgery
      experts, and a statistician. DSMB members will be independent of the Sponsor.

      Interim Analysis and Early Stopping Rule Aside from the interim sample size re-estimation, no
      interim analysis is planned for this study to compare treatment differences with respect to
      efficacy or safety at any time prior to the completion of the study. Specific stopping rules,
      defined for safety considerations, are defined in Section 4.6 of the protocol.
