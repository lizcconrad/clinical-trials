  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single blinded, non-placebo controlled that will compare one group of
      Bells Palsy patients receiving the current standard of care including oral corticosteroids
      and oral antivirals against an experimental group receiving the current standard of care in
      addition to hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Outcome assessment will be based on both objective
      analyses of facial movements as well as subjective quality of life scales.

    <measure>Facial Clinimetric Evaluation Scale (FaCE) Score Standard of Care Group</measure>
    <time_frame>3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Used to assess facial impairment and disability after facial paralysis. It involves 15 statements, each using a five-item Likert scale. A participant circles the most appropriate response to a given statement, whereby 1 corresponds to the lowest function and 5 corresponds to the highest function. Statements are grouped into six independent domains: social function, facial movement, facial comfort, oral function, eye comfort, and lacrimal control. A score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) is calculated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older exhibiting unilateral facial paralysis progressing to completion in
             4 days or less.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No patients from vulnerable populations as listed above will be included.

          -  Subjects must be able to travel to NYULMC continually during the first 12 months
             following enrollment.

          -  During the initial visit candidates must have no associated clinical signs or symptoms
             consistent with other causes of facial palsy. This includes but is not limited to:
             auricular papules, skin rashes, parotid masses, craniofacial trauma, and the presence
             of other cranial or distal neuropathies excluding facial numbness, change in taste,
             and/or hyperacusis.

          -  Patients with atypical presentations will be referred for cross-sectional imaging and
             excluded.

          -  Patients with histories consistent with possible recent tick exposure, rashes,
             headaches, or excessive fatigue will be serologically tested for Lyme disease and
             excluded if it returns positive.

          -  Pneumothorax within the last two years is the only absolute medical exclusion criteria
             (FF).

          -  Patients who are epileptics, or are claustrophobic, will be carefully counseled on the
             risks of HBOT before being allowed to enroll.

          -  Patients with severe comorbidities will undergo evaluation by their primary care
             doctor and require physician approval prior to enrollment.
