  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized controlled trial of a cognitive behavioral interventions and an
      art-based stress reduction treatment protocol (CB-ART) with 100 women, identified with
      elevated perceived stress, before undergoing IVF treatment; in order to examine its effect on
      perceived stress, plasma CFD, telomere length and pregnancy rates.

      CB-ART is a 6-session treatment protocol that has been utilized with women coping with
      stress, depression and pain and is effective in reducing these indicators, developed and
      evaluated by our research team. The treatment protocol emphasizes processing together with
      the client's recalled image, symptom or memory (ISM) pertaining to a current distressing
      mental or physical state. CB-ART is a multi-method model that integrates cognitive behavioral
      interventions and art-based stress reduction interventions. The innovation in this method is
      the transformation of imagined and drawn images and memories rather than solely verbally
      discussing their contents. The focus is on changing compositional elements that comprise each
      image and memory, thus providing a therapeutic venue to reframe and transform stress
      producing, recalled images and memories and reduce symptoms of perceived stress. Art making
      is beneficial for eliciting an emotional response and provides a concrete platform to conduct
      the cognitive processing that initiate change on the paper and then in the mind. Furthermore,
      the soothing qualities of interacting with art making foster and enhance behavioral
      relaxation techniques.

      Our study population, women with infertility problems, who are designated to undergo IVF
      treatment and have been identified to have elevated perceived stress scores on the Perceived
      Stress Scale (above 15) will be randomized and allocated to receive the CB-ART intervention
      tailored to reduce stress or treatment as usual.

    <description>The perceived stress scale (Cohen, Kamarck &amp; Mermelstein, 1994) is a 10 item scale measuring perceived stress by asking 10 questions in which participants are requested to list on a scale from 0- never to 4- very frequently, how often they have experienced different stress related occurrences in the past month. The scale is calculated by summing the items (4 items reversed) with scores ranging from 0 - 40. Higher scores indicate higher perceived stress, with the mean US score being 16.</description>
