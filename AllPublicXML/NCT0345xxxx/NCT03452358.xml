  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A retrospective clinical study will be performed evaluating a large number of partial ceramic
      restorations (IPS e-Max press, Ivoclar, Liechtenstein) placed in general practice. Evaluation
      will be based on the well established Hickel criteria (Hickel et al, 2010). Rationale:
      IPS-e-max press has been made available to the market since 2006. Although millions of these
      restorations have been placed worldwide, clinical data are available of less than 200 single
      restorations only, covering observation periods of 2-8 years.(Guess et al, 2009; Etman en
      Woolford, 2010; Gehrt et al, 2012; Esquivel-Upshaw et al, 2012).

      Objective: Study the survival of lithium disilicate restorations during regular check-ups in
      a private dental practice.

      Study the survival of lithium disilicate restorations during regular check-ups in a private
      dental practice. All included patients were followed-up with special emphasis on the partial
      restoration(s), every time they visited the dental practice for regular dental check-ups
      between 2015 and 2017. To assess these restorations a light photograph with a digital camera
      (Nikon (D7100, 60mm lens), Nikon, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) and an x-ray were taken from
      the partial posterior crowns and evaluated according to the modified United States Public
      Health Service (USPHS) criteria.
