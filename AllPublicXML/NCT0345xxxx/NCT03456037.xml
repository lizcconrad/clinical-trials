    <description>There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. These 5 types are of greatest concern because of the burden of illness and death they cause and the potential for outbreaks and epidemic spread. In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer.The aim is to investigate incidence of HBsAg, anti-HCV in serum samples and evaluation of biomarkers taken from patients who were followed the intensive care unit of Sakarya University Training and Research Hospital.</description>
