  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collapsibility (CI-IVC), distensibility (dIVC) and delta (ΔIVC) indices, which are dynamic
      measures of inferior vena cava (IVC) diameter, are used to assess the intravascular volume
      status in critically ill patients. Positive pressure support (PS) has been shown to induce
      IVC diameter distention by increasing intrathoracic pressure, and high positive expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) decreases the CI-IVC percentage (4). During Triggered positive pressure
      support it is necessary to clarify which IVC index is valid for measuring the volume
      status.it is aimed to compare the IVC indexes (CI-IVC, DIVC, ΔIVC), positive rate of change
      with pressure, correlation with central venous pressure and accurate prediction of volume
      status in patients with different positive pressure support.

      The IVC diameters at different pressure supports were measured by the same clinician after
      obtaining a clear image of where the US and IVC measurements were made and the probe
      stabilization was achieved. He performed the procedure of changing the pressure supports, a
      blind independent intensive care physician without working, and recorded the applied pressure
      supports respectively. The different pressure supports applied are as follows:

        1. PS 10 mmHg-PEEP 5 mmHg,

        2. PS 0 mmHg- PEEP 5 mmHg

        3. PS 10 mmHg- PEEP 0 mmHg.

        4. T-tube (PS 0 mmHg-PEEP 0 mmHg)
