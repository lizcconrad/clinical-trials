      The present trial was aimed to identify which biomarkers could be associated in perioperative
      period after surgical treatment of tibial fracture to the development of POM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early diagnosis of acute posttraumatic osteomyelitis (POM) is of vital importance for
      avoiding devastating complications. Diagnosing POM is difficult due to the lack of a highly
      specific and sensitive test, such as in myocardial infarct, stroke and intracranial bleeding.
      Serum inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), white blood cells
      (WBC) can support clinical findings but they are not able to differentiate between
      inflammatory response to infection and the host response to non-infection insult with high
      specificity and sensitivity.

      The prospective nonrandomised cohort study included 86 patients after high-energy injury to
      the shin requiring primary surgical treatment (open or closed reduction and internal fixation
      of tibial fracture). Values of the biochemical and immunoinflammatory profile were measured
      on admission (ADD), first postoperative day (POD1) and fourth-postoperative day (POD4).

      The objectives of the study were to investigate that the biochemical and immunoinflammatory
      profile could facilitate postoperative monitoring, guide the antibiotic treatment and timing
      of revision surgery.

The immunocytochemic analyzer Modular Analytics SWE (Roche Diagnostics) was used for serum samples analysis. The serum concentration of CRP (reference range 0-5mg/L) was measured by the immunoturbidimetric method, PCT (reference range 0-0.5μg/L) by the electrochemiluminescence method and albumins (reference range 35-52g/L) by the bromcresol green method.</description>

    <description>Whole venous blood was collected into vacutainer tubes containing EDTA. Samples were processed for flow cytometry. For surface staining, the standard whole-blood staining methodology as prescribed by the manufacturer (BDBiosciences) was used. For detecting regulatory T cells, samples were stained for surface antigens with a mix of anti-CD25-PE/ anti-CD127-APC/ anti-CD4-PE-Cy™7. All antibodies were obtained from BDBiosciences (Mountain View, Ca, USA). Cells were analyzed on FACSCantoII™ Flow Cytometer (BDBiosciences) equipped with blue (488-nm solid-state) and red (633-nm helium-neon) laser. Digital data was acquired with FACSDiva software (BDBiosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.,).</description>
