    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety and feasibility of the new
      technique,detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy(DS-MCE)for evaluating
      gastric and esophagus diseases.

    <textblock>
      Esophageal capsule endoscopy(ECE)provides a novel noninvasive approach to visualize the
      esophagus.The main drawback for the use of ECE is its unreliable transit time which often
      renders an inadequate visualization of the esophagus.Thus investigators have developed the
      detachable string magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy(DS-MCE) which can control the
      movement of the capsule through the string.

      This study is a prospective, single-centered, self-controlled pilot study.Outpatients who
      have esophagus symptoms will take conventional endoscopy examination and DS-MCE successively.
