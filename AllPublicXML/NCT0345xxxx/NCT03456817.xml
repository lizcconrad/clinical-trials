  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether compared to our standard low dose ATG with
      CSA, the high dose ATG without CSA minimizes the chances of relapse and chronic GVHD, without
      increasing the chances of other transplant complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of complications of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.

      The main complications are:

        -  Recurrence (relapse) of the disease for which the transplantation is done (for example,
           leukemia). The relapse usually leads to death.

        -  Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This may lead to death.

        -  Chronic GVHD. This may lead to poor quality of life long-term.

      This study is being done to minimize the chances of patients getting relapse and chronic
      GVHD, without increasing the chances of getting acute GVHD.

      At this time, the standard of care approach to treat this condition would be with:

        -  Low dose thymoglobulin (ATG), given on Day -2, -1 and 0.

        -  Cyclosporin (CSA), given from Day -1 through to Day 84.

        -  Methotrexate, given on Days 1, 3, 6 and 11

      CSA reduces the chances of getting acute GVHD, but it does not reduce the chances of getting
      chronic GVHD and increases the chances of getting relapse. ATG reduces both acute and chronic
      GVHD, and does not increase relapse.

      In this study, high dose ATG will be given on days -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0 (instead of only on
      days -2, -1 and 0), no CSA (instead of CSA from day -1 through 84) will be given, and the
      routine dose of methotrexate (unchanged) will be given. We think that this may lead to better
      outcomes.

      Patients will be followed per standard practice of the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant
      Program for the development of acute and chronic GVHD, and for relapse.

      Patients will also be asked to complete a quality of life questionnaire 2 years after the
      transplant to assess how their treatment and illness affects their quality of life.

    <description>High dose ATG at 10 mg/kg will be infused on days -4, -3, -2, -1 and 0. Before each infusion of ATG (thymoglobulin), patient will receive medications preventing side effects from the ATG, including diphenhydramine (Benadryl), acetaminophen (Tylenol) and methylprednisolone (Solumedrol). The high dose ATG will be given into patient's vein via central venous catheter. Each infusion of ATG will take 4-8 hours. No CSA (cyclosporine A) will be given. Standard dose methotrexate will be given.</description>

    <description>Patients agreeing to 10 mg/kg ATG will be treated with 2 mg/kg daily on days -4 to 0. On days -4, -3 &amp; -2, ATG will be infused after fludarabine &amp; busulfan infusion. ATG will be infused over a minimum of 6 hrs on day -4 &amp; over at least 4 hrs on days -3, -2, -1 &amp; 0.

Foothills Medical Center Unit 57 standard practice followed for ATG infusion. ATG premeds include methylprednisolone 40 mg IVPB, acetaminophen 1000 mg PO &amp; diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB. Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO &amp; diphenhydramine 50 mg IVPB can be repeated in 4-6 hrs PRN for flu-like symptoms/fever/chills. Meperidine 25-50 mg IVPB given PRN every 4 hrs for rigors.
