      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the effect of treatment for acquired speech
      impairment can be enhanced by combining effective behavioral treatment with non-invasive
      brain stimulation. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which delivers
      low-intensity current to the scalp, and is a safe and well-tolerated approach that poses a
      non-significant risk to participants. tDCS provides low intensity neural stimulation which
      has been shown to facilitate motor learning in other domains of stroke rehabilitation such as
      arm motor learning but the potential to enhance speech motor learning has not been explored.
      This will be examined with a series of single-case experimental designs.

    <description>Introduction of the independent variable (treatment) across three different points in time. Participants will be randomly assigned to have each treatment phase begin after 3, 4, or 6 baseline sessions. This current stimulates the cortex, with anodal stimulation leading to a depolarized state in which neurons are more likely to fire.</description>
