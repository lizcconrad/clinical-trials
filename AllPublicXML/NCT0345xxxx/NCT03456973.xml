  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to build and test a supportive care software platform called Nurse
      AMIE (Addressing Metastatic Individuals Everyday) to be provided to metastatic breast cancer
      patients on Android Tablets. This program will be tested in 50 metastatic breast cancer
      patients within the Penn State Cancer Institute's 28 county catchment area. The company with
      whom the investigator will partner to develop this application is already working with
      multiple investigators at the institution (Webster Group).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Goals of the Nurse AMIE software program are to regularly assess psychosocial, functional,
      and symptom needs among metastatic breast cancer patients and to provide appropriate
      interventions via YouTube style videos, weekly Skype calls (face to face, tablet to tablet)
      with a patient navigator at Penn State, and appropriate referrals to phone or in person
      consultations as needed. The proposed Nurse AMIE software program will allow for the
      provision of resources (YouTube style videos, audio files, exercises) to intervene on many of
      the common symptoms and challenges experienced by metastatic patients. This is an identified
      need on the part of both metastatic patients and their medical care teams. Finally, it will
      also allow patient navigators to check in with patients, reviewing responses to surveys,
      discerning whether new or different interventions are needed, and connecting women to
      palliative care and other services if additional care is warranted.
