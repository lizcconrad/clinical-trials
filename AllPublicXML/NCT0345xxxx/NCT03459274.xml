  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the use of virtual reality (VR) and biofeedback in rheumatology
      clinics to help manage chronic pain in patients with rheumatologic diseases. The objective is
      to know the usefulness of VR/biofeedback-based therapy in the clinic.

    <description>These participants would express either interest or a lack of interest in trying biofeedback/virtual reality therapy. They will be instructed on how to use the virtual reality equipment and program. Then, they will have the option to participate in the biofeedback/virtual reality experience, if they choose to do so, before sharing their feedback.</description>

    <description>The intervention uses a smart phone with a virtual reality app; a headset that connects to the phone and has goggles that contribute to the 3 dimensional, interactive, and surrounding aspects of the experience; headphones through which subjects hear calming sounds and guiding voices from the experience; an attached microphone that allows subjects to monitor their breathing and interact with their environment through their breath; and a heart rate monitor whose realtime data on variability has an affect on the virtual environment. The virtual reality experience guides subjects through deep breathing exercises. Subjects will attempt to match a certain slow breathing rate, and pulse and breathing rate will cause non-stressful changes to the environment.</description>
