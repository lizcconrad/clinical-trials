      Sixty patients will be enrolled in the study &amp; randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to receive
      either intravenous infusion (IVi) norepinephrine in an initial dose of 0.05 which can be
      increased every 30-60min. up to 0.3ug/Kg/min. to achieve mean arterial pressure ≥ 80-100mmHg&amp;
      will be continued either until HRS reversal or for maximum 10 days or oral midodrine 5mg
      three times/day&amp; can be increased every 24h up to 12.5mg three times daily plus octreotide
      100ug/ 6h subcutaneous&amp; if needed increased to 200ug/6h. Both regimens continued for 7-10
      days. Patients included in the study, albumin (20%) will be given by dose 1gm/Kg on the first
      day then 10-20gm/day &amp; to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) 12-16 cmH2O &amp;stopped if CVP)
      ≥ 16 cmH2O.

      All demographic data will be obtained including the patients' age, sex, body mass index
      (BMI), associated co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension), Child-Pugh score &amp;
      Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA).

      Vital signs including the heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure
      (CVP),intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), urine volume &amp; fluid
      balance will be recorded at admission and then will be followed up daily and recorded as
      required.

      Laboratory investigations including the complete blood profile, prothrombin time, serum
      bilirubin, serum albumin, serum creatinine, estimated creatinine clearance &amp; serum sodium
      will be recorded at randomization as a baseline &amp; then will be assessed on day 0, 1, 3, 5,
      7,10 &amp;12of the study.Thirty-day survival will be followed by phone calls to the patient or
      one of his/her first-degree relatives.

      Patients will be classified into three groups. Group (A) = responders; when there was a
      complete response through reduction in serum creatinine below 1.5mg/dl (133umol/L) &amp;/or urine
      volume ≥ 500ml/day during treatment. Group (B) = partial responders; when there was a
      reduction in serum creatinine of greater than 50% of the pretreatment value but with an end
      of treatment value equal to or greater than 1.5mg/dl (133umol/L) &amp;/or urine volume ≥
      100ml/day &amp;&lt; 500ml/day. Group (C) = non-responders; decrease in serum creatinine level of
      less than 50% compared with the baseline value to a final value higher than 1.5 mg/dL or an
      increase in serum creatinine compared with the baseline value.

             prognosis or any extrahepatic disease that could affect the short-term prognosis, the
             presence of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or presence of contraindication to
             norepinephrine as hypotension due to blood volume deficits except emergency measure,
