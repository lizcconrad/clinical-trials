  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most frequent injuries affecting service members.
      Unfortunately, current neurocognitive assessment tools are unable to reliably detect mild TBI
      more than a few days post- injury. Therefore, development of advanced systems for assessment
      and diagnosis of TBI are a top priority within Department of Defense. This project aims to
      evaluate a combined electroencephalography (EEG) and eye tracking system capable of assessing
      compromised cognitive function stemming from TBI, with the goal of enhancing operational
      readiness and aiding in diagnosis, improving health care and rehabilitation for affected
      military personnel.

    <textblock>
      This study (N=100) will be a correlational study to assess cognitive function in healthy
      controls, individuals with mild TBI, and individuals with moderate-to-severe TBI.

      In general, participants will provide demographic information, medical history, and details
      of their head injury. Participants will also complete a brief neuropsychological assessment
      to obtain an index of cognitive ability, along with the Fusion Test with eye tracking and
      linked EEG. MRI data may also be obtained.
