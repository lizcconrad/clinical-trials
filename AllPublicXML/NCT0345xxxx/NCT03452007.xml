  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to determine the electrode configurations that promote functional
      gains in the storage and voiding phases of lower urinary tract function as a result of
      activation of spinal circuits with spinal cord epidural stimulation in humans with spinal
      cord injury. The innovative approach and novel application of the Medtronic Specify 5-6-5
      (16-electrode array) epidural device will allow the investigators to determine, with this
      early feasibility study, specific parameters of spinal cord epidural stimulation and
      approaches for bladder training needed for lower urinary tract function which will lay the
      groundwork for expedient translation of this promising technology to larger numbers of
      individuals with spinal cord injury who currently have limited treatment options. The current
      proposed study will increase the understanding of human lumbosacral spinal networks and guide
      the use of innovative therapeutic strategies that would be immediately available to not only
      improve the motor output during standing and walking but also ameliorate bladder dysfunction
      and thus improve quality of life in individuals after spinal cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in urologic function after spinal cord injury impact quality of life and
      consistently ranks as a top priority issue in the spinal cord injury population. Bladder
      dysfunction may manifest as detrusor hyperreflexia (bladder contractions at low volumes,
      causing incontinence and smooth muscle hypertrophy), detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia
      (uncoordinated bladder and external urethral sphincter contractions, causing inefficient
      emptying and smooth muscle hypertrophy), decreased compliance (unable to store urine under
      appropriately low pressures) and loss of continence, requiring lifelong management,
      maintenance, and health care visits. Current therapeutic approaches aim to manage both the
      storage and voiding phases of bladder function and include intermittent catheterization,
      pharmacologic and surgical interventions. While most of these strategies are necessary for
      urological maintenance post-injury they oftentimes are associated with side effects and
      therefore remain inadequate. Therapies addressing recovery of function are still needed. The
      use of spinal cord epidural stimulation is a promising alternative approach to addressing the
      primary phases of bladder dysfunction. Additionally, the effects of spinal cord epidural
      stimulation on bladder alone is not known as its use has been directed towards the locomotor
      system. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to perform functional mapping in order
      to identify the spinal cord epidural stimulation configurations (anode/cathode selection,
      amplitude, frequency and pulse width) at the lumbosacral level that can promote neural
      control of bladder storage (capacity) and bladder emptying (voiding efficiency) after spinal
      cord injury.

    <description>Spinal cord epidural stimulation will be administered through a multi-electrode array implanted in the epidural space over the dorsum of the spinal cord. An implanted package containing stimulating circuits, rechargeable battery, and wireless communication activates the electrodes (16 platinum electrodes arranged in three columns of [5-6-5]). The pattern of electrically active electrodes, as well as electrode voltage, stimulating frequency, and stimulating pulse width will be varied to facilitate effects toward bladder function.</description>
