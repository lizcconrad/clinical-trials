  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most people with moderate or severe TBI have difficulty returning to their usual social roles
      and activities. The OBIA has developed a program where peers (other individuals living with
      TBI) coach or mentor those with more recent brain injury. The objective of this project is to
      evaluate the feasibility of measuring the impact of the OBIA Peer Program on social
      participation and mood compared to a control group who have not received peer support yet.

      The proposed study will involve three phases. It will begin with a qualitative component
      (stakeholder interviews), then a pilot RCT, and end with more interviews to explore the
      success of the study intervention. A qualitative descriptive approach will be used at these
      first and last phases of the study. In Phase 1, interviews will be conducted with
      approximately 15 participants including individuals with moderate to severe TBI, caregivers,
      Mentors, OBIA staff members, and health researchers. Phase 2 will be a clinical trial,
      conducted with 60 participants. These participants will be randomized to one of three groups:
      a twice a week Program (n=20), a once a week Program (n=20), or the wait list control group
      (n=20). For Phase 3, a sub group of approximately 25 participants from Phase 2 who
      participated in the OBIA Peer Support Program will be asked to participate in a one-on-one,
      telephone/Skype interview. A sub-group of Mentors will also be asked to participate in a
      one-on-one, telephone/Skype interview.

      This research project will address the highest priority areas of &quot;strategies to enhance
      social participation and community life (personal relationships)&quot; and &quot;psychological
      strategies to improve mood, depression, and irritability&quot;, as identified in the ONF's Request
      for Proposals on &quot;Addressing Evidence Gaps in Moderate to Severe TBI Rehabilitation&quot;. The
      study will provide important results to inform a RCT (of appropriate size) on the impact of
      peer support on the social participation and mood of individuals with moderate to severe TBI.
      This study will then provide the best evidence to support the recommendation on &quot;a
      peer-supported relationship model of intervention&quot;, and inform future versions of the
      INESSS-ONF Guideline.

      Phase 1 - Understanding the Enablers, Barriers of Implementing the Trial Protocol Specific
      Objective: To understand the perceived enablers and barriers of implementing the peer support
      trial protocol, including the perceived enablers and barriers to participant recruitment,
      retention, adherence, and data collection, of implementing the selected outcomes measures,
      and of participating in the trial, from the perspective of stakeholders (knowledge users)
      including individuals with moderate to severe TBI, caregivers, OBIA Peer Support Program
      Mentors, OBIA staff members who are a part of the Peer Support Program, health services and
      knowledge translation (KT) researchers with expertise in TBI, and methodologists with
      expertise in clinical trials; Hypothesis: A better understanding of the perceived enablers
      and barriers of implementing the peer support trial protocol will enhance the effectiveness
      of the intervention and feasibility of the trial in Phase 2; Significance: Results from Phase
      1 will be used to refine the research protocol, if necessary (e.g., ensure that there is a
      good match between the measure of social participation and the content of the OBIA Peer
      Support Program), to optimize the outcomes of Phase 2.

      Phase 2 - Evaluating the Feasibility of the Trial Protocol, Conducting a (Pilot) Randomized
      Controlled Feasibility Trial Specific Objective: a) To evaluate the feasibility of
      participant recruitment and retention, data collection, as well as participant adherence to
      the OBIA Peer Support Program; b) To estimate effect sizes of the immediate impact of the
      twice/week versus once/week OBIA Peer Support Program compared to a wait list control group
      on social participation (primary outcome), mood, HRQoL, and self-efficacy (secondary
      outcomes); Hypotheses: a) It is expected that adequate (i.e., â‰¥75%) recruitment, retention
      and adherence to the OBIA Peer Support Program will be achieved; b) It is expected that the
      six-month OBIA Peer Support Program delivered twice weekly will lead to greater mean
      improvement, on measures of social participation, mood (i.e., depressive symptoms), HRQoL,
      and self-efficacy, than the same program delivered once weekly or a wait list control
      intervention (i.e., a dose response effect will be observed); c) It will be possible to
      estimate the magnitude of effect to allow the sample size calculation for a definitive trial;
      Significance: The results of the currently proposed research will support a future definitive
      RCT.

      Phase 3 - Exploring the Impact and Acceptability of the OBIA Peer Support Program and the
      Trial Protocol Specific Objective: To explore the impact and acceptability of the OBIA Peer
      Support Program and the trial itself from the perspective of Partners and Mentors;
      Hypothesis: It is expected that the OBIA Peer Support Program will be acceptable to both the
      Partners and Mentors and that an increased understanding of the OBIA Peer Support Program and
      the trial itself will be achieved; Significance: The results of Phase 3 will lead to an
      understanding of the &quot;active ingredients&quot; or mechanisms that are associated with improved
      outcomes and the impact of &quot;dosage&quot; of interactions. Furthermore, the results of Phase 3 will
      refine and improve future iterations of the OBIA Peer Support Program and the implementation
      of the definitive RCT.

      METHODS Overview of Study Design The proposed research is a three-phase, mixed methods
      randomized controlled feasibility trial. Consistent with an integrated knowledge translation
      (IKT) approach, as described below, the study design has been informed in consultation with
      the knowledge users (i.e., OBIA). It will include an initial qualitative component, a pilot
      RCT, and then conclude with a qualitative component. A qualitative descriptive approach31,32
      will be adopted for both qualitative phases of the study. For Phase 1, key informant
      interviews will be conducted with approximately 15 participants including individuals with
      moderate to severe TBI, caregivers, OBIA Peer Support Program Mentors, OBIA staff members who
      are a part of the Peer Support Program, health services and KT researchers with expertise in
      TBI, and methodologists with expertise in clinical trials. The results from this phase will
      be used to inform and adapt the protocol for Phase 2, consistent with an IKT approach. Phase
      2 will be a pilot RCT, conducted with 60 participants. These participants will be randomized
      to one of three groups: a twice a week Program (n=20), a once a week Program (n=20), or the
      wait list control group (n=20). For Phase 3, a sub group of approximately 25 intervention
      participants from Phase 2 (i.e., Partners randomized to either the twice a week or once a
      week groups) will be asked to participate in a one-on-one, semi-structured telephone/Skype
      interview. In addition, a sub-group of Mentors will be asked to participate in a one-on-one,
      semi-structured telephone/Skype interview. Both sets of participants will be interviewed to
      explore the impact and acceptability of the program/intervention and trial protocol.
      Specifically, both sets of participants will be asked about their experiences participating
      in the OBIA Peer Support Program and the trial itself, including the strengths and weaknesses
      of the program as well as the enablers and barriers to participating in the program. Research
      ethics approval will be obtained from the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute-University Health
      Network Research Ethics Board. All participants will provide informed consent prior to their
      participation in both the interviews and the trial (see Appendix E - Consent Form, Telephone
      Script for Phase 1).

      Participants and Recruitment Strategy: Phases 1-3 For Phase 1, purposive sampling of each of
      the different stakeholder groups, including individuals with moderate to severe TBI,
      caregivers, OBIA Peer Support Program Mentors, OBIA staff members who are a part of the Peer
      Support Program, and researchers/methodologists, will be used. Eligible Partner participants,
      including caregiver Partners, will include community-based (i.e., no longer participating in
      a comprehensive rehabilitation program) individuals who 1) have a moderate to severe TBI
      (Glasgow Coma Scale â‰¤12)33 or have cared for (i.e., unpaid) an individual with moderate to
      severe TBI for at least one year; 2) are 18 years of age or older; 3) have participated in
      the OBIA Peer Support Program; 4) are fluent in English; and, 5) are able to provide informed
      consent/have an available proxy who is able to provide informed consent. Individuals who are
      medically unstable or have active suicidal ideation will not be eligible to participate. To
      be eligible, Mentor participants must have completed at least one partnership with the OBIA
      Peer Support Program. The OBIA Peer Support Program Database will be used to recruit the
      Partners (including caregivers) and Mentors. On-line searches and/or the contacts of the
      Principal Investigators will be used to recruit the OBIA staff members and the
      researchers/methodologists. We will aim to recruit a total of 15 key informants for Phase 1.
      Individuals who are interested in participating in the study will contact the Research
      Coordinator via telephone or email to gain further information about the study. The
      eligibility criteria of all participants will be confirmed by the Research Coordinator. This
      process will be followed for all phases of the study.

      For Phase 2, eligible Partner participants will include community-based (i.e., no longer
      participating in a comprehensive rehabilitation program) individuals who 1) have a moderate
      to severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 or less);33 2) are 18 years of age or older; 3) are
      fluent in English; and 4) are able to provide informed consent/have an available proxy who is
      able to provide informed consent. Individuals who 1) have previously participated in the OBIA
      Peer Support Program or another peer support/self-management program; 2) are medically
      unstable; and 3) have active suicidal ideation will be excluded. The same inclusion/exclusion
      criteria will be used for the Mentor participants; in addition, they may include
      newly-trained Mentors or Mentors that have already had previous mentorship experience with
      the OBIA Peer Support Program. Partners and Mentors with moderate to severe TBI will be
      recruited via an online advertisement posted on the OBIA website as well as the websites of
      the 14 participating brain injury associations. Mentor participants may also be recruited
      from the OBIA Peer Support Program Database. We will aim to recruit a total of 60 Partners
      (i.e., n=20 participants per group) and 20-40 Mentors for Phase 2.

      Phase 3 will include a sub-set of the Partner and Mentor participants from Phase 2. Purposive
      sampling will be used to recruit Partner participants in Phase 3 and will include
      intervention group (i.e., twice or once a week) and severity of TBI (i.e., moderate or
      severe). All participating Mentors will be approached about participating in the interviews.
      Recruitment of participants will cease once data saturation has been achieved, which is the
      point when successive interviews become repetitive and no new responses or themes emerge.34
      We will aim to recruit a total of 25 Partners and Mentors for Phase 3.

      Study Groups: Phase 2 Intervention and Control Groups Participants in the intervention groups
      will take part in the OBIA Peer Support Group, as described above, receiving either twice a
      week (i.e., two 20-40 minute calls) or once a week (i.e., one 20-40 minute call) support. In
      keeping with an average duration of support,27 and for the purposes of the currently proposed
      study, the intervention duration will be 6 months. Participants in the control group will be
      assigned to a wait list. They will receive the OBIA Peer Support Program after the
      intervention group (i.e., after 6 months). This assignment does not represent a significant
      variation in the usual intake procedure, as the OBIA Peer Support Program already maintains a
      wait list (personal communication).

      Sample Size, Randomization, and Blinding Since this is a feasibility study, a formal sample
      size calculation will not be performed. The recruitment of 20 participants in each arm of the
      trial is judged to be feasible and will produce a robust and useful amount of data.35 In
      fact, one of the specific objectives of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of
      participant recruitment and retention. The primary outcome measure, social participation, as
      measured by the Community Integration Questionnaire (CIQ),36 will be used to inform the
      sample size calculation for the definitive RCT.

      Participants (including Partners and Mentors) who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and have provided informed consent to take part in the trial will be randomized to either the
      intervention (twice/week or once/week Program) or the wait list control groups. A web-based
      randomization service with secure password protected login using random variable block-size
      will be used. Due to the nature of the intervention, blinding of the Partners and Mentors
      will not be possible. However, the processes of outcome assessment and data analysis will be
      blinded.

      Data Collection: Phases 1-3 Qualitative Components: Phases 1 and 3 For Phases 1 and 3,
      participants will take part in a one-on-one, semi-structured telephone/Skype interview
      lasting approximately 45-60 minutes. Individuals from each of the stakeholder groups (i.e.,
      Partners, Mentors) will be interviewed separately. A subset of the interviews will be
      conducted by one of the Principal Investigators and the Research Coordinator. The remaining
      interviews will be conducted by the Research Coordinator alone. The interview guides will
      consist of semi-structured open-ended questions (see Appendix E - Examples of Open-Ended
      Questions from the Interview Guide for Phase 1) and will be pilot tested with various
      Co-Investigators on the team with experience in qualitative methods, an individual with
      moderate and severe TBI, as well as an existing Mentor. Probes or recursive questioning will
      be used during interviews to explore issues in greater depth and verify the interviewer's
      understanding of the information being collected.34 All interviews will be digitally recorded
      and transcribed verbatim for data analysis. During transcription, any identifying information
      will be removed and the participant will be assigned a coded identifier.

      Quantitative Component: Outcome Measures: Phase 2 For Phase 2, baseline data including
      demographic and descriptive information (e.g., age, sex, severity of injury, marital status),
      as well as the outcomes measures described below, will be captured prior to randomization.
      Follow-up assessments for the outcome measures will occur at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months.
      Participants will have the option to complete their baseline demographic and descriptive
      information and outcome measures as well as their follow-up assessments themselves (i.e.,
      paper-based and mailed back to the research team), by telephone, or on-line via Survey
      MonkeyÂ®.

      Social Participation (Primary Outcome) Social participation will be measured using the CIQ.
      The CIQ is a 15-item questionnaire developed to assess three areas of community
      participation: home integration (four items related to household chores and child care),
      social integration (eight items related to leisure and social networks), and productivity
      (three items related to work and school or volunteer participation).36 The questionnaire
      produces a total score and three subscale scores, with higher scores indicating higher levels
      of social participation. The strengths of the CIQ include its brevity,37,38 orthogonal
      subscales,37 and high test-retest reliability.37 The CIQ is able to discriminate individuals
      with TBI from nondisabled individuals.36

      Mood (Secondary Outcome) Mood (i.e., depressive symptoms) will be measured using the
      nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).39 It is a shorter version of the PHQ and
      contains nine items. It is a self-report measure of severity of symptoms of depression over
      the previous two weeks. Severity levels of symptoms of self-reported depression, as reflected
      in the PHQ-9 total scores, are generally graded as minimal (0-4), mild (5-9), moderate
      (10-14), moderately severe (15-19), and severe (20-27). A score of â‰¥ 10 denotes clinically
      significant self-reported symptoms of depression and has been used previously with the
      individuals with TBI. 39-41

      Health-related Quality of Life (Secondary Outcome) Health-related quality of life will be
      measured using the HRQoL-Short Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12).42 The SF-12 is a shorter
      version of the SF-36. The SF-12 includes a physical component summary and a mental (or
      psychological) component summary, but does not provide information about each of the eight
      dimensions of the SF-36 (i.e., physical functioning, social functioning, physical role,
      emotional role, mental health, vitality, bodily pain, and general health). The lowest
      possible score is 0 and the highest is 100 (where 100 represents best health).43 It has been
      used previously in a TBI population (e.g., Haller et al., 2017).44

      Self-Efficacy (Secondary Outcome) Self-efficacy will be measured using the TBI Self-efficacy
      Questionnaire.45 It contains four subscales including Social, Physical, Cognitive, and
      Emotional, measuring self-efficacy for obtaining help and emotional support, managing
      physical symptoms, managing and compensating for cognitive symptoms, and managing emotional
      symptoms, respectively. Items are rated on a 10-point scale (1=not at all confident to
      10=totally confident). Subscale scores are summed to a total score. Higher scores indicate
      greater self-efficacy. It has demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach Î±=.81-.95).46

      Analysis Plan: Phases 1-3 Qualitative Components: Phases 1 and 3 For Phases 1 and 3, analysis
      will be conducted using inductive thematic analysis as described by Braun and Clark (2006).47
      For Phase 1, the analysis will assess the perceived enablers and barriers to participant
      recruitment, retention, adherence, and data collection, of implementing the selected outcomes
      measures, and of participating in the OBIA Peer Support Program and the trial itself. The
      results from this phase will be used inform and adapt the protocol for Phase 2. For Phase 3,
      the analysis will assess participants' experiences with the intervention and the trial
      protocol itself (i.e., the impact and acceptability of the program itself/intervention and
      the trial protocol itself).

      A subset of the interview transcripts will be initially coded by the Research Coordinator,
      giving full attention to all data. In addition, one of the Principal Investigators will
      independently code this same subset and they will meet to compare their codes. This step will
      allow for enhanced reflexivity and ensured rigour. A coding framework will be developed and
      applied by the Research Coordinator to the remaining transcripts. To facilitate the
      organization and analysis of the qualitative data, the Principal Investigator's/Research
      Coordinator's reflective notes from the interviews, as well as the transcripts, will be
      entered into NVivo 10. Following this, the codes will be clustered into groups or categories
      (i.e., codes that share similar meanings) and the predominant themes will be identified. To
      maximize credibility and trustworthiness, additional members of the research team will meet
      with the Research Coordinator and Principal Investigators over several meetings to discuss
      the developing analysis. New themes will also be discussed. Together, the Research Team will
      explore various thematic maps until consensus is reached and theme labels are agreed upon.
      The Research Coordinator will analyze the remaining data.

      Quantitative Component: Phase 2 Baseline characteristics (e.g., age, sex, severity of injury,
      marital status, etc.) will be described and any differences between the three groups will be
      compared using means/medians and frequencies and proportions. As this is a feasibility study,
      and the ability to collect data is being tested, no data imputation will be performed to
      account for missing data.48 The feasibility of recruitment will be based on whether 60
      participants (i.e., 20 participants in each arm of the trial) can be enrolled in the trial
      during the 6-month recruitment period. The number of individuals who provide informed consent
      per month will also be calculated. The feasibility of retention will be assessed by
      calculating the proportion of participants with complete data on each outcome measure at 6
      weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. To evaluate participant adherence, the proportion of
      twice-weekly and weekly sessions attended by the participants will be calculated. The
      proportion of participants who withdraw from the intervention at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6
      months will be calculated along with the reason(s) for withdrawing. The feasibility threshold
      will be set at &gt;75% for recruitment, retention, and adherence (to the intervention). To
      evaluate changes between groups, the analysis plan will focus on mean change scores and
      confidence intervals (i.e., mixed-design analysis of variance model) for the outcome measures
      described above. Effect sizes will be calculated via Cohen d to reflect the impact of the
      OBIA Peer Support Program on social participation, mood, HRQoL, and self-efficacy.

    <description>The Program matches volunteer Mentors and Partners for a series of one-to-one interactions that focus on the discussion and resolution of problems or issues (i.e., problem solving) related to one or several key topic areas including family and friends, resources, life changes or challenges, (health care) professionals, social/recreational activities, work/employment/training/volunteering, the brain injury itself, emotions or feelings, and other issues.27 Once the match is established, the Mentor and Partner communicate with one another primarily by telephone until the problems or issues are either resolved or a referral to another service is made (i.e., counselling or community support services). For some partnerships, communication by email or video conferencing is used.27 Most telephone calls last between 20 and 40 minutes (personal communication) and are held weekly.</description>
