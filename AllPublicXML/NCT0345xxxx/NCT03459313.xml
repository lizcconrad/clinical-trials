  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term purpose of an on-going participatory action research program &quot;The KLUB-study&quot;
      in Sweden, that involves scientists and representatives from all levels of athletics, is to
      develop a sustainable framework for safe athletics (track and field) training for child
      athletes born 2002-2006. The first part of the research program, a 1-year longitudinal study
      analysing training and injury data, was completed in November 2017. The present study sets
      out to evaluate a website that aims to support coaches and caregivers in their role as adult
      key stakeholders to foster young athletes to become adult athletes who possess the tools to
      maintain a healthy sporting lifestyle.

      The intervention will be implemented in youth athletics and evaluated in a randomised
      controlled trial (RCT). It will follow the consensus guidelines for studies in athletics and
      be reported according to the CONSORT checklist. The participating clubs will be randomly
      allocated into active and control group. The active group will be provided the intervention
      program, i.e. access to a website, aimed to support coaches, caregivers´ and athletes' and
      improve knowledge and health literacy to make more informed choices that promote health. The
      control group will continue to train according to their routines and will get access to the
      website after 4 months.

      The participants will be assessed at three times, at the beginning of the study (T1), after
      four months (T2), at ten months (T3) and additional prospective data on training and injury
      will be collected during the first four months (T1b).

    <description>For this study, the Frisk.Friidrott (Healthy.Athletics/Track&amp;Field) website has been developed. The purpose of the website is to provide an easy-to-use tool that can assist coaches and parents involved in youth athletics with information how to structure training and recovery planning, provide guidance on possible injuries, and provide other information on health for youth athletes.</description>
