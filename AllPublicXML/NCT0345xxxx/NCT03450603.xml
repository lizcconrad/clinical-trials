  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are unfavourable events in the
      course of disease for most COPD patients. Published evidence indicates a significant impact
      of exacerbations, especially if frequent, on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL),
      disease progression, mortality, health care utilisation and costs. However, the
      severity,evolution and outcome of an exacerbation may differ significantly between patients -
      some patients will recover completely in a short period of time while others may die. The
      identification of risk factors for an adverse outcome could help in distinguishing patients
      who require more intense management in order to prevent failures, achieve satisfactory
      recovery and reduce the negative clinical and socioeconomic impact of exacerbations.

    <description>Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is defined as an event in the natural course of the disease characterized by a change in the patient's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum that is beyond normal day to day variations and may have warranted a change in regular medication in a patient with underlying COPD.</description>
