      The primary objective of the Resilience Study is to determine the impact of the Corporate
      Athlete® Resilience product through recalibrating mindset and changing resilience supportive
      behavior.

      Analysis will be performed via Survey and Study Interviews (two methods) to determine how the
      CAR Training recalibrated and impacted the Research Participants mindset and resilience
      state.

      1. Tool: Stress Mindset Measure-General (SMM-G)

      Additional analysis will evaluate participants' engagement in behavior changes in the first
      30 days.

      2. Tool: Energy Management Behaviors.

      Secondary objectives include further analysis to determine if the intervention group
      demonstrated significant improvements in the following measures:

      1. Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)

      2. Public Health Surveillance Wellbeing (PHS-WB)

      3. Sleep Habits (Rand MOS)

      4. Health, Wellbeing and Productivity (SF36, HPQ)

      5. Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI)

      6. Brief Cope

      7. Perceived Stress (PSS)

      In addition, demographic assessments will be collected.

      Methodology: This is an interventional mixed methods (qualitative &amp;amp; quantitative) study,
      with pre-post design for research participants in one session. All participants will be
      measured at two time points: surveys will be collected between 3-weeks to the day of
      intervention for baseline, 1-month post intervention.

      In addition, Qualitative interviews will be conducted on a rolling basis between 3-60 days
      post intervention. The qualitative portion is a semi-structured interview will be conducted
      with the purpose of understanding how participants recalibrated their mindset and impacting
      their resilience behaviors.

      Study Advertisement combined with the Resilience Program Advertisement will be posted by the
      Lake Nona Institute. Potential Research Participants will be self-selected, and will contact
      the Lake Nona Study Coordinator for additional information. The self-selected individuals
      will receive HPI materials via mail, in addition to Study and Resilience Program eligibility
      information.

      Potential Research Participants will undergo Screening and Consenting procedures at the Lake
      Nona Institute. The Research Participant will be required to sign and date a paper based
      Informed Consent Document, and provide additional contact information, such as individual
      email address, phone number etc.

      Enrolled Research Participants will be scheduled to attend the CAR Training Session.

      On the day of the CAR Training, the Research Participants will receive a set of
      questionnaires as part of the Corporate Athlete® Resilience Program (&quot;HPI Questionnaire&quot;), in
      addition to a set of Study Specific Questionnaires (&quot;Study Questionnaire&quot;). A description
      study activities (&quot;Study Guide&quot;) and a description of session activities (&quot;Agenda&quot;) consists
      of the introduction to stress and resilience session, will be distributed to all Research
      Participants.

      30 days following the CAR Training, the Research Participants will receive a follow-up HPI
      questionnaires and a Study questionnaires which will be utilized in the Resilience Research
      Study Analysis.

      3-60 days upon completion of the CAR Training, the Research Participants will be asked to
      complete a Research Study Qualitative Telephone, Video or Face-to-Face Interview (&quot;Study
      Interview&quot;).

    <measure>Brief Resilience Scale (BRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3-weeks to the day of intervention for baseline, 1-month post intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) is a 6-item measure created to assess the ability to bounce back or recover from stress. It is scored by reverse coding items 2, 4, and 6 and finding the mean of the six items. A higher score equals higher resilience.</description>

    <description>The Public Health Surveillance Well-Being Scale (PHS-WB) comprises 10-items guaging self-reported mental, physical, and social components of well-being. Response options for 6 of the items are on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The responses options range from &quot;strongly disagree&quot; to &quot;strongly agree,&quot; &quot;none of the time&quot; to &quot;all of the time,&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; to &quot;excellent.&quot; Three of the items are based on a 10-point Likert-type scale. Response options for the 10-point items range from &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; to &quot;very satisfied.&quot; One item assesses energy/vitality over the past 30 day. The responses for that item ranged from 0 to 30. A score for the PHS-WB scale was created by summing the 10 items for each respondent.</description>

    <description>The MOS Sleep Scale is a 12-item instrument, which measures multiple facets of sleep. The MOS Sleep Scale yields a sleep problems index and six scale scores: sleep disturbance (have trouble falling asleep, how long to fall asleep, sleep was not quiet, awaken during your sleep time, and have trouble falling asleep again), sleep adequacy (get enough sleep to feel rested upon waking in the morning and get amount of sleep needed), daytime somnolence (drowsy during day, have trouble staying awake during the day, and take naps), snoring, awaken short of breath or with headache, and quantity of sleep. Quantity of sleep is scored as the average hours slept per night. The other scales and problems index are scored on a range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating more of the concept being measured.</description>

    <description>The product Corporate Athlete® Resilience Training Program (&quot;CAR Training&quot;), is a one day training program aimed to educate participants about stress management and stress recovery techniques.
The content of the training program is divided into two parts:
Introduction to stress and resilience: an overview of stress and its impact on wellbeing, combined with the definition of resilience and its linking to daily performance.
Introduction and implementation of stress management and resilience techniques: an overview of applicable stress management and resilience tools, combined with real time application methods. These activities aim to help individuals recover and grow from a stressful state into meaningful life engagement. The desired overall effect is better performance at home and at work.</description>
