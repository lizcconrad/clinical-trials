  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Traditional office blood pressure (BP) measurement is often inaccurate and is
      inferior to out-of-office measurements, such as ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),
      in predicting cardiovascular outcomes. A relatively new BP measurement method, called
      Automatic Office Blood Pressure measurement (AOBP), may provide similar BP readings to ABPM
      (latest clinical gold standard for BP measurements) and can easily be conducted in clinics.
      AOBP machines measure BP repeatedly 3-5 times with 1-min intervals and automatically provide
      the mean BP value. While AOBP was used in landmark trials (e.g. SPRINT trial) and was shown
      to eliminate white-coat effect, AOBP is rarely used in Hong Kong partly because there is no
      data concerning the accuracy of AOBP in Chinese. Almost all previous AOBP research used BpTRU
      (AOBP model), but BpTRU manufacturer was shut down permanently.

      Aim: To assess if WatchBP Office (another AOBP model) has superior diagnostic accuracy than
      traditional office BP measurements, when compared to ABPM readings.

      Method: 150 Chinese adult patients with a diagnosis of essential hypertension will be
      recruited consecutively from a Government-funded primary care clinic. All patients will have
      their BP measured by a 48-hour ABPM, a WatchBP office, and two traditional office blood
      pressure measurements.

      ABPM will be considered the gold standard; sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative
      predictive values of AOBP and traditional BP to diagnose elevated BP level, masked
      hypertension and white-coat hypertension will be calculated and compared

      Implication: if WatchBP provides closer BP readings to ABPM, this can lead to its
      implementation in routine clinical practice

    <description>BP measurement: The nurse or assistant will leave the room after confirmed validity and the WatchBP will automatically measure BP for the participant at 1-minute intervals for 3 more readings; previous research showed that accurate BP readings could be obtained using 1-minute intervals. This is also the measuring method suggested by the manufacturer. The machine will automatically calculate the mean BP using the 3 readings. The mean BP value will be used for analysis. The diagnostic cutoff for diagnosing HT will be ≥135/85 for AOBP</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  diagnosis of essential hypertension

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  (i) severe hypertension as defined by clinical systolic BP ≥180 mmHg and/or diastolic
             BP ≥110 mmHg (because they may need emergency treatment and it is unethical to delay
             such treatment due to the proposed project), (ii) inability to provide consent, (iii)
             pregnancy, (iv) night-time occupations (we need to compare AOBP and clinic BP readings
             to daytime ABPM average when the patient should be awake), (v) are occupational
             drivers (because potential dangers in driving could occur when patients are asked to
             remain still), (vi) receiving anti-coagulants (to prevent bruises when using ABPM),
             (vii) with known atrial fibrillation (as ABPMs and AOBP use have not been validated in
             this group)
