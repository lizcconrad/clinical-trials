  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of
      generic imatinib under usual clinical practice in patients of Philadelphia
      chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in chronic phase (CP) in
      Egypt

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An observational, multi-center, prospective cohort study to assess the effectiveness and
      safety of generic Imatinib (Carcemia®) in patients with Ph+ CML who are newly diagnosed or
      patients who will be switched from the reference product (Glivec® ) to Carcemia® where
      treatment will be prescribed by the investigator in accordance with clinical practice where
      no visits or intervention(s) additional to the daily practice will be performed.

      Eligible Ph+ CML patients in both cohorts will be followed up for a total of 18 months.
