      The objective of this study is to describe the feasibility of performing the sentinel node
      technique (Detection rate) in patients with early stage ovarian cancer.

      With this research study it will be evaluated the concordance of the result between two
      diagnostic tests: Sentinel node and Pelvic-para-aortic lymphadenectomy in patients with
      ovarian cancer.
