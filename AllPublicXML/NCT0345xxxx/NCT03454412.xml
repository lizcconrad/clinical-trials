      The aim of the study is to observe the effects of Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation
      System on hand function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation System is a novel multimodal rehabilitation
      approach that combines different treatment modalities. The treatment course lasts for 2 weeks
      with daily therapy up to 4 hours. Main treatment programs include biomechanical correction of
      the spine, extremity joint mobilization, physical and occupational therapy, reflexotherapy,
      special massage system, rhythmical group exercises, mechanotherapy and computer games therapy
      and some other.

      Preliminary observational studies indicate an improvement of gross and fine motor functions
      in children with Cerebral Palsy after the treatment course.

      The aim of the study is to observe the effects of Intensive Neurophysiological Rehabilitation
      System on hand function in children with spastic cerebral palsy.

      About 50 patients with spastic forms of cerebral palsy with mild to moderate impairment of
      hand function (Level I to III according to Manual Abilities Classification System) would be
      evaluated before and after the two-week treatment course.

      This study may help to generate the hypothesis of the effects of the Intensive treatment
      course on hand function abilities and to prepare a future randomized controlled trial.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Jebsen Taylor Hand Functions Test score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2 weeks treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>The Jebsen Hand Function Test assesses hand function activities during performance of activities of daily living. Test quantifies the time it takes for the subject to do the following standardized functional tasks with one hand: turning over cards, picking up small items, simulating feeding, stacking checkers, picking up light cans, and picking up heavy cans.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in manual dexterity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2 weeks treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>Manual dexterity is evaluated using Box and Blocks test. The score is the number of blocks carried by hand from one compartment to the other in one minute.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the ABILHAND-Kids score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after 2 weeks treatment course</time_frame>
    <description>ABILHAND-Kids is a measure of manual ability for children with upper limb impairments. The scale measures a person's ability to manage daily activities that require the use of the upper limbs. The Parent is asked to fill in the questionnaire by estimating their child's performance of 21 manual activities on a 3-level scale (impossible, difficult, easy).</description>
