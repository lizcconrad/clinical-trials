  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that aims to better understand the genetic causes of
      frontotemporal degeneration (FTD), Multiple Systems Atrophy (MSA), and Progressive
      Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). It is hoped the information gathered in this study will help lead
      to better diagnostics and future treatments.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Comparative and longitudinal studies reveal clinical differences between subgroups of
      patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), including Progressive Non-fluent Aphasia (PNFA),
      Semantic Dementia (SD), patients with a disorder of social comportment and personality (SOC),
      and non-aphasic patients with executive dysfunction (EXEC). MRI studies of cortical atrophy
      and fMRI studies show correlated neural defects in FTD subgroups. We will obtain converging
      evidence from multiple sources to test hypotheses about the neural basis for cognitive
      functions such as semantic memory, grammatical processing, and social functioning in these
      FTD subgroups, while we improve clinical care for these patients. Recent studies have linked
      progressive supra nuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple systems atrophy (MSA) to FTD. We will
      obtain comparable neuropsychological and biomarker data in order to compare these patient
      groups.

    <time_frame>Baseline and every 2-3 months until subject withdraws or study ends</time_frame>
    <description>We will continue our studies of language and cognition in FTD, PSP, and MSA to help distinguish these patients from Alzheimer's disease (AD), while expanding our longitudinal protocol. We will collect longitudinal MRI data and enlarge our protocol to include social assessments of fully developed FTD, PSP, and MSA. We hypothesize that social disorders progress longitudinally in a manner resembling the decline of language.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate sources of impaired semantic memory in Semantic Dementia (SD).</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 2-3 months until subject withdraws or study ends</time_frame>
    <description>Our model of semantic memory includes at least 2 components: Feature knowledge represented in semantic memory; and processes like categorization that use these features to make semantic decisions. We hypothesize that the diagnostic value of a feature will be consistently degraded in SD, and voxel-based morphometric (VBM) analyses of MRI cortical atrophy will correlate this deficit with left ventral temporal atrophy. Functional imaging studies will be used to assess the impact of cortical atrophy on language processing. Topics investigated will include semantic, phonological, and sentence-level processing. Relative to healthy seniors, fMRI will show limited left ventral temporal recruitment in SD during judgments of diagnostic semantic features.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>. Investigate sources of effortful speech in Progressive Nonfluent Aphasia (PNFA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 2-3 months until subject withdraws or study ends</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical hallmark of PNFA is effortful speech. This may be due to a deficit in word formation and articulation associated with speech errors, or a deficit in grammatical processing that also impairs comprehension. Empirical studies of effortful speech are rare. We hypothesize 2 PNFA subgroups, determined by a quantitative analysis of a semi-structured speech sample and expression and recognition studies of past tense morphology. We will relate this to cortical atrophy seen on MRI and fMRI studies of verb past tense inflection. One PNFA subgroup will have verb omissions and deficits with past tense formation related to left inferior frontal disease (BA 45/47). fMRI will relate past tense inflection deficits to poor left inferior frontal activation in PNFA. Other PNFA patients will have dysarthria with phonemic speech errors due to left frontal opercular and anterior insula disease.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Investigate social disinhibition and rule violation in FTD</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 2-3 months until subject withdraws or study ends</time_frame>
    <description>A disorder of social comportment in the SOC subgroup of FTD includes poor inhibition, cheating, and limited insight into their own behavior. We hypothesize that this social disorder is due to interruption of a large-scale neural network that includes social knowledge, and domain-specific processing resources such as inhibitory control. We expect that the social disorder in these patients is due to interruption of this network. We will test whether VBM studies of MRI relate social disinhibition to right medial orbital frontal atrophy and degraded social knowledge to anterior prefrontal atrophy. fMRI will show limited right frontal activation for social judgments in SOC patients.</description>

    <ipd_description>The University of Pennsylvania is a participant in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center 's FTLD-NACC initiative to create a national database of data specific to FTD spectrum diseases.The FTLD NACC initiative will enable research centers focusing on FTD spectrum diseases to gather standardized data on their FTLD patients, all of which will be combined into a single database and made freely available to researchers around the world.
The FTLD-NACC collects data standardly obtained in this study, including neurocognitive assessments, MRI imaging data, and biomarkers collected through lumbar puncture and blood draw.The FTLD-NACC is designed to facilitate collaborative research and will allow researchers to maximize the use of clinical information and biological material available on frontotemporal degenerative spectrum diseases. Subjects will be able to choose whether or not their research data is shared with the FTD-NACC.</ipd_description>
