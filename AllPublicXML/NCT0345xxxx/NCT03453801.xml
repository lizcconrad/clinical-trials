      This is a Phase IV study of up to 100 healthy children, ages 6 months to 10 years of age, who
      will receive either Flumist® live, attenuated influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent (LAIV4)
      or the current Fluzone® inactivated influenza vaccine, quadrivalent (IIV4). The volunteers
      will be enrolled into one of 3 Groups (A, B, C). Volunteers will return each year until
      2018-2019 for annual flu immunizations and study visits. Questionnaires will be administered
      annually to record demographic characteristics, vaccination history, exposure to animals, day
      care and medically attended illness. There are no exclusions for gender, ethnicity or race.

      Volunteers in Group C will also receive the measles, mumps, rubella and varicella (MMRV)
      vaccine at approximately 12-15 months of age (to be administered by the volunteers' personal
      pediatrician, not as a study vaccine). They will then come for a study visit to collect blood
      60 days later.

      Each twin is counted as a single participant. All reporting numbers reflect the number of
      participants, not the number of twin pairs.

    <description>Group A Monozygotic twins, 2-5 yo (annual return): Individual twin participants will be given FluMist® a live, attenuated influenza vaccine quadrivalent (LAIV4) intranasally. Vaccine non-naive participants will return annually for flu immunization and for blood samples on Days 0, 7 and 60 post-immunization. Vaccine naive children will receive two immunizations in the first year, 28 days apart then return annually for flu immunization. Blood samples will be obtained on Days 0, 7 and 60 post second-immunization.
