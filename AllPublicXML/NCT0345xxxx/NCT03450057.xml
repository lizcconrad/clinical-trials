      This study will evaluate the effects of Daratumumab with dexamethasone in subjects with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and renal impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single arm, open-label phase 2 study. Approximately 38 subjects will
      be enrolled to receive daratumumab + dexamethasone. Treatment cycles have duration of 28
      days. Subjects will receive treatment until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity
      or for a maximum of 30 months. Drug administration and follow-up visits will occur more
      frequently for early cycles (weekly for the first 8 weeks, every two weeks for weeks 9-24 and
      then every 4 weeks). Disease evaluations will occur monthly and will involve mainly
      measurements of myeloma proteins. Other assessments may include bone marrow examinations,
      skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum
      calcium corrected for albumin, and β2- microglobulin and albumin.
