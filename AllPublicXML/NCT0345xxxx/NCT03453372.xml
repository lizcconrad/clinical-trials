    <textblock>
      A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of
      magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) in the treatment of pain caused
      by knee osteoarthritis (OA)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common, disabling, and costly disease, and the knee is one of the
      most affected joints. The predominant symptom is pain. Effective and lasting non-invasive
      treatment approaches are missing. MR-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRgFUS) is a new
      minimally invasive technique which may represent a valid solution providing several
      advantages. The primary aim of this work will be to assess the efficacy of MRgFUS in the
      treatment of pain caused by knee OA in 80 patients candidate for arthroplasty in a
      prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Different
      parameters related to pain, quality of life, function, and imaging will be collected and
      analyzed in a 12-month follow-up. The secondary aims will be focused on a) the evaluation of
      the effects on the joint organ and changes of biological features in response to MRgFUS, and
      b) the impact of selective ablation of nociceptors on OA pain, based on the analysis of
      resected joint tissues.

    <masking_description>Participating patients will be blinded to treatment assignment and to the ongoing results of the study; they will remain blinded to their assignment throughout the study period. All the staff involved in the pre- and post-treatment evaluation of patients will be also blinded. The evaluation of patients will be performed by physicians not involved in the treatment to ensure double blinding.</masking_description>
