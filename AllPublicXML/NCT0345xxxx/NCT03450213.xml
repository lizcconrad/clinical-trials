  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a bilateral (but usually asymmetrical) non-inflammatory progressive thinning
      process of the cornea. It manifests as characteristic cone-like ectasia of the cornea
      associated with irregular stromal thinning, resulting in a cone-like bulge , which causing
      irregular astigmatism and vision impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, with an incidence of 50-230 per
      100,000 persons.Pentacam used diagnose &amp; detect the progression in patients with keratoconus
      and also provide a detailed information about corneal tomography and topography.

      In the last few years, it has been shown that in healthy individuals the posterior corneal
      surface has not only a different amount of astigmatism but also a different alignment of the
      steep meridian.

      The aim of this research is to compare the amount and axis alignment of anterior and
      posterior corneal astigmatism in keratoconus with a healthy controlled group .
