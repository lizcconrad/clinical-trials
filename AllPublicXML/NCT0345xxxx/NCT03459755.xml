  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that reduction in advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)
      is associated with the beneficial regulation of receptor for AGE (RAGE) mediated tumor
      response which may correlate with improved quality of life in PCa survivors. AGEs are
      produced by the body and are affected by lifestyle, weight and diet.

    <description>Patients will have a baseline assessment by undergoing a maximal exercise testing protocol.
For 12 weeks, patients will participate in an exercise session 3 days per week
The patient will then enter a 12 week &quot;Step Down&quot; program in which the number of sessions is decreased to every week, then every 3 weeks.
After the second 12-week period, the patient will enter a 28-week follow up period of unsupervised exercise.</description>
