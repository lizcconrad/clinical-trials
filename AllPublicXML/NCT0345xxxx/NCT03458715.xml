  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population of type 2 diabetes increased enormously worldwide. As disease progression,
      uncontrolled type 2 diabetes patients need multiple daily insulin injections, but the risk of
      body weight gain and hypoglycemia will increase. In recent years, the newly oral
      anti-hypoglycemic agents developed, such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) and
      sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). The former indirectly stimulate insulin
      secretion and suppress glucagon through increase incretin. The later inhibit re-absorption of
      blood glucose in proximal renal tubule to improve hyperglycemia. According to the guideline
      published in 2017 by American diabetes Associations, if patients received premix insulin
      injections twice daily and their glycemic control can't meet the target, increase the
      frequency of injection such as basal bolus would be considered. However, it is difficult for
      some patients and it may cause more hypoglycemia and gain of body weight. Because previous
      report revealed dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2
      inhibitors added to insulin resulted in better glycemic control, but there was no direct
      comparison, so we design this study to observe the efficacy of these two drugs in
      uncontrolled diabetes patient received twice daily insulin injections.
