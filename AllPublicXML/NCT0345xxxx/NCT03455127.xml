      Preliminary pilot testing of the home-based FSI-ECD intervention as delivered by community
      based lay workers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Family Strengthening Intervention for early childhood development was created and piloted
      for feasibility and acceptability in an ongoing protocol #15440 with Harvard Internal Review
      Board titled, &quot;Developing and Piloting a Quantitative Behavioral Assessment Battery,
      Estimating Prevalence of Mental Disability among HIV/AIDS-affected Youth, and Piloting an
      Adapted Mental Health Intervention for HIV/AIDS-Affected Children in Rwanda.&quot; Research
      personnel have been adapting the existing recruitment materials/sessions and 15 Module Manual
      (FSI-ECD) with a focus on making the manual and corresponding materials more user friendly
      for community based lay worker &quot;coaches.&quot;

      This preliminary testing will provide an opportunity to administer a planned full scale
      1,000+ household cluster randomized control trial on a smaller scale in order to learn from
      our materials that have been adapted for community based lay workers. This will also allow us
      to test our supervision and training structures to make necessary adaptation ahead of the
      planned full scale trial.

      After all beneficiary households have completed the FSI-ECD intervention, each community
      based lay worker will complete a qualitative and quantitative exit assessment of his/her
      experience delivering the intervention, as well as ongoing feedback during the administration
      of FSI-ECD; allowing for the intervention and support structure to be strengthened for future
      iterations.

    <description>Half of the sample will be eligible to receive or be receiving the Government of Rwanda's (GOR) flagship social protection programming, Vision 2020 Program (VUP). One component of this program is to provide cash for work opportunities for labor endowed vulnerable households, i.e. one able bodied adult. Vulnerable households are those in Poverty Level 1 category, the GOR's poverty classification system. Furthermore, this study will require households in the control group receiving classic public works as usual to have at least one child between the ages of 6 months to 36 months.</description>

    <description>Half of the sample will receive the FSI ECD home visiting parenting program alongside the GOR's classic public works programming. These households will be in Poverty Level 1 with an able-bodied adult, thus eligible to receive or be received the GORs public works programming. They will have a child between 6 and 36 months at enrollment. Households will be visited by a trained community based lay worker on a weekly to biweekly basis to deliver the 15 module curriculum covering a range of topics from nutrition, water and sanitation, hygiene, early stimulation, conflict management, to good communication. The intervention seeks to promote healthy child development via active coaching to individual beneficiary households, delivering modules on a one on one basis and engaging all family members.</description>
