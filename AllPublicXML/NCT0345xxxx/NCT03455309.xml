  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to further evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a candidate S.
      aureus vaccine NDV-3A, as well as its efficacy against acquisition of S. aureus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety,
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of candidate vaccine NDV-3A (NovaDigm Therapeutics, Inc.) to
      prevent incident nasal acquisition of S. aureus among a population of military recruits at
      increased risk for S. aureus colonization and disease. Colonization is a risk factor for skin
      and soft tissue infection (SSTI), and the anterior nares is an important reservoir for S.
      aureus. Use of S. aureus nasal colonization (specifically, incident nasal colonization with
      S. aureus post-vaccination) as a primary endpoint will allow the investigators to pursue a
      statistically-valid and meaningful parameter related to S. aureus SSTI. The proposed trial
      may yield evidence to warrant evaluation of NDV-3A efficacy against SSTI in a large-scale,
      Phase 2/3 trial in this high risk population.
