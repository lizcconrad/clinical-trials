  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to administer music therapy to patients in the pediatric
      intensive care unit (PICU) in order to observe how music affects patient agitation, vital
      signs, and overall recovery in the unit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled study to observe patients who have been
      admitted to the PICU with an altered state of agitation according to the Richmond Agitation
      Sedation Scale (RASS). These patients will be administered music therapy during a controlled
      setting in the day to observe whether the introduction of music therapy helps reduce the
      patient's level of agitation, improving their vital signs and overall recovery in the unit.
      Once patients are enrolled and have signed consents, patients will receive a headset with
      music or dead air. Therapy times will be selected so that there are minimal disruptions.
      Total time will be 2 hours daily, once in the morning and once in the evening. The treatments
      for session 1 and session 2 of the day will be the same (i.e. Music/ Music, No music/No
      Music).

      The investigators hypothesize that applying music therapy in the PICU will decrease
      agitation, length of stay, and narcotic administration, and normalize heart rate, respiratory
      rate, and blood pressure.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) is a medical scale used to measure the agitation or sedation level of a patient. The scale measures patient agitation and sedation +4 to -5, with a score of 0 equal to an alert and calm patient, a positive score equal to various levels of aggression, and a negative score equal to various levels of sedation. Patients receive one score for one observed time point. Therefore, a patient will have one score from +4 to -5. For the purpose of this study, a better outcome will be a score that is around 0 or that decreases from a higher positive score to a lower positive score. The investigators hypothesize that music therapy will decrease agitation in patients and decrease their positive RASS score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bispectral Index (BIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Bispectral Index provides a direct measure of the effects of sedatives on the brain. It is an algorithm developed by Aspect Medical Systems that measures EEG after the administration of anesthetic agents and is measure on a BIS monitor. The BIS monitor reports a single number from 0 to 100 that represents an integrated measure of cerebral electrical activity. This is interpreted into a patient's level of alertness. A score of 100 indicates that the patient is fully awake, while a number less than 40 is suggestive of a deep hypnotic effect. For the purpose of this study, the investigators are using the BIS to measure the level of alertness in a patient. The investigators hypothesize that the administration of music therapy with have a sedative effect on patients, thereby decreasing their BIS number.</description>
