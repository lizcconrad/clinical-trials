      This is a comprehensive randomized cluster hand-hygiene improvement intervention to reduce:
      self-reported acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) / influenza-like-illness (ILI) and
      gastrointestinal (GI) illness, absenteeism, presenteeism; and related behavioral and
      attitudinal change over a 90 day trial. The Intervention group will receive hand hygiene
      supplies, and a variety of educational materials, including environmental posters in common
      areas. The control group will perform their usual hygiene activities and will not receive an
      intervention.

      Identical weekly surveys will be administered to the intervention and control groups to
      measure self-reported illness, absenteeism, presenteeism, along with behavior and attitudes
      measured at specified intervals during the study. The intervention and control groups were
      randomized by work floors before the onset of the enrollment period. It is hypothesized that
      employees in the intervention group will experience reduced self-reported illness,
      absenteeism and presenteeism along with improved protective hygiene behaviors and related
      attitudes, relative to those in the control group over the 90-day trial.

    <textblock>
      The annual costs of seasonal influenza in the United States have been estimated at $87.1
      billion, while costs from the common cold have been estimated at $40 billion. Office
      employees are at increased risk for contracting communicable disease at work, since they
      spend nearly half of their waking hours in this setting, work in close proximity with each
      other, and share equipment. Furthermore, employers in the U.S. have a compelling interest to
      reduce the spread of infectious disease, because they pay for the direct and indirect costs
      of absenteeism in employee wages, replacement of staff, reduced quality of services, rising
      health care premiums, and if self-insured, direct health care expenditures.

      Hand hygiene is the single most important action to reduce the transmission of pathogens that
      result in healthcare acquired infections. Moreover, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette
      have been recommended as primary non-pharmaceutical strategies in the early stages of an
      epidemic before a suitable vaccine is available. While influenza vaccine uptake is the most
      important recommendation to prevent influenza, the vaccine only protects against 3 or 4 of
      the most prevalent circulating strains in a given flu season and does not provide protection
      against non-influenza viral and bacterial pathogens. Meta-analysis has shown that numerous
      community intervention studies in schools, daycare, and private homes have reduced illness
      from infectious disease by 21-31%.

      Despite the enormous burdens from communicable disease and the importance of the workplace as
      a setting for the potential spread of infections, to date, only four randomized control
      trials have been performed world-wide among office-based employees to assess the efficacy of
      hand hygiene interventions to reduce the spread of communicable disease, including acute
      respiratory infections (ARI), influenza-like illness (ILI) and gastrointestinal infections.
      Collectively, these interventions have shown promising results. Hubner and colleagues (2010)
      found a 65% reduction in the odds of contracting the common cold among workers with improved
      hand hygiene in a public administrative setting in Germany while Savolainen-Kopra and
      colleagues (2012) found a reduction in infectious illness among office employees in Finland
      who participated in a study arm that utilized soap and water and educational training. In the
      U.S., Stedman-Smith and colleagues (2015) found a 31% significant reduction in self-reported
      ARI / ILI and gastrointestinal illness combined in a multi-modal hand hygiene pilot
      randomized cluster trial among office employees at a Midwestern government center. While,
      Arbogast and colleagues (2016) found a significant reduction in health care claims for
      communicable infections spread by hand-to-mouth modes of transmissions over a 13-month,
      multi-component hand hygiene trial which utilized education, hand sanitizer and disinfectant
      wipes.

      This is a comprehensive non-pharmaceutical randomized cluster hygiene improvement
      intervention to reduce self-reported acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) /
      influenza-like-illness (ILI) and gastrointestinal (GI) illness, absenteeism, and presenteeism
      over a 90-day trial. The Intervention group will receive hygiene supplies (hand sanitizer,
      surface disinfectant wipes, tissues) and educational materials in varied mediums, including
      brief educational videos, and motivational posters hung in common work areas, in addition to
      hand sanitizer, along with hand sanitizer and surface disinfectant wipes installed in shared
      work areas. The control group will perform their usual hygiene activities and will not
      receive an intervention. Predominate pathways for the spread of ARI/ILI and non-foodborne GI
      infections include: (1) droplets that land on the nose, mouth, or are inhaled from infected
      persons' who cough, sneeze or talk; or (2) pathogens on hands contaminated from fomites or
      from touching infected persons, which come in contact with portals of entry including the
      mouth and nose. This multi-modal intervention is developed to promote improvements in the
      performance of protective behaviors that will reduce the spread of pathogens for ARI/ILI and
      GI infections by minimizing exposure from these two common pathways.

      Identical weekly surveys will be administered to the intervention and control groups to
      measure self-reported illness, absenteeism and presenteeism; related behavior and attitudinal
      beliefs will be included in the surveys at specified longer intervals during the study. A
      sub-analysis will be performed to determine if those at high-risk for complications resulting
      in severe morbidity and mortality from infections show a reduction in self-reported
      infections, absenteeism and presenteeism. The intervention and control groups were randomized
      by work floors before the onset of the enrollment period.

      It is hypothesized that employees in the intervention group will experience reduced
      self-reported illness, absenteeism and presenteeism along with improved protective hygiene
      behaviors, and attitudinal beliefs relative to those in the control group over the 90-day
      trial. Statistical analysis will be performed to determine if a relative reduction in
      self-reported communicable infections, absenteeism, and presenteeism, along with the
      improvement of related behaviors and attitudinal beliefs occurred among members in the
      intervention group relative to the control group over the 90-day trial. Statistical analysis
      will include the use of multiple imputation to impute missing variables, and the calculation
      of incidence rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Incident rate ratios will be
      calculated using generalized linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution and a log link
      function that will be adjusted for potential confounders and intercluster correlation.

    <measure>Reduction in ARI/ILI/GI infections as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>The content in this measurement item has demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in a previous study from a scale that does not have a formal title, utilized by Stedman-Smith, DuBois and Grey (2012). The scale measures whether or not participants have had self-reported (1) acute respiratory tract / influenza-like infections (ARI/ILI) or (2) gastrointestinal (GI) infections with definitions used from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Measurements will occur baseline, and once per week for 12 successive weeks until the end of the trial. The number of all self-reported infections during the 3-month trial will be counted, combined and summed in the intervention and the control groups; each sum will be used to compute incidence rates and an incidence rate ratio with a 95% confidence interval (CI).</description>

    <measure>Reduction in Absenteeism as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Survey measurements will occur at baseline, and once per week for 12 successive weeks until the end of the trial. The content in this measurement item has demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in a previous study from a scale that does not have a formal title, utilized by Stedman-Smith, DuBois and Grey (2012). The item contains a 6-point scale from zero days lost (0) to more than 5 days lost (6). The question was slightly adapted to add the response option of missing ½ day of work. The total number of lost work-days will be counted and summed from the 12 weekly surveys in the intervention and control group. Incidence rates and an incidence rate ratio with a 95% confidence interval will be calculated. Person days observed for this measurement will exclude holidays and weekends to match the intent of the survey regarding missed scheduled work-days.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in Presenteeism as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Survey measurements will occur at baseline and once per week for 12 successive weeks until the end of the trial. This measurement is based upon 3 items on the Stanford Presenteeism Scale (SPS). Each of the 3 items are measured on a scale of 1-5 points from strongly agree (1 point) to strongly disagree (5 points). The original SPS construct measured these same items from a scale of strongly disagree to strongly agree; we have modified this in order to be consistent with the order of the rest of the questions in our survey, which range from positive to negative responses. The higher the number of points, the greater the degree of presenteeism (symptoms of illness while working). The mean score for presenteeism will be calculated in the intervention and control groups; the mean differences in the two groups will be compared, along with a 95% CI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reduction in ARI/ILI/GI Infections among those at Highest Risk for Complications as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis will be performed on a sub-set of employees who respond affirmatively to a question, which inquires if participants have been diagnosed with one or more listed chronic conditions. The conditions increase the risk of complications from ARI/ILI or GI infections. The content in the measurement item to assess the number of ARI/ILI/GI infections has demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in a previous study from a scale that does not have a formal title, utilized by Stedman-Smith, DuBois and Grey (2012). The scale measures whether or not participants have had self-reported (1) ARI/ILI or (2) GI infections using definitions from the CDC. Survey measurements will occur at baseline and weekly for 12 weeks. The number of self-reported infections during the 3-month trial will be counted, combined, and summed in the intervention and control groups; incidence rates and an incident rate ratio will be calculated with a 95% CI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Hygiene Behaviors as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Survey items will be measured at the baseline; middle and conclusion of the study. Improvement in self-reported hand hygiene behaviors will be measured by a construct of seven items; the construct was part of a survey that does not have a formal title, which demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability from previous research by Stedman-Smith et al. (2012). The items contain a scale of 5 rankings from always (1) to never (5). Higher scores indicate more protective practices. Improvement in the use of hand sanitizer disinfectant wipes will be measured by a newly created item that measures the self-reported frequency of usage on a scale of 0-5, ranging from 2 or more times a day (5) to never (0). Higher scores indicate more protective self-reported hygiene practices. Mean scores will be calculated in the intervention group and in the control group and the two groups will be compared by mean differences.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Improvement in Hygiene-Related Attitudinal Beliefs as Self-Reported in Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement will occur at the baseline; middle and end of the study. Survey items measure constructs on a scale of 1-5 from strongly agree to strongly disagree: perceived beliefs about the benefits of performing protective hygiene behaviors; perceived employer and co-worker norms about hygiene behaviors; and perceived control beliefs about performing hygiene behaviors. Higher scores indicate stronger positive beliefs. Six of the nine constructs have demonstrated acceptable validity and reliability in a survey that does not have a formal title, created by Stedman-Smith et al. (2012). Three items were created regarding the use of disinfectant surface wipes and perceptions about environmental cleanliness. All survey items consist of a scale from 1-5, ranging from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (5). Higher scores indicate more positive beliefs. Mean scores will be calculated in the intervention and control groups, and mean differences will be compared.</description>
