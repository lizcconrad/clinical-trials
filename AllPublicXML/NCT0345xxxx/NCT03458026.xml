    <textblock>
      By this project, the investigators are going to try to demonstrate that to use objects
      connected to make a physical activity can have an impact on the clinical activity of the
      disease by bringing the subjects which present a spondyloarthritis to make a physical
      activity. The investigators shall show furthermore, than the use of connected objects also
      has better chances to glue the patients presenting a spondyloarthritis to a practice of
      regular physical activity that a simple recommendation.

      This project is aimed at subjects with Axial Spondyloarthritis and / or peripheral of the
      Alpes Maritimes and more specifically of the city of Nice and its surroundings. The subjects
      will be recruited by the hospital doctors (consultations, hospitalization). Patients will
      benefit from an inclusion visit in order to explain the protocol, sign the study consent and
      eliminate a possible contraindication to physical activity. Knowing that this is a physical
      activity adapted to the health of people and their physical abilities.

At the end of 12 weeks the connected watch will be deprived of them as well as SMS (text messages). They will have to realize an activity in autonomy during 12 weeks.
At the end of the twenty-fourth week, they will get back their watch. They will have in more 1 session with a coach and 2 sessions to be made in autonomy during 12 weeks.
In 36 week, they return the watch and finish the study.</description>
