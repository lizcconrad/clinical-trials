      To evaluate visual outcomes of a segmental refractive multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) after
      cataract surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This prospective, nonrandomized noncomparative case series investigates the visual
      performance after bilateral implantation of a segmental refractive multifocal intraocular
      lenses (IOL) after cataract surgery and was performed at the department of Ophthalmology,
      Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

      Methods: Fifty eyes (25 patients) were included. Inclusion criteria were bilateral cataract,
      age &gt; 45 years, corneal astigmatism ≤ 0.75 D postoperatively, pupil size 3 to 6 mm (mesopic),
      and center shift &lt; 1 mm (Pentacam). Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgeries,
      amblyopia or potential postoperative distance-corrected visual acuity (DCVA) &lt; 0.3 logMAR,

      Intervention or Observation: Uncorrected (UCVA) and DCVA in 4 m, 80 cm, 40 cm; contrast
      sensitivity (CS) under photopic and mesopic conditions; reading skills (Radner Reading
      Charts); defocus curve, questionnaire on optical quality (OQ) and spectacle independence were
      assessed after 3 months.

      Main Outcome Measures: At 3 months postoperatively, UCVA and DCVA in 4 m, 80 cm, 40 cm
      (logMAR); defocus curves; CS; reading skills; and OQ questionnaire results.
