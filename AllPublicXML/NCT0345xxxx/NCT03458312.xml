  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas (HGG) experience a complex symptom burden
      including high-levels concerns.

      As a consequence to this life-threatening disease, the rely on close contact with a
      specialized neuro-oncological team as well as support and practical assistance from their
      families. However, multidimensional burden of caregivers has been reported.

      CARES seeks to facilitate and activate the existing resources within the patient and the
      network using a new model of systematic family care approach.

      Specialized neuro-oncological nurses are responsible for an expanded area providing an
      opportunity for the nursing profession to establish a new model of nursing care. This may not
      only benefit the patients and their families but also contribute to strengthen the nurses'
      professional identity and support further development of neuro-oncological specialist team.

      Objectives To explore the feasibility and benefits of a 'Nurse-led Family and Network
      Consultation' (FNC) that seek to identify and address patients' symptoms/concerns and
      caregiver burden on one side and identify the resources and opportunities to ease their
      burdens on the other side.

      To explore the impact of these nurse consultations on the nurses' perception of autonomy,
      self-esteem, and confidence, representing their professional identity.

      Methods This is a feasibility study in two parts: 1) a sample of patients with HGG (n=30) and
      their caregivers (n=30) recruited for informing the study about the family function, support
      and caregiver burden and 2) a sample of patients with HGG (n=30) and their caregivers (n=30)
      recruited for intervention group (IG) with 'Nurse-led Family and Network Consultations' using
      pretest and posttest measures.

      Part two applies a Mixed Method convergent design with a QUAL + QUAN design.

      Nursing BA students at Metropolitan University College will carry out affiliated bachelor
      projects within CARES.

      Theoretical framework Biopsychosocial Model International Classification of Functioning,
      Disability and Health (ICF) Use of narratives within neuro-oncology Feedback models and goal
      setting Symptom management theory The integrated Framework of Family System Nursing; Calgary
      Model Model of levels of personal and professional change

      Intervention: FNC IG will receive four family consultations over 52 weeks relying on the
      Calgary model and Patient-reported outcome on symptom management and concerns.

      Measurements

      Test time points:

      Post 1. FNC (week 1-2), post FNC 2 (week 8-10) and post FNC 3 (week 28-30) and post the 4.
      FNC (week 50-52).

      Part 1, questionnaires for cohort patients (n=30) and caregivers:

      The Caregiver Burden Scale (only caregivers) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
      (HADS),(only caregivers)

      The ICE Family Perceived Support Questionnaire (ICE-FPSQ) (caregiver and patient,
      individually) Psychometric development of the Iceland-Expressive Family Functioning
      Questionnaire (ICE-EFFQ) (caregiver and patient, individually)

      Part 2, questionnaires for IG patients (n=30):

      The M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumour Module (before FNC) HADS The Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) ICE-FPSQ ICE-EFFQ

      Questionnaires for IG family members (n=30):

      The Caregiver Burden Scale HADS ICE-FPSQ ICE-EFFQ

      Material from the FNC Written resume of each consultation (n=120)

      Interviews:

      Semi-structured telephone interviews with IG patients (n=30) and IG family member (n=30) post
      FNC 2 and post FNC 4 Focus group interview with project nurses post FNC 5 (n= 5 nurses)

      Analysis The MDASI-BT, HADS, FACT-Br, the ICE-EFFQ, the ICE-FPSQ and Caregiver burden scale
      to be analysed separately.

      Thematic analyses of interviews, field notes and resume according to Braun and Clarke.

      The Mixed Methods analytic approach is interpretive integration, which merges, compares,
      contradicts and discusses the data sets in order to achieve analytic integration in
      meta-inference.

      Time schedule May 2017 - December 2017: The preparatory phase February 2018 -August 2019:
      Cohort data collection March 2018- July 2018: Education of the project nurses August 2018 -
      February 2020: Intervention (1-year intervention with 6 months recruitment)

      Clinical and research implications New model of care in expanded nurse-led consultations
      relying on FNC may be powerful way to facilitate strategies to improve symptom management,
      emotional well-being and reduce concerns among families.

      This study will take at neurosurgical department and oncological department at Copenhagen
      University Hospital, Rigshospitalet in cooperation with neuro-oncological specialist team.

    <description>Changes in Symptoms will be reported. Each symptom is rated on a 0-10 scale (0 = ''not present'' and 10 = ''as bad as you can imagine'') over the past 24 hours. Six interference items assessing symptom-related interference in general activity, mood, work (including work around the house), relations with other people, walking, and enjoyment of life also are included in the MDASI.

    <time_frame>At week 1-2, week 8-10, week 28-30 and week 50-52</time_frame>
    <description>The self-reported quality of life related to brain cancer is measured by FACT-G. It comprises 4 sub-scales: physical well-being (PWB), social/family well-being (SWB), emotional well-being (EWB) and functional wellbeing (FWB), on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Moreover, the brain cancer sub-scale (BrCS) reflects issues specific for brain cancer. The highest possible score is 28 for the PWB, SWB and FWB subscales, 24 for the EWB subscale and 184 for the BrCS. FACT-Br total score is the sum of the 4 sub-scales (of the core instrument). The FACT-G total score provides a summary of the overall HRQOL across the group of patients [range 0-108] and the FACT-Br Trial Outcome Index [range 0-132] is a summary index of physical/functional outcomes. The higher the score, the better HRQOL.</description>
