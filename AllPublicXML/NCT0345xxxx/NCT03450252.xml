  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to assess the acute effects of a pacemaker on reducing
      abnormally high intracavity pressures in the hearts of patients with mid-cavity obstructive
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). During a 12-month period of double-blinded follow-up,
      descriptive data will be collected on patients symptomatic and physical performance during
      dichotomous pacemaker settings for 6-months each (active and back-up). The statistical
      information collected will be used to design a much larger research trial of patient benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease, affecting 1 in
      500 of the general population. It is characterised by abnormal thickening of the heart
      muscle. The various patterns of thickening of the muscle in the main pumping chamber, or left
      ventricle (LV), can result in obstruction to blood flow within the heart, raising the
      pressures in the heart and placing extra strain on the heart muscle.

      The obstruction can cause patients to suffer from symptoms such as shortness of breath and
      chest pain, along with poor exercise tolerance, and dizzy spells. In very symptomatic
      patients with the commonest type of obstruction, invasive procedures performed either via an
      open-heart or keyhole operation can reduce the increased basal septal muscle mass at the
      point of obstruction. However, in around 1 in 10 HCM patients, the obstruction is deep within
      the LV where a ring of thick muscle blocks blood flow when it contracts. These patients
      provide a challenge for doctors, as this type of obstruction is much less suitable for open
      heart or keyhole operation.

      An alternative is to use a cardiac pacemaker to alter the timing of the contraction in the
      ring of thick muscle such that different parts of the ring contract at different times and
      thereby reduce obstruction to blood flow. The investigators' early experience with this new
      treatment shows that carefully placing the pacemaker wires can reduce the obstruction and
      improve patient symptoms.

      Key questions of this research include:

        -  How much can optimal ventricular pacing reduce the obstruction by?

        -  How important is choosing which part of the heart the pacemaker activates first?

        -  Does reducing obstruction in this way make patients better in the short and long term?

    <intervention_model_description>Taking part in this study will involve recording the information at a pre-implant visit, a visit for cardiac pacemaker implantation and follow-up visits six and twelve months later.
At the pre-implant visit, participants will undergo assessment of symptoms, physical performance and blood test for a protein, Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP).
During the pacemaker implantation, the investigators will record the pressures within the heart using a catheter during both active pacing and back-up pacing settings.
The day after the pacemaker implant participants will undergo double-blind randomisation into either the treatment or non-treatment arm (active or back-up pacing respectively). At six months, cross-over takes place with assessment as above, before device reprogramming into either the treatment or non-treatment arm depending on which was completed first.
At the end of the second six month period, participants will undergo repeat assessment as above. That will conclude the study.</intervention_model_description>
