      This study is a phase Ib, single arm, open label clinical trial that will enroll patients
      with untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCBL) at moderate or high risk for poor
      outcome, defined as an NCCN-IPI score of 2 or higher. Each patient's disease will be
      biologically characterized at baseline. Enrolled patients will receive chemoimmunotherapy
      with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP),
      administered every 21 days for 6 cycles, which is the standard of care. In addition, all
      patients will receive the study drug, roflumilast, at the standard dose of 500 μg by mouth
      once daily, throughout the 18-week treatment period.

    <description>All patients will receive R-CHOP therapy at standard doses according to the standard preparation and infusion procedures of each investigational site, which is to be repeated every 21 days for a total of 6 cycles. All patients will receive a fixed oral dose of one 500 microgram (μg) tablet per day with or without food for all 21 days of each cycle, which will amount to a total of 126 doses of roflumilast.</description>

          -  Ann Arbor stage II-IV

          -  Measurable disease, meaning at least 1 lymph node or other lymphomatous lesion with a
             long axis of ≥1.5 cm by CT imaging, and at least one FDG-avid lesion by FDG-PET scan.

             radionucleotide angiography.

          -  Ability to swallow oral tablets without difficulty.

          -  All subjects with preserved reproductive potential must agree to practice abstinence
             or employ contraceptive measures for the duration of treatment and for 4 weeks

             potential. Female subjects of reproductive potential are those who: 1) are not at
             least 50 years old and have no menses for 24 consecutive months; or 2) have not been
             rendered surgically sterile (having undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral
             salpingo-oophorectomy). Female subjects of reproductive potential must have a negative
             serum pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of human
             chorionic gonadotropin ([hCG]) within 7 days of first day of drug dosing.
