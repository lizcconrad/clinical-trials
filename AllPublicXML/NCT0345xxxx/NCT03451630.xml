  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are widely recognized as the U.S. public health challenge
      of the 21st century. These physical and behavioral health conditions take a large toll on
      those suffering from the diseases, including many who are publicly insured, as well as
      caregivers and society. While evidence-based integrated care models can improve outcomes for
      individuals with MCC, such models have not yet been widely implemented. Insurance
      providers/payers have innovative system features that can be used to deploy these models;
      however, the investigators do not yet know which of these features can best help to improve
      outcomes for individuals with MCC in general or high-need subgroups in particular. As a
      result, patients lack information to make important decisions about their health and health
      care, and system-level decision makers face ongoing challenges in effectively and efficiently
      supporting those with MCC.

      This real-world study will provide useful information about available options for supporting
      individuals with MCC. Building on existing integrated care efforts, the investigators will
      enroll 1,662 adults with MCC at risk for repeated hospitalizations and assess the impact of
      three payer-led options (High-Touch, High-Tech, Usual Care) on patient-centered outcomes,
      namely patient activation in health care, health status, and subsequent re-hospitalization.
      The investigators will also determine which option works best for whom under what
      circumstances by gathering information directly from individuals with MCC through self-report
      questionnaires, health care use data, and interviews.

      Study aims. Given the documented need for valuable information about system-level features
      that can be used to effectively and efficiently support adults in living well with MCC, this
      study is designed to achieve the following aims:

      Aim 1: Compare the effectiveness of High-Touch, High-Tech, and Usual Care on primary outcomes
      including hospital readmission, health status, and patient activation, and on several
      secondary outcomes including functional status, quality of life, care satisfaction, emergent
      care use, engagement in primary, specialty, and mental health care, and gaps in care.

      Aim 2: Examine the differential effects of the interventions for patient subgroups, based on
      age, race, illness complexity, and comorbid behavioral health conditions to evaluate
      heterogeneity of treatment effects (HTE) and determine for whom and in what circumstances the
      interventions are most effective.

      Aim 3: Examine perceived barriers and facilitators to efficient and effective implementation
      of High-Touch and High-Tech interventions for delivering evidence-based integrated care.

      An individual-level randomized design along with a pragmatic, mixed-methods approach to
      compare system-level features for delivering evidence-based components of integrated care for
      Medicaid or dual-eligible adult members with MCC who reside in in Western, Central, or
      Eastern PA and are at high risk for rehospitalization has been selected for this study. This
      design, based on significant input from patient stakeholders and Drs. Kraemer (Scientific
      Co-I; health services researcher) and Landsittel (Co-I; biostatistician/CER expert), accords
      fully with the PCORI Methodology Standards.91. Intervention effectiveness will be determined
      by examining the differential impact on outcomes that are most meaningful to patients in our
      target population and those delivering their care. The scope and duration of the study
      interventions and evaluation are sufficient to measure change in patient-centered outcomes.
      Upon receipt of an award, the evaluation and analytics plan described within this section
      will be translated into a formal study protocol to be vetted again for content and process
      with patient partners and other stakeholders and approved by the Human Research Protection
      Office (HRPO).

      High-Touch, High-Tech, and Usual Care will serve as the comparators for this study. Usual
      Care follows standardized procedures for patient engagement including when a patient is
      either hospitalized or transitioning from the hospital setting into ambulatory care for
      follow-up and condition management. Due to resources and other limitations, not all patients
      who are eligible for High-Touch/High-Tech enroll in these programs. Thus, the addition of the
      Usual Care arm will allow for a less intensive model to be examined and targeted to
      appropriate patient populations.

      For Aims 1 and 2, an individual, stratified randomized trial design was selected to randomly
      assign each enrollee to one of the three interventions arms, minimizing and balancing for
      confounding variables. Individual-level randomization was selected as opposed to cluster
      randomization at a system level (e.g., practice-, hospital-level) because the interventions
      are delivered by a single payer and are not subject to within-practice contamination. Based
      on valuable system-level stakeholder feedback, an unequal randomization ratio of 2:2:1 for
      High-Touch, High-Tech, and Usual Care, respectively, was utilized. While the less resource
      intensive Usual Care may, in fact, improve meaningful outcomes for certain patient subgroups,
      the health care system has invested heavily in High-Touch and High-Tech as evidence-based
      solutions for chronic disease care. Additionally, stakeholders have indicated that they would
      like as many participants as possible to have a fully integrated care experience offered by
      High-Touch/High-Tech and would like to limit enrollment into Usual Care. The investigators
      will use a mixed-methods approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative data.
      The addition of qualitative data collection and analyses in Aim 3 will permit more
      comprehensive understanding of patient and staff experiences with the interventions and
      results will aide in dissemination of study findings in a manner that is most consistent with
      patient and other stakeholder perceptions and experiences. The overall, four-year study
      timeline includes three phases: Pre-Intervention (months 1-6), Intervention and Data
      Collection (months 7-40), and Data Analysis and Reporting (months 41-48).

      The study population includes Medicaid or dual-eligible (Medicare-Medicaid) adults age 21
      years and older with MCC, including at least one physical health condition (e.g.,
      cardiovascular disease, hypertension, COPD, diabetes) and at least one additional physical or
      behavioral health condition (e.g., depression, serious mental illness, substance abuse
      disorder). These individuals will reside in PA and will be insured through physical and/or
      behavioral health payers within the UPMC Insurance Services Division (ISD). In addition,
      these individuals are identified as members with consistently high or rising resource
      utilization (which accounts for avoidable hospital readmissions, emergency department usage,
      and high cost, among other utilization-related variables). Individuals who are pregnant, in
      skilled nursing facilities, on hemodialysis for kidney disease, or in active cancer treatment
      will be excluded. The target population comprises an estimated 3,893 adults. Based on current
      UPMC ISD analyses, approximately 75% of these individuals (n=2,920) have a subsequent
      hospitalization within 6 months. The investigators estimate 20% attrition at 12-month
      follow-up.

      The study will use web-based randomization to one of the three interventions for those
      individuals who consent to participate in the study. Once a member of the interdisciplinary
      care team (ICT) determines eligibility, he or she will enter key identification information,
      and the system will then generate a Study ID (numeric identification number) along with
      assignment to an intervention arm. Randomization will be stratified by gender, type of
      insurance (Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid), and technology/digital literacy, which will be
      assessed at time of enrollment and before randomization, to ensure that intervention arms are
      balanced with respect to these important variables. Within each stratum, random block sizes
      of 2 and 4 will be used to maximize balance between intervention groups while minimizing the
      ability to unmask investigators to the next treatment assignment, triggering an automated
      alert to ICT staff regarding which intervention to implement for each participant and
      documented accordingly in Health PlaNET, UPMC ISD's integrated health management software
      program. If a participant is unwilling to be randomized, they will be excluded from the
      study.

      Each patient is assigned an ICT that includes a nurse Clinical Care Manager (CCM), social
      worker Licensed Professional Care Manager (LPCM), and a pharmacist who provides comprehensive
      services for the duration of intervention implementation. Bilingual ICT staff will be
      available to support native Spanish speaking participants. Sixteen CCMs are currently
      employed to develop and implement care plans with patients, coordinate healthcare services,
      work with the pharmacist to manage patient's medications, make home visits, and deliver
      telehealth care and remote monitoring. Fifteen LPCMs are responsible for each patient's
      biopsychosocial needs assessment, meeting with patients in their homes, hospitals and
      provider offices, and conducting psychosocial status reviews. Three pharmacists conduct
      medication reconciliations for all patients and share findings about potential drug
      interactions or medication adjustments with CCMs, patients, and providers as indicated. Each
      ICT has a caseload of up to fifty patients and all staff members meet monthly to review
      progress for all individuals participating in the interventions.

      Staff members undergo extensive in-person and web-based module training to increase
      uniformity in patient engagement and intervention implementation. The work of Peggy Swarbrick
      of Rutgers and the Collaborative Support Programs of New Jersey, Inc. provides the basis of
      the wellness coaching and health navigation training that teaches all ICT staff how to
      utilize motivational interviewing to identify and address barriers and facilitators related
      to disease self-management and holistic health. Additional training includes modules related
      to: medication reconciliations, common physical/behavioral health conditions, strategies to
      engage eligible patients, documentation protocols, trauma-informed care, substance use, and
      harm reduction. SAMHSA's 8 Dimensions of Wellness (physical, emotional, environmental,
      social, financial, occupational, spiritual, and intellectual) are considered with all
      intervention-related activities to ensure that whole health and wellness are taken into
      account when assessing each patient's unique needs.

      Patients in both High-Touch and High-Tech will experience similar procedures at the start of
      their participation. A CCM or LPCM engages patients in a face-to-face assessment in the
      hospital or in a community setting to dialogue about the social determinants affecting
      continued hospital readmissions and emergency department use. At the completion of the
      assessment, the initial home visit is scheduled and medication reconciliation is ordered.
      Individuals randomized to Usual Care will be provided with the transitional care services.
      High-Touch and High-Tech interventions are provided for approximately three to four months
      following hospitalization, and Usual Care is approximately one month.

    <description>Functional status will be measured using the PROMIS Physical Function - Short Form 6b which is a brief self-report tool that consists of 6 self-reported physical function measures that assess current function including the functioning of upper extremities, lower extremities, central regions, as well as activities of daily living. Each question has five response options (a 5 point Likert scale) ranging in value from one to five. The instrument is scored using item-level calibrations using responses to each item for each participant. A single Physical Function capability score is generated from the short form.</description>

    <description>Quality of Life will be assessed using the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF): which is a self-report measure consisting of 16 questions designed to enable investigators to easily obtain sensitive measures of the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning during the past week. The scoring of the Q-LES-Q-SF involves summing only the first 14 items to yield a raw total score. The last two items are not included in the total score but are standalone items. The raw total score ranges from 14 to 70. The raw total score is transformed into a percentage maximum possible score using the following formula:
(raw total score - minimum score)/(maximum possible raw score - minimum score) The minimum raw score on the Q-LES-Q-SF is 14, and the maximum score is 70. Thus the formula for % maximum can also be written as (raw score - 14)/56.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and every three months for a 12 month intervention period.</time_frame>
    <description>Care satisfaction will be assessed using the Patient Assessment of Care for Chronic Conditions (PACIC) Survey. The PACIC Survey consists of 20-items that measures specific actions or qualities of care that patients report they have experienced in the care of their chronic conditions over the past 6 months. There is an additional item that is not part of the PACIC Survey and is used to track the patient's hopefulness over time. The PACIC Survey is grouped into five scales where each scale is scored by averaging the items completed within the scale, and the overall PACIC is cored by averaging scores across all 20 items. The five scales are:
Patient Activation (items 1-3)
Delivery System Design/Decision Support (items 4-6)
Goal Setting (items 7-11)
Problem-solving/Contextual Counseling (items 12-15)
Follow-up/Coordination (items 16-20)</description>

    <description>Health Status will be measured using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36). The SF-36 is a set of 36 health status and quality-of-life measures that are patient self-reported and measure functional health and well-being within eight domains, including physical functioning, physical ability to complete tasks, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional ability to complete tasks, and mental health.. Patients are asked to reply to questions based on how they have felt over the previous week. There are eight scaled scores and each scale is translated into a 0-100 scale with each question carrying equal weight. Lower scores represent more disability and higher scores less disability. The items use Likert-type scales, some with 5 or 6 points and others with 2 or 3 points.</description>
