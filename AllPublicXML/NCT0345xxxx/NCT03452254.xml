  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of serious long-term impairment. According to the
      estimates, 12,500 people suffer a new or recurrent ischemic stroke in Chile annually, which
      shows the magnitude of the problem. Motor impairment of the upper limb (UL) stands out as the
      principal sequel after a CVA (50% of the patients experience it), and the Constraint-Induced
      Movement Therapy (CIMT) is the rehabilitation approach that shows more scientific evidence
      today. Even though patients reach certain recuperation levels through this approach, results
      are still insufficient since 50-80% of the patients continue having upper limb motor
      impairment after completing standard rehabilitation. Because of this, it is pertinent to
      conduct research to explore new rehabilitation strategies to reduce the impairment indexes
      and to provide information for decision making based on evidence.

      Recent studies on functional neuroimaging propose that there is an abnormal balance in the
      motor cortex excitability after stroke - relative under-excitability in the affected
      hemisphere and over-excitability in the unaffected hemisphere (with the consequent inhibitory
      influence on ipsilesional regions) in patient with subacute/chronic stroke and moderate motor
      impairment. This imbalance in the hemispheres function would limit the possibilities of a
      greater recovery. Then, in order to reestablish brain balance, the investigators proposed
      that the early introduction of noninvasive techniques of brain stimulation, such as tDCS, to
      the motor rehabilitation training could promote improvement of upper limb function in
      patients with stroke. However, we lack studies that confirm the benefits of using these
      techniques, define the most appropriate protocols, and determine what patients and under
      which evolving stages would be the best candidates for treatment.

      This study aims to &quot;compare the effectiveness of seven days of bi-hemispheric tDCS, both
      active and sham, combined with modified CIMT (mCIMT) in the motor and functional recovery of
      the hemiparetic upper limb in hospitalized patients with subacute unihemispheric stroke at
      Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile and Hospital San José&quot;. This comparison responds
      to the hypothesis that patients who receive bi-hemispheric and active tDCS combined with
      mCIMT (experimental group) get at least 30% more recovery of the paretic upper limb compared
      to the control group who receive sham bi-hemispheric tDCS plus mCIMT after a protocol of
      seven days treatment.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose to carry out a sham randomized multicenter
      double blind clinical trial. This trial considers seven continuous days of treatment when the
      participants with hemiparesis as a result of a stroke will be assigned to one of the
      treatment groups: bi-hemispheric tDCS combined with mCIMT or bi-hemispheric sham tDCS
      combined with mCIMT. Besides collecting demographic and clinical info from the subjects, the
      investigators will assess the patients using upper limb scales of functional motor recovery
      and an evaluation of their functional independence in basic activities of daily living
      (ADLs). STATA 14.0 software will be used for data analysis.

      To date, no study has tested the efficacy of early bi-hemispheric stimulation in combination
      with mCIMT in subacute hospitalized stroke patients.

    <masking_description>Patients will be assigned to the active tDCS plus mCIMT group or to the sham tDCS plus mCIMT group using randomized blocking to ensure the balance between the treatments. Once the person in charge of recruiting receives the patient's informed consent, he will notify this to the person in charge of randomization who will not have any relationship with the patient, will not know the patient's clinical record, and will not be influenced by the head researchers, the evaluators, or the therapist. This person will send a text message to the person responsible for programming and installing the tDCS, who will proceed to set the tDCS either active or simulated. Patients, treating occupational therapists, and the results evaluator will be kept masked to the assignment process.</masking_description>

    <description>The session will start with the application of the with a couple of surface sponge electrodes (25-35 cm2) on the scalp. The treatment modality will be as follows:
Sham tDCS: We will use the same place and parameters of stimulation applied for the active group, but the stimulator will deactivate after 30 seconds of stimulation. This will ensure that the patient will feel the initial tingling sensation at the beginning of the tDCS which is a requisite for blinding. The occupational therapy session will last one hour.</description>

    <description>Both groups will perform the mCIMT during a period of seven consecutive days. This protocol consists of two elements:
Restriction of the movements of the non-affected hand by wearing a mitt during six hours a day: we will use a mitt that limits the movement of the fingers but allows the free movements of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder.
Intensive and individualized training of the affected arm during 2 hours a day guided by an occupational therapist: the two hours training will be divided into two sessions of one hour each. Sessions will be organized in three blocks: preparation, activation, and function. In the third block, devoted to function, the patient has to choose one activity of daily living that he wants to improve.</description>
