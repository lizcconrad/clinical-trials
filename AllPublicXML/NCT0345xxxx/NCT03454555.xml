  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to one-third of Americans suffer from chronic noncancer pain (CNCP). Opioids are often
      used to treat CNCP. Once on chronic opioid therapy (COT), individuals often continue for
      months or years. Evidence for the effectiveness of COT to treat CNCP is insufficient,
      exposing individuals to known risk. Strategies are needed to reduce/eliminate COT in patients
      who are not benefiting from opioids while ensuring access for those who are.

      The researchers will employ a multisite pragmatic trial using real-time randomization to
      examine the comparative effectiveness of 2 approaches: a guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy
      approach integrated with shared decision making (SDM) (Arm 1) compared with a
      guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy approach integrated with motivational interviewing (MI)
      and cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) (Arm 2).

      The researchers will examine the impact of the 2 approaches on several outcomes. The study
      will examine which set of patients have greater opioid dose reduction, greater rates of
      opioid discontinuation, improved functioning, and/or lower pain scores. Clinical outcomes
      (opioid dose reduction and time to discontinuation) will be assessed using electronic health
      record data at 4 timepoints: baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. Patient-reported
      outcomes, including physical functioning and level of pain, will be measured via patient
      survey at 3 timepoints: baseline, 3 months, and 12 months.

      The study will include patients from North Carolina and Tennessee. The researchers will
      enroll 530 patients in each study arm for a total enrollment of 1,060. This sample size will
      provide robust power to detect clinically important differences in reduction of opioid use
      between the two study arms.

      Analyses will include longitudinal (mixed effects) models to compare the change in outcomes
      from baseline to each timepoint between the two study arms. The project team will explore
      differences in the intervention effect according to participant characteristics such as age,
      sex, baseline pain level, baseline opioid dose, physical comorbidities, mental health
      comorbidities, and a history of substance abuse. Qualitative research methods will be used to
      obtain patient input on their experiences.

      Study Design and Approach This is a large-scale randomized pragmatic trial of implementing
      pharmacotherapy guidelines and behavioral interventions in real-world settings. This study
      provides the opportunity to advance the science on effectiveness-implementation hybrid study
      designs because we can assess both clinical effectiveness and implementation issues.

      In this trial, the researchers will examine the comparative effectiveness of two approaches
      to reducing opioid dosages for chronic non-cancer patients (CNCP) who are on chronic opioid
      therapy (COT): shared decision making (SDM) and guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy (Arm 1)
      compared with cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain and motivational interviewing
      (CBT-CP+MI) and guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy (Arm 2).

      Rationale:

      Believing that an intervention will have a positive outcome is a key tenet of Social Learning
      Theory and self-efficacy is a main tenet of Bandura's Social Cognitive theory that refers to
      one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations. Self-efficacy has
      consistently been demonstrated as a reliable predictor of numerous health-related outcomes
      and is one of the primary constructs targeted by CBT for individuals with chronic pain. We
      posit that enhancing patients' self-efficacy, knowledge, and skills for managing their pain
      will lead to decreases in pain interference, self-reported pain status, and symptoms of
      anxiety and depression. Ultimately, this will lead to increases in physical functioning, and
      for some, decreases in opioid use or discontinuation of opioid use. Our model further
      acknowledges that there are certain benefit-risk tradeoffs involved with this study. For
      example, the intended effect of decreased opioid use in the CBT-CP+MI arm may also result in
      increased reports of pain. Our analyses will explore these and other unintended effects to
      the extent possible. Further, the use of CBT-CP+MI is expected to influence outcomes through
      various other intermediate factors (e.g., reduced negative thought that &quot;nothing can be done
      to help my pain&quot;).

      Aims:

      The research team will examine the impact of the 2 approaches on several outcomes. The study
      will examine which set of patients have greater opioid dose reduction, greater rates of
      opioid discontinuation, improved functioning, and/or lower pain scores.

      The specific aims are:

      Aim 1: To test whether CNCP patients who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy
      integrated with a CBT-CP+MI intervention (Arm 2) have greater opioid dose reduction relative
      to their counterparts, who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy integrated with SDM
      (Arm 1).

      Aim 2: To test whether CNCP patients who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy
      integrated with an CBT-CP+MI intervention (Arm 2) have greater rates of opioid
      discontinuation relative to their counterparts, who receive guideline-concordant
      pharmacotherapy integrated with SDM (Arm 1).

      Aim 3: To test whether CNCP patients who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy
      integrated with an CBT-CP+MI intervention (Arm 2) have improved functioning relative to their
      counterparts, who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy integrated with SDM (Arm 1).

      Aim 4: To test whether CNCP patients who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy
      integrated with an CBT-CP+MI intervention (Arm 2) have lower pain scores relative to their
      counterparts, who receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy integrated with SDM (Arm 1).

      The research team chose these comparison arms and outcomes based on input from patients,
      patient advocates, and therapists.

      Timeline:

      The project commenced in February 2018. In 2018, researchers will develop a formal study
      protocol documenting the approach and implementation steps, and then proceed with requesting
      Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Researchers will finalize arrangements with
      clinical practices in 2018. The study team will conduct clinician training related to the
      interventions to promote consistency in its delivery across the various clinical practices
      prior to initiating the intervention.

      Recruitment, Screening, Enrollment, and Randomization:

      The proposed study will enroll 530 participants in each arm, from primary care and pain
      clinics at three medical centers. Participants will have used opioids at the level of 50 mg
      or greater daily morphine equivalent doses (MED) for 90 or more days, will not have a
      terminal cancer diagnosis, and will not currently be in psychotherapy.

      Patient recruitment will occur on a rolling basis beginning early in 2019 and last for up to
      26 months. Delivery of the intervention will also occur on a rolling basis with the
      recruitment process. We will identify eligible patients monthly and will invite them to
      participate in the study. Patients who are potentially eligible will be identified through
      electronic health records (EHRs) and contacted by mail and phone with an invitation to
      participate. Interested patients will be met at their next clinic visit by a Research
      Coordinator to complete additional screening, enrollment, and randomization.

      The study will use real-time randomization to limit participant loss prior to treatment.
      Eligible patients will be randomized using a stratified, permuted-block design, as this
      constrained randomization approach ensures balance between treatment groups within each of
      the 3 clinical institutions (our only stratification factor) at the completion of each block.
      Consequently, throughout the trial, the treatment arms will have approximately equal sample
      sizes both within a site and across the study. Patients will be provided study information
      based on their treatment assignment. Patients assigned to Arm 2 will be scheduled for initial
      MI and CBT-CP sessions.

      Interventions:

      In Arm 1, patients and clinicians will engage in Shared Decision Making (SDM). In Arm 2,
      patients will participate in cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) and
      motivational interviewing (MI).

      Patients in both study arms will receive guideline-concordant pharmacotherapy treatment,
      based on clinical guidelines for opioid therapy for CNCP. Guideline-concordant care specifies
      current best practices for COT, and the treatment will include the following: patient risk
      assessment, including screening for prior substance use disorders; screening for behavioral
      health issues; regular monitoring for pain/analgesia with self-reported pain scores (0 to 10,
      with 10 = worst possible pain) at each visit; urine drug screens; elicitation of adverse
      reactions or aberrant medication behavior; and patient education and goal setting.

      Because this is a pragmatic trial, we will not go to excessive lengths to ensure patient
      adherence, as might be done in an efficacy trial. If a patient misses a session, we will call
      him or her once, as would be done in most clinics.

      Control variables will include demographic characteristics, intervention dosage for a subset
      of the analyses (e.g., number of intervention sessions attended, overall comorbidity using
      the Charlson Comorbidity Index, mental health disorders, and number and type of CNCP
      conditions per ICD-9 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health
      Problems 9th edition) codes. Comorbidities will be extracted from EHR data.

      Data Analysis and Reporting:

      In a large pragmatic trial such as the one planned, the probability is small that the groups
      will have imbalance by age, sex, health behaviors, or other measured or unmeasured possible
      confounding factors. Nevertheless, researchers will assess whether randomization has
      successfully created comparable groups by descriptively comparing their baseline demographic
      characteristics and potential confounders, including baseline pain score, comorbidities,
      opioid dosage, and number and type of CNCP conditions.

      Researchers will evaluate clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes using longitudinal
      analyses. Analyses will use longitudinal (mixed effects) models to compare opioid dose over
      18 months between the two study arms. Time-to-event models will be used to compare time until
      discontinuation of opiates between study arms. Researchers also will explore differences in
      the intervention effect according to participant characteristics, such as age, sex, baseline
      pain level, baseline opioid dose, and the presence of physical comorbidities, mental health
      comorbidities, or a history of substance abuse.
