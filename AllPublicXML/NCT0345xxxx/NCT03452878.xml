  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aggressiveness has a high prevalence in the psychiatry population and is of major concern.
      Though pharmacological treatments are effective for most patients, there is a portion that
      doesn't respond properly and is considered medically refractory. For them, surgical
      procedures (i.e. stereotactic lesions) have been performed as an attempt to reintegrate
      patient into society. The amygdala is a main structure in the control of aggressive behavior
      and amygdala lesion could improve behavior without neurological or other behavioral
      impairment. In this study, it will evaluate the functional results of the bilateral amygdala
      lesion of aggressive refractory patients through neuroimaging, clinical assessment and blood
      hormonal levels. To better understand the neurobiology of aggression, aggressive patients
      that are not refractory will also be studied through neuroimaging and hormonal levels.
