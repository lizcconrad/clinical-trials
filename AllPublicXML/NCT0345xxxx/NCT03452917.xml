  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, a total of 1500 patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in
      Seattle/King County will be enrolled. This will be a randomized clinical trial and patients
      will receive either two different doses of IV sodium nitrite (45 mg or 60 mg) or placebo
      during resuscitation in the field by paramedics. The primary safety outcome will be
      proportion of patients surviving to hospital admission and primary efficacy outcome will be
      survival to discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hemodynamic effects of the optimal dose of IV nitrite administered in patients with
      cardiac arrest are unknown. A significant negative hemodynamic effect from nitrite would
      decrease the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital, increase rate of re-arrest, or
      increase the need for vasopressor support in the field. In Seattle/King County, typically 40%
      of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients attended to by paramedics have Return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and are admitted to the hospital. In this study, 1500 patients
      with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are undergoing resuscitation by paramedics will be
      randomized to receive placebo (n=500) or 45 mg IV (n=500) or 60 mg dose (n=500) of sodium
      nitrite. The study will have 80% power to detect an absolute increase in hospital admission
      rate of 8% (1-sided .05 level test for each of the two comparisons (45 mg vs placebo and 60
      mg vs placebo, no adjustment for multiple comparisons), with a hospital admission rate of 40%
      in the placebo group and with one interim analysis and stopping only for potential futility
      and/or harm). The investigators will examine the proportion of patients who survive to
      discharge as a secondary measure of efficacy.

      Patients will be eligible for this study if:

        1. Intravenous access (IV)/intraosseous access(IO)

        2. Cardiac arrest, either Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or non-VF patients receiving
           Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) by Seattle/King County paramedics.

        3. Age 18 years or older

        4. Comatose

      Exclusion Criteria

        1. Traumatic cause of cardiac arrest

        2. Prisoner, pregnancy, age less than 18 (special population/vulnerable population)

        3. Known DNAR

        4. Drowning as cause of arrest.
