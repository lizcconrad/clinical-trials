      This study is being conducted to determine whether MAU868 warrants further clinical
      development for the prevention of BKV infection in kidney transplant recipients.

      This is a non-confirmatory, randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded, proof-of-concept study
      in kidney transplant recipients. Approximately 96 eligible subjects are planned to be
      randomized 2:1 to receive MAU868 or placebo. At least 78 subjects are expected to complete
      the study. The study will consist of a pre-treatment (screening) consenting period, a 24 week
      treatment period (consisting of 6 monthly i.v. doses of MAU868 or placebo) and a 24 week
      follow-up period. Subjects who complete the study per protocol will attend a total of 16
      visits over a period of 48 weeks.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria;

          -  Male or female recipients of a first or second kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant
             who weigh at least 30 kg and are at least 7 years of age (in the US, 18 years of age
             or above) at the time of transplantation.

          -  Recipients of organs from a heart-beating deceased, non-heart-beating deceased, living
             unrelated, or human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched living related donor.

          -  Recipients who are treated with lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy (e.g., rabbit
             antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab). Subjects treated with rabbit antithymocyte
             globulin must receive a total dose of at least 3 mg/kg. Subjects treated with
             alemtuzumab must receive a total dose of at least 20 mg.

          -  Recipients of a kidney with a cold ischemia time (CIT) &lt;36 hours.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Recipients of organs from identical twins or living, HLA-matched, related donors.

          -  ABO incompatible or complement-dependent lymphocytotoxic (CDC) crossmatch positive
             transplant (isolated positive B cell crossmatches are not an exclusion criterion).

          -  Recipients who are treated with non-lymphocyte-depleting induction therapy (e.g.,
             basiliximab) or no induction therapy.

          -  Recipients who are treated or planned to be treated with mTOR inhibitors as part of
             their initial immunosuppression regimen post-transplantation.

          -  Recipients who require antibody-depletion prior to transplantation and in the opinion
             of the investigator are likely to require antibody-depletion after transplantation.
             Antibody-depleting therapies include but are not necessarily limited to
             plasmapharesis, immunoadsorption, and IVIg.

          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a
             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by hCG
             testing.

          -  Current clinical, radiographic, or laboratory evidence of active or latent
             tuberculosis (TB) or any history, in the opinion of the investigator, that confers a
             risk of reactivation of TB and precludes the use of conventional immunosuppression.

          -  History of splenectomy or asplenia.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using basic methods of contraception during dosing
             of investigational drug.
