  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Relapse is very common in patients with illicit drug use disorder and contributes
      to a series of bad consequences that substantially impact patients' physical and social
      functions. Due to the limited existence of effective addiction treatment, the majority of
      patients with drug use disorder could not access help when needing. Mobile health (mHealth)
      offers a potential solution to improving recovery outcome for patients in community.

      Objective: This paper is a protocol for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a smart phone
      application called community-based addiction rehabilitation electronic system (CAREs) . This
      interactive system consists of an APP for clients and a webpage for service providers, with
      the aim of teaching clients craving and emergency coping skills and helping service providers
      to improve work efficiency and effectiveness in community.

      Methods: A randomized controlled trial(RCT) will be conducted. Sixty drug illicit users who
      are newly ordered to undergo community rehabilitation will be recruited from the community in
      Shanghai. Participants will be 1:1 randomly assigned to receive integrated community
      rehabilitation by using CAREs or only receiving routine community rehabilitation for 6
      months. Corresponding anti-drug social workers will provide service and monitor participants'
      drug use behavior in accordance with the routine work-flow. Outcomes will be assessed at
      baseline and in the 6th month. The primary study outcome is the performance on illicit drug
      urine test which will be carried on regularly twice per week during the study period.
      Secondary study outcomes include days that participants interact with anti-drug social
      workers, and the decrease rate of addiction-related issues severity index.

    <masking_description>To minimize the risk of biased results as much as possible, the persons who conduct the urine tests and complete the evaluation of the ASI will be different from those who provides the intervention. But subjects may talk about the CAREs intervention during the assessment so it is not possible to completely 'blind' the evaluators to the intervention group of the subjects.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Drug urine test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>The results of drug urine tests will be examined in overall percentage of drug positive samples. Overall percentage of drug positive samples= the number of positive urine tests results / the number of total urine tests (Subject who does not submit urine samples on time during the intervention period or refuses to submit samples even if he/she is present at the site will be considered as having a positive urine test result).</description>

    <description>Interaction with anti-drug social workers: The days that participants interact with their corresponding social workers will be collected during the study period. Any phone call, SMS, face-to-face meeting, or communication via CAREs will be considered as interaction happening.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The decrease rate of addiction-related issues severity index</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese translation of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) that has good reliability and validity in China will be used to assess the severity of addiction at enrollment and 6 months after enrollment. The descent rate will be counted via dividing the minus value between baseline score and 6-month score by baseline score.</description>
