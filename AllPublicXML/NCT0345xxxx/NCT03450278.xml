      The current study Is a split-mouth Randomized Controlled Trial that was performed to
      investigate three dimensionally, using digital models and Cone Beam Computed Tomography
      imaging, the effect of micro-osteoperforations (MOPs) on the rate of tooth movement in a
      canine retraction model.

      Sample size calculation was carried out and resulted in enrolment of 18 female patients
      requiring bilateral upper first premolars extraction and canine retraction with maximum
      anchorage. The sample was recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Orthodontic Department,
      Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.

      After placement of the fixed orthodontic appliance, leveling and alignment proceeded till
      0.016&quot; × 0.022&quot; NiTi upper archwire. Indirect skeletal anchorage was then prepared using TADs
      inserted bilaterally between the upper 1st molar and 2nd premolar, and the patient was
      referred for upper 1st premolars extraction.

      Three months after extraction, 0.017&quot; × 0.025&quot; stainless-steel upper archwire was inserted
      and three vertically aligned MOPs were randomly allocated and performed in one side using a
      single TAD, while the other side served as control. The three MOPs were performed distal to
      the canine, equidistant in the extraction space. Bilateral canine retraction was then
      commenced using NiTi closing coil springs delivering 150 gms of force. Before leaving the
      clinic, a pain questionnaire was given to each patient.

      Data were collected from monthly upper impressions, which were poured into stone models and
      scanned to obtain sequential digital models (T0, T1, T2, T3 &amp; T4), in addition to pre- and
      post-retraction maxillary CBCT images.

      The assessed outcomes were the rate of canine retraction per month, the total distance
      travelled by the upper canines, first molars anchorage loss, tipping, torque and rotation of
      upper canines and first molars, canine root resorption and finally the pain related to MOP
      procedure. Statistical analysis was performed on the gathered data and results were
      withdrawn.
