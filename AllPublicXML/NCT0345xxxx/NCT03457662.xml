  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sonodynamic therapy (SDT)
      in reducing atherosclerotic plaques inflammation and increasing peak walking time (PWT) among
      peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients with symptom of intermittent claudication.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atherosclerotic lower extremity PAD affects more than 20 million people in the world. PAD is
      associated with a major decline in functional status and claudication is the most frequent
      symptom. Current claudication therapies are associated with significant limitations.
      Pharmacotherapy cilostazol and supervised exercise are recommended in 2016 AHA/ACC Guideline
      on the management of lower extremity PAD patients with claudication, but cilostazol may not
      achieve an ideal response rate, and supervised exercise efficacy may be limited by
      co-morbidities and medicare reimburse. Furthermore endovascular procedure may not be
      feasible, durable or cost-effective, especially in femoropopliteal arteries.

      The aim of this trial is to test the hypothesis that SDT will inhibit atherosclerotic plaques
      inflammation and improve PWT in femoropopliteal arteries PAD patients compared to optimal
      medical care (OMC) therapy within 1 month. An estimated 32 eligible patients will be randomly
      divided into two groups: OMC combined with pseudo-SDT and OMC combined with SDT. Recruitment
      will be performed over 6 months and patients will be followed for 1 month; the anticipated
      total study duration will be 1 year.

      Finally, this trial investigate the safety and efficacy of SDT in PAD patients with
      intermittent claudication and explore new end-points to evaluate therapeutic effects using
      PET-CT imaging as well as traditional endpoints.

    <description>OMC is established according to the 2016 ACC-AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients with PAD. SDT treatment is the combination of sonosensitizer administration and target atherosclerotic lesions ultrasound exposure. Sinoporphyrin sodium (DVDMS) as sonosensitizer, is dissolved in 0.9% sodium solution for following skin test and intravenous injection. 0.01mg/ml DVDMS solution (0.1ml) is prepared for skin test followed by 0.04 mg/ml.DVDMS solution intravenous injection (0.2mg/kg). The target atherosclerotic lesions are marked on the corresponding skin with ultrasound guidance and underwent ultrasound exposure after 4 hours incubation. The therapeutic ultrasonic transducer is fixed to the marked skin site of each lesion.</description>
