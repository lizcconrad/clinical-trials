  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of lasmiditan on simulated driving
      performance in healthy participants. Participants are expected to complete each of four study
      periods, which will last a total of about 10 days. During this time, participants will remain
      in the clinical research unit. Screening must be completed within 28 days before the start of
      the study. Follow-up will be completed about one week after discharge.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are overtly healthy males or females, as determined through medical history and
             physical examination.

          -  Possess a valid driver's license and is an active driver at screening. Driven a
             minimum of 8,000 miles (about 13,000 kilometers) per year for the preceding 3 years.

          -  Have a score of &lt;10 on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a history within 3 months of admission, or current treatment for, a sleeping
             disorder (including excessive snoring, obstructive sleep apnea), or a chronic painful
             condition that interferes with the subject's sleep.

          -  Have a history of difficulty either falling asleep or staying asleep in the previous 3
             months of admission that is considered clinically significant by the investigator.

          -  Are expected to use any other medication or dietary supplement to promote sleep
             including over the-counter sleep medications, during their participation in the study.

          -  Have traveled across 2 or more time zones (transmeridian travel) in the past 2 weeks
             prior to randomization.

          -  Have worked in a night shift in the past 2 weeks prior to randomization.

          -  Show a history of central nervous system (CNS) conditions such as strokes, transient
             ischemic attacks, significant head trauma, seizures, CNS infections, migraine, brain
             surgery, or any other neurological conditions that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, increase the risk of participating in the study.

          -  Show evidence of significant active neuropsychiatric disease (e.g., manic depressive
             illness, schizophrenia, depression) considered as clinically significant by the
             investigator.
