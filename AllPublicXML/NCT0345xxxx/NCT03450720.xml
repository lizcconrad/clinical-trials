        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male subject ≥18 years of age on the day of signing the informed consent form (ICF).

          -  A confirmed clinical diagnosis of CF.

          -  Two mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene
             belonging to class I and/or class II and/or class III (documented in the subject's
             medical record or CF registry).

          -  Weight ≥40 kg.

          -  Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (documented in the subject's medical record).

          -  Stable concomitant medication regimen for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          -  Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ≥40% of predicted normal for age, gender
             and height at screening (pre- or postbronchodilator).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of clinically meaningful unstable or uncontrolled chronic disease that makes
             the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study in the opinion of the investigator.

          -  Unstable pulmonary status or respiratory tract infection (including rhinosinusitis)
             requiring a change in therapy within 2 weeks prior to study drug administration.

          -  History of hepatic cirrhosis with portal hypertension (e.g.,signs/symptoms of
             splenomegaly, esophageal varices).

          -  Use of CFTR modulator therapy (e.g., lumacaftor or ivacaftor) within 2 weeks prior to
             study drug administration.
