  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cholinesterase inhibitors (CI) remain the only drugs with a recognized efficacy in mild to
      moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in spite of enormous research efforts. However, these drugs
      presented as &quot;symptomatic treatment&quot; of AD are considered as having only a weak effect on the
      course of AD. The reimbursement of these drugs is regularly challenged due to the lack of
      evidence for the impact of these drugs on milestones stages of AD evolution (survival without
      severe dementia, restriction in Basic Activities of Daily Living - BADL) and on major
      consequences in public health (hospitalization and institutionalization). The great majority
      of previous randomized controlled trials conducted with CI have had a too short duration and
      the end points were limited to cognition (ADAS Cog scale), IADL (Instrumental Activities of
      Daily Living) function and Global Impression of Change. New evidences from the DOMINO trial
      (1) conducted in UK, independently of the pharmaceutical industry, showed that the true
      effect of CI might be more to avoid or to delay the cognitive or functional decline in AD
      than to improve patients; the institutionalisation (2) was also delayed. However, this trial
      was conducted in patients with moderate to severe AD, and the interest of the drugs at the
      mild to moderate stage remains questionable.

      The investigators have shown that a good surrogate marker of survival without severe dementia
      would be an increase of ADAS Cog scale of more than six points (3). A post hoc reanalysis of
      the pivotal RCT with two CI showed that in mild to moderate patients, CI was associated with
      a 15% decrease of patients with a deterioration of ADAS-Cog of more than six points in six
      months. Thus at the beginning of dementia the real effect of CI might be more of delaying the
      cognitive and functional decline, than to improve the patients. The main objective of the SOS
      trial is to demonstrate that the benefit of CI at the early phase of dementia is the same as
      at the later phase.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome is a combination of complete BADL dependency in bathing and dressing and/or institutionalization or death at 2 years after randomization.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 30 months after patient's inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Institutionalization with date of entry will be assessed by specialist at each follow-up time every 6 months. For patients not coming to the memory consultation, caregiver (formal and/or informal) and/or the general practitioner will be systematically contacted to obtain the information.
Death and date of death will be assessed by contacting proxy or general practitioner. In case of lack of information the birth City Hall will be contacted to assess the vital status.
For dependency in bathing and dressing, although it could be considered as less objective, we choose a level of total dependency, easy to assess with very low risk of misinterpretation.</description>

The treatment is one of the CI (donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine) with market authorization and commercialized for more than 15 years in France.

    <description>The choice of the treatment will be done by the specialist according to his habits; the specialist will monitor the treatment as usual. All the recruited patients will be treated by CI according to the recommendations of the French HAS and the clinician's habits to choose the type of CI and adjust the dosage. After a 6-month period under CI treatment, patients will be classified according to the evolution of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) as &quot;non-responders&quot; or responders.
Responders patients will continue their treatment according to the habits of the clinician. Non-responder patients will be included in the RCT, with individual randomization in two groups: one group who stops the CI, one group who continues the CI. All randomized patients will then be followed-up for two years with regular assessment of judgment criteria every 6 months.</description>
