  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect information about Fiasp® to evaluate how effective
      Fiasp® is in treating elevated blood sugar in patients with type 1 diabetes, compared with
      the participant's previous insulin treatment. The study will also assess how satisfied the
      participants are with the treatment with Fiasp® and the impact of the treatment on quality of
      life. The study has also been set up to learn more about how effective Fiasp® is in
      controlling the glucose levels during the day and night. The duration of the study is
      expected to be approximately 2 years. The participation is expected to be approximately 6-8
      months for each patient.

    <description>The TRIM-D Device is an eight item measure with two domains assessing Device Bother and Device Function. This captures information on the ease of use, convenience, and handling of the device(s) used to take diabetes medication. The measure has acceptable reliability, validity and ability to detect change.</description>

    <description>The DTSQs questionnaire will be used to assess subject's treatment satisfaction. This instrument contains 8 items and measures the treatment for your diabetes (including insulin, tablets and/or diet) in terms of convenience, flexibility and general feelings regarding treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive fast-acting insulin aspart at the treating physician's discretion as part of the usual clinical practice. The prescription and use of fast-acting insulin aspart is completely independent of this study. Total study duration for the individual patient will be approximately 24 weeks.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with commercially available fast-acting insulin aspart as bolus insulin (multiple daily injection [MDI]) or as insulin used in the insulin pumps (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]). Dosing of fast-acting insulin aspart is individual and determined by the treating physician in accordance with the needs of the patient.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed consent obtained before any study-related activities (study-related activities
             are any procedures related to recording of data according to protocol)

          -  The decision to initiate treatment with commercially available Fiasp® has been made by
             the patient and the treating physician before and independently from the decision to
             include the patient in this study

          -  Male or female, age greater than or equal to 18 years at the time of signing informed
