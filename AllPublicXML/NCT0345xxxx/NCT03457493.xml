  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this substudy is to measure the concentration and the regional brain
      distribution of activated brain microglia/macrophages using the PET ligand [18F]DPA-714 in
      participants enrolled in the UAB Neuroinflammation in PD study. The PET tracer [18F]DPA-714
      binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO, also known as the peripheral benzodiazepine
      receptor) in the mitochondria of activated microglia/macrophages and provides a non-invasive
      measure of neuroinflammation. The amount and distribution of [18F]DPA-714 in the brain will
      be correlated to clinical data acquired through the separate ongoing Neuroinflammation in PD
      study. The primary objective of this study is to determine if patients with PD have higher
      levels of neuroinflammation than healthy controls as measured with [18F]DPA-714-PET/MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrollment in the UAB Neuroinflammation in PD study under the separate UAB approved
             research protocol IRB-300000690.

          2. Negative urine or serum hCG test within 2 days of [18F]DPA-714-PET administration in
             women of child bearing potential. Women who are post-menopausal with at least 1 year
             since last menses or documented surgical sterilization will not require pregnancy
             testing.

          3. High or mixed affinity binder for TSPO ligands based on genotyping for single
             nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meets any exclusion criteria for the UAB Neuroinflammation in PD study.

          2. Contraindication to MRI and/or PET imaging

          3. Inability to participate in the imaging studies due to severity of PD or other medical
             comorbidities.

          4. Low affinity binder for TSPO ligands based on genotyping for SNP rs6971. -
