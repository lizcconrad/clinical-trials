    <textblock>
      Rationale: Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is the treatment of first choice for couples with
      unexplained and mild male factor infertility in many countries, but it is controversial
      whether ovarian stimulation improves fertility outcomes. In recent retrospectively collected
      data, investigators found that in couples with unexplained and mild male factor infertility
      undergoing IUI, ovarian stimulation with letrozole increased live birth rate as compared to
      natural cycle IUI without substantially increasing the multiple pregnancy rate. Investigators
      therefore perform a randomized clinical trial (RCT) on the subject in the Centre of
      Reproductive Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.

      Objective: To test the hypothesis that in couples with unexplained or mild male factor
      infertility scheduled for an IUI program ovarian stimulation with letrozole increases the
      live birth rate as compared to natural cycle treatment.

      Study design Randomized clinical trial.

      Study population Women diagnosed with unexplained or mild male factor infertility scheduled
      for treatment with IUI.

      Intervention Women will be randomized for ovarian stimulation with letrozole or to natural
      cycle IUI. In the group allocated to ovarian stimulation, women will receive oral tablets
      letrozole 5 mg daily from cycle day 3-5 for 5 days. Investigators will treat the couples for
      3 cycles, with a time horizon of 4 months.

      Main study parameters/endpoints Primary outcome is ongoing pregnancy leading to live birth.
      Secondary endpoints are clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage rates, pregnancy
      complications and patients' costs.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness The strategies compared are already broadly applied in current practice. No
      additional risks are expected. There is no benefit for participants, but the results may
      benefit future subfertile couples.
