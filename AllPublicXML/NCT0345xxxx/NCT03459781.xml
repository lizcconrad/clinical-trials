  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of solid tumor cancers and their informal caregivers (family members or friends)
      experience significant impairments in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) including
      disruptions in psychological, physical, social, and spiritual well-being. Our prior work
      demonstrates that impairments in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and negative affect
      experienced by cancer survivors across time are strongly related to, or interdependent with,
      those experienced by their informal caregivers. These findings suggest that interventions
      directed simultaneously toward both members of the cancer survivor-caregiver dyad may be
      especially impactful in improving HRQOL in cancer survivors and informal caregivers. Although
      a number of interventions have been developed and tested to support the survivor or the
      caregiver, few have attempted to simultaneously intervene with both to improve HRQOL within
      the collective survivor-caregiver dyad. CBCT®, Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (already
      piloted by members of this team with breast cancer survivors, is an 8-week manualized
      meditation-based program that starts with attention and mindfulness training and builds to
      contemplation about compassion for the self and others. It differs from other meditation
      interventions in that it directly enhances self-compassion, feelings of social connection,
      empathy for others, and equanimity and by doing so lessens emotional suffering. Our recent
      findings suggest that CBCT® may reduce depressive symptoms, fear of cancer recurrence, and
      improve vitality in breast cancer survivors. The proposed pilot feasibility study builds upon
      this work to intervene with caregivers in addition to survivors of solid tumor cancers. The
      major aim of the proposed project is to test the feasibility and acceptability of CBCT® for
      survivors of solid tumor cancer and their informal caregivers after the end of cancer
      treatment. The project will also determine in a preliminary manner whether or not CBCT®
      (compared to a cancer health education [CHE] comparison group) has a positive impact on
      different measures of HRQOL (e.g. features of depression and anxiety, fatigue, social
      isolation), stress-related biomarkers of inflammation and cortisol, and assessments related
      to healthcare utilization (medication adherence and patient healthcare-related activation).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of this research is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and
      preliminary efficacy of Cognitively-Based Compassion Training (CBCT®) compared to a cancer
      health education (CHE) attention on dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQOL),
      biomarkers of inflammation and diurnal cortisol rhythm, and healthcare utilization-related
      endpoints including medication adherence and healthcare-related patient activation. To
      address this goal the study will be conducted to address four specific aims:

      Aim 1: To determine the feasibility, acceptability, and obtain preliminary evidence of
      efficacy (as reflected by the effect sizes) of an 8-week CBCT® (Cognitively-Based Compassion
      Training) program for survivors of solid tumor cancer and their informal caregivers to impact
      health-related quality of life outcomes. The objective of this aim is to determine
      feasibility and acceptability of CBCT® for cancer survivor-caregiver dyads compared to CHE,
      and to also obtain preliminary measures of pre to post intervention change on HRQOL including
      psychological (depression features, anxiety features, negative affect), physical (fatigue),
      social (empathy, feelings of social isolation, dyadic function), and spiritual
      (self-compassion) domain as well as global well-being.

      Aim 2: To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy (as reflected by the effect sizes) of an
      8-week CBCT® program for survivors of solid tumor cancer and their informal caregivers on
      stress-related biomarkers of inflammation and diurnal cortisol rhythm. The objective of this
      aim is to obtain preliminary measures of pre to post intervention change on stress-related
      biomarkers of inflammation (plasma interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF)- alpha, peripheral blood mononuclear cell [PBMC] nuclear factor-kB [NF-kB] pathway
      activation), as well as diurnal saliva cortisol change in survivor-caregiver dyads randomized
      to CBCT® compared to survivor-caregiver dyads randomized to CHE.

      Aim 3: To explore health care adherence in both survivors of solid tumor cancer and their
      informal caregivers, and obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy of the 8-week CBCT® program
      (as reflected by the effect sizes) on patient healthcare-related activation. The objective of
      this aim is to obtain preliminary measures of pre to post intervention change in medication
      adherence (of medications prescribed by participant' healthcare providers) and healthcare
      activation (i.e. intent to use cancer-related survivorship plans [survivor] and management
      plans of other chronic conditions [survivor and caregiver) in survivor-caregiver dyads
      randomized to CBCT® compared to survivor-caregiver dyads randomized to CHE.

      Aim 4: To explore the interdependence of solid tumor cancer survivor and informal caregiver
      health-related quality of life from before to after CBCT® (Cognitively-Based Compassion
      Training). The objective of this aim is to statistically determine the degree to which
      changes of HRQOL measures, biomarkers of inflammation, or diurnal cortisol rhythm in
      survivors predicts changes in caregivers (or vice-versa). We will use methods used by our
      group previously according to the actor-partner interdependence model.

      Over the course of the study we will randomize 20 cancer survivor-caregiver dyads to CBCT®,
      and 20 dyads to the CHE attention group. We will conduct the study in two cohorts, with 10
      dyads randomized to CBCT® and 10 dyads randomized with CHE in each cohort. The research
      procedures are elaborated below in chronological order of when they will occur for each study
      cohort. The study will consist of four major phases after recruitment/ screening/ consent:

        1. Baseline (pre-intervention) assessments

        2. Intervention phase

        3. 8-week (post-intervention) assessments

        4. 3-month (post intervention) assessments

      Assessments - Baseline (pre-intervention)

      After successful recruitment, screening, and consent we will invite solid tumor cancer
      survivor-informal caregiver dyads to the College of Nursing for the baseline assessment.
      Shortly after arrival blood will be collected from participants before starting self-report
      questionnaires. Blood will be drawn in order to obtain plasma and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Blood (2 X 7 milliliters) will be collected by venipuncture into
      EDTA-coated vacutainer tubes by the (TBA) study phlebotomist, and then immediately processed
      to obtain plasma or PBMCs.

      After blood sampling at the baseline assessment is complete we will next ask
      survivor-caregiver dyads to complete self-report assessments. Self-report instruments to be
      completed will assess different dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and
      healthcare adherence/ utilization.

      Interventions

      Within 2 weeks of the baseline assessment study participants will begin either 8 weeks of
      CBCT® or 8 weeks of CHE, depending on randomization. Study group will be revealed to study
      participants and study staff after the completion of the baseline assessment.

      Upon randomization to either the CBCT® or CHE groups participants will be given a booklet,
      &quot;Survivorship and Surveillance Guidelines&quot;, and another booklet, &quot;Healthy Behaviors for a
      Healthier Life.&quot; Although these booklets will not be referred to directly throughout CBCT® or
      CHE, participants will be encouraged review them and ask questions about the content of these
      booklets throughout the study. Participants with questions after reviewing these booklets
      will be referred to Dr. Badger, clinical co-I. These booklets are being included because they
      may have an indirect effect on measures of health care adherence/ utilization in both the
      CBCT® and CHE groups.

      Assessments - 8 weeks

      Within a week of concluding the study interventions we will schedule all survivor-caregiver
      dyads to return to the College of Nursing for the 8-week assessment. The 8-week assessment
      will mirror the baseline assessment except for the healthcare utilization questionnaire,
      which will use an 8-week version of this questionnaire.

      Assessments - 3 months

      About 4 weeks later we will have all survivor-caregiver dyads visit the College of Nursing
      for the final, 3-month assessment time point. As with the 8-week assessment, this visit will
      mirror the baseline assessment except for a different healthcare utilization questionnaire,
      which will use a 3-month version of this questionnaire.

    <description>CBCT® was designed at Emory University by Lobsang Tenzin Negi. CBCT® is a secular adaptation of techniques derived from traditional Tibetan Buddhist methods for cultivating compassion known as lo-jong. Over the course of 8 weeks there will a total of 8 CBCT® sessions, one session per week, led by the CBCT® instructor. Dyads will attend the weekly CBCT® classes together. Each weekly session will last for 90 minutes and will begin with brief meditation to focus attention. The instructor will then articulate content and goals of the current week, after which a group discussion led by the instructor will take place. A session will end with a 20-30 minute meditation. Dyads will be encouraged to practice a minimum of 10 minutes per day at home, and together as a dyad if possible.</description>

    <description>The cancer health education (CHE) intervention is an adaptation of the in-person program called Health Discussion, a protocol used by our group previously. The CHE will focus on relevant topics to health and cancer including 1) cancer advocacy, 2) health and cancer biology, 3) nutrition, 4) lifestyle interventions such as physical activity and goals for physical activity, 5) the importance of good sleep, 6) the impact of stress, and 7) mental health and social support. CHE will also discuss current events related to cancer. Over the course of 8 weeks there will be a total of 8 sessions, one session per week. Each session will last for approximately 90 minutes.</description>
