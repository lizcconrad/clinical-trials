  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to determine whether the effect of gut microbiota on
      human metabolism might be mediated by short chain fatty acids (SCFA) and whether the SCFA
      might modulate lipid metabolism.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This would be the first study determining the effect of SCFA synthesis on hepatic de novo
      lipogenesis and to assess whether and how isocaloric dietary changes (namely low
      carbohydrates) might modify the composition of the gut microbiota and reduce the synthesis of
      SCFA during adolescence, a sensitive period for the development of obesity.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>For an equal amount of dietary carbohydrates, obese youth will synthesize short chain fatty acids at higher rates than lean youth.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be given orally 15g of deuterated inulin every 30 minutes.Total acetate is calculated by summing the synthetic rates of the single acetate. The primary outcome will be the peak percent change from fasting in total acetate estimated by dividing the difference between total acetate at fasting and the peak total acetate by the total acetate at fasting.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>If high rates of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis enhance hepatic de novo lipogenesis.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will consume 2g of Inulin, 13g of unlabeled inulin. Blood draws will be taken every hour. To evaluate the association between total SCFA and de novo lipogenesis, peak percent changes in de novo lipogenesis will be regressed on peak percent changes in total SCFA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The effect of an isocaloric low carbohydrate (CHO) diet on the bacterial synthesis of short chain fatty acids (SCFA).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be enrolled in a low carbohydrate diet. The percent change in peak total acetate rate, calculated as the follow-up peak total acetate minus the baseline peak total acetate divided by the baseline peak total acetate, will be compared between the low CHO period and the control period.</description>

    <description>The experimental diet will consist of 30% carbohydrates (CHO), 35% protein, and 35% fat. Since the experimental diet is lower in CHO, the fiber and sugar content will be calculated based on total CHO in the same percentage as the control (0.25 g fiber per each kcal of CHO and 18.2% sugar for total CHO).</description>
