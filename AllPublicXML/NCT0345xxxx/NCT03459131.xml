        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Able to understand and sign an approved informed consent form (ICF);

          -  Successful wear of BIOFINITY® (spherical) (or private label) contact lenses in both
             eyes for a minimum of 5 days per week and 8 hours per day during the past 3 months;

          -  Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 20/25 or better in each eye;

          -  Possess spectacles that provide a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in both
             eyes (OU) and be willing to wear them (as needed);

          -  Currently using digital devices (computer, tablet, and/or smart phone) for a minimum
             of 5 days per week and 4 hours per day;

          -  Other protocol-specified inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, abnormality or disease that
             contraindicates contact lens wear;

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated;

          -  Refractive, ocular, or intraocular surgery, as specified in the protocol;

          -  Current or history of eye injury or disorders, as specified in the protocol;

          -  Current or history of intolerance, hypersensitivity or allergy to any component of the
             study products;

          -  Habitual contact lens wear in an extended wear modality (routinely sleeping in lenses
             for at least 1 night per week) over the last 3 months prior to enrollment;

          -  Use of topical ocular medications that would require instillation during contact lens
             wear;

          -  Other protocol-specified exclusion criteria may apply.
