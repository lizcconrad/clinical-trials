      The goal of this proposal is to perform first-in-man evaluation of the imaging probe F-18
      tetrafluoroborate (BF4) as a PET imaging biomarker for expression of the human sodium/iodide
      symporter (hNIS) in tissues. Imaging of functional hNIS activity in tissues with [18F]BF4 is
      anticipated to provide superior sensitivity and image quality to Tc-99m SPECT for monitoring
      hNIS transduction effected by viral therapies. The proposed work is designed to 1) evaluate
      the imaging feasibility in comparison with Tc-99m SPECT of hNIS expression in a) 10 myeloma
      patients treated with Edmonston Measles virus-NIS (MV-NIS) and b) 10 endometrial cancer
      patients treated with vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to express human interferon-and
      NIS (VSV-hINF-NIS). This data will be necessary to support future regulatory submissions.

               4. Decompensated congestive heart failure.

               5. Significant cardiac arrhythmia or conduction disturbance, particularly those
                  resulting in atrial or ventricular fibrillation, or causing syncope, near

          7. Patients who had received an investigational medication within the last 30 days or who
             have participated in a clinical trial involving medications other than the related
             MV-NIS or VSV-NIS viruses in the last 30 days. Additionally, the time between the last
             dose of the previous experimental medication and enrollment (completion of screening
             assessments) must be at least equal to 5 times the terminal half-life of the previous
             experimental medication.

          8. Patients with current clinically significant medical comorbidities that might pose a
