      A study of plasma and tissue vancomycin pharmacokinetics in pediatric surgical patients.

  <detailed_description>

      Background: Vancomycin is used for antibiotic prophylaxis in pediatric surgical patients
      without a complete understanding of plasma and soft tissue pharmacokinetics. Guidelines
      recommend incision within 60 minutes after administration; however, tissue concentrations of
      vancomycin at that early time may not be therapeutic. The Investigators conducted a study of
      plasma and tissue concentrations in pediatric neurosurgical and orthopedic patients to
      characterize intraoperative vancomycin pharmacokinetics.

      Patients, ages (0.1-18.8 years), undergoing posterior spinal fusion (n=30) or
      ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (n=30), received intravenous vancomycin 15 mg/kg over
      one hour. Skin biopsies were taken at incision and skin closure. Blood samples were also
      collected at incision and closure; additional samples were drawn at 2- and 4-hours if patient
      was still in surgery. Population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis was performed to characterize
      PK parameter estimates and to develop a model of intraoperative plasma and tissue vancomycin
      concentrations vs. time.
