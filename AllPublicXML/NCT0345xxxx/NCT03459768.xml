    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the CoDISEN cohort study is to propose a model of prevention and care for
      HIV and viral hepatitis adapted to the needs of people who inject drugs (PWID) in Dakar,
      Senegal.

      THE UNODC estimated the number of consumers of injectable drugs at 1,02 millions in 2012 in
      Africa among which 12,1 % lived with HIV. Prevalences of HIV, chronic hepatitis C and B among
      people who inject drugs remain little documented in Sub-Saharan Africa. The transmission of
      HCV in Africa is mainly hospital-borne, bound to a precarious transfusional and therapeutic
      safety. However, the transmission by intravenous drug use emerges as a new stake in public
      health in urban areas. The report of a strong HIV prevalence in the population of PWID in the
      sub-region ( for example, In 2007, in the Cape Verde, prevalence of the HIV was 14 % in
      emprisoned PWID against 0,8 % in the general population) contributed to assert the reality of
      the use of intravenous drugs in the region and the vulnerability of this population. Senegal,
      a country with an concentrated HIV epidemic [0,5 % prevalence in 2012, WHO source] is the
      first country of western Africa to have measured prevalence of HIV (5,2 %), HBV (7,9 %) and
      HCV (23,3 %) in PWID (Study ANRS 12243). In view of these results, the Senegalese authorities
      introduced from October, 2011 in Dakar, activities of harm reduction by means of a mobile
      team of social workers and mediators allowing individual and collective activities of
      prevention, needle exchange program, references for care and follow-up, as well as a opioid
      substitution program in a methadone center (CEPIAD) located in Dakar, first of its kind in
      Western Africa. The objective of the present research project thus is to estimate the impact
      of a strategy of &quot; test and treat &quot; of HIV and harm reduction initiatives on the prevalence
      and incidence of HIV, HBV and HCV infections in an population of injectable drug consumers
      followed in the methadone center ( CEPIAD) of Dakar, Senegal
