  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute myelocytic leukemia ( AML) is a highly heterogeneous group of malignant hematopathy.
      Chromosomal translocation with t (8; 21) (q22; q22) , about 10 ~ 15% incidence in AML and 40%
      incidence in the AML-M2 type of leukemia, is a karyotype that is considered to have a good
      prognosis. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that
      high-dose Ara-c regimens may benefit for patients, but with 30 to 40% relapse and serious
      risks on myelosuppression, infection and bleeding in high-dose Ara-c consolidation
      chemotherapy and more than 70% recurrence rate with （tyrosine kinase）KIT mutation. So the
      exploration of a relatively safe and efficient consolidation therapy is one of the difficult
      problems to be solved in the treatment of mitigatory t (8; 21) AML.
