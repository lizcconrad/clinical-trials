  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized clinical trial testing an implementation intervention to support
      delivery of a behavioral weight loss program at community mental health programs.
      Investigators will conduct a pilot trial testing a standard and an enhanced implementation
      intervention. The evidenced based intervention investigators are basing the behavioral weight
      loss program on is ACHIEVE, and investigators are calling the translated weight loss program
      ACHIEVE-D. The standard version of the implementation intervention, which will train
      community mental health program staff to become ACHIEVE-D coaches and peers to become
      ACHIEVE-D peer-leaders, will include in-person and online training and avatar-assisted
      motivational interviewing practice, as well as organizational strategy meetings. The enhanced
      implementation intervention will include all of these strategies + performance coaching for
      ACHIEVE-D coaches.
