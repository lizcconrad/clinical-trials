      Background

      Trauma is a critical global public health concern and the number of fatalities as a result of
      trauma continues to increase globally. In 2016 more than 4,6 million deaths were the result
      of trauma making it the 8th leading cause of death. In the Global Burden and Disease study
      (GBD), traumatic injuries account for nearly one-tenth of all deaths, more than malaria,
      tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and maternal conditions combined.

      TBI is defined as brain injury caused by trauma, trauma being defined as damage inflicted on
      the body as the direct or indirect result of an external force, with or without disruption of
      structural continuity. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality globally. It is the largest contributor to trauma deaths in the world, having three
      times higher mortality rate than trauma without accompanied TBI. It is estimated that TBI
      affects more than 10 million people annually.

      To guide physicians in diagnostics and resuscitation regimes, prognostic models predicting
      TBI severity and outcome are of great importance. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is one of the
      most widely used prognostic model. It is a neurological scale developed to assess the
      response to stimuli in patients with craniocerebral injuries by using three parameters; eye
      opening, verbal response and motor response. It has been used to assess level of
      consciousness in both clinical practice and neurotrauma research. The GCS Score, the sum of
      the three parameters used in GCS is used to assess severity, ranging from mild, moderate to
      severe.

      Several studies have researched the prognostic value of GCS and the prognostic value of GCS
      individual components, but little is known about how the relationship of time between injury
      and first GCS affects the predictive value of GCS. Studies have shown that GCS measured on
      admission to trauma care is more predictive than GCS measured at the trauma site, and that
      the median GCS on admission is higher than the median GCS at trauma site but if and how time
      affects GCS scores has not been studied.

      Aim

      The aim of this study is to assess how the timing of measuring GCS affects its predictive
      value after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adult patients. The first objective is to assess
      if the predictive performance of GCS is improved if adjusted for time from injury to when it
      was recorded. The second objective is to assess if the predictive performance of GCS varies
      depending on when it was recorded.

      Study Design

      This is a retrospective analysis of the cohort study Towards Improved Trauma Care Outcomes in
      India (TITCO).

      Setting

      The de-identified TITCO cohort will be used. This cohort includes 16,000 patients enrolled
      between July 2013 and December 2015 from four university hospitals in India. Project
      officers, holding a health science master degree, collected data prospectively on admission
      at each site by direct observation of the emergency room and filling out a standardized form.
      The project officers worked in rotating eight-hour shifts (morning, evening, night). Data was
      also retrieved retrospectively from patient records for patients admitted outside the
      observed shifts.

      Source and method of participant selection

      The one-site project officer included patients from participating hospitals, either by
      prospective observation or by retrospective data retrieval from patient records.

      Explanatory variables The two explanatory variables of interest will be GCS and time between
      injury and GCS recording in hours, henceforth referred to as time to GCS. GCS was extracted
      from patient records as was the date and time of first GCS recorded. If date and time of
      first GCS recording are missing date then time of arrival to the participating centre will be
      used instead. Date and time of injury were extracted from patient records or directly
      reported by participants. Data and time of first GCS recording or arrival to participating
      centre were extracted from patient records.

      Covariates The variables age, sex, mechanism of injury, whether the patient was transferred
      from another health facility, and anatomical injury severity quantified using the injury
      severity score (ISS) will be reported to characterise the study sample. Age, sex, mechanism
      of injury and transfer status were either extracted from patient records or reported by
      participants. ISS was calculated by a single accredited coder based on injury text
      descriptions.

      Bias

      To account for human errors in recording GCS, Aal data collector observers were holders of
      health science master degrees and were continually trained and supervised throughout the data
      collection period.

      Quantitative variables

      GCS will be treated both as a linear term and as an ordinal variable with 12 levels. The
      non-testable levels of the verbal and eye components will be treated as 1. Time between
      injury and recorded GCS will be treated both as a continuous variable and a categorical
      variable. When treated as continuous time between injury and GCS will be allowed to have a
      non-linear association with mortality by modelling it using restricted cubic splines with
      three knots placed at equally spaced percentiles. When treated as categorical it will be
      divided into blocks of two hours.

      Statistical methods

      All analyses will be conducted in the statistical language and programming environment R. The
      sample will first be temporally split into training and validation samples as outlined in the
      study size section below. Each sample will then be characterised using medians and
      inter-quartile ranges (IQR) to present quantitative variables and counts and percentages to
      present qualitative variables.

      In the training sample four simple prediction models will be fit using logistic regression
      with mortality as the outcome. The first model will include only GCS as a linear term, the
      second GCS as a linear term and time to GCS modelled using restricted cubic splines, the
      third only GCS as an ordinal variable, and the fourth model GCS as an ordinal variable and
      time to GCS modelled using restricted cubic splines. To avoid overfitting a shrinkage factor
      will be estimated using a bootstrapping procedure which will then be applied to the model
      coefficients.

      The four models will then be applied in the validation sample and their predictive
      performance estimated and compared. Predictive performance of each model will be evaluated
      using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC), positive and
      negative predictive values. Differences in predictive performance between models and
      associated 95% confidence intervals will be estimated using bootstrapping.

      Each of the training and validation samples will then be divided into subsamples based on
      time to GCS, so that the first subsample includes patients with time to GCS &lt; 2 hours and the
      second subsample includes patients with time to GCS between two and four hours and so on in
      blocks of two hours. In each of the training subsamples a simple logistic model will be fit
      including GCS as a linear term as the only independent variable. The coefficient of GCS in
      each model will be shrunk.

      The model developed in the first training subsample will then be applied to the first
      validation subsample and so on. Model performance in each validation subsamples will be
      evaluated using AUROCC and root mean square error. The trend in these measures across
      validation subsamples will then be quantified using a simple generalised linear model with
      performance measure data as the outcome variable and a nonlinear transformation of block
      index number using restricted cubic splines with three knots as the only independent
      variable.

      Strategy to handle missing data

      If the required sample size is reached if only patients with complete data on the outcome,
      explanatory variable, and covariates are included then a complete case analysis will be
      conducted. If not then missing data will be handled with multiple imputation using chained
      equations. The number of imputed datasets will be equal to the percentage of incomplete
      observations. The analysis will be conducted separately in each imputed dataset and the main
      results presented as medians with IQR across imputations. For confidence intervals the most
      extreme values of pooled upper and lower bounds will be reported.

      Study size

      The most data intensive analysis is likely to be fitting the model with GCS as an ordinal
      variable and time to GCS as restricted cubic splines and therefore the study size is
      estimated to accommodate this analysis. Simulation studies indicate that logistic regression
      models need at least ten events, or observations with the outcome, per included parameter to
      generate reliable coefficient estimates. Modelling GCS as an ordinal variable will involve
      estimating coefficients for eleven parameters and including time to GCS adds two additional
      parameters. The total number of parameters is then 13, indicating a need for at least 130
      events. Assuming an outcome prevalence of 20% based on previous research the training sample
      needs to include at least 650 observations. If this number is less than half of the complete
      sample then the training and validation samples will be generated by splitting the complete
      sample in two parts of equal size. If the complete sample includes less than 1300
      observations the first 650 observations will be included in the training sample and the
      remaining observations will be included in the validation sample. Regardless, the samples
      will be created in such a way that the relative contribution of each centre is approximately
      the same in both samples.
