  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine the best time to offer Meaning-Centered
      Psychotherapy (MCP), an intervention that has proven to be helpful in improving spiritual
      well-being and decreasing existential distress among patients with advanced cancer, to
      caregivers. (MCP has also been shown to be an appropriate method of attending to the
      palliative or comfort care needs of caregivers of patients with cancer. Studies show that the
      psychological burden associated with caring for a patient with advanced cancer is often
      greater than that experienced by the patients themselves.) The investigators would also like
      to find out about caregivers initial impressions of MCP-C, Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for
      Cancer Caregivers, so that the intervention can be adjusted to meet the unique needs of
      caregivers of patients with Glioblastoma.

    <measure>Feasibility of Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers (MCP-C) delivered to caregivers of participants with GBM</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be measured by our ability to recruit our target sample of 60 ICs within the 1-year enrollment period. Our feasibility target for completion of follow-up assessments if 80% at T2 and 60% at T3, based on typical assessment completion rates in other psychosocial intervention studies conducted at our institution.</description>

    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability will be informed by the MCP-C completion rate and Phase 2 semi-structured interviews (deemed acceptable if at least 40% complete all psychotherapy sessions).</description>

    <description>Focus group (Phase 1) of four to ten GBM ICs bereaved at least one year to help determine our recruitment strategy. Participants will be asked to reflect on their caregiving experience and specifically, when the receipt of a supportive intervention that addresses existential distress would have been most appropriate and well received. Should consensus among participants be reached (e.g., if the majority report that being approached at time of their loved one's cancer recurrence would have been the optimal time for enrollment), we will target our enrollment timeline to this point (and this timeline will be reflected in amended inclusion criteria). If no consensus is reached, the study staff will enroll ICs at all points in the caregiving trajectory and revisit the appropriateness of various points of contact during the Phase 2 individual interviews.</description>

    <description>In Phase 2, we will recruit 60 ICs of patients with GBM who will be randomized to receive either MCP-C or EUC. MCP-C will be delivered individually over 7 1-hour-long sessions within 7 - 14 weeks.</description>

    <intervention_name>Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy for Cancer Caregivers / MCP-C</intervention_name>
    <description>MCP-C is structured as a 7-session (1-hour weekly or biweekly sessions) individual intervention that utilizes a mixture of didactics, discussion and experiential exercises that focus around particular themes related to meaning and cancer caregiving</description>

    <intervention_name>Enhanced Usual Care / EUC</intervention_name>
    <description>The &quot;enhancement&quot; to usual care in this study involves the inclusion of screening and targeted referral components as suggested by Reynolds et al. [79]. Research study assistants conducting the screening and providing feedback and referrals will be trained in the NCCN guidelines for distress management and will discuss the screening results and associated recommendations with the study PI (NCCN) [63]. As of November, 2017, ICs of patients seen in the Neurology Service at MSKCC are not consistently screened for distress and offered targeted referrals. Participants randomized to EUC will receive feedback about their level of distress (based on the Distress Thermometer administered at screening) after randomization. Within a week of randomization, and post-baseline, the study RSA will send EUC participants appropriate targeted referrals based on levels of distress and problem areas endorsed.</description>

        Phase II Randomized Intervention of GBM ICs:

          -  Age &gt;/= 19

          -  Score of &gt; 4 on the Distress Thermometer (DT) and indication that this distress is
