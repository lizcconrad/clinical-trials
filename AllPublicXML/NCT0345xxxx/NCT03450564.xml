    <textblock>
      The cluster randomized controlled trial will be done in Pastoralist community of Afar region,
      Ethiopia for a total of nine months. There will be three arms in the study. The type of
      randomization will be a cluster randomized controlled trial where kebele are randomized to
      two different interventions and control groups together. These interventions are women
      education to use family planning and male education/involvement to enhance family planning
      use in the community.

      This study hypothesized that doing on women education and men education/involvement in family
      planning utilization would be a practical way to achieve for an increment of family planning
      utilization in Pastoralist community of Afar region.

      The study will be carried out in Afar region, North Eastern Ethiopia from October 1, 2017, to
      June 1, 2018. A three-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial will be used to answer the
      objective of the study. The type of randomization will be a cluster randomized controlled
      trial where kebele are randomized to two different interventions and one control groups
      together. These interventions are women education to use family planning and male
      education/involvement to enhance family planning use in the community.

      The unit of randomization is clustered which are kebeles in a different district. From a
      given district 11 Kebele will be selected randomly gives a total of 33 kebele. The 33 cluster
      were allocated to the 2 interventions and one control arms by having a meeting with community
      leaders, and a representative from the district health office and Regional Health Bureau. A
      cluster code will be written and put in a box. They will be given an option to draw a lottery
      either to the two interventions or control arm. One of the community leaders will be given
      the responsibility to draw 3 clusters consecutively from the box and assign into either two
      interventions or control arm. The same step will be done for the 33 cluster. The detail
      description of the two interventions and one control arm is described below.

        -  Arm 1): existing standard family planning service provision by the government health
           sectors.

        -  Arm 2): It focuses on the involvement of men to enhance the utilization of family
           planning by their wives and educating the women in the male intervention area.

        -  Arm 3): It deals with educating married women to use family planning.

      Data collection tool, procedures, and follow-up The data collection tool contains
      socio-demographic and determinant of health, reproductive history, knowledge, Attitude, and
      practice of family planning. Besides, it has tools on male involvement in contraceptive and
      mass media exposure to family planning. For the items of knowledge, attitude and male
      involvement reliability and validity tests were done. The modification was made based on the
      finding of the reliability and validity test. The test was done in 118 married women.
      Finally, the tool will be prepared based on the finding from the reliability and validity
      test of the pilot test. An experience data collector with health background and Afarri
      speaking will be recruited to collect the data. Besides, a master holder with health
      profession will be employed to supervise the whole data collection process. The data will be
      collected by using a mobile-based application called open data kit (ODK). Immediately after
      the data checked for its completeness, it will be sent to the Mekelle University Server. An
      information technology person at the Mekelle University server will be assessing the whole
      data quality and information will be provided for the data collector to take corrective
      action while they are in the field.

      â€¢ In the initial step, a pre-intervention survey will be conducted after the randomization
      and allocation. Following the pre-intervention, a follow-up data will be collected in six and
      12 months. Each participating household (intervention arm) will receive a package of health
      education about family planning messages based on the intervention type every month by
      experts, clan/religious leader and model women in using family planning. The type of Health
      education will be contextualized to the target group namely women and men intervention.

      Intervention description:

      The community-based intervention in this study includes two components. These are educating
      women to use family planning and male involvement for use of family planning.

      Analysis plan and statistics methods Statistical analyses will be performed by using R
      software Version 3.4.2. Intention- to- treat analysis will be used to compare the proportion
      of women who use contraceptive based on the randomization. Besides, the follow-up data will
      be analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE). Before analysis, the data will be
      restructured from a vertical list to horizontal which allows the data to follow on a
      longitudinal basis. And the finding of the pre-intervention data will be compared to the
      follow-up data and post-intervention data.

      Ethical consideration Permission to undertake the study was obtained from Mekelle University
      College of Health Sciences institutional review board. And an official letter of cooperation
      will be given to Afar Regional Health Bureau. Informed consent to participate in the study
      will be secured before conducting the interview. For this, a one-page consent letter will be
      attached to the cover page of each questionnaire and it will be explained to study
      participants that participation is voluntary and confidential and private information would
      be protected. Information about the study will be given to the participants. The right of the
      respondent to withdraw from the interview or not to participate will be respected.
      Identification of an informant will possible only through specific identification numbers.

    <intervention_name>Women Education</intervention_name>
    <description>This intervention intends to provide health education message for women and men to enhance FP utilization in pastoralist community. It was cognizant that, Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa. And there is a great discrepancy between contraceptive use, unmet need for FP and maternal and child morbidity and mortality between the pastoralist and agrarian community. Pastoralist community in the country expressed as low contraceptive users, a high unmet need for FP and highest maternal and child morbidity and mortality. The previous study indicates that only 8.5% of the women use contraceptive. The most common reason mentioned for not using of contraceptive are lack of awareness, demand for a large number of children and male dominance in all decision making power in general and FP in particular. In light of this, the study hypothesized that working with men and educating women towards the use of FP could enhance the use of family planning utilization.</description>

    <description>Male involvement will be a feature of intervention in this arm. Comprehensive health education by family planning expert, health extension workers and clan/religious leader to enhance family planning (FP) utilization will be given for male and women. In pastoralist community the most reason mentioned for not using of FP are husband objection and religion influence. And most of the decisions are in the palm of husband to seek care for reproductive, maternal and neonatal health in general and FP in particular. Besides, the pastoralist community manifested by high total fertility rate and maternal and child morbidity and mortality.</description>
