  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparison of two lens designs manufactured in the same material. The hypothesis is the
      subjectively rated performance of comfort, vision and lens handling will be better with the
      modified design compared to the initial design
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      The objectives of the study are

        1. to identify possible reasons for the different comfort and vision experience in Japanese
           CL wearers compared to Caucasian CL wearers and

        2. to assess whether the modification of lens thickness in the optical zone results in
           increased comfort and reduced visual acuity fluctuations in Caucasian eyes.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a double-masked, cross-over, bilateral wear study design with five (5) study visits across three (3) study visit days. Participants will be dispensed and wear both the initial and modified lens design for a total of six (6) hours each on two (2) separate visit days, with the order of lens wear being randomized; participants will be allowed to leave the CCLR on their lens wearing days between dispense and follow-up visit.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This will be a double-masked study, with both the study participants and study investigators being masked to the order of lens wear for the initial and modified DD lens design. Study lenses will be dispensed to the participants at V2 and V4 by unmasked research assistants from paper cups. Lenses and blister-pack solution will be directly transferred into the paper cups, and only the paper cups will be taken to the examination room where lenses are being dispensed.</masking_description>
