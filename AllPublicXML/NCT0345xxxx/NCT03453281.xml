  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one month pre post intervention study. Subjects with diabetic macular edema were
      given intravitreal anti VEGF (Aflibercept) injection. Central retinal thickness, macular
      electrophysiology, and visual acuity were observed one week and one month after injection was
      given to the eye to describe early anatomical, physiological, and clinical changes. We
      hypothesized that changes to these outcomes can be found and documented.
