  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is a common reason for medical consultation affecting 6.7 % of the adults from
      50 to 70 years old and until 21 % of the adults over 70. Among these painful shoulders,
      rotator cuff tendinopathy represents 44 to 65% of these consultations. To treat this
      condition, patients usually receive analgesics and physical therapy. When these treatments
      are not effective, a corticosteroid sub-acromial injection is proposed. However, according to
      the literature, there is only about 50% of good response to this subacromial injection in
      rotator cuff tendinopathy. It has been suggested that the injection could be more effective
      in the presence of an inflammation over the tendons called bursitis. However, no studies have
      clearly established this. The objective of the study is to determine if the presence of a
      bursitis could be a factor of good response to corticosteroid injection. The results could
      allow us to determine which patients have the best profile to respond to subacromial
      injection. The investigators hope that these data would improve the treatment of this
      frequent disease.

      Patients referred to receive a subacromial ultrasound-guided injection for shoulder pain
      related to a rotator cuff tendinopathy will be enrolled in the study. After validation of the
      inclusion criteria, the participants will receive oral information about the protocol. Then,
      they will be examined and will undergo X-rays and an ultrasound of their shoulder. Pain
      shoulder and shoulder disability will be assessed before the injection with a visual analogic
      pain scale and the Oxford Shoulder Score questionnaire, respectively.

      The subacromial injection will be performed under ultrasound guidance to accurately inject
      the subacromial bursae. After skin disinfection with povidone, the injection will be
      performed with a 21G needle. The bursae will be injected with 2 ml of lidocaine 2% and 1 ml
      of betamethasone.

      After the procedure, the participants will all receive a standardized physiotherapy.

      For primary outcome, the therapeutic response will be assessed 3 months after the procedure.
      Patients will be considered as having a good response if their level of pain decreases by
      over 30%.

      The number of participants having a good clinical response will be compared between the
      patients presenting a bursitis and those without bursitis. The comparison will be made using
      a Chi-2 test.

      Others parameters will be studied: reduction in pain 6 weeks after the injection, reduction
      in shoulder disability 6 weeks and 3 months after the injection. Other ultrasound lesions
      will be collected so as X-ray features to search other factors associated with the presence
      or absence of a good therapeutic response (details in secondary outcomes).

    <description>The primary outcome is the presence of a therapeutic response 3 months after the intervention. The level of pain will be assessed by a visual analogic pain scale of 0 (absence of pain) to 10 centimeters (maximal pain).
Participants will be considered as good responders if their level of pain decreases more than 30 percent.

    <description>The OSS is a 12-item shoulder-specific questionnaire that was developed, with patients, for the assessment of shoulder pain and function. Items refer to the past 4 weeks and each offers five ordinal response options. These were scored from 1 to 5 (5 = most severe) and then conbined to produce a single score with a range from 12 (least difficulties) to 60 (most difficulties).</description>

Bursitis: the bursitis is defined by a thickening of more than 2 mm of the subacromial bursae.
Tendinous lesions (supra-spinatus, infra-spinatus or sub-scapularis): tendon thickening, hypoechoic density, presence of microcalcification, partial or complete tear
Effusion of long head of biceps tendon sheath
