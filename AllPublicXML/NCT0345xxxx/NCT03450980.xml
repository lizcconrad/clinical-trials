      Develop and evaluate a new smartphone based app to screen for and measure eye misalignment
      (strabismus). The investigators will validate the app against simulated strabismus of known
      magnitude and common clinical tests. They will evaluate the app as a screening tool in high
      risk populations, to determine the sensitivity and specificity. They hypothesize that the app
      can measure to within 2 units (prism diopters) of the ground truth, and that it will be
      correlated with gold standard tests.

      The goal of the proposed project is the development and evaluation of a novel mobile medical
      application for the detection and monitoring of strabismus (eye misalignment). The image
      analysis technology necessary to measure strabismus using the corneal reflection technique
      (Photographic Hirschberg Test) has been available for many decades (Brodie 1987), however it
      has never been deployed using a smart phone. A smart phone platform will eliminate barriers
      of cost (since the hardware is maintained and updated by the smart phone industry), leading
      to rapid wide spread application and allowing the technology to finally reach its potential
      level of impact for children's eye care in the detection and management of strabismus.
      Strabismus causes visual confusion and double vision which ultimately results in the brain
      suppressing vision from the deviated eye. In children this results in under-development
      (amblyopia) with permanent vision loss in the deviated eye if not detected and treated at a
      young age (Rowe, 2012). Strabismus in children is also associated with coordination problems
      such as postural instability (Lions et. al. 2013) and severe social disadvantages (Lukman et.
      al. 2011). Strabismus develops in an estimated 3-8% of children in the U.S. (Taylor et.al.
      2011; Cotter et.al. 2009; Rowe 2012). The prototype smart phone app (Referred to here as the
      Mobile Eye Alignment App - MEAA), uses photographic analysis of the corneal reflection
      (Purkinjie image) generated by the smart phone camera flash. The corneal reflection method
      uses the displacement of the reflection from the center of the pupil in the deviated eye to
      calculate the amount of eye misalignment. This measurement technique will be deployed for the
      proposed project using the hardware of the iPhone, a popular phone with an iOS operating
      system. Preliminary results suggest the app can measure differences in eye alignment of 1.6Â°
      (2.8 prism diopters). If successfully developed, the app has potential to be utilized to
      advance pediatric strabismus research by facilitating and reducing the cost of collecting
      enormous amounts of data from the general population and under-served or remote populations
      for epidemiological studies, and allowing researchers to capture eye alignment data much more
      frequently than is currently possible. Such a tool could better delineate the natural history
      of strabismus and perhaps help determine its causes. While devices are available which could
      make these measurements, the costs are prohibitively high (&gt;$3,000 ea.) and will not reach
      the widespread availability of smart phones. Clinical goals for the app are to provide eye
      doctors with an objective measurement tool in the exam room, allow daily monitoring of
      treatment effects, and eventually to be used as a screening tool by school nurses,
      pediatricians, and parents. The barriers to market success of stand-alone devices is not the
      accuracy sensitivity or specificity of photographic analysis technique which has been
      reported with sensitivity from 53% to near 90% and specificity ranging from 76% to 94% for
      strabismus detection (Ying et.al. 2005; Silbert et.al. 2013; Loudon et.al. 2011; Barnard
      et.al. 2013). Impact of strabismus screening for the young - Early detection for strabismus
      in young children, especially during the critical period up to 2 years of age, is important
      to ensure that treatment is administered as soon as possible (Klaver et. al. 2011; Williams
      et.al. 2002). The success of amblyopia treatment depends on several factors, but principally
      on the age of onset and the age at which the treatment is initiated (Taylor et.al. 2011).
      Therapy for amblyopia is maximally effective if started before age 3 and can be initiated as
      early as 8 months, underscoring the critical need for early and widespread access to
      strabismus screening (Epelbaum 1993; Williams et. al. 2002). Indeed, countries with
      long-standing early vision screening programs have reported significantly reduced rates of
      amblyopia (Eibschitz-Tsimhoni et.al. 2000). Access to strabismus screening is also important
      for older, school age children (age 7-17) suffering from amblyopia, for whom treatment can
      lead to significant improvements in visual acuity ranging from 20%-70% of patients, depending
      on their age bracket (Taylor 2011; Scheiman et. al. 2005; Hertle et.al. 2007).

      Aims Specific Aim 1: Develop and test key functionality of the strabismus app by comparing
      measurements with successive versions of the prototype app to known angles of eye deviation
      (non-strabismic volunteers will gaze at off axis targets of known eccentricity). Specific Aim
      2: Evaluate the strabismus app accuracy and feasibility in a clinical environment.

      Primary Hypothesis: For strabismus ranging from 1 to 30 prism diopters (target range), the
      optimized version of the app will provide measurements which are not significantly different
      from the ground truth (simulated strabismus) or clinical tests of eye alignment.
