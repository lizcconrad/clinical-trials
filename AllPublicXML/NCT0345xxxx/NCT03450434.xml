      A multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group comparative Phase II clinical study
      to assess the efficacy and safety of different doses of XC8 vs Placebo in patients with
      partly controlled bronchial asthma receiving stable treatment with low doses of inhaled
      corticosteroids with or without long-acting beta2-agonists during 12-weeks treatment period.

      Study design was developed by Pharmenterprises LLS, Russia in cooperation with Eurrus Biotech
      GmbH, Austria and FGK Clinical Research GmbH, Germany.

      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of different doses of XC8 on
      change in pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) (% of predicted
      value) at Week 12 as compared to baseline at Week 0 vs. Placebo in patients with partly
      controlled bronchial asthma (BA).

      Twenty Russian centers were approved for participation in this study. Twelve centers were
      initiated. Patients were enrolled in 12 centers. The study consisted of 4 periods: Screening,
      Run-In Period, Treatment Period, and Follow-up. All eligible patients were randomized into
      one of four treatment groups in a ratio of 1:1:1:1.

      Treatment group of XC8 2 mg daily (30 patients) Treatment group of XC8 10 mg daily (30
      patients) Treatment group of XC8 100 mg daily (30 patients) Treatment group of Placebo (30
      patients) The study drug was manufactured by order Pharmenterprises LLS, Russia and Eurrus
      Biotech GmbH, Austria. During the treatment period (12 weeks) patients took the study drug or
      Placebo once a day in addition to stable low doses of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) with or
      without long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA). The follow-up period lasted for 4 weeks.
