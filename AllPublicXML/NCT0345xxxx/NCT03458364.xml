  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has been shown to improve oxygenation and facilitate weaning
      in hypoxemia patients. Some clinical studies show the benefits of using HFNC in COPD
      patients, including reducing dead space and work of breathing. However, no clinical study has
      been to investigate the value of HFNC in weaning COPD patients from invasive ventilation.
      Thus, we proposed a randomized controlled trial to compare the use of HFNC and noninvasive
      ventilation (NIV) in weaning COPD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) provides high concentration oxygen in a high flow, which
      exceeds patient's inspiratory flow demand, to improve oxygenation. In a recent meta-analysis
      of seven trials with 1771 patients, HFNC was shown to improve oxygenation and avoid
      intubation in patients with severe hypoxemia. The high velocity of the gas can rinse the dead
      space of the upper airway and reduce CO2 rebreathing, reduce COPD patients' work of breathing
      and improve the dynamic compliance of respiratory system.

      Thus, we proposed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the value of high flow nasal
      cannula in weaning AECOPD patients from invasive ventilation, with comparison of noninvasive
      ventilation.

    <description>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) refers to the provision of ventilatory support through the patient's upper airway using a mask. This technique is distinguished from those which bypass the upper airway with a tracheal tube, laryngeal mask, or tracheostomy and are therefore considered invasive.</description>

    <description>High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy is a recent technique delivering a high flow of heated and humidified gas. HFNC is simpler to use and apply than noninvasive ventilation (NIV) and appears to be a good alternative treatment for hypoxemic acute respiratory failure (ARF). HFNC is better tolerated than NIV, delivers high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), generates a low level of positive pressure and provides washout of dead space in the upper airways, thereby improving mechanical pulmonary properties and unloading inspiratory muscles during ARF.</description>

    <description>Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the use of airway support administered through a face (nasal) mask instead of an endotracheal tube. Inhaled gases are given with positive end-expiratory pressure often with pressure support or with assist control ventilation at a set tidal volume and rate. Numerous studies have shown this technique to be as effective as, and better tolerated than, intubation and mechanical ventilation in patients with exacerbations of COPD</description>
