      This study aims to research on the relationship between knee varus and patellofemoral pain.
      The standardized standing whole-lower-extremity radiographs of the participants will be
      taken. The hip-knee-ankle angle will be obtained from the radiographs. The hip-knee-ankle
      angle of the participants with knee varus in the study group and the hip-knee-ankle angle of
      the participants with knee varus in the control group will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hip-knee-ankle angle of 180° ± 1° from standing whole-lower-extremity radiograph was
      taken as neutral axis. Angles of less than 179° were labelled knee valgus, and angles greater
      than 181° were labelled knee varus. The proportion of knee valgus is very low in the general
      population. Maybe the number of participants with knee valgus in this study will be very
      small. Therefore, the study will mainly assess the hip-knee-ankle angle of the participants
      with knee varus in the two groups. It is hypothesized that knee varus is a risk factor for
      patellofemoral pain.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patellofemoral pain during physical activities such as running, jumping, squatting,
             and going up or down stairs for at least 4 weeks.

          -  The onset of pain is required to be atraumatic in nature.

          -  Exhibit two of the following clinical criteria on assessment: pain on direct
             compression of the patella against the femoral condyles with the knee in full
             extension, tenderness of the posterior surface of the patell on palpation, pain on
             resisted knee extension, and pain with isometric quadriceps muscle contraction against
             suprapatellar resistance with the knee in 15° of flexion.

          -  Negative findings in the examination of knee ligaments, menisci, bursae, synovial
             plicae, Hoffa's fat pad, iliotibial band, and the hamstring, quadriceps, and patellar
             tendons and their insertions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  With patellofemoral instability, or With other knee diagnoses.

          -  Any previous surgery or severe trauma in the affected limb.

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis and tumors in the affected limb.
