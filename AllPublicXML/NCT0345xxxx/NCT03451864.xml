      Eighty-eight pregnant women and their newborns were enrolled in a cross-sectional study.
      Maternal serum 25-OHD was measured by ELISA.Maternal 25 (OH) vitamin D measurement: Blood
      samples for determination of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D were collected by venipuncture and
      processed as follows: 3 mL blood were collected into plain tubes and allowed to clot for 30
      minutes, then it was centrifuged at 1500 round per minute for 15 minutes at room temperature
      and the serum was separated into clean, properly labeled tubes and stored at ≤ -20°C till
      assay. Serum 25 (OH) vitamin D level was assessed by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay
      (ELISA) using DRG 25-OH Vitamin D (total) ELISA (DRG International, Inc., USA) according to
      manufacturer's instructions. Vitamin D deficiency is defined by 25(OH) D levels less than 20
      ng/d
