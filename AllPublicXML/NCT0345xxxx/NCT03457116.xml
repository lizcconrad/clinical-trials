  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of oral opiate pain
      medication vs non-steroidal ant inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of postoperative
      rhinoplasty pain. This study will also evaluate potential contributing factors affecting the
      efficacy of these pain control methods. Patients will be randomized to receive either NSAIDs
      in the form of 400mg of Ibuprofen or Norco (hydrocodone 5mg- acetaminophen 325mg) to be used
      for post-operative pain. The study will then compare which is more effective in controlling
      post operative pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients 18-70 years old undergoing septorhinoplasty or rhinoplasty for either
             obstructive or aesthetic reasons. All approaches to rhinoplasty and surgical
             techniques utilized will be included. This will include patients that undergo
             additional procedures during the rhinoplasty including osteotomies, turbinate
             reduction, septoplasty, nasal valve repair and ear cartilage graft.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who undergo a rhinoplasty requiring a rib cartilage graft for the procedure
             as this is known to cause significant pleuritic chest pain.

          -  Patients receiving functional endoscopic sinus surgery concurrently with the
             rhinoplasty will be excluded.

          -  Patients with known history of gastrointestinal bleeds, peptic ulcer disease or who
             have other comorbidities that prevent them from taking NSAIDs.

          -  Patients with a history of radiation, active head and neck malignancy or other pain
             disorders such as various rheumatologic diseases will be excluded to decrease
             confounding factors in the control of pain.
