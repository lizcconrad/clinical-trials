  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a minimally- invasive procedure for removing kidney
      stones. The small incision of PCNL is performed medially from the posterior axillary line
      according to stones location. Despite the small skin incision patients suffer from
      postoperative pain due to visceral pain and intercostal nerve injury. The aim of this study
      is to evaluate the perioperative analgesic effect of subcostal transversus abdominis plane
      (TAP) block performed prior to PCNL procedure.

      Primary outcome of our study was Morphine consumption at 48th hour after the surgery.
      Secondary outcomes were perioperative fentanyl consumption; postoperative Verbal Analog Scale
      and additional analgesic drug requirement.

      Patients who were scheduled for elective percutaneous nephrolithotomy were randomized into
      two groups: Group TAP and Group IV. General anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg,
      fentanyl 1 mcgr/kg and rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg and maintained with sevoflurane 2% in 40%:60%
      oxygen/air mixture and fentanyl 0,5 mcgr/kg and rocuronium 10 mg, if necessary. Unilateral
      Transversus abdominis plane block was performed with total of 30 ml volume of local
      anesthetic solution (20ml Bupivacaine 0,125% and 10ml Lidocaine 1%) after intubation but
      before surgery to the Group TAP patients. Paracetamol 1 gr, iv was given to the Group IV 20
      minutes before the end of the surgery. Also 100mg Tramadol,iv was administered 20 minutes
      before the end of the surgery to the both groups. Morphine iv patient controlled analgesia
      was applied to both groups. Perioperative fentanyl consumption; postoperative Verbal Analog
      Scale, morphine consumption and additional analgesic drug requirement were determined. Data
      of perioperative complications and adverse effects were also collected. Chi square with Yates
      correction and Mann Whitney U tests were used for statistical analysis.

    <description>Ultrasound guided Subcostal transversus abdominis plane block is performed after anesthesia induction and endotracheal intubation , to the side where kidney stone is. A composition of 10 ml Lidocaine %1 plus 10 ml physiologic saline solution plus 10 ml Bupivacaine %0,25 , total of 30 ml of local anesthetic mixture is administered into the area between internal oblique muscle fascia and transversus abdominis muscle fascia. After that, the patient is positioned to lithotomy position and the open-end catheter is inserted. After that the patient is turned to prone position and the percutaneous nephrolithotomy is performed. Tramadol 100 mg iv is administrated 20 minutes before the end of the surgery. Morphine patient controlled analgesia is planned for postoperative pain management.</description>
