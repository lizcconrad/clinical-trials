  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to investigate the use of Salaso, a web based exercise app, to increase
      access to physiotherapy and improve physical activity in patients attending St James's
      Hospital Rheumatology for Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). Participants will be set up on the app
      and given an individual exercise programme. All individual exercises and exercise class
      videos will be available on the app. Completion of exercises can be logged on the app and
      exercise compliance will then be monitored remotely by the physiotherapist through the Salaso
      app. The physiotherapist will have a monthly telehealth session with each participant to
      assess progress and to address any difficulties. Outcome measures will be completed at
      initial assessment and again at the end of the pilot study. This data will then be analysed
      to assess the effectiveness of the Salaso app as a treatment option for AS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AS is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the spine and other joints, causing pain and
      stiffness. Currently approximately 150 people attend Saint James's Hospital rheumatology
      department for management of their condition. Physiotherapy plays a key role in this
      management. As this is often a younger patient population, it can be challenging for them to
      attend appointments due to work and family commitments. It is envisaged that this pilot will
      enhance treatment options for all participants.

      The aims of this study are: to improve use of exercise and physical activity using an online
      exercise application; to improve self-management skills in monitoring progress and ability to
      exercise independently using an online exercise application; to provide an online appointment
      review option to patients who are unable to attend physiotherapy appointments in St James's
      Hospital.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to record and analyse the study data, using SPSS
      software.

    <measure>Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is an assessment of a person's ability to self-manage his/her pain, function and other symptoms. The self-efficacy function scale has 9 questions, each scored on a scale of 1-10, with a total minimum score of 10 and a maximum score of 90. The self-efficacy pain scale has 5 questions, with a total minimum score of 5 and a maximum score of 50. The self-efficacy other symptoms scale has 6 questions, with a minimum total score of 6 and a maximum score of 60. The other symptoms scale and the pain scale may be combined, with a sum score given.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale (EBBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measuring the perceived benefits of and barriers to performing the prescribed exercises. There are 43 questions in total. It may be scored in it's entirety or as two separate scales. Scores can range from 43 to 172. The higher the score, the more positively the individual perceives exercise. The benefits scale is scored between 29 and 116. The barriers scale is scored between 14 and 56. The higher the score on the barriers scale, the greater the perception of barriers to exercise. If combined, the barriers scale is reverse-scored.</description>

    <description>Participants, with a confirmed diagnosis of AS, will be invited to participate. Once participants have provided informed consent, they will be required to complete the outcome measures provided. Participants will be set up to use the online exercise application and educated on its use.
Participants will then have access to videos of suitable exercises or exercise classes to follow and education material on their condition to read. Participants will be able to complete AS specific outcome measures and record their progress. Participants will also have a monthly video call with the senior rheumatology physiotherapist to discuss their exercise programme, symptoms and management. The participants will also record their compliance with their exercise programmes.
After the 6 month pilot period, participants will be required to complete the same outcome measures completed at the start of the study.</description>
