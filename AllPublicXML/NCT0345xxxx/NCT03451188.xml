  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EDS (Ehlers-Danlos syndromes) form a heterogeneous group of hereditary connective tissue
      pathologies, which present a characteristic triad: cutaneous hyperelasticity, articular
      hyperlaxity and connective tissue fragility.

      The innumerable sprains and dislocations of all the joints require recurrent immobilizations
      and are responsible for a musculoskeletal handicap, chronic pains and a great fatigability,
      resounding on the quality of life of the patient.

      The use of custom-made compression garments seems to provide relief from pain, especially
      nociceptive pain and in stabilizing joints by proprioceptive effect.

      The SEDCARE study is an observational monocentric, non-comparative study. 76 patients will be
      followed in this study for 2 years during which they will wear compression custom-made
      garments (Cerecare®).The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of
      pressure garments Cerecare in the EDS, especially in terms of joint pain.
