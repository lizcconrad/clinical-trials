  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients can develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious
      and potentially fatal complication. The researchers have developed a blood test to identify
      patients most at risk for developing severe GVHD. Patients who consent to this study will
      have their blood tested up to two times after BMT to determine if they are at high risk for
      severe GVHD. The tests will be performed one week and two weeks after BMT. Patients who are
      high risk will be treated with a drug called alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) to see if it prevents
      the development of severe GVHD. Patients will receive 16 doses of AAT through a catheter
      placed into a blood vessel over eight weeks. AAT will be given either in the hospital or the
      outpatient clinic two times per week. Patients will be followed for the development of severe
      GVHD for up to four months from the BMT and will continue to be followed at routine clinic
      visits for up to one year after BMT.

    <description>For patients who develop GVHD prior to day 100 post-HCT, the overall response rate = complete remission and partial remission (CR + PR) 28 days after initiation of systemic steroid treatment. PR is defined as improvement in one or more organs involved with GVHD symptoms without progression in others. For a response to be scored as PR on day 28, the patient must be in PR on day 28 and have had no intervening systemic therapy for acute GVHD other than steroids.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  High risk prediction score as determined by the MAGIC algorithm at either day 7 or day
             14 post HCT.

          -  Any donor type (e.g., related, unrelated) or stem cell source (bone marrow, peripheral
             blood, cord blood).

          -  Donor and recipient match each other for at least 7/8 HLA-loci (HLA-A, B, C, and DR)

          -  Any conditioning regimen (non-myeloablative, myeloablative, or reduced intensity) is
             acceptable.

          -  GVHD prophylaxis must include a calcineurin inhibitor combined with methotrexate or
             mycophenolate.

          -  The use of serotherapy to prevent GVHD (e.g., antithymocyte globulin) prior to day 3
             post-HCT is permitted

          -  Direct bilirubin must be &lt;2 mg/dL unless the elevation is known to be due to Gilbert
             syndrome within 3 days prior to enrollment.

          -  ALT/SGPT and AST/SGOT must be &lt;5 x the upper limit of the normal range within 3 days
             prior to enrollment.

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent obtained from patient or legal
             representative.

             endpoint

          -  Uncontrolled active infection (i.e., progressive symptoms related to infection despite
             treatment or persistently positive microbiological cultures despite treatment or any
             other evidence of severe sepsis)

          -  Patients who are pregnant

             Principal Investigator (PI) may approve prior use of an investigational agent if the
