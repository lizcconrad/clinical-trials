  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a designed as a prospective, multi-site, non-randomized study of 20
      subjects. Subjects will receive up to 5 study treatments completed 21 days apart. Phone
      follow-up will occur at Day 3 following each treatment for the assessment of adverse events
      and expected treatment effects. Post-treatment follow-up will be completed prior to the next
      subsequent treatment and at Days 30, 90 and 180 following the last treatment to assess
      adverse events and expected treatment effects, capture digital images, and assess efficacy.

    <measure>Improvement in the Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) from Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 30 Days following the last study treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>A change in MASI score from baseline to post-treatment. The MASI quantifies the pigmentation area, darkness, and homogeneity, assessing four areas of the face for hyperpigmentation: forehead, right malar region, left malar region and chin, corresponding to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total face. The melasma area in each region is given a numeric value from 1 (&lt;10%) to 6 (90-100%) in each of the four regions. Darkness of pigment is compared to normal skin in each area on a scale of 0 (absent) to 4 (severe). Homogeneity is based on a scale of 0 (minimal) to 4 (maximal). The MASI score is then calculated as the sum of severity rating of darkness and homogeneity, multiplied by the value of area involved. The maximum score is 48; the minimum score is 0.</description>

    <measure>Clinician assessment of overall aesthetic improvement.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Days 30, 90 and 180 following last treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of a 5-point Clinician Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale, based on a live assessment of the subject while comparing to the subject's pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of the subject's pre-treatment photographs to the current post-treatment photograph. Aesthetic improvement will be based on the following definitions:
= Very Much Improved: Optimal cosmetic result.
= Much Improved: Marked improvement in appearance from the initial condition, but not completely optimal.
= Improved: Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition
= No Change: The appearance is essentially the same as the original condition.
= Worse: The appearance is worse than the original condition.</description>

    <description>Overall aesthetic improvement based on completion of a 5-point Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale. Subjects will complete the scale based on a live assessment referring to a hand mirror and their pre-treatment photographs, and based on a comparison of their pre-treatment photographs to the current post-treatment photograph. Aesthetic improvement will be based on the following definitions:
= Very Much Improved: Optimal cosmetic result.
= Much Improved: Marked improvement in appearance from the initial condition, but not completely optimal.
= Improved: Obvious improvement in appearance from initial condition

    <measure>Improvement in the Melasma Quality of Life Scale (MELASQOL) from baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 30 following last treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The Melasma Quality of Life Scale assesses the effect melasma has on the quality of life of sufferers on a scale of 1 (not bothered at all) to 7 (bothered all of the time), rating the following questions:
The appearance of your skin condition
Frustration about your skin condition.
Embarrassment about your skin condition.
Feeling depressed about your skin condition.
The effects of your skin condition on your interactions with other people.
The effects of your skin condition on your desire to be with people.
Your skin condition making it hard to show affection.
Skin discoloration making you feel unattractive to others.
Skin discoloration making you feel less vital or productive.
Skin discoloration affecting your sense of freedom.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 30 following last treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated based on subjects' completion of a patient satisfaction questionnaire while referring to a hand mirror and their pre-treatment photographs and their Day 30 follow-up photographs. Subjects will be asked to document Yes/No as to whether they notice any improvement in how the melasma on their face looks; beyond changes to the melasma pigment specify any changes they see in the treated areas, e.g., skin texture improvement, skin tone improvement, fine lines and wrinkles improvement, etc.; characterize their level of satisfaction with study treatment based on 5 levels of satisfaction: Very satisfied, Satisfied, Slightly Satisfied, Neither Satisfied or Dissatisfied, Dissatisfied; document Yes/No if they would recommend the treatment to friends and family members.</description>

    <measure>Treatment-related pain</measure>

    <description>During study treatments, subjects' pain levels will be monitored using a validated Numeric Rating Scale (0-10), with 0 being 'No Pain' and 10 being the 'Worst Possible Pain'.</description>
