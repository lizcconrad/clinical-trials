        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.Patient with an informed consent signed by the patient himself or legally acceptable
        representative before any trial-related activities; 2.2. Male patients diagnosed by
        confirmation of prostate cancer of any stages for whom endocrine treatment is indicated;
        patients with laboratory evidence of &quot;biochemical recurrence&quot; (BCR) are allowed. BCR is
        defined as the presence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) greater than 0.2 ng/mL measured
        6 to 13 weeks after radical prostatectomy followed by a confirmatory test showing
        persistent PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL; or &quot;PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL&quot; (treated with radiation
        therapy); or PSA doubling time &lt; 6 months without radiographic evidence of recurrence
        3.Patients with a Screening testosterone level &gt;1.5 ng/ml; 4.Patients with a life
        expectancy of at least 12 months; 5.Patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
        (ECOG) performance status of ≤2; 6.Patient understands and is willing to comply with the
        protocol and related procedures; 7.If having female sexual partners of childbearing
        potential, agree to avoid the occurrence of pregnancy during study participation and for
        130 days after completing the study by using a highly effective method of contraception
        such as barrier method and female contraceptives, including spermicides, etc.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a history of orchiectomy, adrenectomy or pituitary resection or
             receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer (patients with prostatectomy are eligible

             not received within 6 months prior to Screening);

          2. Patients who have previously received hormonal therapy for prostate cancer, including
             surgical deprivation or sex hormone-regulating agents such as GnRH agonists/inhibitors
             as well as estrogen therapy. However, patients previously treated with neo-adjuvant
             therapy or adjuvant hormonal therapy for less than 6 months with an interval of at
             least 6 months since discontinuation of such therapy at the time of the Screening
             Visit can be enrolled;

          3. Any patient at risk of urinary tract obstruction or spinal cord compression due to
             potential testosterone surge;

             smokers, drug abusers or have taken alcohol within 24 hours prior to dosing;

         10. Patients who are taking medications for seizures or oral steroids such as
             dexamethasone, methylprednisolone or prednisone;

         11. Patients who have taken 5α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride, and
             epristeride, etc.) within 3 months prior to Baseline Visit (Day 0);

         12. Patients with an intellectual incapacity or language barrier precluding adequate
             understanding or co operation;

         13. Patients who have received an investigational drug within the last 30 days before the
             Screening Visit or longer if considered to possibly influence the outcome of this
             trial;

         14. Patients who are part of an ongoing trial;

         15. Patients with an ECG at Screening of with a QTc &gt;450 ms or have a family history of
             prolonged QT syndrome;

         16. Patients with abnormal laboratory results which in the judgment of the investigator
             would affect the patient's health or the outcome of the trial;

         17. Patients with a clinically significant medical condition (other than prostate cancer)
             including but not limited to: renal, hematological, gastrointestinal, endocrine,
             cardiac, neurological or psychiatric disease, alcohol or drug abuse or any other
             condition that may affect the patient's health or the outcome of the trial as judged
             by the investigator.
