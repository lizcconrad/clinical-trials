  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single- and
      multiple-ascending oral doses of BIIB095 in healthy participants. The secondary objectives
      are to characterize the single- and multiple-oral-dose PK of BIIB095 in healthy participants
      and to investigate the effect of food on the single-oral-dose PK of BIIB095 in healthy
      participants.

Results in death; in the view of the Investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life threatening event), however, this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a medically important event</description>

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>
