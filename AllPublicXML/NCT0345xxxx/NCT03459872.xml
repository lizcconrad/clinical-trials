      Can acupuncture be quantified. This study sets out to observe if there are measurable effects
      of fine motor control that are attributable to acupuncture. The study utilizes an FDA
      approved medical device for measurements of fine motor control called the RU-Fit.

      Context: Currently there is a high demand for evidence-based research in the field of
      Acupuncture. The medical practice of acupuncture has existed for thousands of years and
      purportedly has been successful at managing a wide array of health conditions. Producing
      objective/quantitative data that rule out any possibility of placebo effect has proved
      burdensome.

      Objectives: This exploratory study seeks to determine if physiological measurements of fine
      motor control can be changed after receiving an acupuncture treatment. Can this change
      demonstrate the effectiveness of the treatment? Design, Setting, Participants, Interventions:
      This study looked at acupuncture patients undergoing treatments for pain relief, and general
      minor injury to determine whether or not observable changes could be detected in the fine
      motor control of the hands after acupuncture treatments.

      Two groups of 50 subjects were used in the study. The test group was given a fine motor
      control test prior to and after their acupuncture therapy to determine if any changes could
      be measured.

      The control group was given two fine motor control tests without acupuncture treatment with a
      40 minute delay between the tests to replicate the test group timing. This study was
      conducted at a non-profit community clinic between the dates of 9/28/16 &amp; 2/19/17.

        Study participants were selected from the acupuncture patient population freely visiting
        the clinic. Patients were asked if they would be interested in a research study. They were
        informed about the objectives of the study, what their role would be and that this was a
        free non-invasive test that they would undergo before and after their regular acupuncture
        treatment. Before inclusion into the program, patients are provided with informed consent
        forms and after agreeing and signing the form, individuals then become participants.
