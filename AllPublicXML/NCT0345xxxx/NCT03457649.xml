        Subjects meeting all of the following criteria are eligible to participate in this study:

          1. Willingness and ability to understand the purpose and risks of the study and provide
             signed and dated informed consent prior to any procedures and be available for all
             study visits.

          2. Male or female of non-child bearing potential, between 18-55 years of age, inclusive,
             on the day of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18-30 kg/m2, inclusive with a weight of at least 50 kg
             and no more than 100 kg.

          4. Female subjects must have a negative blood pregnancy test at screening and a negative
             urine pregnancy test at Day -1.

          5. Female subjects who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile (having had a
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, or tubal ligation). Determination of serum
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be done with FSH levels &gt; 35 mIU/mL being
             confirmative for menopause. For hysterectomy and tubal ligation, documented
             confirmation will be requested.

          6. Non-vasectomized male subjects having a female partner of childbearing potential must
             agree to the use of an effective method of contraception until 90 days after the last
             administration of study drug.

          7. Male subjects have to agree not to donate sperm until 90 days after the last
             administration of study drug.

          8. Judged by the investigator to be in good health based upon the results of a medical
             history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and
             laboratory findings.

          9. Discontinuation of all medications (including over-the-counter and/or prescription
             medication, dietary supplements, neutraceuticals, vitamins and/or herbal supplements
             such as Ginkgo biloba or Saint John's wort), except occasional paracetamol use
             (maximum dose of 2 g/day and maximum of 10 g/2 weeks), at least 2 weeks prior to the
             first study drug administration. In addition, subjects must agree to the prohibitions
             and restrictions for this study.

         10. Non-smokers, and not using any nicotine-containing products. A non-smoker is defined
             as an individual who has abstained from smoking for at least 1 year prior to the
             screening.

         11. Negative urine drug screen (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis,
             cocaine, opiates, methadone, and tricyclic antidepressants) at screening and Day -1.

         12. Negative alcohol breath test at screening and Day-1. Note: A retest can be done in
             case of an out of range clinical laboratory test value that will determine a subject's
             eligibility. This retest should preferably be done at an unscheduled visit. The result
             of the retest will be considered for subject eligibility. If the retest is outside
             normal reference ranges, the subject may be included only if the investigator judges
             the abnormalities to be not clinically significant.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are excluded from participation in this
        study:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to study drug ingredients or a significant allergic reaction to
             any drug as determined by the investigator, such as anaphylaxis requiring
             hospitalization.

          2. Positive serology for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis C virus
             (HCV) or any history of hepatitis from any cause with the exception of hepatitis A.

             Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed by a positive QuantiFERON® TB-Gold In Tube
             test or a positive tuberculin skin test (&quot;Mantoux&quot;) in case of a weak positive
             QuantiFERON® TB-Gold In Tube test.

          5. Subjects with known clinically relevant immunological disorders.
