    <textblock>
      In a multicenter, single-arm, open-label and Phase III Radotinib clinical study, chronic
      phase Ph+ chronic myeloid leukemia patients with resistance or Intolerance to previous TKIs
      therapy including Imatinib will be recruited. In this phase 3 study, 195 subjects are
      expected to be enrolled in a single arm with the administration of Radotinib 400mg twice
      daily, which includes 20% of dropout rate.
