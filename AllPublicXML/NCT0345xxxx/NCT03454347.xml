  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following orthopedic surgery and/or injury, a significant loss of muscle mass is generally
      observed. While this loss of muscle mass appears to be the norm, it causes significant
      problems in both the athletic and general population. Athletes struggle to regain their
      performance because of the decrease in muscle mass and also have a greater potential for
      reinjury while they are in a depleted state. In the general population, and particularly
      among the elderly, this loss in muscle mass can be even more devastating because as people
      age, it is more difficult to regain muscle after it is lost. In elderly individuals, this
      loss in muscle mass can lead to significant disability, diminished quality of life along with
      an increased risk of falls. In addition to the muscle mass lost during the post-operative
      period, the strength of the muscle also decreases. This has obvious performance implications
      in athletes, as well as having the potential to extend recovery time. In the elderly,
      decreased strength may result in reduced independence and inability to perform activities of
      daily living. Many previous bed rest studies have reported that significant bone loss also
      occurs during times of decreased mechanical loading. The post-operative period generally
      results in decreased mechanical loading; however, some muscle loading will still occur during
      the rehabilitation process. The dynamic relation between muscle activity/loading and bone
      density changes in the post-operative state has not been fully described and requires further
      study.

      With this knowledge of the importance of nutrition to the musculoskeletal system, applying
      the principles of increased protein intake through the addition of a dietary supplement to a
      population preparing for orthopedic surgery and subsequent muscle disuse is a logical next
      step. The investigators hypothesize that through the consumption of a protein-based dietary
      supplement three times per day (75g protein), along with educating patients on the importance
      of consuming foods that are high in protein, there will be an attenuation of decreases in
      muscle mass and strength as well as losses in bone that occur with orthopedic injury and
      disuse. The investigators long-term goal is to identify a nutritional protocol that can be
      implemented prior to and following orthopedic surgery to diminish the deleterious effects of
      the subsequent disuse on muscle and bone.
