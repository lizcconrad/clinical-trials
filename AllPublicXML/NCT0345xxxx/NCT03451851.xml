    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of Participants who Achieve an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score of Cleared (0) or Minimal (1)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA documents the investigator's assessment of the participants' plaque psoriasis at a given time point. Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling. The participants' plaque psoriasis is assessed as cleared (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4). A higher score indicates more severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Percentage of Participants who Achieve Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severity of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy. In the PASI system, the body is divided into 4 regions: the head, trunk, upper extremities, and lower extremities. Each of these areas are assessed separately for the percentage of the area involved, which translates to a numeric score that ranges from 0 (indicates no involvement) to 6 (90 percent [%] to 100% involvement), and for erythema, induration, and scaling, which are each rated on a scale of 0 to 4. The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 (no psoriasis) to 72. A higher score indicates more severe disease. A PASI 75 response represents at least a 75% improvement from baseline in the PASI score.</description>

    <description>The CDLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the disease on a child's QoL. The CDLQI, a 10-item questionnaire has 4-item response options and a recall period of 1 week. The CDLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0; the higher the score, the greater the impairment in QoL.</description>
