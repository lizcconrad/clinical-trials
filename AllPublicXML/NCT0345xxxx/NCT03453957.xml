  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a professional development program intended to improve the relationship
      or alliance between therapists and patients/clients who are receiving psychotherapy in the
      community. Half of the participating therapists will receive training to detect and improve
      alliance with new patients while half will not. The professional development training is
      expected to improve therapists effectiveness in identifying and correcting alliance tensions
      which will, in turn, improve therapeutic outcomes for patients/clients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice for many mental disorders, yet there is a gap
      between research and practice. Research indicates that: the therapist-patient alliance is
      important to reduce patient symptoms, alliance tensions are detrimental to patients, and
      those therapists who identify and repair alliance tensions can improve patient outcomes. In
      this study we will use state of the art research to train community-based therapists in
      evidence-based interventions to identify and repair alliance tensions. Trained therapists and
      their patients will be compared to therapists who provide usual care to their patients. We
      will measure improvement in therapists' skills in identifying and repairing alliance tensions
      and how this is associated with better patient mental health outcomes. We will also interview
      trained therapists to identify the best ways of improving the training and disseminating the
      findings to psychotherapists across Canada. Research to improve practicing therapists'
      ability to identify and repair therapeutic alliance tensions will result in better mental
      health outcomes for patients.

    <intervention_model_description>This will be a 2-arm, parallel, prospective, single-blind cluster RCT with 1-1 allocation comparing: (a) therapists who receive the professional development intervention to identify and repair alliance tensions at the study outset versus (b) therapists who receive the intervention after participation is complete (no training control). Therapists will be randomized to study condition and patients will be clustered within therapists. Randomization will control for: (a) the effect of therapist variables (age, gender, theoretical orientation, experience, differing initial skill level) on competence, therapeutic alliance, or patient outcomes; (b) potential biases caused by pre-treatment patient variables (symptom severity, co-morbidity, chronicity, psychoactive medications); and (c) treatment or study factors (e.g. frequency of sessions, time to complete the study sessions, treatment received after the study sessions). Patients will be blind to therapist study arm allocation.</intervention_model_description>
