  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the routine use versus non-use of urethral catheterization in
      women undergoing first elective cesarean section as regard to intraoperative and
      postoperative complications

  <detailed_description>

      This randomized controlled trial will be done at Ain Shams University Maternity One hundred
      and seventy pregnant women scheduled for first elective CS attending at outpatient clinic
      will be chosen after complete history and physical examination to determine eligibility for
      inclusion after taking their consent with full explanation of the study including potential
      benefits and risks.

      The study population will be randomized using computer sequence program in 1:1 ratio.
      Allocation of every patient to one of the studied groups will be done using opaque envelops.

      The studied groups will be either Group C or Group N For both groups

        -  A written consent will be taken.

        -  Full history to exclude medical problems that need special care.

        -  Full history to exclude UTI or recurrent UTI during pregnancy.

        -  A single dose of 2 gm cefazolin will be given IV pre-incision for preoperative
           antibiotic prophylaxis (Sullivan et al., 2007).

        -  midstream urine samples will be collected preoperative to exclude UTI and 24 hours
           postoperatively after giving the instructions to the patients (washing hands and
           genitals ,pass some urine into the toilet then without stopping catch some urine in a
           sterile container ) to be analyzed for presence of UTI

    <description>midstream urine samples were collected 24 hours postoperatively after giving the instructions to the patients and tested for presence of UTI. These fresh non-centrifuged urine samples were collected and tested for leukocyte esterase and nitrite using (Convergys urine matrix 10, Germany) strips. Nitrite will be considered positive if there is change in color of dipstick from colorless towards pink within 60 seconds. Leukocyte esterase will be considered positive if there is change in color from off-white towards purple within 2 minutes</description>
