  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of topical beta-blockers, such as 0.1% timolol, in promoting wound healing is
      currently emerging in the academic literature. The investigators will enroll 72 patients who
      have their skin cancer surgically removed and require a split-thickness skin graft to close
      their surgical wound. The objective of this randomized, open-label safety study is to
      determine the safety and efficacy of 0.1% timolol in promoting wound healing in
      split-thickness skin graft donor and receiving sites.

      The standard therapy for split-thickness skin graft (STSG)

      All other adverse reactions will be analyzed and reported, if applicable.

    <intervention_model_description>On the donor site (dressed with paraffin gauze during surgery) starting the day after surgery: either daily dressings with 0.1% timolol gel injected with a syringe with a 23-gauge needle (1 fingertip unit every 5 cm2) under the paraffin gauzes, paraffin gauzes removal at 15 days, and then daily detersion and topical 0.1% timolol gel application+paraffin gauze if healing is not complete (case group); or to wound inspection at 7 days (paraffin gauze left in place), paraffin gauzes removal at 15 days and then daily detersion and paraffin gauze if healing is not complete (control group).
On the receiving site (dressed with moulage during surgery): either daily dressing with 0.1% timolol gel injected with a syringe and a 23-gauge needle or cannula under/around the moulage up to its removal (7 days) and then daily detersion and 0.1% timolol gel application (case group); or to no dressing up to moulage removal (7 days) and then daily detersion+paraffin cream (control group).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Histogram planimetry is more accessible and less expensive than automated analysis software programs, and it is based on the pixel count of a selected irregular area which is divided by the pixel count of 1 cm2 to find a result in terms of cm2 or mm2</description>

    <measure>Cosmetic outcomes of donor/receiving sites by blinded physician Vancouver Scar Scale assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months' post-surgery, 6 months' post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>A physician blinded to the treatment group the subject is in will self-administer the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS) which documents change in scar appearance over time. The VSS ranges from 0 (most desirable outcome) to 13 (least desirable outcome), thus, a lower score is considered to have a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome. The VSS consists of four sub-scales, with each sub-scale reporting a value. The &quot;pigmentation sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal pigmentation) to 2 (hyperpigmentation); the &quot;vascularity sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal appearance) to 3 (purple appearance); the &quot;pliability sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal pliability) to 5 (contracture); and the &quot;height sub-scale&quot; ranges from 0 (normal [flat]) to 3 (&gt;5mm). Sub-scale scores are combined to give an overall VSS assessment score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Study subject complete the Patient Scar Assessment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months' post-surgery, 6 months' post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete a Visual Analogue Scale (Patient Scar Assessment Scale, PSAS) for scar assessment to rate how they think their graft sites appear cosmetically compared to normal skin, and any complaints about how painful they sites are, and how itchy they feel. Each question ranges from 1 (no complaints with itch or pain/as normal skin) to 10 (worst imaginable itch or pain/very different from normal skin). The PSAS ranges from 6 (best outcome score) to 66 (worst outcome score), thus a lower score is considered to have a better outcome and a higher score is considered a worse outcome.</description>

    <description>Patients will report and side effects they experience post-STSG. A physician will also assess for side effects and determine whether they are likely associated with the 0.1% topical timolol or part of the normal STSG healing experience.</description>
