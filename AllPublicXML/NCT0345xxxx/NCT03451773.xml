  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      Pancreas cancer ranks 4th in all cancer-related deaths in the U.S. Gemcitabine is a standard
      treatment for it. M7824 blocks a pathway that prevents the immune system from effectively
      fighting cancer. The two drugs together might help people with pancreas cancer.

      Objective:

      To test if giving M7824 together with gemcitabine is safe and causes tumors to shrink.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with pancreatic cancer already treated with standard therapies

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medical history

      Physical exam

      Scans in a machine that takes pictures of the body

      Blood, urine, and heart tests

      Some participants may have a tumor sample removed.

      Participants will get M7824 by IV once every 2 weeks. They will continue until their disease
      gets worse or they have unacceptable side effects. In addition they will get

      Participants will get gemcitabine by IV once weekly for 7 weeks. Then they will get it as
      follows for up to 6 months: Skip 1 week, get the drug once a week for 3 weeks, skip 1 week.

      Before treatment on the first day of each cycle, participants will repeat screening tests.
      They will also have:

      Optional tumor biopsies before and after 3 cycles of therapy

      Questions about their well-being and function

      Genetic testing of tissue and blood samples

      Participants will have a follow-up visit 4 5 weeks after they stop therapy. This includes a
      physical exam, blood and urine tests, and maybe a scan. If their disease does not get worse,
      they will be invited for scans every 12 weeks.

      Background:

        -  M7824 is an investigational agent in phase IB/II clinical development with dual activity
           against TGF-beta signaling (TGF-beta ligand trap ; extracellular domain of human
           TGF-beta receptor II) and immune checkpoint ligand inhibition (PD-L1 inhibition;
           avelumab, fully human IgG1 mAb directed against human PD-L1) with an acceptable toxicity
           profile and early signals of anti-cancer activity including in pancreas cancer.

        -  Gemcitabine (2 &lt;=,2 &lt;=-Difluordesoxycytidine) is a standard-of-care nucleoside analogue
           in pancreas cancer with immunomodulatory mechanisms of actions in pancreas cancer
           patients.

        -  Preclinical studies in authochtenous and syngeneic murine models have shown that
           TGF-beta inhibition and PD-L1 inhibition cooperate with gemcitabine to achieve reduction
           of tumor growth and extension of survival induce anti-tumor immunity, and reprogram the
           immune landscape.

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of M7824 in combination with gemcitabine in
           subjects with metastatic or locally advanced pancreas cancer.

        -  To determine best overall response (BOR) rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria
           (RECIST 1.1) in advanced pancreas cancer subjects.

      Eligibility:

        -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.

        -  Patients must have progressed on prior chemotherapeutic regimen.

        -  Concurrent treatment with non-permitted drugs and other interventions, prior therapy
           with gemcitabine or any antibody / drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune
           checkpoints) such as anti-PD 1, anti PD-L1, or anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4
           (CTLA 4 antibody) is not allowed.

      Design:

      - The proposed study is a phase IB/II study of M7824 in combination with gemcitabine in a
      safety run-in of 6-18 patients and, if safe and tolerated, will proceed to an expansion phase
      II cohort with a standard Simon Minimax design .

             this trial) within the last 3 years. Subjects with a history of cervical carcinoma in

             agent with the exceptions:

               -  diabetes type I, vitiligo, alopecia, psoriasis, hypo- or hyperthyroid disease not
                  requiring

          -  subjects requiring hormone replacement with corticosteroids are eligible if the
             steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at doses
             less than or equal to 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;

          -  administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result in a
             minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation) is
             acceptable.

               -  Known severe hypersensitivity reactions to monoclonal antibodies (Grade greater
                  than or equal to 3 NCI-CTCAE v4.03), any history of anaphylaxis or history of

                  infarction (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart
                  failure (New York Heart Association Classification Class greater than or equal to
                  II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia.

               -  Clinically relevant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease) and / or
                  uncontrolled medical conditions, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, might

               -  Vaccine administration of live vaccines within 21 days of enrollment.

               -  Patients with known contrast allergies requiring pre-medication with steroids.
