  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative, observational, cross-sectional and prolective diagnostic test study, including
      patients that have had a right heart catheterization and were referred for a CT pulmonary
      angiography as part of their imaging workup protocol for pulmonary hypertension.

      Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) pulmonary angiography was performed on each patient to
      obtain perfusion maps and do a quantitative analysis. Segments with and without perfusion
      defects according to significant differences in the quantitative values, were defined as
      compatible or not with chronic thromboembolism.

      To assess the accuracy of the method and evaluate its performance, these results were
      compared with the sole results from the right heart catheterization, known to be the gold
      standard diagnostic tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      a comparative, observational, cross-sectional and prolective diagnostic test study is
      conducted, including consecutive patients from the pulmonary hypertension clinic at our
      institution, from March 2017 to October 2018. Patients that have had a right heart
      catheterization and were referred for a CT pulmonary angiography as part of their imaging
      workup protocol. (The minimum sample size calculated is 26 patients).

      DECT pulmonary angiography (256-slice and double-source CT scanner) was performed on each
      patient. Obtaining perfusion maps and doing a quantitative analysis by circular regions of
      interest (ROI) and iodine-related attenuation values (IRA) on each lung segment. Then,
      according to the finding in right heart catheterization, a comparison will be made between to
      groups: segments with and without perfusion defects, in order to find significant differences
      in the quantitative.

      To assess the accuracy of the method and evaluate its performance, these results were later
      compared with the sole results from the right heart catheterization.

      ROC curves were plotted to extract possible decision thresholds of the IRA values to classify
      perfusion as normal or deficient with this technique.
