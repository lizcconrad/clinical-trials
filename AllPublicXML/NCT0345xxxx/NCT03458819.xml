  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10-11% of end stage kidney disease patients worldwide utilize peritoneal
      dialysis (PD) as their method of renal replacement therapy. Over time, the peritoneal
      membrane often undergoes anatomic and functional changes due to the process of epithelial to
      mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is characterized by increases in pro-inflammatory and
      pro-angiogenic cytokines. In this process, the mesothelial cells lining the peritoneal
      membrane are denuded and change their morphology to one more closely resembling fibroblasts.
      These fibroblasts invade the submesothelial zone of the peritoneal membrane resulting in
      marked fibrosis, and the pro-angiogenic cytokines cause an increase in neovascularization.
      Jointly, these processes culminate in impaired function of the peritoneal membrane and often
      limit the duration of effective PD therapy.

      In vitro studies in cultured human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and in vivo studies
      in rodent models of PD have demonstrated that the use of active Vitamin D receptor agonists
      or statins may attenuate this process of EMT. These are both classes of drugs that are
      commonly in use by patients on PD. The investigators goal is to determine whether either or
      both of these drugs might attenuate the process of EMT in patients performing PD.

      Patients will perform a standard 2 Liter overnight dwell with the usual 2.5% dextrose PD
      solution. This will be done the night before a routinely scheduled visit to the home dialysis
      clinic. In the clinic the fluid will be drained in usual fashion and the fluid- which would
      otherwise be discarded- will be analyzed as below:

      HPMCs will be isolated as previously described by Kinashi et al. and stored at -80 degrees
      until analysis. Changes in the protein expression of EMT markers such as E-cadherin, alpha
      smooth muscle actin (a-SMA), Snail, and fibronectin in the HPMCs will be evaluated by Western
      blot analysis.

        PD patients &gt; 18 years old. We propose to study 4 groups of 6 patients each:

          1. Patients taking neither an active Vitamin D analogue nor a statin

          2. Patients already taking an active Vitamin D analogue

          3. Patients already taking a statin

          4. Patients already taking both an active Vitamin D analogue and a statin
