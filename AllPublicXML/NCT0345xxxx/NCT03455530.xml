  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to reduce negative health outcomes in small businesses that primarily
      employ high-risk Latino workers by characterizing their exposures to hazardous chemicals and
      assessing if a community health worker (CHW) intervention is effective at decreasing these
      exposures. Although preventable by definition, occupational disease and injuries are leading
      causes of death in the United States, with a disproportionate burden faced by Latinos. Small
      businesses pose a particular risk. They are more likely to employ low-wage Latino workers,
      and often use hazardous solvents including volatile organic chemicals that can cause asthma,
      cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disease; yet their workers lack access to culturally
      and linguistically appropriate occupational health and pollution prevention information due
      to economic, physical, and social barriers. CHW-led interventions and outreach in Latino
      communities have documented increased access to health care and health education and reduced
      workplace exposures among farmworkers. CHWs are an innovative method to bridge the gap
      between these small business communities and other stakeholders. The proposed project will
      capitalize on established partnerships between the University of Arizona, the Sonora
      Environmental Research Institute, Inc. and the El Rio Community Health Center. A
      community-engaged research framework will be used to complete the following specific aims: 1)
      quantify and identify exposures to hazardous chemicals in the two high risk small business
      sectors common in our target area (i.e., auto repair shops and beauty salons); 2) work
      collaboratively with business owners, trade groups, workers and CHWs to design an industrial
      hygiene - enhanced CHW intervention tailored for each small business sector; and 3) conduct a
      cluster randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the CHW intervention at reducing
      workplace exposures to volatile organic compounds and assess which factors led to successful
      utilization of exposure control strategies in both male and female-dominated businesses.
      Businesses will be randomized to either an intervention or delayed intervention group, both
      of which will receive incentives to participate including worksite health screenings. CHWs
      will work closely with business owners and employees to select and implement
      exposure-strategies appropriate for their worksite using a menu of complementary strategies
      of varying complexity and cost. This innovative project has the potential to directly reduce
      occupational health disparities through a CHW intervention that moves beyond providing
      occupational health education. The intervention will overcome current barriers by helping
      marginalized Latino workers and small business owners who may have limited education,
      literacy, and computer skills to understand the hazards associated with their work, and will
      empower them to have greater control over their occupational exposures, with the ultimate
      goal of preventing occupational disease and reducing health disparities.

    <intervention_model_description>Both groups will receive a baseline exposure assessment, health screenings from El Rio Community Health Center, and Sonora Environmental Research Institute's existing packets on pollution prevention to ensure that all businesses have the same pollution prevention information at baseline. Then, the intervention group will receive the industrial hygiene (IH)-enhanced community health worker (CHW) intervention. After the second exposure assessment, the delayed group will receive the intervention. A third exposure assessment will be obtained to determine if exposure levels and controls are maintained in the intervention group, and to assess the intervention in the delayed group. This will help us assess sustainability of the intervention. CHWs will accompany evaluators during the first assessment but leave before data collection begins. We anticipate that the CHW intervention will be completed over a 60-day time period (range: 30-90 days).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention will be derived from audits and exposure assessments and focus groups with workers and owners in the same business types (excluded from the trial) conducted in an earlier part of the study, as well as a community advisory group (e.g., Hispanic Chamber of Commerce) . From this, we will generate educational materials specific for each small business sector. We will provide the CHWs with a list of industry-specific control options along with potential cost savings and benefits. For example, EPA estimates a cost saving of $13,000 per year for auto body shops that switch to the high-velocity low-pressure spray guns. Each list will be a comprehensive menu of options that contain multiple control measures including simple controls, such as keeping the lids on the solvent containers.</description>
