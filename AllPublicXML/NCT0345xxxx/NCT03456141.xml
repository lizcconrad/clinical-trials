      SPECIFIC AIMS Using the UNC surgery clinic multi-modal protocol of drugs/dosages to control
      acute pain after third molar surgery assess each post-surgery day(PSD) the patient reported

        1. pain levels post-surgery as recorded by Likert-type and Gracely scales

        2. quality of life(QOL) outcomes for lifestyle and oral function

        3. number of opioid doses taken by subject-patients

        4. number of NSAID and acetaminophen doses taken by subject-patients.

    <description>Likert scales for average pain and worst pain are assessed with 7-point scales with verbal anchors of &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain imagined&quot;.
Recovery for pain on the Likert scales is defined as the number of PSD until the patient reports a score of 1 or 2 on the 7-point scale.</description>
