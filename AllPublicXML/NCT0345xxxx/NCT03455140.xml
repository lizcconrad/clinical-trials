  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PARC is an international phase I/II trial evaluating the safety and activity of pegylated
      recombinant human arginase (BCT-100) in children and young people with relapsed/refractory
      leukaemia, neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade gliomas (brain cancers).

      Currently the outcomes for these patients are poor and the therapeutic options are limited
      with a significant toxicity burden. Therefore new treatments which work in different ways to
      standard chemotherapy are urgently needed. Research has shown that arginine (a nutrient) is
      important in the survival of cancer cells. BCT-100 is a drug which can deplete arginine
      levels and starve cancer cells - a completely new approach. BCT-100 has been tested in adults
      and shown to be active with almost no side-effects. This trial will test whether this dose of
      BCT-100 is also safe and active in children with relapsed/refractory leukaemia,
      neuroblastoma, sarcoma and high grade glioma. The trial will also study how BCT-100 is broken
      down in the body and look for new biological markers of treatment response. Up to 64 children
      with relapsed cancers will be recruited over 2 years.
