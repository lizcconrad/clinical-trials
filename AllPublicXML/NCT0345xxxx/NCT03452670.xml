      The study will examine the use and impact of a meditation app delivered to adult workforce
      populations facing extreme time demands. Enrollees will be randomized to either app or a
      wait-list group, and will be assessed in terms of job and daily functioning, well-being, and
      biomarkers of immune function and stress physiology, and neural structure and function prior
      to randomization and again at multiple time points after participants commence app
      engagement. In order to assess efficacy, we will examine the longitudinal changes in all
      measures in both the mindfulness group, compared to wait-list control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the last 25 years, research on contemplative practices, a family of practices including
      mindfulness meditation and yoga, has advanced in domains both clinical and basic, motivated
      by burgeoning evidence of their efficacy for remediating psychopathology and augmenting
      well-being and resilience. However, much of this research has examined the effects of
      scheduled group interventions, delivered in-person by instructors over the course of several
      weeks. Far less research has looked at the delivery method that is most common and arguably
      most sustainable for busy adults, namely, smart phone delivered Contemplative Applications
      (apps) for Well-being (CWAs). The proposed study will examine the use and impact of an app
      delivered to populations facing extreme time demands.

    <measure>Change in Incivility in Nursing Education Revised Survey score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Incivility in Nursing Education Revised Survey contains 24-items asking students about behaviors they exhibited or witnessed in the past 12 months (for example, &quot;Students made rude gestures or nonverbal behaviors towards others&quot;). Respondents indicate how often these behaviors occurred by selecting from 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely (only once or twice), 3 = Sometimes (approximately once per month), or 4 = Often (more than once per month). Total scores can range from 24 to 96, with higher scores indicating more incivility performed or witnessed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in School-Burnout Inventory score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The School-Burnout Inventory is a 9-item survey asking students about how much burnout they have felt in the past month (for example, &quot;I feel overwhelmed by my schoolwork&quot;). Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a scale of 1 to 6 where 1 = completely disagree and 6 = completely agree. Total scores can range from 9 to 54, with higher scores indicating more burnout.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression score on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) is a 42-item survey asking about feelings of depression and anxiety that the respondent has experienced in the past week (for example, &quot;I found myself getting upset at quite trivial things&quot;). Respondents indicate the degree to which they agree with each statement on a scale of 0 to 3 where 0 = does not apply to me at all and 3 = applied to me very much, or most of the time. The depression subscale includes 14 items. A score of 0-9 indicates no depression, 10-13 indicates moderate depression, 14-20 is moderate depression, 21-27 is severe depression and scores of 28 and above indicate extremely severe depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Empathic Accuracy (EA) Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Empathic Accuracy (EA) Task is a dynamic video assessment that asks participants to continuously rate the emotions of others as they tell emotional autobiographical stories. Empathic accuracy is the correlation between feelings of the story-tellers in the video and what the participants perceive the story-tellers feelings to be.</description>

    <description>The researchers will acquire a high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scan of the whole brain and brain stem from vertex to approximately 2.5 cm below the lower rim of the cerebellum. Gray matter density in the brain stem, with particular focus on the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus nerve and the nucleus of the solitary tract will be measured.</description>
