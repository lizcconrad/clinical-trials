  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of Pevonedistat/Low-Dose Cytarabine (LDAC)
      therapy will be tolerable, that a recommended phase 2 dose of Pevonedistat in combination
      with LDAC will be identified, and that the combination therapy will show evidence of clinical
      activity in adult patients with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) and
      Advanced Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, dose escalation study of PEVONEDISTAT (formerly MLN4924) in combination
      with fixed doses of low dose Cytarabine (LDAC) utilizing a traditional 3+3 design. Eligible
      patients will be enrolled in cohorts of three starting at Dose Level 1. Dose escalation will
      proceed provided that:

        1. All patients enrolled on the previous cohort have completed the first cycle of treatment
           (28 days)

        2. The number of patients who experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is within the
           appropriate guidelines (i.e., 0 out of 3; 1 out of 6).

        3. Dose levels for escalation/de-escalation:

             -  Dose Level -1: Pevonedistat 10 mg/m2, LDAC 20 mg/m2

             -  Dose Level 1 (starting dose): Pevonedistat 15mg/m2, LDAC 20 mg/m2

             -  Dose Level 2: Pevonedistat 20 mg/m2, LDAC 20 mg/m2

             -  Dose Level 3: Pevonedistat 25 mg/m2, LDAC 20 mg/m2

             -  Dose Level 4: Pevonedistat 30 mg/m2, LDAC 20 mg/m2

      A more conservative dose-escalation, with evaluation of intermediate doses and/or expansion
      of an existing dose level, is permissible if such measures are needed for patient safety or
      for a better understanding of Pevonedistat dose-related toxicity, exposure, or
      pharmacodynamics. Such changes will be discussed among the protocol investigators and will be
      approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies.

      Up to 16 cycles of 28 days are planned. If patients are receiving clinical benefit, treatment
      can continue beyond 16 cycles.

      Patients will be followed for a minimum of 30 days after the last dose of Pevonedistat/LDAC
      combination therapy. After this 30 day period, patients will be followed only for the
      resolution of any ongoing adverse events. Resolution is defined as a return to baseline
      status or the stabilization of an event with the expectation that it will remain chronic. Any
      follow-up visit scheduled after this 30 day period will be done at the discretion of the
      Principal Investigator (PI) or treating physician.
