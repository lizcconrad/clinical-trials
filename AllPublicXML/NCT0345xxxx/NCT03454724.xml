      This is a Multi Center Randomized (MeRes:XIENCE=1:1) Control Study of MeRes100 Sirolimus
      Eluting BioResorbable Vascular Scaffold System in treatment of approximately 484 subjects
      with Coronary Artery Disease in China. The post marketed XIENCE Everolimus Eluting Coronary
      Stent System will serve as the control device, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      MeRes100 Sirolimus Eluting BioResorbable Vascular Scaffold System in coronary artery disease,
      and to support the product registration approval of the China Food and Drug Administration
      (CFDA).

      Eligible subjects shall have up to two de novo lesions in different epicardial vessels ( One
      lesion in each coronary artery or it's major branch),Target lesion shall have visually
      estimated diameter stenosis ≥ 70% (or ≥ 50% and has clinical evidence of myocardial
      ischemia), lesion length ≤ 24mm, reference vascular diameter visually ≥ 2.75mm and ≤ 4.0mm.
      And subjects must meet all the study inclusion / exclusion criteria before enrolment in the
      study.

      All the subjects shall accept angiography follow up at 12 months post procedure.

      OCT subgroup ((N=80, 40 from test group and 40 from control group) shall accept follow up of
      OCT at immediately and 12 months post procedure. In segment late lumen loss at 12 months post
      procedure is the primary endpoint, and the percentage of stent strut neointimal coverage
      assessed with OCT at 12 months post procedure is the key secondary endpoint.
