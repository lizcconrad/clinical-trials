    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter, single-arm study to
      demonstrate the acceptable safety and performance of the JETSTREAM™ Atherectomy System
      (Jetstream) used during percutaneous peripheral vascular intervention in patients with
      occlusive atherosclerotic lesions in the native SFA and/or PPA. It is intended that all
      patients with qualifying lesions would be considered for enrollment and treated with the
      Jetstream System.
