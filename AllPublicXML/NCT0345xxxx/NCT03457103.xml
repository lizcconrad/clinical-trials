  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capnometry-Assisted Breathing Training for COPD (CATCH) is a behavioral intervention that
      aims to promote optimal, self-regulated, mindful breathing. A portable capnometer is used
      in-session to provide continuous visual feedback of Respiratory Rate (RR), End-Tidal Carbon
      Dioxide Tension (ETCO2), and breathing pattern. The tailored CATCH intervention will
      emphasize a slow, quiet, regular, nasal breathing pattern, as well as pursed lips breathing
      (PLB). CATCH is once weekly for 6 weeks, for a total of 6 sessions; each session is
      approximately 60 minutes long. The principal investigator will implement the CATCH
      intervention. The principal investigator will implement the CATCH intervention. Patients will
      use the Address Stress app on a smart phone or computer tablet as part of their home
      breathing exercises.

    <description>Patients in both treatment groups will participate in a 10 week (16-20 sessions) comprehensive PR program. The control group will receive the 10-Week PR program with traditional breathing training sessions (without biofeedback). The program comprises 2 or 3 exercise training sessions per week by physical therapists (each 1 hour duration).</description>
