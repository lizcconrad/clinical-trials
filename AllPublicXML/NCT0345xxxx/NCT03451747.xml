  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of CVD-related deaths is generally higher in women than men. Postmenopausal
      changes in estrogen/androgen ratio that induce a relative androgen excess have been proposed
      as important factors in the higher prevalence of hypertension. Therefore, the investigators
      hypothesize that testosterone has potential role between hypertension and target organ damage
      in postmenopausal hypertensive women. And the objective is to evaluate the effects of
      testosterone between hypertension and target organ damage in postmenopausal hypertensive
      women.
