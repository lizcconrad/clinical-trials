    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this open-label, Phase 2 proof of concept study is to evaluate the
      efficacy of 12 months of oral ACH-0144471 in participants with C3G or IC-MPGN based on renal
      biopsy results and the number and percentage of participants with an improvement relative to
      baseline in clinical manifestation(s) of C3G (proteinuria and reduced estimated glomerular
      filtration rate [eGFR]).
