    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to collect information on how semaglutide works in real world
      patients. Participants will get semaglutide prescribed by the study doctor. The study will
      last for about 6 to 8 months. Participants will be asked to complete some questionnaires
      about the health and the diabetes treatment. Participants will complete these during the
      normally scheduled visits with the study doctor.

    <measure>Change in Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - Status (DTSQs) (absolute treatment satisfaction): Total treatment satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), end of study (week 28-38)</time_frame>
    <description>The status version (DTSQs) provides a measure of how satisfied patients are with their current diabetes treatment. It consists of 8 questions, which are to be answered on a Likert scale from 0 to 6 (0 = very dissatisfied to 6 = very satisfied). Six questions are summed to produce a total Treatment Satisfaction score. The remaining two questions are concerning perceived frequency of hyperglycaemia and perceived frequency of hypoglycaemia, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (week 0), end of study (week 28-38)</time_frame>
    <description>The change version (DTSQc) has the same 8 items as the status version, but is reworded to direct the patients to compare the experience of the current treatment with the experience of previous treatment. Each question is scored on a scale of -3 to +3 (-3 = much less satisfied now to +3 = much more satisfied now), with 0 (midpoint), representing no change.</description>
