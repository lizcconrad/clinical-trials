      The research team has developed a prototype for an investigational mechanical nasal dilator
      and the investigators aim to evaluate its efficacy.

      Specifically, the investigators wish to address the following research questions: 1) How does
      mechanical nasal obstruction affect patients' lives? The investigators aim to answer this
      question with use of validated questionnaires. 2) How do currently available mechanical nasal
      dilators affect objective and subjective findings related to nasal obstruction? This will be
      evaluated with objective nasal airflow testing and with modifications to validated
      questionnaires 3) How does the investigational team's novel device affect these same outcome
      measures? 4) Do patients find the investigational device subjectively comfortable and
      efficient?

      Background:

      Restricted nasal breathing is a common complaint among patients presenting to Otolaryngology
      clinics. In fact, one in eight people experiences some degree of nasal obstruction, or
      regular difficulty breathing through the nose, which is often the result of a narrowing or
      collapse of the internal nasal valve. This condition is a daily source of discomfort that
      reduces productivity and quality of life. Sufferers report shortness of breath throughout the
      day, difficulty sleeping and habitual snoring, and limited stamina during sports and
      exercise.

      Slight dilation of the nasal passages directly counteracts nasal obstruction and reverses
      symptoms in 89% of those afflicted. To this end, many patients undergo functional rhinoplasty
      procedures to surgically widen the nasal passages. However, up to 20% of patients experience
      unimproved or worsened symptoms postoperatively. Moreover, these surgeries are invasive,
      requiring autologous grafts taken from the nose, ear, or ribs; and they entail a yearlong
      recovery period.

      Nasal dilators such as Breathe Right strips offer a potential alternative to surgery, as they
      mechanically expand the nasal passages to effectively relieve obstruction. However, existing
      products are designed as sleep aids, and customers find them uncomfortable, difficult to use,
      and too visible to wear in public. Although the mechanism for reversing nasal obstruction is
      straightforward, surgery is considered the only viable option for those who struggle to
      breathe during the day.

      Engineers from the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering Department, partnered with clinicians
      from the Johns Hopkins Department of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery, have developed
      the Schnozzle, a small silicone stent to counteract nasal valve collapse and relieve
      restricted nasal breathing. The investigators hypothesize that this device will improve
      symptoms of nasal obstruction and provide patients with a viable alternative to visible
      non-invasive devices or surgical management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      feasibility and comfort of this device in comparison to existing commercially available
      devices.

      Recruitment:

      Participants will be recruited from patients presenting to Otolaryngology clinics with
      symptoms of nasal obstruction. The otolaryngologist in clinic will screen these patients for
      nasal valve collapse as they would in standard clinical practice. This involves visualizing
      the nasal cavity through nasal endoscopy and evaluating the nasal valve using Cottle maneuver
      (applying lateral force to the cheek to open the nasal valve) or the modified Cottle maneuver
      (using a cotton tip applicator to open the nasal valve from inside the nasal cavity) and
      evaluating for improvement in nasal obstruction symptoms. Improved nasal airflow during the
      maneuver suggests nasal valve collapse contributes to restricted nasal airflow.

      The clinical Otolaryngologist will counsel participants with nasal valve collapse regarding
      the various treatment options as they would in routine clinical practice (management options
      include to doing nothing, using existing nasal dilator devices, or undergoing surgery).
      Patients will then be invited to participate in the study, which will involve a study session
      in which they are fitted with several nasal dilator devices, instructed in proper care and
      use, and report on their function and comfort. Additional participants will be recruited from
      patients who present to clinics with symptoms unrelated to nasal breathing to serve as a
      control group.

      Study design:

      If a patient expresses interest in participating they will be introduced to a member of the
      research team to discuss the study and complete informed consent. All participation is
      voluntary and participants are able to withdraw from the study at any point. The study
      participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes the previously
      validated Nasal Obstruction and Septoplasty Effectiveness (NOSE) instrument, questions
      regarding the patient's current treatments, and a ranking of their preferred characteristics
      of an ideal nasal dilator.

      Patients will then be asked to inhale rapidly into an airflow transducer to measure peak
      nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF). Following the pre-test survey participants will be fitted with
      existing nasal dilator products per manufacturer recommendations (Breathe Right strips, Max
      Air nose cones, Sleep Right dilator, and Nozovent dilator), and the experimental nasal
      dilators designed by the research team. In this crossover design study participants will be
      blinded as to which dilators are branded and which are experimental. The order of fitting
      nasal dilators will be randomized.

      After each fitting and use for 5 minutes to adjust to the device and confirm there is no
      immediate discomfort or irritation, participants will undergo repeat PNIF testing with each
      device, then will be free to go home and trial the devices. Participants will be given a
      schedule specifying one device to use for at least one continuous hour per day in a
      randomized order, while also being blinded as to which device they will be using (Schnozzle,
      Breathe Right, Max Air, Sleep Right, Nozovent). The devices will be numbered in a random
      fashion, for participants to be able to identify which device via the assigned number they
      are scheduled to use. They will similarly use the device number when performing any device
      evaluation. Participants are free to wear the assigned nasal dilator at their leisure, but
      must log the hours and activities performed while wearing the device (for example, &quot;10am-11am
      exercising&quot;). Participants are not required to wear a device in public at work or during
      exercise unless they feel comfortable doing so. All devices should be worn overnight. If
      there is any discomfort, irritation, skin breakdown, or epistaxis the participant should stop
      wearing the device and contact the research team immediately. Each morning, the participant
      will complete a survey summarizing their experience using the assigned device. Before
      returning to the clinic for the conclusion of the study, participants may have several days
      without an assigned device. Participants are free to stop wearing all devices or use any
      device as they please as long as it is consistent with proper care and use of the device(s).

      After at least five days (one day per device) the participant will return to the office for
      an exit interview with the study team in regards to their subjective experience with each
      device. At the end of each trial they will be asked to fill out a concluding survey regarding
      the device they were using. At their exit interview they will be asked to hand in the survey
      for each device they trialed.
