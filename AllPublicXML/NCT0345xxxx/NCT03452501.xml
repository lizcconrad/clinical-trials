    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of
      biosimilar Infliximab in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Saudi Arabia where
      no visits or intervention(s) additional to the daily practice will be performed.

      A multicenter, observational, prospective, cohort study to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of biosimilar Infliximab (Remsima®) in newly diagnosed and in switched IBD
      patients diagnosed with active Crohn's disease (CD), fistulizing CD, or Ulcerative Colitis
      (UC). Each patient is expected to be treated for a total of 38 weeks if naive or 40 weeks if
      switched. The study duration will be between 46 and 48 weeks (up to 12 months). Follow-up is
      expected to end 8 weeks after the last treatment visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  - Adult patients with moderate to severe active CD who have not responded despite a
             full and adequate course of therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive
             agents, or who are intolerant to or have medical contraindications to such therapies.

          -  Adult patients with fistulizing active CD who have not responded despite a full and
             adequate course of therapy with conventional treatment (including antibiotics,
             drainage and immunosuppressive therapy).

          -  Adult patients with moderate to severe active UC who have had an inadequate response
             to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) or
             azathioprine (AZA), or who are intolerant or have medical contraindications to such

             screening.

          -  Patients who are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) or previously diagnosed with TB with
             no evidence of complete resolution

          -  Patients with severe or chronic infections (e.g. sepsis, abscesses, opportunistic
             infections, invasive fungal infections), or severe or chronic infection, without
             sufficient documentation of complete resolution following treatment

             latent TB at Screening. A patient who has received at least the first 30 days or
             recommended period of country-specific TB prophylactic therapy and intends to complete
             the entire course of therapy may be enrolled. Recommended methods to screening latent
             TB are interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] test, with a chest X-ray, however, other
             methods could be used according to local guideline.

          -  Patients with moderate or severe heart failure (New York Heart Association NYHA class
             III/IV).

          -  Patients for whom the treatment with Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blockers is
             concerning due to a history of malignancy within the previous five years prior to
             enrollment or a history of herpes zoster within one month prior to enrollment, may be
