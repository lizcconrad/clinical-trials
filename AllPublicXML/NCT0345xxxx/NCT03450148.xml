  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test a new way to help people quit smoking. The PI
      will test acceptability and feasibility of a new device called Pavlok wearable wrist band to
      help caregivers of pediatric patients with respiratory illness quit smoking. Participants
      will be caregiver of a child with respiratory illness and referred for Nicotine replacement
      therapy. Participants will be randomized into intervention and control groups.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention group will continue to wear the wristband and the wristband will deliver a
      slight electric stimulus every time it is pressed.

      The placebo group will wear continue to press the button on the wristband but it will not
      give a slight electric stimulus when pressed. Both groups will receive the device for 3
      months only.

      Both groups will be evaluated after 1 week and assessed for their participation and
      commitment to the study. Those included will be randomized to two groups described above and
      will continue the study for 3 months. There will be follow up surveys at various time points
      (1 week, 2 week, 3 week, 2 months, 3 month) with the final survey at 3 months. A short follow
      up survey will be done at 6 months.
