      This study is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate safety of BC2059
      administered intravenously to subjects with proven primary or recurrent desmoid tumor that is
      unresectable and symptomatic or progressive. This study will utilize single patient cohorts
      for the first two dose levels in order to minimize sub-optimal drug exposures, followed by a
      conventional 3+3 dose escalation phase to achieve MTD or RP2D determined by pharmacokinetics
      or biologically relevant activity. Once MTD or RP2D is determined, that dose level cohort
      will expand to 14 patients enrolled to collect additional safety PK and PD data. If at least
      1 patient has clinical benefit, the dose expansion phase will be expanded by a further 11
      patients (25 total in at RP2D). The total duration of study for each subject will be
      dependent upon the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BC2059

        Inclusion criteria

             bi-dimensionally measurable tumor by WHO criteria.

          -  Patients with disease that is either unresectable or for which the patient refuses
             surgery but is currently progressing, as defined by:

               -  20% increase in tumor volume within 6 months OR

               -  Recurrent disease within 1 year of surgery OR

               -  Desmoid related symptoms as documented by a PRO questionnaire and documentation
                  that symptoms are related to desmoid and not prior therapies.

          -  Willingness to provide tumor biopsies prior to treatment and while on treatment

          -  Patients may have been previously treated with local therapies such as surgery,
             radiation, radiofrequency ablation, or cryosurgery provided this has been completed at
             least 4 weeks prior to registration and recovered from therapy related toxicity to
             less than CTCAE grade 2 and show no improvement in tumor size or symptom score.

          -  Patients may have been treated with systemic therapies such as tyrosine kinase
             inhibitors, hormone inhibitors or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
             provided this has been completed at least 4 weeks prior to registration and recovered
             from any therapy related toxicity to less than CTCAE grade 2 and show no improvement
             in tumor size or symptom score.

          -  Patients may have been treated with systemic therapies such as cytotoxics, biologics
             or other unclassified experimental therapies provided this has been completed at least
             8 weeks prior to registration and recovered from any therapy related toxicity to less
             than CTCAE grade 2 and show no improvement in tumor size or symptom score.

          -  Patients who have been treated with immune therapies such as vaccines, dendritic or
             other whole cell therapies, oncolytic or other viral approaches within the preceding
             12 months should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to screening and
             enrollment into the study to determine eligibility.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Patients who have not recovered to grade 1 from adverse events related to prior
             therapy excluding those considered not clinically significant (ex. Lymphopenia).

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to BC2059 or other agents used in study

          -  Clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or cardiac repolarization

             requirements

          -  Pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from this study. The effects of BC2059
             on the developing human fetus have the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient
             effects. There is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants

             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of BC2059 administration.

          -  Patients with abnormal serum chemistry values other than the specific limits detailed
             above, that in the opinion of the Investigator is considered to be clinically

             study.

             interfere with drug administration or collection of study samples
