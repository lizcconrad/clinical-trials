  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In summary, state anxiety scores indicate that both YogaFit and seated rest were effective at
      acutely reducing state anxiety post-condition, but not at preventing an induced anxiety
      responses post-exposure. However, physiological measures indicate a healthy adaptive response
      to YogaFit and rest both post-condition and post-exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rest or acute exercise can decrease state anxiety, with some evidence showing acute exercise
      to prevent elevations in anxiety after exposure to emotional stimuli. The purpose of this
      study was to examine the effectiveness of an acute YogaFit session on state anxiety, heart
      rate, and measures of heart rate variability (HRV) to determine whether yoga provides
      short-term protection against emotional stimuli. Both time-domain and frequency-domain
      measures of HRV were assessed. Forty healthy, female college students completed a thirty-min
      session of YogaFit along with a time-matched seated rest condition on separate days. After
      each condition, participants viewed 30 min of emotional picture stimuli. State anxiety, HR,
      and HRV were assessed baseline, post-condition, and post-exposure to emotional stimuli.

    <description>For YogaFit Vinyasa Flow (referred to as YogaFit in this manuscript)], participants followed, via digital versatile disc, a standardized YogaFit format choreographed by an American Council of Exercise Certified and Registered Yoga Teacher (RYT). YogaFit was performed in the same laboratory setting and lasted 30 min. YogaFit is a westernized version of yoga that does not use Sanskrit terms (Shaw 2009). Breath was an integral part of every movement with specific breath rates for each phase of the session. The objective was to move the body with intention and purpose and be present in the body.</description>
