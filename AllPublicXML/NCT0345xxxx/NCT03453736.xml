  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that team work impacts patients safety. This is particularly the case in
      surgical theatres where individuals from different backgrounds (surgeon, anaesthetists,
      nurses, ..etc) work together to achieve a common goal which is looking after the patient. The
      robotic theatre set up is different due to the physical separation of the surgeon from the
      patient and the rest of the team. This may represent a communication challenge. The Study
      investigators aim to study theatre staff experiences and practices of communication and
      teamwork in this special setup, investigating any challenges participants may be facing and
      possible ways of adapting to them. Staff opinions and suggestions for improvement will be
      explored for utmost surgical performance and patient safety.

      The study will involve two parts:1) individual staff interviews and 2) teamwork observations
      during real life surgery. The two parts should complement each other giving an overall
      picture of the teamwork in the robotic theatre setup.

    <description>Experiences and practices in Robotic theatres will be studied via semi-structured interviews with staff as well as team observations during real time robotic surgery. As the study is a qualitative one, data collection will continue till we reach saturation of theoretical categories. We expect 20 interviews and 10 observations to suffice.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Non-Robotic procedures</arm_group_label>
    <description>Staff involved in robotic surgery will have almost definitely worked in non-robotic theatres ie major abdominal and laparoscopic. Staff interviews will explore differences in experiences and practices between these different theatre setups.
In addition, we aim to observe further 5 non-robotic procedures to evaluate staff teamwork and communication within the more regular theatre setup.</description>
