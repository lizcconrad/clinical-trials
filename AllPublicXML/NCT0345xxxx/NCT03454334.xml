      This investigation assessed the visual performance of presbyopia and cataract patients after
      bilateral implantation of 4 distinct sorts of multifocal IOLs: At lisa tri, PanOptix, ReSTOR,
      and Symfony. The clinical results demonstrated here were excellent for four groups, however,
      there were also differences in group ReSTOR, UCVA and BCVA for the intermediate and near of
      the other groups showed less vision also symphony group for far distance demonstrated less
      vision than other groups, which may be related to their design.Multifocal IOLs demonstrated
      very good technology and unquestionably have a place in refractive surgery, whether for clear
      lens extraction or cataracts.Patients can expect excellent outcomes and surgeons can expect
      patients to be very satisfied with surgical outcomes. Four groups multifocal lenses provided
      excellent distance, intermediate and near vision, but several measures indicated that the
      PanOptix and at lisa tri lens provided better vision in all distances. Spectacle independence
      was significantly higher with four groups. Multifocal IOL design might play a role in the
      postsurgical outcome, because better results were obtained with diffractive lenses. Although
      there were differences in the results of these four lenses in the study, all of the results
      were acceptable.

    <description>mean postoperative contrast sensitivity in logarithmic scale under binocular mesopic and photopic conditions. There was no significant difference in the values obtained between at lisa tri and PanOptix at spatial frequencies of 1 cpd and 3, 6, 12, 18 cpd. Eyes with the PanOptix and at lisa tri IOL showed better contrast sensitivity than ReSTOR and Symfony at spatial frequencies of 1, 3, 6 cpd (P&lt;0.001) in photopic and mesopic conditions. The curves achieved with monocular vision were equivalent with binocular vision that was achieved.</description>
