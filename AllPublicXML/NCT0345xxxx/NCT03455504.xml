      This study will test the effectiveness and safety of Venetoclax in combination with standard
      induction regimen for patients with acute leukemia and poor prognosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intensive treatment of Acute Leukemia, multidrug based chemotherapy induction, achieves
      complete remission (CR) rates ranging from 50% to 80%. Nonetheless, the majority (60- 70%) of
      responding patients will eventually relapse.

      Patients with non-low risk leukemia according most diffuse risk scores have a poor prognosis
      and a short survival. For these patient traditional chemotherapy seems to be ineffective,
      even with BMT consolidation, probably due to activation of survival pathways in Leukemia
      cells, so that novel therapeutic interventions should be attempted.

      This study will test the effectiveness and safety of Venetoclax, a selective BCL2 inhibitor,
      in combination with standard induction regimen.

      Inhibiting anti-apoptotic pathway of BCL2, the investigators expect to improve success rate
      of standard chemotherapies.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with documented/confirmed new onset non-m3 acute myeloid leukemia, according
             to WHO 2017 will be eligible for this study.

          -  Hematological illness has to be graded intermediate or high risk according ELN
             criteria

          -  Patients ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 65 years old

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2.

          -  Patients with a life expectancy &gt;12 weeks

          -  Patients may have AML which has arisen from prior therapies or other antecedent
             disorder

          -  Adequate hepatic function

          -  Adequate pancreatic function

          -  Adequate renal function assessed by: Serum creatinine within reference laboratory
             ranges or creatinine clearance (by Cockcroft Gault formula, see Appendix 2) ≥ 50
             mL/min for patients in whom, in the Investigator's judgment, serum creatinine level
             may not adequately reflect renal function.

          -  All non-hematological adverse events must have resolved to NCI-CTCAE Grade ≤ 2 prior
             to starting therapy.

          -  Patients must be considered by Investigator suitable to receive combination
             chemotherapy.

          -  Combination chemotherapy has not to be considered toxic without expectation of any
             benefit for the patient

          -  For females of childbearing potential, a negative pregnancy test must be documented
             within 72 hours prior to the first study drug administration.

          -  All patients must be willing to use effective methods of contraception, during the
             treatment period and for 100 days after the last dose of Venetoclax. Female patients
             must be postmenopausal (≥ 1 year of amenorrhea), surgically sterile, or they must
             agree to use 2 adequate methods of contraception with at least one method with a
             failure rate of

             ≤ 1% per year (e.g., hormonal implants, combined oral contraceptives, vasectomized
             partner) and the second preferably a physical barrier method of contraception. Oral or
             injectable contraceptive agents cannot be the sole method of contraception. Male
             patients must be surgically sterile or agree to use an acceptable method of
             contraception.

          -  Patient must be willing to submit the blood sampling and bone marrow sampling for the
             PK and PD analyses and exploratory biomarkers.
