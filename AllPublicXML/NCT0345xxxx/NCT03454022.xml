  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful communication between patients, caregivers, and physicians can improve how
      patients feel about their treatment. Our recent studies of older dialysis patients find,
      however, that many patients do not engage in this type of communication about treatment
      options. This study aims to determine whether the Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy (DART), a
      web-based program, can improve shared decision-making (decisions where patients are actively
      engaged) among patients, caregivers, and physicians, and improve certainty and satisfaction
      in treatment decisions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Successful end-of-life communication between patients, caregivers, and physicians is
      associated with superior psychosocial outcomes, less intensive treatment, greater
      satisfaction, and higher likelihood of death at home. The Decision-Aid for Renal Therapy
      (DART) is an interactive web-based decision-aid that can empower patients and caregivers to
      select the treatment choice for chronic kidney disease that best suits them. DART was
      developed using a rigorous, validated, patient-engaged process and helps clarify
      decision-points and tradeoffs by providing individualized information about outcomes that
      matter most to patients. DART is designed to promote shared decision-making between patients,
      caregivers, and physicians and align preferences with treatment received.

      Although proven effective and in current use in the general population, DART's effectiveness
      in an older population is unclear. The purpose of this project is to conduct a pilot study of
      DART's feasibility and effectiveness to improve end-of-life planning and shared
      decision-making among older end-stage renal disease patients.

    <description>Measures personal perceptions of: a) uncertainty in choosing options; b) modifiable factors contributing to uncertainty such as feeling uninformed, unclear about personal values and unsupported in decision making; and c) effective decision making such as feeling the choice is informed, values-based, likely to be implemented and expressing satisfaction with the choice. Scores range from 0 (no decisional conflict) to 100 (extremely high decisional conflict).</description>
