    <textblock>
      The goal of this research program is to implement and evaluate complementary interventions
      designed to address underage alcohol, marijuana, tobacco and other drug use and abuse among
      Native American youth residing in and around nine contiguous Indian reservations in rural
      portions of a Southern California county.

      Component 1. Motivational Interviewing (MI) Evaluations (Identified PHI). Approximately 150
      participants between 13 and 20 years of age will participate in the Motivational Interviewing
      (MI) intervention and the three follow-up assessments over an 18 month period. Questionnaires
      of youth substance use and access patterns will be by phone or self-administered using paper,
      iPad, and web-based surveys. Formal informed consent from participants 18 and older and
      assent and parental/legal guardian consent will be obtained from those participants under 18.

      Component 2. Psychoeducation (PE) Evaluations (Identified PHI). Approximately 150
      participants between 13 and 20 years of age will participate in the Psychoeducation (PE)
      intervention and the three follow-up assessments over an 18 month period. Questionnaires of
      youth substance use and access patterns will be by phone or self-administered using paper,
      iPad, and web-based surveys. Formal informed consent from participants 18 and older and
      assent and parental/legal guardian consent will be obtained from those participants under 18.

      Study Design. Following screening and giving informed assent/consent, eligible participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of two study conditions: (1) MI: four weekly one hour
      sessions of therapist administered MI, and (2) PE: four weekly one hour sessions of therapist
      assisted educational DVD about adolescent alcohol use, drug use, and driving under the
      influence provided by Human Relations Media, Mount Kisco, NY (hrmvideo.com).

      Interventions will be curriculum based in that each session will be introduced by the leader
      with a brief description of problems associated with underage drinking, underage binge
      drinking, underage tobacco and other drug use, and driving while intoxicated. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to the MI or PE condition, but will be able to choose an individual
      or group intervention format. In a preliminary study, the investigators have found that many
      youth prefer a group format. Both individual and group formats have been successfully used
      previously in this population.

      Assessments will be carried out pre-intervention and at 6, 12, and 18 months
      post-intervention. Pre-intervention assessments will be carried out in person and
      post-intervention assessments will be done in person, by telephone, or be web-based using
      questionnaires developed at Brown University and previously used successfully in youth in
      this population. Participating youth will be paid $75 for the initial four hour intervention
      and $25 for completing each of the three follow-ups. The payments will be in the form of
      Target or other department store gift cards. All questionnaires will be available on
      scannable paper forms or as a web-based application to permit ease and accuracy of data
      transmittal to a database for evaluation.

      Measures: in addition to collecting demographic data, the following measures will be used
      pre-intervention (MI or PE) and at 6, 12, and 18 months post-intervention: Adolescent
      Drinking Questionnaire (ADQ), Drug Use Questionnaire, Drinking and Drug Use Driving Scale,
      Tobacco Use Scale, Injury behavior checklist, Student Self Check, Relationship with
      Parent/Guardian - Most Important, Teen Monitoring (Chassin), Peer Substance Use, Peer
      Tolerance of Substance Use, Stage of Change Assessment, MI Adherence Checklist (for the MI
      sessions only).

      Examples of potential factors include information transfer, change in beliefs, internalizing
      new norms, resolving ambivalence, establishing increased autonomy, empowering for change,
      peer modeling, and peer support. The investigators will assess 1) these change factors, 2)
      the participant's movement along the stages of behavior change to a new level of
      drinking/drug use, and 3) self-reported changes in drinking, drug use, and intoxicated
      driving. With these data the investigators will be able to determine not only the overall
      efficacy of the MI vs. PE intervention in decreasing alcohol and drug use and intoxicated
      driving and their efficacy over time (at 6 month intervals for 18 months), but also the type
      of behavior change (e.g., moving from pre-contemplation to action) and the variables
      associated with that change (e.g., internalizing new norms, increased autonomy, peer
      support).

      The MI intervention will incorporate open-ended questions, personalized feedback, and
      discussion about participants' alcohol use and drug, associated risk behaviors (e.g.,
      drinking and driving), and the consequences of these behaviors. Individual MI procedures will
      incorporate the core principles of MI described by Miller and Rollnick, including expressing
      empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy.
      Therapist interventions will be tailored to the participants' readiness to change/current
      stage of change (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and
      relapse).

      In the PE intervention, participants will view one DVD at each of the four PE sessions (all
      DVDs available from Human Relations Media:

      Session 1: Underage Drinking: Know the Facts, Know the Risks describes negative consequences
      of youth alcohol abuse, including deaths resulting from drunk driving, and alcohol poisoning.

      Session 2: Too Much: Extreme Danger of Binge-Drinking presents information specifically about
      the physiology of how binge drinking can cause death, and an interview with a parent of a
      student who died from alcohol poisoning while partying with his friends.

      Session 3: Everything You Need to Know About Substance Abuse in 22 Minutes outlines alcohol,
      tobacco, and other drugs' effects.

      Session 4: Dying High 2: Real Stories of Drugged Driving shows consequences of driving under
      the influence.

      Training in MI. Under the supervision of Dr. Gilder, at least six training workshops will be
      held with Tribal clinic study staff to deliver culturally appropriate MI to adolescent Native
      Americans. Workshop leaders will be Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers (MINT)
      certified PhD-level trainers with expertise in working with American Indian/Alaska Native
      populations.

      Assessment of MI fidelity. Since tribal leaders and parents, citing confidentiality and
      cultural concerns, stated that audio- and video-taping of MI sessions would not be
      acceptable, the investigators will assess the MI sessions with the Adherence Checklist -
      Individual and Group MI Prevention Session. The checklist contains 14 items which assess the
      session's process and content and the therapist's adhering to the principles of MI. Items
      include asking if the therapist discussed the pros and cons of changing behavior, and
      introduced a change plan worksheet to the participant. Therapist fidelity to MI will be
      assessed both during training and on an ongoing basis every 6 months during the study using
      the MI Adherence checklist. If the average total checklist score of adherence falls below
      80%, a quality improvement program will be instituted to identify the problem(s) and correct
      it with additional training.

      Follow-Up. The investigators believe, given the success of the preliminary pilot study in
      recruiting reservation youth to the initial assessment and intervention, that successful
      follow-up of participants represents the main potential problem for the study. These
      obstacles were overcome, at least in part, by 1) instituting a web-based assessment that
      adolescents can take any time, including free time at school; 2) keeping email and regular
      mail addresses of participants current; 3) increasing payment for follow-up and paying for
      each follow-up session individually; 4) instituting follow-up in conjunction with a program
      the adolescent is participating in, i.e. after school youth program, and appointments at the
      clinic for medical and dental services. The Tribal IRB has given permission for the web-based
      assessment.

      This intervention study aims to recruit 150 participants to each intervention condition for a
      total enrollment of 300 youth participants ages 13-20 years. Evaluation will be designed to
      test that MI is more effective than the PE in reducing alcohol and drug use and intoxicated
      driving at 6, 12, and 18 months post intervention. Evaluations to test that MI is more
      effective than the PE in reducing alcohol and drug use will be undertaken as follows: The
      primary outcome variables will be: in the previous 6 months (1) quantity x frequency of
      drinking, (2) frequency of binge drinking and being drunk; (3) number of days used
      cigarettes, other forms of tobacco, e-cigarettes and nicotine inhalant devices, cannabis,
      &quot;Spice,&quot; stimulants, opiates, cough syrup, inhalants, hallucinogens, and benzodiazepines; (4)
      drinking or using drugs and driving and/or being a passenger in a car with a driver who has
      been using alcohol or drugs; (5) a negative consequences of drinking or using drugs composite
      score.

      Descriptive statistics will be generated for each variable. Statistical analyses assessing MI
      vs. PE differences will be assessed as follows. For dichotomous variables, repeated-measures
      chi-square analyses will be used. For continuous variables, repeated measures analysis of
      variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used. The Mann-Whitney Test will
      be used for continuous variables that are not normally distributed. Repeated measures of
      ordinal data for two time points and for 3 or more time points will be assessed using the
      Wilcoxin Signed Ranks Test and Friedman's Test, respectively. With 2 groups, 150 participants
      in each group, an alpha = 0.01 to avoid a Type 1 error, a medium effect size for the group of
      dependent variables analyzed in chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression analyses, and a
      Bonferroni correction for 5 multiple comparisons in each set of analyses, the power at the
      projected n for chi-square, ANOVA, and logistic regression will be 0.96, 0.96, and &gt;0.80,
      respectively. Power estimates were made using G*Power 3.61 If sample size permits, a larger
      model examining the association of selected outcome variables (e.g., frequency of bingeing
      and drinking/driving in the past 6 months) with independent variables (e.g., age, gender,
      stage of change, MI vs. PE intervention) in multiple and logistic regression models will also
      be evaluated.
