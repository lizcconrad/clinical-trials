  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac rhythm disorder particularly common in intensive care
      patients. Some meta-analyzes report a prevalence of new onset AF ranging from 4.5% to 29.5%
      in polyvalent intensive care. In our department, a recent month-long survey showed that more
      than 30% of the patients who were unhealthy on admission suffer from an episode of new onset
      AF during their stay.

      The occurrence of AF in intensive care has a pejorative effect on the patient's outcome, and
      this through two factors. On the one hand, the decreasing of cardiac output by degradation of
      the ventricular filling in diastole time, on the other hand the FA is responsible for an
      over-risk of ischemic stroke. In fact, it has been shown that the occurrence of new onset AF
      in intensive care is associated with a higher level of severity and a higher mortality. It is
      also important to underline the medico-economic impact of this rhythmic disorder as
      complication of shock due to the frequent prescription of various anti-arrhythmic or
      anticoagulant medication.

      Various factors have been mentioned to explain the frequent occurrence of AF in shocked
      patients. The shock state, whatever its origin, is characterized by the occurrence of a
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome in which is observed a particularly important
      releasing of stress hormones and endogenous catecholamines involved in the occurrence of a
      rapid multi-organ failure without treatment. Systemic humoral elements are possibly involved
      in the occurrence of new onset AF, such as high level of inflammation that characterizes
      shock states. In addition, physiological factors such as hypoxia, hypovolemia, hyperthermia
      or ionic disorders are also implicated, but their non-systemic association with intensive
      care new onset FA suggests that humoral factors may play an important and independent role.
      Among these humoral factors, the proteins of chromogranin family particularly Vasostatin-I
      (VS-I) seem possibly involved in the genesis of AF in the aggressed intensive care patients.
      Several studies have highlighted the beneficial regulatory role of VS-I on the cardiovascular
      system, particularly in a study on a canine model Stavrakis and al. have shown the VS-I
      protective role on the FA occurrence.

      However, as has been demonstrated in a prospective study in intensive care, the rates of
      circulating VS-I were significantly higher in the most severe patients and those whose
      prognosis was the most pejorative, thus not supporting the thesis of the protective effect of
      VS-I. An explanation exists for this discrepancy: VS-I is present in two distinct forms in
      the circulating blood. In vitro work carried out within the U1121 INSERM team with has made
      it possible to highlight the coexistence of two forms of VS-1: an aggregated &quot;inactive&quot; form
      and an &quot;active&quot; disaggregated form. In our hypothesis, the inactive aggregated form would be
      predominant during the states of acute pathological aggressions such as the shock and thus
      would not exert the anti arrhythmic and cardio protector expected functions.

      The first aim of our study is therefore to confirm that the onset of new onset FA during the
      shock state is associated with a significant decrease in the VS-I plasma level in its
      monomeric form called &quot;active&quot;, even when high levels of total VS-1 are detected by ELISA in
      the plasma of patients.

      Our project is a pilot and unpublished translational work. The link between VS-I and new
      onset AF in intensive care severe patients has never been studied in vivo, and the recent
      work of the associated INSERM team provides advances in understanding the function of VS-I
      over time shock conditions. Nevertheless, our experimental hypothesis require confirmation in
      humans.

      A better understanding of the factors influencing the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in
      intensive care patients is a major ambition as it would be a step forward in the development
      of a preventive strategy or new treatment for the benefit of patients.
