  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epiretinal membranes (ERM) are disorders leading to vision loss and metamorphopsia.
      Vitrectomy with membrane peeling has developed to be the gold-standard in treatment of ERM.
      ERM can be well visualized with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).

      The aim of the study is to examine ERM and internal limiting membranes (ILM) exzised during
      routine macular surgery with fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and compare
      results to optic coherence tomography (OCT) findings.

    <textblock>
      Purpose of the present study is to analyse components of ERM and ILM, giving hints for the
      origin of cells producing ERM. In contrast to electron microscopy, FTIR spectroscopy does not
      need any chemical fixation of the membranes and therefore structure of components of ERM and
      ILM are not changed by fixation.

      In total, 20 eyes with idiopathic ERM, 10 eyes with lamellar macular hole, 10 eyes with full
      thickness macular hole and 10 eyes with diabetic ERM will be examined. To our knowledge there
      are no previous reports about FTIR spectroscopy of ERM and ILM, therefore the study will be
      performed as an exploratory pilot study.
