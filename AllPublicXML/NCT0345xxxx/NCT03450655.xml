  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the increasing prevalence of obesity, there is an urgent need to find better strategies
      to promote physical activity in the community. The present study will invite 70-year-olds
      with central (abdominal) obesity to participate in a 10-week aerobic exercise program.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two equally large groups. The first group
      will complete the exercise program in instructor-led groups. The second group will complete
      the program at home with the help of an on-line video.

      Central obesity means having a lot visceral fat, that is, fat located in the abdominal
      cavity. Visceral fat is a well-established risk factor for cardiovascular disease and
      all-cause mortality.

      Participants will be recruited from the Healthy Ageing Initiative (HAI), an ongoing
      population-based study that invites all 70-year-olds in Umeå, Sweden, to a health
      examination. The exercise program will focus is on station-based aerobic exercises and
      resistance exercises, predominantly with participants' own body weight as resistance. The
      program is progressive, starting at a moderate pace so that participants learn to perform the
      exercises properly. The intensity will be aimed at 60-80% of maximal exhaustion, and each
      exercise bout will last 60 seconds with 20 seconds of rest between bouts. The program was
      developed by seniors in the bachelor's program in exercise physiology at Umeå University,
      Sweden.
