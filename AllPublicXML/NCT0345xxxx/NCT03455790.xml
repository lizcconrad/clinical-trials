  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the relationship between shoulder internal and
      external rotation isokinetic muscle strength, grip strength, anaerobic capacity, aerobic
      capacity and sportive performance in wheelchair basketball athletes. Through this work, we
      aim to contribute to the literature with objective, blood-based results.

      The wheelchair (WC) basketball characterizes high intensity activities such as rolling,
      rebounding, rolling, smashing overhead. Because these activities are fast and powerful, they
      require both anaerobic and aerobic capacities. The main factors affecting WC Basketball
      performance are upper extremity muscle strength and aerobic capacity. It is stated that
      higher muscle power and aerobic performance in WC Basketball will provide more independence
      in daily life activities as well as increased speed and power during sports play.

      WC basketball players have both a spore-specific activities and a shoulder rotational muscle
      strength aerobic power components have a critical functional role when using a wheelchair.
      When the literature on this subject is examined, it is seen that there is a limited number of
      works for WC basketball sport which is very popular nowadays. Assessment of upper limb muscle
      strength, aerobic capacity and sporting performance in wheelchair basketball athletes is
      crucial in regulating the athletes' training programs and establishing individual training
      programs.

      This study was aimed to investigate the relationship between isokinetic muscle strength of
      shoulder internal and external rotation, grip strength, anaerobic capacity, aerobic capacity
      and sportive performance in wheelchair basketball athletes.

      26 wheelchair basketball athletes were involved into the study. Wheelchair basketball players
      were divided into two groups according to the classification levels (Group 1: less than 3
      points, Group 2: 3 points and higher). Upper extremity muscle strengths were evaluated with
      the ISOMED 2000® isokinetic device. Hand grip strength was evaluated with hydraulic hand
      dynamometer. The measurement of the aerobic capacity was measured using its own wheelchair on
      the treadmill by applying a custom ramp protocol. Anaerobic capacity was evaluated with
      Wingate anaerobic power test (WAnT) for 30 seconds in standard laboratory conditions. The
      sportive performances were assessed by &quot;20 m Sprint test&quot;, &quot;Slalom Test&quot; and &quot;Zone Shot&quot;
      tests.

The aerobic capacity values will be measured using the Cosmed K5® instrument and the TS in the Cosmos-Saturn brand running band. Anaerobic capacity will be measured by Wingate anaerobic power test (WanT) for 30 seconds in standard laboratory conditions for TS basketball athletes using Monark 894 E model ergometer developed by Monark for upper extremity anaerobic capacity and power measurement. The sporty performances will be evaluated with the &quot;20 m Sprint test&quot;, &quot;Slalom Test&quot; and &quot;Zone Shot&quot; tests.</description>

The sportsman will be prompted to take the chair as fast as possible after the wheelchair has been positioned so that the front bar is on the field edge. The 2 meter slow-down distance will also be counted in seconds and the completion time of the 20 meter track will be measured.</description>

    <description>It will be done to measure the ability of sportsmen to use wheelchairs. Five cones will be placed starting 1.5 meters from the starting line of the Sahara, with a distance of 1.5 meters between them. Sportsmen will be required to complete the course by making a slalom between these topics and making a slalom in the same way by turning back and passing through the starting line. Track completion times will be recorded in seconds.</description>

    <description>Zone Shot test will be applied to evaluate the shooting skills of the athletes. In the starting position the athlete will be asked to shoot the pot from the athlete with the warning given while on the foul shooting line and then to take their own rebounds. They will have to shoot again from the point where they have taken the rebound and rebound and go back to the foul line. The test will continue for 2 minutes in this manner. At the end of the 2-minute training period, the athletes will score the correct shot 2, the missed shot 1 point and the total score will be recorded.</description>
