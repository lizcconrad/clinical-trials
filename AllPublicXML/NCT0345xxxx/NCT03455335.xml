  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a phase 1b, open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized dose-escalation study of
      autologous bone marrow-derived MSCs. Following informed consent, patients who meet the
      criteria will be screened and enrolled. Up to 100 mls of bone marrow will be harvested from
      the participant from which MSCs will be culture expanded. In this dose escalation study, 3
      participants on each cohort will be treated with a targeted dose of either 20 million hMSC;
      40 million hMSC; or 80 million hMSC. The cells will be administered to the ischemic leg by 20
      intramuscular injections of approximately 0.5ml per injection . Treatment groups will be
      completed sequentially, beginning with the lowest dose group.

      This is a phase 1b, open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized dose-escalation study to examine
      the safety of intramuscular autologous transplantation of escalating doses of mesenchymal
      stem cells to patients with no option critical limb ischemia.

      Trial Aims and Objectives: To examine the safety of intramuscular transplantation of
      escalating doses of autologous bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells to patients with no
      option critical limb ischemia.

      Patient Population: Patients with critical limb ischemia who are not candidates for
      revascularization.

      Trial Setting:HRB Clinical Research Facility Galway and Galway University Hospitals.

      Trial Intervention:Intramuscular delivery of autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells to patients with no option critical limb ischemia.

      Study Design: Open label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, dose escalation study. Sample Size: 9
      Method of Participant Assignment:Sequential administration of 3 escalating doses of
      autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

      Examination Points: Day 0, 7, 30, 90, 180, 365 and 730 Primary Outcome: Serious adverse
      events that are attributable to intervention. Secondary Outcomes :Amputation free survival,
      median time to amputation, TcPo2, ABI, pain scale, ulcer healing, quality of life
      assessments, collateral vessel formation detected by MRI at 12 months.
