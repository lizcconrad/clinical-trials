      The present prospective study aims to assess the efficacy of using the telehealth solution
      &quot;Hypertension Monitor&quot; in patients with hypertension by comparison to the standard care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, meta-analysis confirms that BP telemonitoring may represent a useful tool to
      improve hypertension management, the strength of the provided evidence is limited. Therefore,
      future well-designed, large-sample, prospective, controlled trials are mandatory to
      understand the benefit of BP telemonitoring.

      Recently, a specific telehealth solution for hypertension management has been developed in
      France (Hypertension Monitor - e-CoreLab®).

      The present prospective study aims to assess the efficacy of using the telehealth solution
      &quot;Hypertension Monitor&quot; in patients with hypertension by comparison to the standard care.

      The primary objective: To evaluate whether a home telehealth system can improve BP control
      and other risk factors in hypertensive individuals, as compared to the standard care.
