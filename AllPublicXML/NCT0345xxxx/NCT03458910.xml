  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback aimed at increasing
      HRV can reduce anxiety and stress. However, some mental quiescence practices that reduce HRV
      during the practice sessions also lead to positive emotional outcomes. Thus, it is not
      obvious that the benefits of HRV-biofeedback accrue due to increasing HRV during the session.
      An alternative possibility is that the benefits arise from engaging prefrontal control over
      heart rate. In this study, the investigators will test two possible mechanisms of the effects
      of HRV on emotional health by comparing two groups. In one group, participants will be asked
      to engage in daily training to decrease HRV using the HRV biofeedback device. In the other
      group, participants will be asked to engage in daily training to increase HRV using the HRV
      biofeedback device. This will allow analyses to pit two possible mechanisms against each
      other:

        1. Mechanism 1: engaging prefrontal control over heart rate is the critical factor that
           allows HRV biofeedback to help improve well-being. In this case, well-being should
           increase over time in both groups, as both training should engage prefrontal cortex to
           implement self-directed control over heart rate. Strengthening prefrontal control
           mechanisms may help improve emotion regulation in everyday life.

        2. Mechanism 2: increased HRV during the training sessions leads to greater functional
           connectivity among brain regions associated with emotion regulation during the high HRV
           state. In this case, improved well-being would be specifically associated with having
           time each day during which there were very high HRV states, and so improved well-being
           should be seen only in the group in which participants get biofeedback to increase HRV.
