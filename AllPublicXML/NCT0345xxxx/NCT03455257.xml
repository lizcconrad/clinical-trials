      This pilot study will test the effect of a cash transfer program aiming to improve family
      food consumption patterns, family health and schooling, with resulting benefits for childhood
      growth and cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cash transfer (CT) programs in low-income countries that allow recipients to receive cash
      designated for specific household expenditures such as food and family health and education
      typically show significant program benefits. In particular, several programs have shown
      positive impacts on use of health care resources, nutrition status and self-reported health,
      along with significant improvements in the motor and cognitive development of young children.

      Guinea-Bissau is currently the 11th poorest country and is thus an appropriate target for a
      cash transfer program. This project will pilot test the effect of a 2 year cash transfer
      program aiming to improve family food consumption patterns, family health and schooling, with
      resulting benefits for childhood growth and cognition. Family-wide assessment will be
      conducted to examine the impact in all family members. Baseline and 3 follow up assessments
      will be completed.

    <description>The heads of households will receive a cash transfer for up to 7 family members in the home every quarter. Head of households will be expected to attend meetings every 4 months at their local community health centers led by Community Health Workers (CHW). Meetings will have 2 components: 1) children under 5 will be measured to identify children at risk of malnutrition and 2) group education sessions. There will also be monthly growth monitoring and education sessions led by CHW for a subgroup of head of households with children identified as risk of malnutrition with rapid referrals to regional tertiary clinics for any children with health problems that cannot be addressed by CHW.</description>
