  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study allows patients to take part of the decision making between a unicompartment knee
      (partial ) or a total Knee replacement . Using the measures of a decision aid questionnaire
      which explicitly details the risks and benefits of both procedures.The study will use
      subjective (reported by patient) and objective data (which will be measured) to allow the
      determination if one option is superior to the other. Information gathered from this study
      will be used to assist future patients in selecting the surgical option that best fits their
      life style.

      A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial will help to evaluate the outcomes
      of both procedures and help shape a multicentre Canadian study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis of the knee is an increasingly common problem for many Canadians aged 50 or
      greater. When conservative management fails, patients are often offered a type of knee
      replacement as treatment. The choices are a total knee replacement or a partial knee
      replacement, which carry distinct advantages and disadvantages. Typically, patients with
      partial knee replacement have less post operative pain, quicker recovery and enhanced
      function with greater knee bend. There is however a higher chance of revision where the pain
      is not relieved or the implant fails. The decision for which replacement to offer is now
      primarily surgeon driven, shaped by their experience, review of evidence and capability to
      perform either of these options. Canadian patients would benefit from a decision making model
      so their own values can shape and determine the decision. This research hopes to evaluate the
      merits of a patient based decision aid which explicitly details the risks and benefits of
      both procedures as they are best understood today. Further, the quality of the current
      evidence is only moderately strong limited by patient selection biases and there is a need
      for contemporary comparative study trial of the 2 procedures to help clinicians and patients
      make the decision.

      A feasibility pilot study of a randomized clinical trial is being proposed to evaluate the
      outcomes of both procedures, which will help shape a multicentre Canadian study.

    <measure>Change in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) Index</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire is the sum of WOMAC A (total pain), WOMAC B (stiffness) and WOMAC C (functional impairment) subscores. All the items are scored on a scale of 0-4; lower scores are indicative of lower disease burden. Values are summed for a combined WOMAC score (Total score ranges from 0-96, with higher scores indicating worse pain, stiffness, and functional limitations).</description>

    <measure>Change in Oxford Knee Score (OKS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported questionnaire. The sum of the questionnaire will be totaled. Oxford Knee Score Scale range 0 (severe arthritis) - 48 (satisfactory joint function)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Knee Society Score (KSS) is comprised of 4 components: 1) An &quot;Objective&quot; Knee Score (7 items: 100 points), 2) A Patient Satisfaction Score (5 items: 40 points), 3) A Patient Expectation Score (3 items: 15 points), and 4) A Functional Activity Score (19 items: 100 points). Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative analysis of gait using EMG and motion capture</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>A ten-camera infrared motion capture system will be used to track patients gait in a Biomechanics Laboratory. Retroreflective markers will be placed on the body in various locations to track muscle activity. Patients will be asked to perform 5 trials of level walking, 5 trials of inclined and declined walking (12.5% slope), 5 trials of going up and down stairs and 5 trials of sitting and standing motions. Only patients exhibiting the following characteristics will be suitable for assessment: BMI of 35 or less, No other ipsilateral or contralateral lower limb joint disorders.</description>

    <measure>Short Term Recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients recovery will be evaluated using the 40 item, quality of recovery (QoR-40) questionnaire. The sum of all scores (the total) will be reported (Minimum=40, Maximum=200). Higher scores are indicative of better perceived recovery while lower scores are associated with a worse perceived recovery.</description>
