  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well auranofin and sirolimus work in treating participants
      with ovarian cancer. Immunosuppressive therapy, such as auranofin and sirolimus, is used to
      decrease the body?s immune response and may increase blood cell count.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response [CR] +
      partial response [PR]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of
      metastatic serous ovarian cancer across all patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the overall tumor response rate (ORR, that is, complete response [CR] +
      partial response [PR]) of the combination of auranofin and sirolimus in the setting of
      metastatic serous ovarian cancer within patients that have overexpression of PKCiota.

      II. To estimate progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events from the
      combination of auranofin and sirolimus.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether PKCiota-relevant biomarkers in serous ovarian cancer tumors are
      associated with treatment response patterns, such as ORR, progression free survival, and
      overall survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive auranofin orally (PO) once daily (QD) and sirolimus PO QD on days 1-28.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
