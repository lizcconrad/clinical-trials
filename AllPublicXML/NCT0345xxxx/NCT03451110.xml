  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to evaluate the effect of lemborexant 10 milligrams (mg) (at
      steady state) on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a single-dose combined oral contraceptive,
      Loestrin 1.5/30 (containing 0.030 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 1.5 mg of norethindrone), and
      to evaluate the effect of fluconazole 200 mg (at steady state) and a single dose of
      famotidine 40 mg (an H2 blocker) on the PK of a single oral dose of lemborexant 10 mg.
