  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of adolescent depression is steadily rising in the U.S., especially among
      adolescent girls. Currently 20% of adolescent girls experience major depression compared with
      6% of boys (National Institute of Mental Health, 2016). The profound gender disparity in
      depression that emerges at puberty, but not before, implicates a role of ovarian steroid
      hormones in promoting affective (mood) symptoms in adolescent girls. In addition to dramatic
      physical maturation and a rapidly changing reproductive hormone environment at puberty,
      adolescence is also a time of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress, particularly in
      girls. It is well documented that stress interferes with the maturation of neurodevelopmental
      trajectories and is a critical precipitating factor in the pathway to psychopathology.
      However, the neuropathophysiological mechanisms linking stress exposure and sensitivity to
      ovarian hormone fluctuations at puberty to the onset and maintenance of depression symptoms
      in adolescence have yet to be elucidated, and is the purpose of this research.

    <textblock>
      Framed within a diathesis-stress model of disease, the primary objective of this research is
      to determine a pathophysiological role of estradiol (E2) variability in the context of severe
      psychosocial stress exposure in regulating neurophysiological correlates of affective state
      change in girls (ages 12-14) during the pubertal transition (i.e., Tanner developmental
      stages 3 or 4). The rationale for examining E2 variability as a diathesis for mood impairment
      is twofold. First, sensitivity to hormonal flux during specific reproductive events has been
      shown to trigger affective symptoms in susceptible women, and second, E2 is a powerful
      neuroregulator of neural networks implicated in depression.

      35 peripubertal girls undergoing a healthy pubertal transition will be recruited for the
      study. Over an 8-week period, depression symptoms (Mood and Feelings Questionnaire (MFQ)) and
      psychosocial stress exposure (Coddington Life Events Record (CLER)), and serum E2 measured by
      liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) will be assessed on a weekly basis.
      An electroencephalogram (EEG) during an emotional go/no-go task will be performed after the
      8-week collection period to probe neurophysiological correlates of maturing fronto-limbic
      circuitry and assess key domains of cognitive and emotional processing impacted by the
      hormonal milieu. The central hypothesis of the proposed research is that the amplitude and
      synchrony of frontal neural oscillations evoked during the cognitive-affective processing
      paradigm will partially mediate the relationship between greater E2 variability and elevated
      depression symptoms in peripubertal girls, and this relationship will be particularly strong
      in girls who have experienced recent (within six months) psychosocial stress.
