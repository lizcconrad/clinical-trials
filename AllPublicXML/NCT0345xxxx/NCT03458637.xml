  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Family-based lifestyle intervention programmes have been known to reduce
      overweight and improve cardiovascular risk in adolescent obesity [1]. This study was designed
      to address the gap in service provision of a family based weight management program for
      overweight and obese adolescents. The LITE (Lifestyle Intervention for obese teenagers) group
      program is a 6-month, family-based behavioural lifestyle intervention, specifically designed
      to treat obesity in adolescents 10-16 years referred to the Weight Management Clinic. The
      main principles underpinning LITE program are that parents are identified as the agents of
      change responsible for implementing lifestyle change in the family .

      Methods: The study design is a two-arm randomized controlled trial that recruited 60
      overweight and obese adolescents 10-16 year olds that attended Kandang Kerbau Women and
      Children's Hospital(KKH) weight management clinic. Adolescents with secondary cause for
      obesity are excluded. Participants are randomized to LITE program with usual care or usual
      care.

      Briefly, the LITE program involves four x 180 min weekly sessions, followed by three x 90 min
      monthly sessions, for adolescents and parents. The key aspects covered in the LITE program
      are in keeping with Health Promotion Board guidelines for the management of overweight and
      obesity and include healthy food choices and eating patterns, increasing physical activity
      and reducing sedentary behavior. The parenting aspects aim to support and increase parental
      capacity to implement and maintain the lifestyle changes. The program takes a solution
      focused approach with families identifying small changes that they would like to try each
      week instead of a child-centric approach.

      Outcome measurement are assessed at 3 and 6 months post baseline and include anthropometric
      measurements, physical activity, dietary intake, metabolic profile, improvement in positive
      parenting behaviour and measurement of family support.

      Primary outcome is change in body mass index (BMI) z-score at 6 months. Secondary aim is to
      evaluate the changes in waist-height ratio and fat percentage change and improvement in
      positive parenting behaviour.
