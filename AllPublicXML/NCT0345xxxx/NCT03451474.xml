    <description>The Sollerman Hand Function Test is a standardized performance test designed to measure handgrips needed for certain activities of daily living (ADLs), such as eating, driving, personal hygiene, and writing. It includes multiple subtests that represent common handgrips and activities, completed using the hands both bilaterally and separately. Scoring of each subtest takes into account the time taken to complete the task, level of difficulty displayed, and quality of performance using correct grips. Scores range from 0 (task cannot be completed) - 4; a total score (0 - 80) is obtained from the sum of scores of all subtests.</description>

    <description>The DASH instrument is a 30-item, self-report questionnaire used to assess overall upper extremity function. The DASH requires subjects to rate their ability to perform tasks using the upper extremities. Individuals are instructed to report their ability to perform the tasks, regardless of which arm they use or what strategies they employ. A single disability/symptom score is produced. Scores range from 0-100, where a greater score indicates greater disability. The DASH will be administered by the physicians, nurses, or physical therapist involved in the study.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-operative, post-operative at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a questionnaire designed to measure general health and quality of life across eight, scaled scores (vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health)--a total score will be reported. The eight subscales are each given scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in each subscale section, and each subscale score is directly transformed into a total score of 0-100 scale. The lower the score the more disability,a and the higher the score the less disability (that is, a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability, and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability). The SF-36 will be administered by the physicians, nurses, or physical therapist involved in the study.</description>
