  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of the Noona
      Healthcare Mobile PRO Application to describe oncology patient engagement using a web-based
      symptom self-monitoring instrument. Additionally, the studyy will dentify side effects as
      well as long term or chronic adverse events during and following cancer therapy based on the
      United States (US) National Cancer Institute (NCI) Patient Reported Outcomes Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), and identify patients to participate in
      future long-term Quality of Life studies following cancer therapy.

      The study is not intended to compare outcomes between groups receiving different therapies.

    <description>Participants will create an account with Noona (web-based symptom tracking tool). Patients will be instructed to log symptoms as often as relevant using their own personal devices. Patients will also be prompted once per month for 12 months to log any recent symptoms.
These participants will be sent an Adverse Event Questionnaire (AEQ) via the Noona tool that summarizes their symptoms and distress once per month and one week prior to any medically indicated oncology clinic visit.
Symptoms designated as clinically severe either during regular symptom logging or via the AEQ will trigger a prompt to contact the clinical team for immediate follow-up. Participants will complete a follow-up questionnaire at 6 months and 12 months following enrollment that includes a self-report of symptom burden, HRQOL, and satisfaction.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Individuals (men and women) aged 18 years or older

          2. History cancer with no limitation on prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting

          3. ECOG performance status of 0-2

          4. Estimated life expectancy of at least 12 months

          5. Access to smartphone, tablet or computer with capability to utilize symptom-tracking
             application

          6. Willing and able to provide written, signed informed consent after the nature of the
             study has been explained, and prior to any research-related procedures

          7. Willing and able to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent disease or condition that interferes with participation or safety

          2. Non-English speaking, as the application is developed in the English language

          3. Children will not be included in the study. The pattern of disease and symptoms are
             different in children than in an adult population. The web-based tool was designed
             based on the symptom experience of adults with cancer.
