  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deficits in self-control are of major public health relevance as they contribute to several
      negative outcomes for both individuals and society. For children, developing self-control is
      a critically important step toward success in academic settings and social relationships, yet
      there are few non-pharmacological approaches that have been successful in increasing
      self-control. We found in our earlier studies that self-control can be increased in
      preschool-aged children with high impulsivity by using games in which they practice gradually
      increasing wait-time for larger, more delayed rewards. We are performing this current study
      to test if this training to increase self-control can be increased using mobile app
      technology, with computerized game time being used as a reward.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Problems with self-control are of major public health relevance as they are associated with
      substance abuse, suicide attempts, lower academic functioning, poor financial planning, and
      physical and mental health issues that impact both individuals and society. The ability to
      obtain immediate rewards in our daily lives is increasing due to technological advances from
      on-line games to Amazon deliveries within 1 hour after placing an order. There are fewer
      opportunities for children to learn how to wait. For children, developing self-control is a
      critically important step toward success in academic settings and social relationships, yet
      there are few non-pharmacological approaches that have been successful in increasing
      self-control.

      Our objective in this current proof-of-concept study is to replicate and extend our earlier
      finding (Schweitzer &amp; Sulzer-Azaroff, 1988) in which we demonstrated that self-control could
      be increased in preschool-aged children with high rates of impulsivity by using a &quot;shaping&quot;
      procedure whereby delays to larger, more delayed rewards were gradually increased. In this
      study we will aim to show that shaping self-control can be implemented using more
      sophisticated experimental design and mobile app technology.

      A principal goal of this R03 pilot project is to refine the procedural methods to ensure that
      they are developmentally-appropriate using a well-controlled design and procedures. Our plan
      is to develop and implement a mobile application (&quot;app&quot;), &quot;Delay Tolerance Application&quot;
      (DelTA) that administers real-time rewards in a delay discounting procedure, in which the
      child will choose between an immediate, shorter game playing and a delayed, longer version of
      playing the same game.

      This project will assess the feasibility of delivering the procedure via a mobile app and
      test if computerized games are effective rewards in a delay discounting context for young
      children (3-6 years) given that previous methods used immediately consumable rewards (e.g.,
      candy). Positive findings from this proof-of-concept project will support future clinical
      trial projects to improve self-control and the use of the procedure for other interventions.
      The app may eventually serve as a targeted, precision intervention for children who exhibit
      elevated impulsivity.

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomly assigned to one of two possible groups.
Group 1: Treatment; this group begins 6-week training with the self-control shaping application immediately after baseline.
Group 2: Wait-list Control; After baseline, this group waits for 6-weeks before completing another pre-training assessment and then starts the 6-week training with the self-control application.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Indifference point</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The indifference point on the tablet-task assessment is defined as the delay interval at which the child chooses 50% longer, larger rewards and 50% shorter, smaller rewards. Investigators hypothesize that the shaping group will have greater increases in their indifference points than the waitlist control group.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percent change in preference for longer, larger (LL) rewards</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of trials in which the child selects the longer, larger (LL) reward option during the tablet-task assessment will be recorded. Investigators hypothesize that the shaping group will have greater increases in the percentage of trials for which they choose the LL rewards compared to the waitlist control group.</description>

    <measure>The Preschool Life Skills Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 13-item teacher scale that assesses behaviors noted as important to educators in predicting preschool success: instruction following, functional communication, delay tolerance, and friendship skills. Investigators predict the greatest change in the delay tolerance scale in the shaping group compared to the waitlist control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Snack Delay Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of delay of gratification. In this task, the child is invited to play a game in which he or she is asked to wait for varying intervals (5 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds) before they can a a parent-approved treat. Behavior is coded for latency to touch and eat the snack (seconds). Investigators predict that the shaping group will have better improvement in delay of gratification in the Snack Delay Task compared to the waitlist control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dinky Toy Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of effortful control. In this task, the child is asked to look through a prize box containing toys while keeping his hands flat on the table. The child should then select a prize verbally by indicating the name of the toy or providing a description of it. Behavior is coded for latency to choose a prize and whether hands were removed from the designated table mat. Investigators predict that the shaping group will have better improvement in effortful control as measured by the Dinky Toy Task compared to the waitlist control group.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gift Wrap and Gift Delay Task</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An assessment of effortful control. In this task, the experimenter shows the child a bag containing a present that still needs to be wrapped. The child is told &quot;try not to look&quot; at the present during the wrapping process, which is completed by the experimenter at a table behind the child's back. The rule is to not peek at the gift. Sixty seconds later, when the experimenter has completed wrapping the gift, she will leave the room to search for a bow while instructing the child not to touch the present. The experimenter returns in 3 minutes, places the bow, and awards the gift. Behavior will be coded for the child's peeking strategy, and his latency to peek at the gift, touch the gift, and leave his seat while the experimenter is away. Investigators predict that the shaping group will have better improvement in effortful control as measured by the Gift Wrap and Gift Delay Task compared to the waitlist control group.</description>

    <description>Participants will be introduced to an adaptive tablet-based application that asks the child to choose between two options: 1) a shorter duration of game play that begins immediately, or 2) a longer duration of game play that begins after a delay. Depending on the child's choices, the application alters the pre-reward delay with the intent of training the child to tolerate longer delays for larger rewards (i.e., more game play). Children may participate in up to 25 approximately 30-minute training sessions over 3-6 weeks.</description>
