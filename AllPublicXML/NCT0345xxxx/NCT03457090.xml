  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine how venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) affects cerebral
      blood flow velocity (CBFV) measured by transcranial doppler (TCD), to determine whether
      specific changes in cerebral blood flow velocity may be associated with neurologic injury and
      to determine modifications of CBFV after withdrawal of ECMO.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venoarterial Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used in adult with refractory
      cardiac failure as a life-saving measure. Adults treated with ECMO survived to hospital
      discharge in 21,8% to 65,4% of cases. Neurologic complications such as intracranial
      hemorrhage, anoxia and ischemia are major causes of death and long-term disability in ECMO
      patients (7% to 14%). Current neurological monitoring techniques are insufficient to predict
      which critically ill patient receiving ECMO therapy will suffer from neurologic injury. Even
      after a clinical suspicion of neurologic injury, diagnosis can be difficult. TCD is commonly
      used to monitor the CBFV of traumatic brain injury. There are no reports that evaluate CBFV
      of patients requiring ECMO therapy. Patient will have to do both echocardiography and TCD to
      evaluate cardiac output and CBFV. We will repeat these dopplers every 24 hours until ECMO
      withdrawal and one day after explantation.

    <description>Examination that involves the completion of a TCD and an TTE (Trans-Thoracic Echocardiography) :
To reports clinical parameters at the time of the examination : ECG data: sinus rhythm, atrial or ventricular arrhythmia, state of consciousness, heart rate, O2 saturation
To review of pharmacological parameters at the time of the examination : presence of sedation; presence, type and dose of catecholamines.
To collect biological data from the day of the examination : Partial Pressure of O2, PaCO2 (partial pressure) and hematocrit
To collect possible additional examinations : brain scan, EEG. These are non-invasive exams that do not require patient displacement. Only the samples taken by the medical team as part of the treatment will be analyzed.</description>
