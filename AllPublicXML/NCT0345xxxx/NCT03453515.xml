    <textblock>
      This study evaluates an educational web-based intervention designed to increase adolescent
      boys' and girls' motivation and skills to engage in safer sexual behavior (HEART: Health
      Education and Relationship Training). Half of participants will receive HEART and half of
      participants will receive Growing Minds, an attention-matched control website focused on
      growth mindsets of intelligence and self-regulation. The ultimate goal of this work is to
      help youth reduce their risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases and to avoid
      unplanned pregnancies.
