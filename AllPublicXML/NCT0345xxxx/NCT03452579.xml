  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety and
      tolerability of an investigational drug called nivolumab (also known as BMS-936558) in
      glioblastoma (a malignant tumor, or GBM), when added to bevacizumab.

      Nivolumab is an antibody (a kind of human protein) that is being tested to see if it will
      allow the body's immune system to work against glioblastoma tumors. Opdivo (Nivolumab) is
      currently FDA approved in the United States for melanoma (a type of skin cancer), non-small
      cell lung cancer, renal cell cancer (a type of kidney cancer), Hodgkin's lymphoma but is not
      approved in glioblastoma. Nivolumab may help your immune system detect and attack cancer
      cells.

      Bevacizumab is a drug which works on the blood vessel that supply the tumor and potentially
      can starve the tumor by cutting off the blood supply to these tumors. Bevacizumab is
      commercially available and FDA approved for patients with recurrent glioblastoma.

      This study has two study groups. Arm 1 will receive the study drug Nivolumab 240mg and
      bevacizumab 10 mg (standard dose) every 2 weeks and Arm 2 will receive the study drug
      Nivolumab 240 mg and bevacizumab 3 mg (reduced dose) every 2 weeks. A process will be used to
      assign patients, by chance, to one of the study groups. Neither patients nor doctors can
      choose which group patients are in. This is done by chance because no one knows if one study
      group is better or worse than the other. 90 total patients are expected to participate in
      this study (45 patients in each arm).

      Your total participation in this study from the time you have signed the informed consent to
      your last visit, including follow-up visits, may be more than three years (depending on what
      effect the treatment has on your cancer, and how well you tolerate the treatment).

      Primary Endpoint(s) To evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab when administered with standard and
      reduced bevacizumab dosing among recurrent glioblastoma patients as measured by the rate of
      overall survival at twelve months.

      Secondary Endpoint(s) To evaluate the safety and tolerability of nivolumab in combination
      with bevacizumab administered according to standard and reduced dosage schedules for
      recurrent glioblastoma patients.

      To compare progression free survival (PFS) at 6 months of nivolumab when administered with
      standard and reduced bevacizumab dosing for recurrent glioblastoma patients.

      To compare the overall survival rate of nivolumab when administered with standard and reduced
      bevacizumab dosing for recurrent glioblastoma patients.

      To compare progression free survival (PFS) of when administered with standard and reduced
      bevacizumab dosing for recurrent glioblastoma patients.

      To compare the objective response rate (ORR) of nivolumab and bevacizumab administered
      according to standard and reduced dosage schedules for recurrent glioblastoma patients

      Exploratory Endpoints (s) To evaluate whether baseline values or subsequent changes in
      circulating immunologic parameters (including but not limited to the number of T-cells,
      B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells; the number of T cell subsets; soluble circulating
      cytokines) are associated with outcome.

      To assess neurologic functioning in the treatment arms using the Neurologic Assessment in
      Neuro-Oncology (NANO).

      To assess the perfusion and diffusion base imaging to correlate with changes and response to
      nivolumab when administered with standard and reduced bevacizumab dosing.

      To assess response using the immunotherapy response assessment in neuro-oncology criteria
      relative to survival.

      Study design and duration This is a randomized, open-label, phase 2 safety study of nivolumab
      and bevacizumab administered according to standard and reduced dosage schedules in adult (≥
      18 years) subjects with a first recurrence or second recurrence of glioblastoma (GBM).
      Subjects must have received previous treatment with radiotherapy and may have up to 2
      recurrences. Patients will undergo 1:1 randomization to receive treatment with either
      nivolumab (240 mg flat dosing IV every 2 weeks) and bevacizumab administered according to
      standard (10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; Arm A) and reduced (3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks; Arm B)
      dosage schedules for recurrent glioblastoma patients. The study will allow patients that
      require decadron up to 4 mg/ day to participate in the study.
