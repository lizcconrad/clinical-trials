  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are looking to understand: 1) how adults â‰¥ 60 years old
      thinking and memory abilities are affected by stem cell transplant; 2) whether these changes
      affect day-to-day activities and quality of life; and 3) how thinking and memory abilities
      are affected by genetics, depression, anxiety and physical function. Genetics and other
      factors may affect the brain's chemicals or structure, and may increase risk for negative
      effects on thinking and memory.
