      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of adding oral
      azacitadine to the chemotherapy combination R-ICE. This study will also look at whether or
      not disease outcomes improve with the combination.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic confirmation of relapsed/refractory disease of one of the following: DLBCL,
             transformed DLBCL, grade 3B follicular lypmphoma, B-Cell lymphoma unclassifiable with
             features intermediate between diffuse large B-cell lypmphoma and Burkitt lymphoma,
             primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma.

          -  Patients are encouraged to have a biopsy at screening but this may be waived with
             permission from the primary investigator.

          -  eligible for high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT)

          -  measurable disease on cross section imaging by PET and/or CT that is at least 1.5 cm
             in the longest diameter and measurable in two perpendicular dimensions as defined by
             IWG criteria.

          -  at least 18 years ole

          -  Able to understand and voluntarily sign consent prior to any study related assessments
             or procedures

          -  Adequate organ function as specified in the protocol.

          -  must have received at least one prior CD20 containing multi-agent chemotherapy regimen
             (R-CHOP, R-EPOCH). Bendamustine and rituximab can be the prior regimen if used for
             follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma and susequently transformed to DLBCL.

          -  A pre-phase treatment with prednisoe at 1mg/kg/day or equivalent, for a maximum of 10
             days leading up to the first dose of CC-486 is allowed. No washout period is
             necessitated for steroids.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) should be advised to avoid becoming pregnanct
             and men should be advised not to father a child while receiving treatment with
             azacitidine. All men and women of child-bearing potential must use acceptable methods
             of birth control throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  more than three prior treatments for the large cell component of lymphoma. Radiation

          -  prior history of malignancy other than DLBCL unless subjet is free of disease for more
             than 2 years from signing consent. Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the
             skin; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast;
             previously treated localized prostate cancer with normal PSA levels.

          -  significant active cardiac disease

          -  active viral infection of hepatitis type B or C.

          -  seropositive for HIV

          -  known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol

          -  patients with advanced malignant hepatic tumors

          -  any condition causing an inability to swallow pills

          -  receipt of live vaccine within 28 days prior to registration

          -  anti-cancer therapy within 21 days prior to registration. Prior radiation within 14
             days prior to registration

          -  any other illness that in the opinion of the investigator, would exclude the patient
             from participating
