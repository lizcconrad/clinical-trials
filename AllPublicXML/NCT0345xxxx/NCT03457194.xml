      This study has been designed to investigate if:

        1. BMI affects the immunogenicity of influenza and pertussis vaccines given during
           pregnancy.

        2. If pertussis vaccine co-administered with influenza vaccine impacts on the
           immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine.

        3. If BMI affects transplacental antibody transfer efficiency following maternal
           vaccinations.

      A clinical observation study to determine whether obesity during pregnancy is associated with
      altered immunogenicity of influenza and pertussis vaccines during pregnancy. The study will
      also assess vaccine specific antibody concentrations in cord blood collected from vaccinated
      women at the time of delivery to estimate any effect of obesity on transplacental transfer of
      antibodies and will measure and compare cytokine profiles between obese and non-obese
      participants to determine any correlation with immune responses. This study will enrol 150
      pregnant women (50 obese and 100 non-obese) during 2017-2019 to receive a recommended,
      licensed influenza vaccine (FluQuadri) as well as pertussis vaccination (Adacel) for women
      enrolled in their third trimester, as part of routine antenatal care. Local and systemic
      adverse events will be captured using a 7 day diary card and unexpected or serious adverse
      events will be recorded for the duration of the study. Blood samples will be collected to
      measure antigen specific vaccine antibody responses. The proportion of influenza vaccine
      recipients achieving seroprotective antibody titres at 4 weeks post vaccination and
      persisting at 6 months post vaccination be compared between obese and non-obese recipients.

    <description>150 participants (pregnant women at least 18 years of age and meeting eligibility criteria) will be enrolled and administered the FluQuadri, the quadrivalent influenza vaccine which will be administered by single-dose intramuscular injection.
Single-dose intramuscular injection of Adacel - DTP vaccine (multiple actives) will also be administered to all enrolled pregnant women who are at gestation 28 weeks or greater at the time of enrolment.
Where the vaccines are to be co-administered, FluQuadri will be administered into the dominant arm and Adacel into the non-dominant arm.
Pregnant women will be at a gestation of 20 weeks or greater at the time of enrolment. The vaccines administered are currently licensed and recommended in Australia to be given during pregnancy.</description>
