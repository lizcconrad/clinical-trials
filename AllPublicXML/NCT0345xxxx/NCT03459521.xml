  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cirrhotic patients have an increased risk of infections. In these patients is
      important to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, as it may cause a deterioration of
      liver function. However, HBV vaccine efficacy in this group of patients is lower than in
      healthy population. Despite increasing standard doses to double doses or administering an
      accelerated pattern, the response to HBV vaccination remains suboptimal. For this reason, an
      alternative strategy may be using vaccines with novel adjuvants such as Fendrix®.

      Aim: To assess the adjuvanted HBV vaccine (Fendrix ®) efficacy in patients with chronic liver
      disease and to understand the kinetics of anti-HBs titers over time in patients who respond
      to vaccination.

      Methods: Prospective and multicenter study. Serological markers of HBV will be assessed
      prospectively in consecutive patients with non-cirrhotic liver disease (permanent abnormal
      liver blood tests &gt; six months; elastogram ≥8 kilopascal (kPa); serum markers of fibrosis
      (APRI or FIB-4 ≥ F2); ultrasound changes suggesting chronic liver disease) and cirrhotic
      patients (diagnosed by liver biopsy and/or non-invasive methods: clinical, blood tests and
      ultrasound). Seronegative patients will receive four doses of Fendrix ® at 0,1, 2 and 6
      months. Antibodies against HBV superficial antigen (anti-HBs) will be determined at 2 months
      +/- 10 days, six months and one year after having received the fourth dose of the vaccine (to
      see kinetics). The study will differentiate between responders and non-responders to the
      vaccine: adequate immunity to HBV will be defined as anti-HBs higher than &gt; 10mUI/mL
      (standard definition of seroconversion) and&gt; 100mUI/mL. Investigators will evaluate the
      factors that influence the response, kinetics and safety of the vaccination in patients with
      chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.

      Intervention: Serological markers of HBV will be assessed prospectively in consecutive
      non-cirrhotic liver disease or cirrhotic patients. Seronegative patients willing to
      participate will sign a written informed consent and will receive four doses of 20 µg Fendrix
      ® at 0,1, 2 and 6 months. Antibodies against HBV superficial antigen (anti-HBs) will be
      determined at 2 months +/- 10 days, six months and one year after having received the fourth
      dose of the vaccine (to see kinetics). An enzymatic immunoassay (AUSAB; Laboratorios Abbott,
      Abbott Park, IL, USA) will be used. The study will differentiate between responders and
      non-responders to the vaccine: adequate immunity to HBV will be defined as anti-HBs higher
      than &gt; 10mUI/mL (standard definition of seroconversion) and&gt; 100mUI/mL.. Adverse events will
      be assessed throughout the treatment period.

      Vaccination technique: Patients will receive the adjuvanted monovalent and commercial
      adsorbent Fendrix suspension for injection GlaxoSmithKline vaccine in the following protocol:
      Standard protocol: Intra- muscular Dose: 0.5 ml (20 µg of Hepatitis B Surface Antigen + 50 µg
      of - 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A) at baseline and 1, 2 and 6 months.
