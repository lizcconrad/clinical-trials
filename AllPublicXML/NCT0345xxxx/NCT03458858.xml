  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine which components of berries improve
      glucose metabolism and increase fat oxidation in humans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to improve understanding of how diet can regulate glucose metabolism
      and fuel use. Previous human and animal studies have demonstrated that berries can improve
      gluco-regulation and increase fat oxidation. The aim of this study is to determine which
      component of berries is conveying this health benefit.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Mixed Berry Diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive between 400 to 800 grams of mixed berries daily, as a proportion of their daily caloric intake added to their base diet. The base diet will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive between 400 to 800 grams of strawberry jello daily, as a proportion of their daily caloric intake added to their base diet. The jello will be matched to the mixed berries in both total carbohydrate level and gram quantity. The base diet will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Fiber Enriched Jello</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive between 400 to 800 grams of fiber enriched strawberry jello daily, as a proportion of their daily caloric intake added to their base diet. The jello will be matched to the mixed berries in both total carbohydrate level and fiber content, and in the same gram quantity. The base diet will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Fiber Mixed Berry Juice</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will receive 1 liter per day of low fiber mixed berry juice added to their base diet. The juice will be squeezed from the mixed berries, then filtered. The sugar level of the juice will match that of the mixed berries. The base diet will be prepared using traditional American foods with a macronutrient composition representative of a typical American diet.</description>
