      -  Clinical Phase: phase II single arm study

        -  Primary Objectives: Response rate

        -  Number of Subjects: 27 patients

        -  Study Population: recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma

        -  Investigational Product(s), Dose, and Mode of Administration:

      Durvalumab 1500mg plus tremelimumab 75mg via IV infusion Q4W, starting on Week 0, for up to a
      maximum of 4 doses/cycles followed by durvalumab monotherapy 1500mg via IV infusion Q4W,
      starting 4 weeks after the last infusion of the combination until progression.).

      Proton therapy 5 GyE x 5 fractions

      - Study Assessments and Criteria for Evaluation: Safety Assessments: according to NCI CTCAE
      version 4.0 Efficacy Assessments: according to RECIST version 1.1

      - Statistical Methods and Data Analysis: PFS: from the date of treatment to the date of
      progression or death or last follow-up OS: from the date of treatment to the date of death or
      last follow-up

      - Sample Size Determination: Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of
      HNSCC. In this phase II study, up to approximately 27 eligible patients will be enrolled. It
      is anticipated that full accrual to this study will take approximately 24 months.

      H0: Objective response rate ≤10% H1: Objective response rate ≥35% According to Simon's
      two-stage optimal design (power of 90% and one-sided alpha of 0.05), this study needs total
      27 evaluable patients. At the first stage, 11 patients would be enrolled. If two or more
      among them achieve objective response, the study will go forward the second stage. At the
      second stage, 16 additional patients (total 27 patients) would be enrolled. Among the total
      27 evaluable patients, six or more objective responses are necessary for this drug to be
      evaluated further in the group of R/M HNSCC

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of Head and neck cancer (HNC) is approximately 6% of all cases with a world
      annual incidence and nearly 90 to 95% of HNC is squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). [1] For
      patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (R/M HNSCC), cytotoxic-based chemotherapy remains
      the standard therapeutic option. The median survival of these patients treated with
      cytotoxic-based chemotherapy, however, is only 6 to 10 months. For those who are not
      candidates for chemotherapy, the prognosis is even worse with median survival of 3 to 6
      months. [2-4] Thus, new therapeutic options for these patients are needed to improve the
      treatment outcomes.

      We hypothesize that durvalumab plus tremelimumab combined with proton therapy would be
      effective in R/M HNSCC.

      The combination of immunotherapy and RT can be effective regimen because immunologic response
      might be enhanced by RT through the alteration of microenvironment within the irradiated
      field, tumor antigen release and &quot;abscopal effect&quot; at distant metastatic sites. In addition,
      the benefit of proton therapy is to deliver RT dose just to target lesion. The irradiated
      volume can be significantly reduced with proton therapy compared to X-ray treatment, thus
      proton therapy will provide better quality of life compared to X-ray during palliative RT.

      Patients in the durvalumab (MEDI4736) + tremelimumab combination therapy treatment group will
      receive durvalumab (MEDI4736) (1500mg Q4W) in combination with tremelimumab (75 mg IV Q4W)
      for up to 4 doses/cycles each, followed by durvalumab (MEDI4736) 1500mg Q4W until confirmed
      disease progression unless there is unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or another
      discontinuation criterion is met. The first durvalumab (MEDI4736) monotherapy dose at 1500mg
      Q4W will be 4 weeks after the final dose of durvalumab (MEDI4736) in combination with
      tremelimumab.

      Tremelimumab will be administered first; the durvalumab (MEDI4736) infusion will start
      approximately 1 hour (maximum 2 hours) after the end of the tremelimumab infusion. If there
      are no clinically significant concerns after the first cycle, then, at the discretion of the
      Investigator, all other cycles of durvalumab (MEDI4736) can be given immediately after the
      tremelimumab infusion has finished.

             time has not occurred due to the schedule or PK properties of an agent, a longer
             wash-out period will be required, as agreed by AstraZeneca and the investigator

          3. Any unresolved toxicity NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 from previous anticancer therapy with the
             exception of alopecia, vitiligo, and the laboratory values defined in the inclusion

             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirement, substantially increase
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written
             informed consent

         10. History of another primary malignancy except for Malignancy treated with curative
             intent and with no known active disease ≥5 years before the first dose of IP and of
