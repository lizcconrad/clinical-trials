  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach seeks to address the neurobiological mechanisms
      of sensory symptoms in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) by investigating
      dimensional components of behavior that more closely align with brain circuitry. This project
      focuses on the dimensional symptom of sensory phenomena (SP), which are uncomfortable or
      aversive sensory experiences that drive repetitive behaviors in OCD, including &quot;not just
      right&quot; sensations, physical urges, and sensations of disgust. SP are very prevalent,
      occurring in 60-80% of OCD patients, and experienced as highly distressing. Unfortunately, SP
      are not well addressed by standard treatment approaches, which may be in part because their
      neurobiological mechanisms are not well understood.

      This project builds on our preliminary data to (1) investigate the neural mechanisms of SP in
      large OCD cohort showing the full range of SP severity and (2) probe for familial risk
      markers in unaffected siblings of patients. For Aim 1, SP will be measured in 100 OCD
      patients using the Sensory Phenomena Scale. Diffusion and fMRI data will be acquired during
      rest and fMRI tasks. In order to identify familial risk markers, Aim 2 will compare sensory
      phenomena and neural circuitry between OCD probands, 50 unaffected biological siblings of OCD
      patients, and 50 unrelated healthy controls without a family history of Axis 1 disorders.

      This project investigates the neurobiological mechanisms of sensory symptoms in patients with
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their siblings using task-based fMRI, resting-state
      functional connectivity, and diffusion MRI approaches. OCD is a chronic disorder presenting a
      high public health burden. Treatment presents a particular challenge because OCD is extremely
      heterogeneous, with clusters of symptoms likely derived from differing neural etiologies.
