  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Vortioxetine 20 mg/day will lead to changes in
      neural activity (BOLD signal), as measured using fMRI, in brain areas associated with
      executive functioning and memory during cognitive task performances compared to placebo in
      subjects remitted from depression and in controls, and to explore if Vortioxetine will lead
      to improved cognitive performance in the absence of depression.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        All subjects must have:

          -  a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score â‰¤ 7

        Subjects remitted from depression must:

          -  be in remission from recurrent depression having suffered from at least two previous
             Major Depressive Episodes (MDEs)

          -  have received prescribed treatment with an antidepressant or a recognised
             psychotherapy for depression for a previous MDE

          -  report present subjective cognitive dysfunction

          -  not have been treated with antidepressants or received other psychotherapy for
             depression for at least six weeks prior to screening visit

        Control group subjects must:

          -  have no history of MDEs

          -  have no history of MDEs in a biological parent or other first degree relative as
             reported by the subject

          -  not report present subjective cognitive dysfunction

          -  never have been treated with antidepressants or psychotherapy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, unlikely to comply with the
             clinical study protocol or is unsuitable for any other reason

        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
