  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MELAS patients suffer from exercise intolerance, weakness, poor vision or blindness, poor
      growth, developmental delay, and deafness. They also have unique 'stroke-like' episodes
      (SLEs) which are not due to blockages of large or medium arteries. These 'strokes' are
      thought to be due to energy failure of very small brain blood vessels combined with energy
      failure in the mitochondria (cell battery) of the brain cells, especially in the back region
      of the brain in the vision centre. This leads to visual loss and paralysis. The overall goal
      of this study is to better understand the mechanism of these SLEs at the level of the brain
      cells and small blood vessels.

      We will study a family of 3 siblings, each with different severities of MELAS, using safe,
      non-invasive tests. We will determine whether there is a decrease in the ability of small
      brain blood vessels to increase blood flow by dilating in response to certain stimuli such as
      increased blood carbon dioxide levels or in response to brain cell activation in the vision
      centre by visual stimuli. We will use a technique called BOLD-fMRI which can detect changes
      in brain blood flow. As exercising muscle also depends on increased blood flow and
      mitochondrial energy, we will study different measures of aerobic energy metabolism in
      exercising muscle using cycle exercise testing and special phosphorus-magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy which measures the changes in the major chemicals of muscle energy metabolism.
      The dietary amino acid L-arginine is known to dilate blood vessels increasing blood flow and
      to decrease toxic free radicals that are generated by dysfunctional mitochondria. We will
      determine the effect of a single dose and a 6 week trial of oral L-arginine, on brain blood
      vessel reactivity, brain cell activation and muscle aerobic function to see how useful this
      would be in the treatment of these patients and other mitochondrial disorders which present
      with strokes.
