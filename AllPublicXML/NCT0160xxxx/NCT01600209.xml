    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is male or female, 50-84 years of age, inclusive.

          -  Subject is at average risk for development of CRC and has undergone a screening
             colonoscopy with a normal result at least 30 days and no more than 120 days before
             providing a stool sample for the study. For the purposes of this study, a &quot;normal&quot;
             colonoscopy result is defined as no polyps of any size detected or removed (including
             benign, hyperplastic polyps).

          -  Subject is able to understand the study procedures, and is able to provide signed
             consent to participate in the study and authorizes release of relevant protected
             health information through signing a HIPAA consent.

          -  Subject is able and willing to provide stool samples at least 30 days and no more than
             120 days after undergoing a colonoscopy that resulted in normal findings, according to
             the written instructions provided to them.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator should preclude
             participation in the study.

          -  Subject had any findings on recent or any previous colonoscopy including benign,
             and/or hyperplastic polyps of any size. (Note: Tissue biopsies that result in no
             histopathology findings are acceptable.)

          -  Subject has a history or recent diagnosis of CRC or adenoma.

          -  Subject has a history of aerodigestive tract cancer.

          -  Subject has had a positive fecal occult blood test or FIT within the previous six (6)
             months.

          -  Subject has had a prior colorectal resection for any reason other than sigmoid
             diverticular disease.

          -  Subject has had overt rectal bleeding, e.g., hematochezia or melena, within the
             previous 30 days. (Blood on toilet paper, after wiping, does not constitute rectal
             bleeding)

          -  Subject has a diagnosis or personal history of any of the following high-risk
             conditions for colorectal cancer:

               -  Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including chronic ulcerative colitis (CUC) and
                  Crohn's disease.

               -  Greater than or equal to (&gt;=)2 first-degree relatives who have been diagnosed
                  with colon cancer. (Note: first-degree relatives include parents, siblings and
                  offspring).

               -  One first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before the age of 60.

               -  Familial adenomatous polyposis (also referred to as &quot;FAP&quot;, including attenuated
                  FAP).

               -  Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome (also referred to as &quot;HNPCC&quot;
                  of &quot;Lynch Syndrome&quot;).

               -  Other hereditary cancer syndromes including but are not limited to Peutz-Jeghers
                  Syndrome, MYH-Associated Polyposis (MAP), Gardner's Syndrome, Turcot's (or
                  Crail's) Syndrome, Cowden's Syndrome, Juvenile Polyposis, Cronkhite-Canada
                  Syndrome, Neurofibromatosis and Familial Hyperplastic Polyposis.
