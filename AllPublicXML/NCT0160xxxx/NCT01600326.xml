      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of various treatment soft
      tendinosis also known as tendinitis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently there are three treatments that are considered standard of care; rest, tenotomy and
      tenotomy with injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Tenotomy is performed by passing a
      needle through the abnormal tendon repeatedly until the needle has passed through all areas
      of the abnormal tendon with softening of the tendon. Tenotomy with PRP injections is
      performed in the same manner but includes an injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) into the
      tendon. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of tenotomy versus PRP treatment.

    <time_frame>Up to 23 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patient symptoms are measured on a 50 point scale where 0 is no pain or interference with activities and 50 is highest pain and interference.
A verbal evaluation and assessment of subject's pain and symptoms will be completed prior to treatment. After receiving medication a second evaluation will be taken to determine how well the medication has relieved and controlled the subject's pain and inflammation associated with tendinitis.
Subjects will be specifically asked to rate the level of pain and how the pain is affecting common activities of daily living. The outcomes will be assessed at 2 follow up periods, 1 and approximately 2 weeks after treatment (but no more than 23 days).</description>

          <title>Pain Level and Interference With Activity</title>
          <description>Patient symptoms are measured on a 50 point scale where 0 is no pain or interference with activities and 50 is highest pain and interference.
A verbal evaluation and assessment of subject's pain and symptoms will be completed prior to treatment. After receiving medication a second evaluation will be taken to determine how well the medication has relieved and controlled the subject's pain and inflammation associated with tendinitis.
Subjects will be specifically asked to rate the level of pain and how the pain is affecting common activities of daily living. The outcomes will be assessed at 2 follow up periods, 1 and approximately 2 weeks after treatment (but no more than 23 days).</description>

Ultrasound guided platelet rich plasma injection: Subjects will fill out a pre-treatment pain survey, then will undergo ultrasound and have blood drawn from their arm.
The blood sample will be separated into blood cells and plasma. The plasma portion of the blood (liquid minus the cells) will be injected into the tendon under sterile conditions. Ultrasound will help guide the injection. This is called &quot;Ultrasound guided platelet rich plasma injection.&quot;
Subjects will be be contacted by the investigator by telephone or email on day 7 and day 14 to complete another pain survey. Subjects must avoid non steroidal anti inflammatory medications for 2 weeks before the study and 2 weeks after the study.
