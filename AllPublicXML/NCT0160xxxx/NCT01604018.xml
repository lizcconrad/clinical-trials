  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cat allergy is an increasingly prevalent condition affecting 10-15% of patients with allergic
      rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma.

      The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate
      rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to cat dander in the EEC among subjects who
      completed all dosing visits in study CP005 and all visits in study CP005A approximately two
      years after the start of treatment.

      Subjects who completed all visits in studies CP005 and CP005A will be invited to attend the
      Screening Visit for CP005B. Subjects will attend for 4 visits to the EEC on successive days.
      Following the last EEC visit is a follow-up visit which will be performed 3-10 days later.
