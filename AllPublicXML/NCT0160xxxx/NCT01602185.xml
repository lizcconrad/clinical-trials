  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if memantine or dextromethorphan gave in relay to
      ketamine maintains or induces a decrease of pain intensity.

      In clinical, after ketamine cure, clinicians have often difficulties to treat patients in
      order to maintain analgesia or suggest another treatment if analgesia induced by ketamine was
      not effective, which occurs in one quarter of patients. It will be very useful for monitoring
      of painful patients evaluate if memantine or dextromethorphan could be an effective
      therapeutic alternative in neuropathic pain treatment.
