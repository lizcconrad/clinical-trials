  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study involves a single injection of LY2963016 and a single injection of Lantus, on 2
      separate occasions in participants with type I diabetes. Following each dose, participants
      will undergo a glucose clamp which lasts for 42 hours each time. There will be at least 7
      days between the two periods, during which time there will be no study treatment, but
      participants will resume their regular therapy. The duration of this study can be up to 9.5
      weeks. The purposes of this study are to understand how the blood sugar lowering effect of
      LY2963016 compares to that of Lantus, and to determine how LY2963016 and Lantus are
      metabolized by participants with type I diabetes.

    <measure>Pharmacodynamics: Duration of Action of LY2963016 and Lantus</measure>
    <time_frame>Periods 1 and 2: Baseline up to 42 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of action is defined as the period of time elapsed between dose administration and the time at which the participant's blood glucose is consistently &gt;150 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) without any glucose infusion. Participants whose blood glucose did not rise to 150 mg/dL were censored 42 hours postdose.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maximum Glucose Infusion Rate (Rmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Periods 1 and 2: Baseline up to 42 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Rmax is the maximum infusion rate of glucose administered intravenously needed to maintain a target blood glucose level of 100 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) [5.6 millimoles/Liter (mmol/L)] and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of study drug by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate. Data presented are the maximum infusion rates, adjusted by body weight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Total Glucose Infused (Gtot)</measure>
    <time_frame>Periods 1 and 2: Baseline up to 42 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Gtot is the total glucose infusion over the clamp duration and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of study drug by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate. Data presented are the total glucose infused, adjusted by body weight.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time of Maximum Glucose Infusion Rate (tRmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>Periods 1 and 2: Baseline up to 42 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>tRmax is the time to reach maximum glucose infusion rate and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of study drug by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Maximum Concentration (Cmax) of LY2963016 and Lantus</measure>
    <time_frame>Periods 1 and 2: Baseline up to 42 hours postdose</time_frame>
    <description>Cmax was not analyzed because of insufficient data due to concentrations being below the quantifiable lower limit of the assay.</description>

    <measure>Pharmacokinetics: Area Under the Concentration-time Curve (AUC) of LY2963016 and Lantus</measure>

        <title>Pharmacodynamics: Duration of Action of LY2963016 and Lantus</title>
        <description>Duration of action is defined as the period of time elapsed between dose administration and the time at which the participant’s blood glucose is consistently &gt;150 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) without any glucose infusion. Participants whose blood glucose did not rise to 150 mg/dL were censored 42 hours postdose.</description>

The numbers of participants censored were 7 for both LY2963016 and Lantus groups. Maximum duration of actions is based on participants who reached the end of action before 42 hours: 13 participants for both groups.</population>

        <title>Maximum Glucose Infusion Rate (Rmax)</title>
        <description>Rmax is the maximum infusion rate of glucose administered intravenously needed to maintain a target blood glucose level of 100 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) [5.6 millimoles/Liter (mmol/L)] and is used to measure the study drug action over time as measured by the euglycaemic clamp procedure. During the euglycaemic clamp procedure, blood glucose concentrations are held constant after the administration of study drug by adjusting the exogenous glucose infusion rate. Data presented are the maximum infusion rates, adjusted by body weight.</description>
