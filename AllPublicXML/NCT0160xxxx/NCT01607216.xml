    <textblock>
      This is an observational study that proposes to collect clinical, physiological, cellular and
      molecular information in an attempt to identify a set of factors that may predict the risk
      for persistent lung disease in babies born prematurely.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 550,000 babies born prematurely each year in the United States suffer from
      birth at a time in development when the respiratory tract and immune system would normally be
      protected and maintained in a na√Øve state. This project is a component of the NIH Prematurity
      and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) whose goals are the identification of disease
      mechanisms and biomarkers to stratify premature infants, at the time of discharge, for their
      risk of subsequent pulmonary morbidity. This Clinical Research Center (CRC) project will
      investigate prematurity-dependent alterations in cellular innate and adaptive immune systems
      resulting in increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and environmental irritants,
      and leading to respiratory morbidity in the first year of life. Prior studies have
      established developmental (maturity) and disease-related changes in circulating and pulmonary
      lymphocyte populations but a comprehensive assessment of their relationship to disease
      risk/outcome has not been undertaken. We hypothesize that cellular and molecular
      immuno-maturity is altered due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors presented by premature
      birth in such a way as to reduce resistance to viral infections and to promote cytotoxic
      damage to the lung. We will evaluate immunologic maturity by comprehensively phenotyping
      lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood sampled at premature delivery, at the time of
      discharge from the hospital and at twelve months corrected age. The lymphocytic phenotype
      will be analyzed particularly in the context of gestational age and maternal-fetal stressors
      capable of modulating oxidative stress (oxygen exposure, infection and environmental tobacco
      smoke exposure). Additionally, we will assess changes in the molecular phenotype of isolated
      CD8 lymphocytes, a cell type preferentially recruited to the lungs of premature infants and
      capable of contributing to disease pathogenesis, by genome-wide expression profiling, in
      order to uncover novel disease pathways and define a gene expression signature associated
      with disease risk. Finally, we propose to build a statistical model, using cellular and
      molecular phenotypes and additional clinical variables, for stratifying risk of lung
      morbidity within the first year of life.

    <measure>Symptomatic Respiratory Disease (SRD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessed every three months until 1 year corrected gestational age</time_frame>
    <description>The primary goal of the PROP studies (single center and multicenter protocols) is to identify biomarkers (biochemical, physiological and genetic) and clinical variables that are associated with and thus potentially predictive of pulmonary status in preterm infants up to 1 year corrected age. We propose a composite primary outcome of SRD that is based on serial parental reports of respiratory symptoms, medications, hospitalizations and dependence on technology during the first year of life.</description>

    <description>Severity of lung disease will be assessed by length of time on mechanical ventilation, length of time on oxygen, oxygen requirement at 36 weeks corrected gestational age, need for pulmonary medications at determined at hospital discharge, or at 40 +/- 5 weeks corrected gestational age.</description>

    <measure>Statistical correlation of CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte function with severity and persistence of lung disease.</measure>
    <time_frame>At at 40 +/- 5 weeks corrected gestational age and at one year of age</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of lung disease prior to first hospital discharge and the persistence and severity of SRD in the first year of life will be compared with the T cell lymphocyte phenotypes at birth, at hospital discharge and at one year of life. Specifically, at minimum, the ability of T lymphocytes at rest and after stimulation to produce interferon gamma at the test time points will be compared with the history of lung disease. The intent is to identify biomarkers and to suggest immune-mediated mechanisms for lung disease in preterm infants</description>
