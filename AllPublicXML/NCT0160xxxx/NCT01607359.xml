  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both warfarin and dabigatran have been used for stroke prophylaxis at the time of catheter
      ablation of atrial fibrillation. Although the risks of thromboembolism and bleeding with
      warfarin are well established, the relative risk and benefit of dabigatran in this setting
      are unknown. The purposes of the study are to assess the efficacy of warfarin versus
      dabigatran in the prevention of stroke and other systemic embolic complications before and
      after catheter ablation for AF, and to compare the prevalence of serious bleeding
      complications with the two OAC agents.

      -  Data from patients collected from 4 US and 1 Canadian medical center

        -  Retrospective record review of all patients that had undergone catheter ablation of
           atrial fibrillation during the time period beginning with the initiation of dabigatran
           therapy for stroke prophylaxis at each center and ending in November 2011.

        -  Dabigatran study group comprised of all patients that received dabigatran for stroke
           prophylaxis during the study time period.

        -  Warfarin comparison group to be selected from all patients that received warfarin for
           stroke prophylaxis during the identical study time period.

        -  Warfarin patients will be numbered sequentially

        -  A subgroup of warfarin patients identical in number to the dabigatran patients at each
           center will be selected using random number generator.

      Patient data sets will be de-identified and compiled

        -  Master data set to be stored in Excel file

        -  Statistics to be performed with SAS (Cary, NC)

        -  Continuous data to be expressed as means Â± S.D., compared with unpaired t-tests

        -  Categorical data will be compared with Fisher's exact test or Chi-square

        -  Complications including any thromboembolic events or any bleeding events will be
           recorded and the prevalence compared.
