  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design includes an open-label, dose escalation phase followed by a blinded,
      randomized phase, which combines INCB024360 (an oral IDO1 inhibitor) with an approved therapy
      and compares to approved therapy plus placebo in metastatic melanoma patients.

  <why_stopped>
    Further development of this compound with ipilimumab in the treatment of melanoma is no longer
    being pursued.
