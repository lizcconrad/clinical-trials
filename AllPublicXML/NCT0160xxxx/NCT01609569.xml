  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine on preliminary basis weather an elevated pro-calcitonin
      level can be used to assess ischemia as a result of coronary artery complications during
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pro-calcitonin is a type of protein found in the blood. This protein has recently be found to
      be elevated in patients with diseases of the arteries of the heart such as heart attack.

      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is widely used in the treatment of many patients
      with blockage in the arteries of the heart.

      the investigators normally used a marker called troponin after cardiac catheterization.
      However, this marker may not be specific.

      Pro-calcitonin has been found to be a useful marker for the detection of myocardial injury.
      the value of Pro-calcitonin as a marker for the identification of myocardial damage
      undergoing PCI has not yet been studied.
