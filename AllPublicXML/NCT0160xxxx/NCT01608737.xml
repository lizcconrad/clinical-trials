      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different treatment regimens with BI 201335
           (high dose given for 12 weeks or low dose given for 24 weeks both in combination with
           Pegylated interferon-a and Ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV) as compared to PegIFN/RBV alone in
           treatment-naïve (TN) chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infected patients.

        2. Evaluate the efficacy and the safety of BI 201335 high dose given for 12 weeks in
           combination with PegIFN/RBV given for 24 to 48 weeks as compared to PegIFN/RBV alone in
           chronic GT-1 hepatitis C virus infected relapser patients who failed a prior PegIFN/RBV
           treatment.

             infection, may be screened

         10. Received silymarin (milk thistle), glycyrrhizin, or Sho-saiko-to (SST) within 28 days

             immunomodulatory drug other than interferon alfa or ribavirin for acute or chronic HCV
             infection including and not restricted to protease or polymerase inhibitors

         12. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredient of the study drugs

         13. Alpha fetoprotein value &gt;100 ng/mL at screening; if &gt;20 ng/mL and =100 ng/mL, patients
             may be included if there is no evidence of liver cancer in an appropriate imaging
             study (e.g., ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI)) within last 6 months prior to randomisation (Visit 2) Other exclusion criteria
             related to pegylated interferon-a and/or ribavirin restrictions are not listed here.
