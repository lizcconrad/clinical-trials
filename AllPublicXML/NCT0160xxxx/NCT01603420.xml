      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects on prostate cancer using radiation
      therapy with or without chemotherapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The recommended treatment for a high risk prostate cancer consists of a combination of
      radiation therapy and androgen suppression for 2-3 years. Recent studies have shown a
      survival advantage for chemotherapy for prostate cancer. Chemotherapy has already been
      successfully integrated in the treatment of other cancer types and is our belief that
      chemotherapy will prove to be beneficial for patients with high risk prostate cancer.
      However, a clinical study is necessary to compare the results good or bad of chemotherapy
      with radiation therapy.

    <measure>Phase 2 - Assessment of Number of Freedom From Failure Events in the Chemotherapy Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>No failures were reported at the time of study termination (22 months). This outcome was originally written to assess failure at 2 years. However, that end point was not reached.</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of Freedom from Failure i.e. the first occurence of clinical failure (local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis), biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition (Prostate Specific Antigen [PSA] &gt; = 2 ng/ml over the nadir PSA discounting bounces per the investigators discretion), or the start of salvage therapy including androgen deprivation.
This study was terminated prior to the time frame of 2 years being reached. Therefore, this outcome was assessed at time of study closure (22 months).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2 - Assessment of Number of Freedom From Failure Event Comparing Chemotherapy Arm to Standard Treatment Arm</measure>

    <description>This endpoint will be examined if decision is made to not move forward with phase 3 study.
This study was terminated prior to a decision being made about moving on to a phase 3 study. Therefore, this outcome was not assessed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 2 - Cumulative Number of Incidences of Grade 3 or Higher Adverse Events.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Assessment will be performed using CTCAE v4 criteria.
This study was terminated prior to the time frame of 2 years being reached. Therefore, this outcome was assessed at time of study closure (22 months).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Phase 3 - Assessment of the Number of Freedom From Failure (FFF) Events Comparing the Chemotherapy Arm to the Standard Treatment Arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>at 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The events for FFF will be the first occurence of clinical failure (local recurrence, regional recurrence, or distant metastasis), biochemical failure by the Phoenix definition (PSA &gt; = ng/ml over the nadir PSA discounting bounces per the investigators discretion), or the start of salvage androgen deprivation.
This study was terminated prior to a decision being made about moving on to a phase 3 study. Therefore, this outcome was not assessed.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Number of GI and GU Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Descriptive measurements of frequency will be compiled.
This study was terminated prior to the time frame of 3 years being reached. Therefore, this outcome was not assessed. Data were collected on toxicities up until study closure at 22 months. However, this timepoint was not indicated as a secondary objective in the protocol. Therefore, data was not analyzed at time of study closure.</description>
