  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation
      care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term
      infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part V is comparing
      standard WHO thermoregulation practices plus use of a plastic torso wrap to no plastic torso
      wrap in full term infants from resuscitation to one hour after birth.

    <textblock>
      Due to delivery rooms without adequate climate controls, even full term infants have high
      rates of hypothermia in the developing world. This study will compare the rates of
      hypothermia one hour after birth in full term infants randomized to receive standard WHO
      thermoregulation care (control group) or standard WHO thermoregulation care without immediate
      drying plus a plastic bag covering their torsos and lower extremities (intervention group).
      The axillary temperature of each infant will be taken within 15 minutes of birth at at one
      hour after birth with removal of the plastic bag. Hyperthermia, room temperature, and death
      will be recorded throughout the hospitalization for all infants. With an estimated baseline
      hypothermia rate of 15% and a hypothesized 10% absolute risk reduction (66% relative risk
      reduction), a sample size of 276 will be used to have a power of 80% and a confidence
      interval of 95%.

    <description>Infant will be placed within 10 minutes of his birth into a plastic bag to his/her axillae and the bag will be folded and taped to itself to prevent it from covering the infant's nose or mouth. After his/her head is dried, the infant will receive a cloth cap. Resuscitation will occur in the delivery room and the infant will be wrapped in a blanket and taken to the nursery where he/she will remain in the plastic bag until 1 hour after birth.</description>
