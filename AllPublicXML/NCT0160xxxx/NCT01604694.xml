  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominoplasty is a major cosmetic surgery with a painful post operative period. Recently
      more and more anaesthetists are turning to regional analgesia for anterior abdominal wall
      surgery namely the Transversus Abdominis Plane (TAP) Block with or without ultrasound
      guidance.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the analgesic effect of TAP block ultrasound guided in
      post operative period of abdominoplasty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine if TAP block have an analgesic effect in post operative period of abdominoplasty
      this study was made versus placebo: one group of patients will have a TAP block of
      levobupivacaine, the second group will have a TAP block with placebo before the surgery.
      Patient follow up includes data collected before surgery (at pré anesthesic visit and just
      before surgery) and data collected immediately after surgery (at post operative time) and at
      distance of the surgery (15 days and 3 months after the surgery). The principal aim is to
      show if TAP block have an analgesic effect in post operative period after abdominoplasty. To
      answer this question we will compare opioid intake during the two days after the surgery
      between the two groups.
