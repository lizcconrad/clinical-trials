      We hypothesise that feedback and feedback + psychology informed intervention delivered to
      primary care medical practices will reduce high-risk prescribing to patients compared to a
      simple educational intervention alone. The specific objectives are :

        1. To test the effectiveness of the two EFIPPS feedback arms in reducing the specified
           primary outcome of a composite measure of high-risk antipsychotic, non-steroidal
           anti-inflammatory drug, and antiplatelet drug prescribing

        2. To test the effectiveness of the two EFIPPS feedback arms in reducing the specified
           secondary outcomes of the six individual measures constituting the composite

        3. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention

    <textblock>
      High risk prescribing is the use of drugs which carry significant risk to patients. Such
      prescribing is not always inappropriate but does require regular review to ensure that the
      balance of risk and benefit in individuals is appropriate. High risk prescribing is common
      and varies widely between practices, and there is evidence that intensive interventions (for
      example, pharmacist led medication review) can reduce rates of high risk prescribing. The aim
      of this study is to test whether a simpler and therefore cheaper feedback intervention can
      reduce high risk prescribing. The study is a three arm cluster randomised trial with primary
      care medical practices as the unit of randomisation and outcomes measured at patient level
      using routinely held prescribing for individual patients. The trial will compare two forms of
      feedback of practice rates of high risk prescribing with usual care. Usual care matches
      existing NHS working practice. The first active arm will receive quarterly feedback. The
      second active arm will receive the same feedback plus a health psychology informed
      intervention designed to promote response to feedback embedded in the feedback.

    <description>The primary outcome is a composite of six high-risk prescribing measures relating to antipsychotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet drug use. It is defined as the proportion of patients particularly at risk of an adverse event from the specified prescribing, who receives one or more high risk prescriptions. A composite is reasonable because each of the underlying indicators is based on evidence of harm and has been judged valid in one or more formal consensus studies, so the composite is a coherent measure of 'high-risk prescribing'.</description>
