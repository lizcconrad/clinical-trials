    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, concurrently controlled, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the Spinal Kinetics M6-C artificial cervical disc compared to anterior
      cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of symptomatic cervical radiculopathy
      with or without cord compression. Some participating sites will enroll just M6-C patients,
      while others will enroll just ACDF patients.

      Patients eligible for study enrollment will present with degenerative cervical radiculopathy
      requiring surgical intervention, confirmed clinically and radiographically, at one vertebral
      level from C3 to C7.

      A total of 243 subjects will be included at up to 20 sites.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        All study subjects must present with degenerative cervical radiculopathy with or without
        spinal cord compression, confirmed clinically and radiologically, requiring surgical
        intervention at a single vertebral level from C3 to C7.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of degenerative cervical radiculopathy with or without spinal cord
             compression requiring surgical treatment at one level from C3 to C7 demonstrated by
             signs and/or symptoms of disc herniation and/or osteophyte formation (e.g. neck and/or
             arm pain, radiculopathy, etc.) and is confirmed by patient history and radiographic
             studies (e.g. MRI, CT, x-rays, etc.)

          2. Inadequate response to conservative medical care over a period of at least 6 weeks

          3. Neck Disability Index score of ≥ 30% (raw score of ≥ 15/50)

          4. Neck or arm pain VAS ≥ 4 on a scale of 0 to 10

          5. Willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol including follow-up
             requirements

          6. Willing and able to sign a study specific informed consent

          7. Skeletally mature and ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 75 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. More than one cervical level requiring surgery

          2. Previous anterior cervical spine surgery

          3. Axial neck pain as the solitary symptom

          4. Previous posterior cervical spine surgery (e.g., posterior element decompression) that
             destabilizes the cervical spine

          5. Advanced cervical anatomical deformity (e.g., ankylosing spondylitis, scoliosis) at
             the operative or adjacent levels

          7. Less than 4º of motion in flexion/extension at the index level

          8. Instability as evidenced by subluxation &gt; 3 mm at the index or adjacent levels as
             indicated on flexion/extension x-rays

          9. Advanced degenerative changes (e.g., spondylosis) at the index vertebral level as
             evidenced by bridging osteophytes, central disc height &lt; 4mm and/or &lt; 50% of the
             adjacent normal intervertebral disc, or kyphotic deformity &gt; 11º on neutral x-rays

             oxide residuals

         18. Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease or a systemic disorder such as HIV,
             active hepatitis B or C or fibromyalgia

         19. Insulin-dependent type 1 or type 2 diabetes

             disease, alcohol or drug addiction) that would interfere with patient self-assessment
             of function, pain or quality of life.

         24. Involved in current or pending spinal litigation where permanent disability benefits
