  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the provision of nutrients via the intravenous route. Parenteral
      nutrition associated metabolic bone disease (MBD) was first described in children in the
      1980s. Since then, there has been little to no research into the underlying relationship and
      as a result, little evidence on which to base clinical care. In adults, MBD is associated
      with increased fractures. At the Hospital for Sick children in Toronto, an intestinal failure
      program has been set up since 2003. This is the only intestinal failure program in Canada and
      receives country wide referrals. Most of the patients have short bowel syndrome (SBS) and
      require PN for prolonged periods, or for life. About 90% of these patients have MBD, and some
      have had bone fractures. An understanding of the etiology of MBD would provide information to
      guide care, and prevent this condition. Funding for this area of research however is
      challenging because intestinal failure requiring long term PN is a rare condition, accounting
      for approximately 200 - 300 children in all of Canada. The goal of this study therefore is to
      gather pilot data on markers of MBD in children on long term PN, and to compare these markers
      to age and gender matched control patients who are fed by mouth or feeding tube. The
      information gathered from this study will help us begin to understand what is actually
      happening in the bones of children on long term PN and will form the basis for future studies
      and improved clinical care.
