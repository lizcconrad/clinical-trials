  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of specific immunotherapy with Pangramin SLIT HDM-mix
      compared to placebo in the treatment of House Dust Mite (HDM) induced rhinitis with or
      without asthma.

      Sublingual immunotherapy has been used during several years and has been shown to provide
      benefits compare to traditional subcutaneous treatment. This study will investigate if
      improvements in rhinitis symptoms and less use of symptomatic medication can be obtained as a
      consequence of being treated under specific immunotherapy.

      This study aim also to contribute to the documentation of tolerability and safety profile of
      Pangramin HDM Mix.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Extensive clinical experience has been gained due to the widespread use of Pangramin® SLIT
      and other SLIT products as named patient products, both with respect to the types and the
      frequencies of the adverse events(AEs) observed. No safety concerns have been found.

      The optimal therapeutic dose range regarding SLIT is not fully elucidated. The fate of the
      allergen after sublingual administration is not known in detail, i.e. to what extent is the
      allergen absorbed over the mucosa or swallowed and how this is related to volume, excipients
      etc. The relationship between dose and effect is thus not fully elucidated. The general
      recommendation is to use a dose inducing a clinical relevant effect in most patients without
      causing unacceptable adverse events. As Pangramin SLIT HDM-mix has a safety profile that
      allows a single daily intake by the patient at home, the dosage at this trial will be the
      same as marketed product.

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptoms Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: From V1 date(Week -8) to V2 date(Week 0); 11-12months: From V8 date(Week 44) to V9 date(Week 52).</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects completed symptom assessments and recorded the results in the patient diary cards on a daily basis. A total of six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale from 0-3 as follows:
0 = No symptoms.
= Mild symptoms.
= Moderate symptoms. 3= Severe symptoms.
The six symptoms are classified in 2 groups as follows:
Nose symptoms: Runny nose, Blocked nose, Sneezing, Itchy nose; Eye symptoms: Gritty feeling/red/itchy eyes, Watery eyes. The six symptom scores were summed to obtain the rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms score with range 0(best) to 18(worst).
Baseline was set as 8 weeks before randomization as from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). 11-12months' end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms scores (Baseline and 11-12months) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days with diary.</description>

    <measure>The Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Medication Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline: From V1 date(Week -8) to V2 date(Week 0); 11-12months: From V8 date(Week 44) to V9 date(Week 52).</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were provided with open-labelled rescue medication to be used as needed for treatment of their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms. Subjects reported their use of specific rescue medication via the patient diary cards. Scoring principles were applied to transform the number of rescue medication doses used into medication scores.The scores of all the medication used were summed to produce the daily rhinoconjunctivitis medication score range from 0 to 32. A lower medication score means the patient use less medication, and represent a better outcome; on the contrary, a higher medication score means the patient use more medication, and represent a worse outcome.
Baseline was from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). The end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average scores (Baseline and End) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days in diary.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Symptoms Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</title>
        <description>Subjects completed symptom assessments and recorded the results in the patient diary cards on a daily basis. A total of six rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms were measured on a scale from 0-3 as follows:
0 = No symptoms.
= Mild symptoms.
= Moderate symptoms. 3= Severe symptoms.
The six symptoms are classified in 2 groups as follows:
Nose symptoms: Runny nose, Blocked nose, Sneezing, Itchy nose; Eye symptoms: Gritty feeling/red/itchy eyes, Watery eyes. The six symptom scores were summed to obtain the rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms score with range 0(best) to 18(worst).
Baseline was set as 8 weeks before randomization as from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). 11-12months’ end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms scores (Baseline and 11-12months) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days with diary.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Rhinoconjunctivitis Medication Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</title>
        <description>Subjects were provided with open-labelled rescue medication to be used as needed for treatment of their rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms. Subjects reported their use of specific rescue medication via the patient diary cards. Scoring principles were applied to transform the number of rescue medication doses used into medication scores.The scores of all the medication used were summed to produce the daily rhinoconjunctivitis medication score range from 0 to 32. A lower medication score means the patient use less medication, and represent a better outcome; on the contrary, a higher medication score means the patient use more medication, and represent a worse outcome.
Baseline was from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). The end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average scores (Baseline and End) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days in diary.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Asthma Symptom Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</title>
        <description>Subjects were instructed by the investigator on how to complete symptom assessments and recorded the results in the patient diary cards on a daily basis.
A total of 4 Asthma symptoms were measured on a scale from 0-3 as follows:
0 = No symptoms.
= Mild symptoms.
= Moderate symptoms. 3= Severe symptoms. The 4 symptoms as follows: Cough, Wheeze, Chest tightness/shortness of breath (dyspnoea), Exercise induced symptoms. The 4 symptom scores were summed to obtain the asthma symptoms score with range 0(best) to 12(worst).
Baseline was set as 8 weeks before randomization as from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). 11-12months’ end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average scores (Baseline and 11-12months) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days with diary.</description>

        <title>The Change From Baseline in Rhinitis Medication Score at 11 - 12 Months Between the Actively Treated Patients and the Placebo Treated.</title>
        <description>Subjects were provided with open-labelled rescue medication to be used as needed for treatment of their Rhinitis symptoms. Subjects reported their use of specific rescue medication via the patient diary cards. Scoring principles were applied to transform the number of rescue medication doses used into medication scores. The scores of all the medication used were summed to produce the daily Rhinitis medication score range from 0 to 30. A lower medication score means the patient use less medication, and represent a better outcome; on the contrary, a higher medication score means the patient use more medication, and represent a worse outcome.
Baseline was set as from V1 (Week -8) to V2 (Week 0). 11-12months’ end evaluation period was set from V8(Week 44) to V9(Week 52). These two average scores (Baseline and 11-12months) were calculated for each patient as the sum of the daily score throughout the 2 months(8 weeks in count) in evaluation period and divided with the days with diary.</description>
