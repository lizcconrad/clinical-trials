      This post-approval study will follow 60 participants who have ALS, documented chronic
      hypoventilation, and bilateral phrenic nerve function, and who undergo the surgical
      implantation procedure to receive the NeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System device. Participants who
      are successfully implanted with the device will use it for daily diaphragm conditioning
      sessions. Participants will be followed for at least two years (until the last enrolled
      participant reaches the 2-year follow-up visit). Safety and probable benefit outcome measures
      will be assessed.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open-label, interventional, post-approval (FDA) study
      of the NeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS) device. The study will enroll 60 participants who
      have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), meet the FDA-approved device indications for use,
      and undergo the surgical implantation procedure to receive the device. The device is intended
      for use in ALS patients with a stimulatable diaphragm (both right and left portions) as
      demonstrated by voluntary contraction or phrenic nerve conduction studies, and who are
      experiencing chronic hypoventilation (CH), but not progressed to an FVC less than 45%
      predicted. Participants who are successfully implanted with the device will use it for daily
      diaphragm conditioning sessions. Participants will be followed for at least two years (until
      the last enrolled participant reaches the 2-year follow-up visit). Safety and probable
      benefit outcome measures will be assessed. The primary objective of the study is: (1)
      (Safety) Characterize the types and frequency of major device-related adverse events (AEs)
      over the time of device use. Secondary objectives of the study are: (2) (Safety) Determine
      whether the frequency of major device-related AEs increases dramatically toward end of life;
      and (3) (Probable Benefit) Determine whether there is a relationship between survival time
      and onset type (bulbar and limb), time from onset to treatment, and use of NIV, riluzole, or
      PEG in patients treated with the device.

    <intervention_name>NeuRx Diaphragm Pacing System (DPS)</intervention_name>
    <description>The NeuRx DPS is a percutaneous, intramuscular, diaphragm stimulation system which is implanted using standard laparoscopic surgical techniques in an outpatient procedure. The implanted intramuscular diaphragm electrodes are connected to a four channel external stimulator at a percutaneous exit site. DPS is designed to help ALS patients breathe by providing conditioning stimulation of the diaphragm muscles. Recommended frequency of diaphragm conditioning is at least 3 times per day with each session lasting at least 30 minutes. Patients may find it helpful to use the DPS for longer periods to help with breathing. DPS may be used at the same time as non-invasive ventilation. Patents may also sleep with the DPS to assist with breathing difficulties at night.</description>
