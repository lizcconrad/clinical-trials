      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical utility of specific autoantibody
      testing in unmasking an underlying connective tissue disorder in patients who present with
      interstitial lung disease and found to have weak positive ANA (1:400 titre) with no overt
      connective tissue disease manifestations OR borderline/negative ANA with some clinical
      suggestion of connective tissue disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been well established that patients with connective tissue disease associated
      interstitial lung disease respond better to immunosuppressive therapy, and have a better
      outcome compared to patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonias. This makes it
      imperative to identify this group of patients for management and prognostication.
      Unfortunately some of these patients do not demonstrate overt clinical manifestations of
      connective tissue disease and our current available autoantibody screen does not detect all
      potential autoantibodies present. We would like to test for specific autoantibodies in this
      group of patients to evaluate its clinical utility in identifying covert connective tissue
      diseases associated with interstitial lung disease.
