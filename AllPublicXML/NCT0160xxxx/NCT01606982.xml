      THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND HEALTH CANADA HAVE APPROVED MDV3100
      (ENZALUTAMIDE) FOR SALE TO THE PUBLIC, ENROLLMENT IS CLOSED IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND
      CANADA.

      The expanded access treatment protocol is being conducted while marketing approval of
      enzalutamide is being sought. There is no age requirement.

      Subjects will complete visits on Day 1, Week 4, Week 12 and then every subsequent 12 weeks
      until discontinued from the study.

      The study will end if enzalutamide is approved for sale to the public by the country's health
      authority (commercially available) or if the sponsor otherwise decides or is required to end
      the study. If a subject would like to receive enzalutamide after the study ends, he and the
      doctor will decide if he should receive a prescription for enzalutamide, with a goal of
      avoiding any interruption in treatment.
