  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The HIV-2 is less common ie 1-2 million people in West Africa. HIV-2 does have the same
      sensibility to antiretroviral treatment (ART) compared to HIV-1. The ART strategies that are
      appropriate for the HIV-1 infection are not as effective for HIV-2. Classical triple therapy
      including PI is less effective for HIV-2. Also, the choice of ARTs in a second line treatment
      is limited. The first line optimal treatment has to be defined by a prospective and
      randomized evaluation of other strategies. The primary endpoint will be adapted to the
      specificity of the HIV-2 infection. The 1st step is to define, with a phase II clinical
      trial, whether a strategy including 2 NRTIs and raltegravir, as an alternative strategy to
      the classical triple therapy, shows an immunovirological response, at least, as good as the
      one obtained with the triple therapy. The hypothesis is that the low ART response observed in
      HIV-2 infection is due to a low virological strength of the ARTs used and that the
      combination of 2 NRTIs and raltegravir should show a therapeutic success of at least 50% at
      week 48.
