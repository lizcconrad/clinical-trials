  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of the
      investigational drug lisofylline, when administered under the skin or in the vein, in people
      with type 1 diabetes. A second aim is to determine how much drug is available in the blood
      after injection under the skin, compared to injection in the vein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, crossover study in subjects with type 1 diabetes. There
      are two treatment periods separated by approximately one week. One treatment will consist of
      a 10 hour subcutaneous infusion of lisofylline, and the other treatment will consist of a 10
      hour intravenous infusion of lisofylline.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Infusion Center the morning of dosing (Day 1, Day
      7) during each treatment period, receive their assigned dose of study drug on Day 1 and Day
      7, and will remain confined to the Infusion Center until approximately 3 hours following the
      start of study drug administration for the remaining blood draws. The subjects will then be
      escorted to the Sleep Center of Eastern Virginia Medical School for an overnight stay during
      which time their heart rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored by pulse oximetry. The
      next morning the subjects will return to the Infusion Center for a final blood draw and
      physical examination. The Infusion Center and the Sleep Disorders Center are both within
      Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

      All subjects will be assigned to a treatment sequence according to a randomization schedule.

    <description>Subjects will be monitored for adverse events both during and after the study drug infusion and will undergo physical examinations, electrocardiograms and clinical safety laboratory tests.
Study staff will contact subjects within 5 days after each dosing period and approximately 30 days after the 2nd dosing period, to review laboratory results and to ask the subject about any changes in health that they have experienced. Should the subject require an in-person evaluation, this will be arranged with the principal or sub-investigator promptly.</description>

    <description>Blood will be collected for determination of lisofylline concentrations at various predetermined time points during the infusions, and 10 and 24 hours following infusion completion. This will help to determine if subcutaneous infusion over 10 hours results in similar lisofylline plasma concentrations as with intravenous infusion.</description>

Study staff will contact subjects within 5 days after each dosing period and approximately 30 days after the 2nd dosing period, to review laboratory results and to ask the subject about any changes in health that they have experienced. Should the subject require an in-person evaluation, this will be arranged with the principal or sub-investigator promptly.</description>
