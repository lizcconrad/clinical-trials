      1. Aim: The aim of this trial was to determine whether whole-body vibration (WBV) induced
           via a non-invasive oscillation platform could improve symptoms and health-related
           quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic functional constipation.

        2. Methods: A single-blinded, randomized, control trial was performed in a single Hospital
           in Taiwan. Patients diagnosed with chronic functional constipation, as per the Rome III
           diagnostic criteria were included and randomized to either the WBV treatment or no
           treatment (control) group. The treatment group received six 15-minute sessions of WBV
           therapy over a two-week period. Patients received vibrations of 2 mm in amplitude at a
           frequency of 12 Hz. The primary outcome was assessed by the constipation severity
           instrument (CSI). The secondary outcome was improvements in HRQOL.
