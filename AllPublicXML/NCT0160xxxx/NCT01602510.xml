  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registration study in China is a multi-centre, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine in the prevention of
      recurrence/relapse of mood episodes in subjects with bipolar I disorder. Subjects are bipolar
      I disorder patients with recent/current manic, hypomanic, mixed or depressive episode. The
      study will include an open-label phase and a randomized phase. During the open-label phase,
      subjects will have lamotrigine monotherapy or combination therapy escalation. The target dose
      of lamotrigine is 200 milligram (mg)/day monotherapy. The duration of treatment in the
      open-label phase will last 6-16 weeks, until subjects reach a stable dose of lamotrigine.
      Beginning at week 7 of the open-label phase, subjects who have reached a stable dose of
      lamotrigine and met response criteria, defined as maintaining a Clinical Global Impression of
      Severity (CGI-S) score &lt;= 3 for at least 4 continuous weeks and maintaining lamotrigine 200
      mg/day monotherapy for at least 1 week, will be eligible to enroll in the double-blind phase
      of the study. Subjects who have not met response criteria after 16 weeks of participation in
      the open-label phase will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects will have lamotrigine 200
      mg/day monotherapy for at least 1 week prior to randomization. Subjects who have met
      randomization requirements will be randomized 1:1 to lamotrigine 200 mg/day or placebo for 36
      weeks double-blind treatment. After randomization, subjects will be assessed at weekly
      intervals for the first month, biweekly intervals for the second month, and then at monthly
      intervals for up to 36 weeks of double-blind treatment. The primary endpoint will be TIME,
      defined as the time to intervention (addition of pharmacotherapy or electroconvulsive therapy
      [ECT]) for any mood episode (relapse or recurrence of a depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed
      episode) after randomization. The secondary endpoints will include time to intervention for
      manic, hypomanic or mixed episode (TIMan) and time to intervention for depressive episode
      (TIDep).The scores on the Hamilton Depression (HAMD), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), CGI-I,
      CGI-S and Global Assessment Scale (GAS) will be used as indicators for both intensity and
      duration of mood symptoms during this phase. Subjects who withdraw early from the study prior
      to week 36 or reach TIME will have a follow-up visit 14 days after the last dose of
      investigational drug.

    <time_frame>36 weeks (wks)</time_frame>
    <description>TIME is defined as being the time from entry into the randomized double-blind phase to the time of the first prescription of any additional pharmacotherapy or Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) determined by the investigator to be necessary for treatment of a relapse and/or recurrence of a depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episode, whichever occurs first. TIME was measured relative to randomization date. Par. prematurely discontinued from the study prior to reaching the TIME event were censored at the time of discontinuation. Analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression model with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score, treatment and treatment by CGI-S baseline score interaction. The overall hazard ratio for treatment group could not be calculated due to different CGI-S baseline score level.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival in Study (TIME-SIS).</measure>
    <time_frame>36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>TIME-SIS was defined as the time to intervention (addition of pharmacotherapy or ECT) for any mood episode, or to the time when the participant is withdrawn for any reason after randomization. The premature discontinuation of a participant prior to reaching TIME, for any reason, was treated as an event related to bipolar disorder. All participants prematurely discontinued prior to the TIME event in this analysis were to be assumed to have reached TIME. TIMS-SIS was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression model with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score, treatment and treatment by CGI-S baseline score interaction. The overall hazard ratio for treatment group could not be calculated due to different CGI-S baseline score level. Par. prematurely discontinued from the study prior to reaching the event were censored at the time of discontinuation.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Improvements (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale where investigator were asked to assess the participant's illness at the time of assessment (improved or worsened) relative to a baseline state. In this scale, 1= very much improved; 2= much improved; 3= minimally improved; 4= no change; 5= minimally worse; 6= much worse; or 7= very much worse. Analysis was performed using Analysis of covariance with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score and treatment. In presented Last-observation-carried-forward datasets, the last non-missing on therapy (OT) score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for the remaining study visits of the treatment period. Baseline value was defined as the last non-missing values at or prior to the randomization. Change from baseline at the time point of interest was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-baseline values. If either baseline or post-baseline value was missing, the change from baseline was set to missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 7-point scale where investigator were asked to rate the severity of the participant's illness at the time of assessment on severity of mental illness, where 1= normal, and 7= extremely ill. Data was collected on Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32 and 36. Analysis performed using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score (Open label phase), treatment and CGI-S baseline score. In presented Last observation carried forward (LOCF) datasets, last non-missing on therapy score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for remaining study visits of treatment period. The baseline value was defined as last non-missing values at or prior to the randomization. The change from baseline at the time point of interest was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from individual post-baseline values. If either the baseline or post-baseline value was missing, the change from baseline was set to missing as well.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>HAMD consists of 17 items: depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia-early, middle, late, work and activities, retardation, agitation, anxiety psychic, anxiety somatic, somatic symptoms gastro-intestinal, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Investigators rated par. from 0 to 4 (or 2) for these items. Total score is sum of all subscales (0 to 52, higher is worse). Data was collected on Wks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline (BL) score, treatment and HAMD total BL score. The last non-missing OT score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for remaining study visits of the treatment period. BL value was defined as the last non-missing value at or prior to the randomization. Change from BL was calculated by subtracting BL from the specific post-BL value. If BL or post-BL value was missing, the change from BL was set to missing.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>YMRS consists of 11 items: Elevated Mood, Increased Motor Activity/Energy, Sexual Interest, Sleep, Irritability, Speech, Language/Thought Disorder, Content, Disruptive/Aggressive Behaviour, Appearance, and Insight. Investigators rated par. from 0 to 4 (or 8) for each of these items. Total score is the sum of all subscales, from 0 to 60 (higher is worse). Data was collected on Wks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of site, CGI-S BL score, treatment and YMRS total BL score. In LOCF datasets, the last non-missing OT score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for the remaining study visits of the treatment period. BL value was defined as the last non-missing values at or prior to the randomization. Change from BL at the time point of interest was calculated by subtracting BL value from the individual post-BL value. If either the BL or post-BL value was missing, change from BL was set to missing.</description>

The scale has a 10 score categories: 1-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90, 91-100, using intermediary levels when appropriate (from 100 to 1, Lower is worse.). Data was collected on Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of site, CGI-S BL score, treatment and GAS total BL score. In presented LOCF datasets, the last non-missing on therapy score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for the remaining study visits of the treatment period. The BL value was defined as the last non-missing values at or prior to the randomization. The change from BL at the time point of interest was calculated by subtracting the BL values from the individual post-BL values. If either the BL or post-BL value was missing, the change from BL was set to missing as well.</description>

        <title>Time to Intervention for Any Mood Episode (TIME)</title>
        <description>TIME is defined as being the time from entry into the randomized double-blind phase to the time of the first prescription of any additional pharmacotherapy or Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) determined by the investigator to be necessary for treatment of a relapse and/or recurrence of a depressive, manic, hypomanic or mixed episode, whichever occurs first. TIME was measured relative to randomization date. Par. prematurely discontinued from the study prior to reaching the TIME event were censored at the time of discontinuation. Analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression model with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score, treatment and treatment by CGI-S baseline score interaction. The overall hazard ratio for treatment group could not be calculated due to different CGI-S baseline score level.</description>

        <description>TIME-SIS was defined as the time to intervention (addition of pharmacotherapy or ECT) for any mood episode, or to the time when the participant is withdrawn for any reason after randomization. The premature discontinuation of a participant prior to reaching TIME, for any reason, was treated as an event related to bipolar disorder. All participants prematurely discontinued prior to the TIME event in this analysis were to be assumed to have reached TIME. TIMS-SIS was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression model with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score, treatment and treatment by CGI-S baseline score interaction. The overall hazard ratio for treatment group could not be calculated due to different CGI-S baseline score level. Par. prematurely discontinued from the study prior to reaching the event were censored at the time of discontinuation.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression of Improvements (CGI-I)</title>
        <description>The CGI-I is a 7-point scale where investigator were asked to assess the participant’s illness at the time of assessment (improved or worsened) relative to a baseline state. In this scale, 1= very much improved; 2= much improved; 3= minimally improved; 4= no change; 5= minimally worse; 6= much worse; or 7= very much worse. Analysis was performed using Analysis of covariance with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline score and treatment. In presented Last-observation-carried-forward datasets, the last non-missing on therapy (OT) score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for the remaining study visits of the treatment period. Baseline value was defined as the last non-missing values at or prior to the randomization. Change from baseline at the time point of interest was calculated by subtracting the baseline values from the individual post-baseline values. If either baseline or post-baseline value was missing, the change from baseline was set to missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)</title>
        <description>HAMD consists of 17 items: depressed mood, feelings of guilt, suicide, insomnia-early, middle, late, work and activities, retardation, agitation, anxiety psychic, anxiety somatic, somatic symptoms gastro-intestinal, general somatic symptoms, hypochondriasis, loss of weight, and insight. Investigators rated par. from 0 to 4 (or 2) for these items. Total score is sum of all subscales (0 to 52, higher is worse). Data was collected on Wks 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 36. Analysis was performed using ANCOVA with covariates of site, CGI-S baseline (BL) score, treatment and HAMD total BL score. The last non-missing OT score prior to TIME was carried forward to estimate missing data points for remaining study visits of the treatment period. BL value was defined as the last non-missing value at or prior to the randomization. Change from BL was calculated by subtracting BL from the specific post-BL value. If BL or post-BL value was missing, the change from BL was set to missing.</description>
