  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of preemptive dexamethasone
      and methylprednisolone to prevent pain, swelling and limitation in mouth opening following
      third molar extraction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Third molar surgery is often associated with significant post-surgical sequelae. The trauma
      caused to soft and bony tissue can result in considerable pain, swelling and trismus.
      Symptoms begin gradually having a peak 2 days after extraction. The use of corticosteroids
      such as dexamethasone and methylprednisolone can be a valuable tool when performing moderate
      to moderately severe oral surgical procedures. No clear consensus have emerged yet regarding
      patient selection, dosage, timing and type of administration of steroid. In this light, this
      clinical trial aim to compare the effect of preemptive dexamethasone and methylprednisolone
      to prevent pain, swelling and limitation in mouth opening following third molar extraction.

    <description>During the postoperative intervals of 24, 48 and 72 hours and seven days, the swelling was determined using linear measures in the face and trismus by maximum mouth opening. The postoperative pain was self-recorded by the patient using visual analogue scale in 72 hours with an interval of eight hours</description>
