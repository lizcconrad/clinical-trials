      Objective of this pivotal study was to assess the bioequivalence between Test Product:
      Allopurinol 300 mg Tablets USP of M/s Ipca Laboratories Limited, India and the corresponding
      Reference Product: Zyloprim® (Allopurinol) 300 mg Tablets manufactured by Catalytica Pharma
      Inc., USA for Prometheus Laboratories Inc., USA, under fasting condition in normal, healthy,
      adult, human male subjects in a randomized crossover study.

      The study was conducted with 32 healthy adult male subjects. In each study period, a single
      300 mg dose of either test or reference was administered to the subjects as per the
      randomization schedule in each study period with about 240 mL of water at ambient temperature
      in sitting position.

      The duration of the clinical phase was 51 days including washout period of at 18 days between
      administrations of study drug in each study period.
