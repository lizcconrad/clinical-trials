    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess [18F] -fluciclatide as a biomarker of response to
      pazopanib and to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of pazopanib and
      paclitaxel in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Responded to at least on one line of prior platinum based therapy

          -  Relapsed within platinum resistant interval (≤6months)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;2

          -  Measurable disease defined as a lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one
             dimension with the longest diameter ≥25mm using conventional techniques

          -  Satisfactory baseline haematologic and organ function:

               -  Haematologic: Absolute neutrophil count &gt; or = 1.5 X 10^9/L; Platelets &gt; or = 100
                  X 10^9/L; Haemoglobin &gt; or = 9g/dL; PT or INR &lt; or = 1.2 x ULN; PTT &lt; or = 1.2 x
                  ULN

               -  Hepatic: Bilirubin &lt; or = 1.5 X ULN; AST or ALT &lt; or = 2.5 X ULN

               -  Renal: Serum creatinine &lt; or = 1.5 mg/dL; Or if &gt;1.5 mg/dL, calculated creatinine

                  OR

               -  chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, investigational therapy or
                  hormonal therapy within 14 days or five half-lives of a drug (whichever is
                  longer) prior to the first dose of pazopanib
