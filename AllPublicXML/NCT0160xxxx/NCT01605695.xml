  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The discovery that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) circulates in people who are
      developing the sepsis pathology has provided an opportunity to develop a first-in-class
      diagnostic test for the onset of sepsis. This study is designed to determine the normal human
      plasma level of circulating iNOS as the initial reference level against which hospitalized
      patients at risk for the development of sepsis can be compared to ascertain if the patient is
      at risk for becoming septic based upon an elevated level of plasma iNOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections in intensive care units (ICUs) and other hospital settings can be caused by
      different types of organisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Yearly, these infections cause at
      least 2 million patients in the USA to enter the early stages of the sepsis pathology
      (pre-sepsis) which will lead to more than 750,000 cases of sepsis that can deteriorate into
      life-threatening severe sepsis with organ dysfunction and septic shock with multiple organ
      failure and result in more than 250,000 deaths per year. At present, an accurate clinical lab
      test to predict the onset of the sepsis pathology does not exist. Thus, there is a large
      unmet clinical lab need for a test that can aid physicians in assessing the risk their
      hospitalized patients have for developing the sepsis pathology. A reliable test for
      predicting very early the onset of sepsis would be a major medical breakthrough. However, a
      reference level for normal healthy individuals is needed against which plasma levels can be
      compared for increased (or decreased) levels of iNOS.

        Reference values will be obtained from 100 plasma samples obtained from healthy normal
        humans collected prospectively under an IRB approved protocol and informed consent after
        blood donation for use in research. The 100 normal human plasma samples will be assayed
        using the PliNOSa test.
