  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff tears are common amongst 50-60 year olds with no connection to their physical
      activity. When symptomatic, the injury affects all aspects of general health, quality of life
      and function. Surgical intervention is recommended only if conservative treatment fails. The
      purpose of the surgical intervention is to reduce pain, and improve function while improving
      range of motion and muscle strength around the shoulder. The purpose of the current study is
      to measure physical, functional, expectation, satisfaction and quality of life outcomes after
      rotator cuff repair surgery. Another purpose is to learn the reproducibility components of
      the above outcomes.
