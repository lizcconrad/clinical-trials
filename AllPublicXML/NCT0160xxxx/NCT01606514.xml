  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single disaster, terrorist attack, or other large-scale incident can adversely affect
      thousands of youth and families. Immediate consequences may include unmet basic needs and
      high economic burden, particularly among underserved populations. Disasters also can
      dramatically affect family roles and relationships over time (e.g., family routines, marital
      stress, parent-child interactions). Whereas most youth are resilient in the aftermath of
      disasters (i.e., do not develop serious mental health or health-risk problems), the
      prevalence of various problems of public health significance (e.g., PTSD, depression,
      substance abuse) clearly increases in this population. This underscores the need for
      effective, widely accessible, culturally-appropriate and cost-efficient interventions that
      foster resilience or rapid recovery relative to the health effects of disasters. Yet, few
      evidence-informed resources are available to youth and families to facilitate post-disaster
      resilience and recovery. Primary aims of this project are: (a) to develop a Web-based
      intervention for disaster-affected adolescents and parents targeting prevalent health-related
      correlates of disasters (i.e., development phase), (b) to conduct a randomized controlled
      population-based study to examine feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the intervention
      (i.e., randomized controlled trial [RCT] phase) and cultural relevance (i.e., perceived
      applicability of the intervention to one's cultural group), and (c) to refine the
      intervention based on RCT-phase data.
