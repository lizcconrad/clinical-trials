  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the pharmacokinetic (what the body does to
      the drug) parameters of telaprevir are altered in patients with moderate hepatic impairment,
      compared to the pharmacokinetic parameters in patients with normal liver function, and
      measure the relative unbound plasma concentrations of telaprevir.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) study to
      investigate the single dose and steady state pharmacokinetics of telaprevir in patients with
      moderate hepatic impairment, and measure the relative unbound plasma concentrations of
      telaprevir. In addition, a small group of patients with severe hepatic impairment will be
      included to further characterize the pharmacokinetics of telaprevir as a function of liver
      disease. In this study 24 patients will be enrolled. Based upon physical examination and
      laboratory assessments, patients will be scored and classified into hepatic function groups
      on the basis of the Child-Pugh classification (Classification is based on Child-Pugh score
      which is used to assess prognosis of chronic hepatic disease). A Child-Pugh score of 7 to 9
      is considered Child-Pugh category B (CPB) and indicative of moderate liver function
      impairment; a Child-Pugh score of 10 or greater is considered Child Pugh category C (CPC),
      indicative of severe liver impairment. Hepatic function groups will consists of Group 1: 10
      patients with moderate hepatic impairment (CPB 7 to 9]); Group 2: 10 healthy control patients
      with normal hepatic function. Each healthy control patient is matched to a patient in Group 1
      with respect to sex, age (+5 years or -5 years) and body mass index (BMI) (+15% or -15%);
      Group 3: 4 patients with severe hepatic impairment (CPC [limited to Child Pugh score 10 to
      12]). Safety and tolerability evaluations including adverse events, clinical laboratory
      tests, 12-lead electrocardiogram, vital signs and physical examination will be recorded
      throughout the study period.
