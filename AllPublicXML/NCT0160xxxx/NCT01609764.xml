  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is associated with a reduction of physical activity, movement efficiency, and quality
      of sleep. This leads to reduced health and well being in elderly subjects. Exercise training
      can increase movement efficiency and quality of sleep.

      Objectives:

        1. Laboratory validation test of body acceleration based indexes for movement efficiency
           and quality of sleep;

        2. Cross-sectional analysis to assess relations between these indexes and age;

        3. Intervention study to assess the effect of exercise training on daily life movement
           efficiency and quality of sleep in ageing subjects

      45 healthy human volunteers, age 50-83 yr, BMI 20-30 kg/m2 are divided in control or
      intervention group. Subjects that will have practiced fitness activities in the previous
      year, as well as pregnant or lactating women, will be excluded.

    <description>The primary objective is to identify features of body acceleration to be included in an index to assess daily life movement efficiency. Secondly, the index is related with age to quantify how ageing affects daily life movement efficiency.
The third objective is to show the effects of regular physical activity training on this index. The expected improvement of the index would show that exercise delays the age related decrease of movement efficiency.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women

          -  Age between 50-85 years

          -  No fitness activity in the previous year, to amplify training effects on movement
             efficiency and quality of sleep.

          -  Body mass index between 20 and 30 kg/m2, obesity limits the training capacity of
             subjects.

        Signed informed consent by the participants

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age below 50 or above 85 years;
