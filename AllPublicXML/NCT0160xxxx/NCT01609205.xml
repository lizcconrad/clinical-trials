  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the relationship between RA disease activity based on Doppler
      quantification and the subsequent clinical response (EULAR response) to treatment with
      Adalimumab during 12 months. The purpose is also to compare the Doppler quantification with
      conventional clinical methods and semiquantitative Doppler assessment.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be the proportion of different clinical (EULAR) response (good, moderate, no response)* to add-on therapy with anti-TNF treatment at 6 months follow-up visit in patients with activity versus in those without activity measured by Doppler ultrasound at baseline.</description>

    <description>The proportion of patients with good response to add-on therapy (measured by both Doppler and clinical assessment) at 6 and 12 months follow-up visits in two groups of patients, those who achieve low disease activity according to Doppler assessment at 3 months visit versus those who did not.</description>
