    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare gene expression profiles in endometrial biopsies
      during the window of implantation after triggers of oocyte maturation using GnRH agonist or
      hCG and compared with their natural cycles in order to identify genes that may be
      dysregulated in GnRH agonist-triggered cycles.

      The investigators also intend to evaluate patients feeling of well being and physical quality
      of life after GnRH agonist trigger compared with hCG trigger

    <textblock>
      Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication of controlled ovarian
      hyperstimulation (COH) which may result in significant morbidity and rarely mortality as well
      as significant financial and psychological distress. The use of a GnRH agonist for induction
      of final oocyte maturation in ovarian stimulation cycles utilizing GnRH antagonist for
      pituitary suppression has proven to be an effective method of preventing the risk of OHSS
      development.

      Unfortunately, some studies, but not all, have also reported lower pregnancy rates in these
      cycles as compared to cycles using hCG trigger and this has been attributed to possible
      impaired endometrial receptivity.

      The investigators intend to obtain endometrial biopsies collected from the same subject in a
      natural cycle and then a biopsy during either a GnRH agonist or hCG triggered stimulation.
      Expression profiles of mRNAs will first be screened using microarray technology. Relative
      levels of specific mRNAs that display altered expression in the GnRH-triggered samples, as
      assayed by microarray, will then be confirmed by real-time, quantitative reverse
      transcription/polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR). The investigators shall also evaluate
      patients feeling of well being and physical quality of life after GnRH agonist trigger
      compared with hCG trigger.
