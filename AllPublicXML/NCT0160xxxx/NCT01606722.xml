  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the relationship between plasma and intracellular darunavir (DRV) concentrations
      and virological efficacy in HIV-infected patients on DRV/rtv monotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To be enrolled, subjects had a plasma HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies/mL for at least 6 months based,
      virologic failure while on a PI-containing regimen was allowed if the genotypic resistance
      tests showed no major resistance mutation associated to reduced susceptibility to DRV/rtv
      according to the International AIDS Society. Patients with transitory episodes of detectable
      plasma HIV-RNA viral load (&quot;blip&quot;) preceded and followed by a plasma viral load &lt;50 copies/mL
      without changes in antiretroviral treatment could also been included. The only exclusion
      criteria were pregnancy, hepatitis B coinfection and the concomitant use of drugs with
      potential major interactions with DRV/rtv pharmacokinetics.
