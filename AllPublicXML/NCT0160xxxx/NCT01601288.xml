  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a prospective database of all patients who have
      undergone pulmonary function testing from which the investigators can study the clinical
      phenotypes of various respiratory conditions. The investigators hope by understanding the
      differences in these myriad phenotypes to be able to provide individualized, patient-targeted
      therapy in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that clinical phenotyping of patients with various respiratory
      conditions is important in the understanding of the disease process, clinical response to
      treatment, and prognosis. Pulmonary function testing is a very important aspect of clinical
      phenotyping in many respiratory conditions. Creating a database will enable us to study the
      various phenotypes within each respiratory condition. This will allow us to better understand
      each disease, with a view to provide personalized patient care targeted at their specific
      phenotype and hence better clinical outcomes.
