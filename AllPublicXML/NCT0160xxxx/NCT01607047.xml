  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Leptospirosis is a zoonosis of worldwide distribution whose incidence is higher in the
      tropics, where conditions for transmissions are favorable. The disease is endemic in
      Martinique and Guadeloupe, two Caribbean islands of the French West Indies. In tropical
      areas, many wild and domestic animals serve as reservoirs for pathogenic Leptospira strains
      and contaminate the environment by shedding the organisms in their urine. Humans are usually
      infected through abraded skin or mucous membrane contact with water contaminated by the urine
      of animal reservoirs, and less frequently by direct contact with animals or their urine. The
      mean incubation period is 10 days, with a usual range of 2-20 days. Clinical manifestations
      are protean and the spectrum of symptoms range from subclinical or mild anicteric febrile
      illness to acute renal failure and respiratory distress syndrome which are associated with
      high mortality rates.

      The microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and culture are the reference standard test for
      diagnosis of leptospirosis, but they are only available in reference laboratories and their
      conclusive results requires convalescent sample or prolonged incubation. At present, only
      direct detection methods using PCR might provide rapid diagnosis during the early acute stage
      of the illness, when treatment is likely to have the greatest benefit.

      Quantitative PCR also offers the ability to measure level of leptospiremia in clinical
      samples. Using qPCR based diagnosis, the investigators have the opportunity to study the
      association of level of leptospiremia and clinical manifestations in French West Indies. All
      qPCR-positive samples will be used for molecular typing.

      Principal objective

      To determine if leptospiral bacterial load is associated with severe evolution of the disease
      (organ failure, internal bleeding, death) in French West Indies.

      Secondary objective

        1. To identify demographic, clinical, biological, bacteriological, and genetic factors
           (HLA) associated with severe complications of leptospirosis (organ failure, internal
           bleeding, death).

        2. To identify demographic, clinical, biological, bacteriological, and genetic factors
           (HLA) associated with an altered quality of life after the acute phase of leptospirosis.

        3. To collect human biological samples to allow studies of the individual susceptibility to
           the infection (genetic polymorphisms, HLA).
