  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects entering the study will have undergone cardiac surgery. Those who experience kidney
      injury within 48 hours of their surgery will be enrolled into the study. Once enrolled,
      subjects will receive a single administration of AC607 or placebo. Kidney recovery will be
      evaluated over the subsequent 30 days and death or the need for dialysis will be evaluated
      within 90 days of dosing. After 90 days (evaluation period), subjects will enter a 3-year
      extension phase of the study to monitor safety and long-term outcomes (follow-up period).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll post-cardiac surgery subjects (CABG and/or valve) with laboratory
      evidence of AKI within 48 hrs of removal from cardiopulmonary bypass. Subjects will be
      randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to treatment with a single administration of AC607 or placebo
      (approximately 100 subjects per group).

      Safety and efficacy assessments will be performed daily during the post-operative hospital
      stay from the day randomized into the study until discharge, at 30 days, and at 90 days after
      study drug administration (evaluation phase). Safety and long-term clinical outcomes will be
      assessed at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months (long-term follow-up phase).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 21 years

          -  Had cardiovascular surgery utilizing cardiopulmonary bypass

          -  Have a pre-operative (baseline) serum creatinine value collected within 30 days of
             surgery (if multiple laboratory results are available within this time window, the
             most recent serum creatinine value prior to surgery will be used to establish the
             baseline)

          -  Willing and able to comply with visit schedule and study procedures including
             post-hospitalization discharge follow-up

          -  Ability to give informed consent or have a legally acceptable representative do so for
             them

          -  Have AKI defined as ≥ 0.5 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine from baseline within 48 hours
             of removal from cardiopulmonary bypass

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active cancer and/or receiving active treatment for cancer, with the exception of
             squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin

          -  Had surgery for thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA)

          -  Currently participating in another interventional drug or device clinical study

          -  Prisoner or other detainee

          -  Has a current medical condition that would preclude or compromise femoral artery
             catheter placement

          -  Has an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) in place within 2 hours of catheter placement

          -  Has a ventricular assist device (VAD) or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in
             place at the time of the study catheter placement

          -  Prior history of solid organ or bone marrow transplant

          -  Stage 5 CKD or currently on dialysis

          -  Are expected to receive dialysis within 24 hours of enrollment or dosing

          -  Had a complication during surgery or post-operatively that, in the opinion of the
             principal investigator (PI), significantly increases the risk of complications to the
             subject and therefore precludes dosing the subject

          -  Are pregnant or lactating. A woman with child-bearing potential may be tested for
             pregnancy at the discretion of the PI.
