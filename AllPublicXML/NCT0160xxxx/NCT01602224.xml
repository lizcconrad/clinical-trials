  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational drug called tabalumab in
      participants with Multiple Myeloma (MM) who have tried at least one other therapy in the
      past. Tabalumab will be given in combination with standard doses of two other drugs that are
      often used to treat MM. Study doctors will collect information about the effectiveness and
      side effects of this therapy.
