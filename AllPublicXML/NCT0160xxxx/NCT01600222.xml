      A Phase 2 Maximal Use Systemic Exposure (MUSE) study evaluating the safety and efficacy of
      LEO 90100 used once daily in subjects with extensive psoriasis vulgaris.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to assess the systemic safety of LEO 90100. Although LEO
      90100 contains the same active ingredients in the same concentration as
      DAIVOBET/DOVOBET/TACLONEX ointment, the degree of absorption of the active ingredients from
      the new formulation may differ. Systemic safety will be assessed through the effect of LEO
      90100 on calcium metabolism and HPA axis function under maximum use conditions (i.e., in
      subjects with very extensive psoriasis on the trunk, limbs and scalp, using up to 120g per
      week of LEO 90100 for up to 4 weeks). Data from this study, together with the measurements of
      albumin-corrected serum calcium and the calcium:creatinine ratio in spot urine samples in the
      planned phase 2 and 3 studies in the development program for LEO 90100, are expected to
      provide adequate information with respect to the systemic safety of LEO 90100.

      <pre_assignment_details>Subjects with extensive psoriasis vulgaris of at least moderate severity (according to the Investigators Global Assessment of Disease Severity; IGA) on the trunk, limbs and the scalp were enrolled.
Screening: normal HPA axis function before and after ACTH-challenge test and albumin-corrected serum Ca lvl below the upper normal limit were required.</pre_assignment_details>

If it is not possible to calculate the above PK parameters, samples with plasma concentration above lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) will be presented.
All subjects but 1 had plasma concentration of calcipotriol below the LLOQ (lower limit of quantification), and thus it was not possible to calculate group mean of the derived PK parameter based on one sample. Provided values for calcipotriol Cmax are derived from that 1 subject.</description>
