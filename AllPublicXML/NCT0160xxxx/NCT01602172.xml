      Veterans drink, binge drink, and drive under the influence of alcohol at higher rates than
      non-Veterans do. Addressing alcohol misuse, the range of alcohol consumption from risky
      drinking to alcohol abuse and alcoholism, is a national priority for the VA. It is
      recommended that people keep their alcohol consumption below limits established by the
      National Institutes of Health (NIH). A type of 10-15 minute counseling known as &quot;brief
      intervention&quot; (BI) has been shown to help risky drinkers cut back to the NIH-recommended
      limits. This study will examine the impact of a nurse-delivered alcohol BI on hospitalized
      Veterans' weekly number of drinks, monthly number of binge drinking episodes, readiness to
      change drinking behavior, and alcohol-related problems. This preventative approach for
      reducing alcohol consumption is intended to help Veterans avoid many of the physical and
      psychosocial consequences of alcohol misuse.

    <textblock>
      Improving the identification and management of alcohol misuse is a VA priority. Alcohol
      misuse includes the spectrum of alcohol consumption ranging from hazardous drinking to
      alcohol use disorders (alcohol abuse and dependence). The VA recommends using a set of
      clinical strategies referred to as Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
      (SBIRT) to identify and address alcohol misuse in primary care settings. Brief intervention
      (BI), a core component of SBIRT, significantly reduces alcohol consumption, morbidity, and
      healthcare utilization in hazardous drinkers, but its efficacy is not well-established
      outside of outpatient settings. In the hospital setting, nurses are well-positioned to
      deliver BI, but research is needed to determine the efficacy of inpatient nurse-delivered BI,
      particularly with hazardous drinkers. The few previous trials of BI in the inpatient setting
      demonstrated limited effects on alcohol consumption and alcohol-related problems, potentially
      due to assessment reactivity--extensive patient assessment that inadvertently raises patient
      awareness about drinking in both groups, mimicking the effect of BI and thus driving findings
      towards the null. Additionally, very few of these trials involved nurse delivery of the
      intervention and many included patients with alcohol use disorders, patients believed to be
      beyond the &quot;therapeutic reach&quot; of BI.

      The primary goal of this 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of
      nurse-delivered alcohol BI with hospitalized patients who are hazardous drinkers and to
      identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of BI in inpatient settings. Arm 1 (BI)
      consists of Veterans randomized to nurse-delivered BI, Arm 2 (AC) consists of Veterans
      randomized to an attention control, and Arm 3 (AC-LA) consists of Veterans randomized to an
      attention control with limited assessment of readiness to change and adverse consequences of
      alcohol use so as to reduce and evaluate assessment reactivity.

      Specific Aim 1 is to determine the impact of a nurse-led BI on the alcohol screening status,
      number of drinks/week, number of binge drinking episodes, readiness to change drinking
      behavior, and adverse consequences of alcohol use in hospitalized hazardous drinkers.
      Specific Aim 2 is to formatively evaluate the process of the intervention implementation to
      inform the design and execution of a future, multi-site randomized effectiveness trial of the
      intervention. A secondary aim is to identify factors, issues, and themes related to Veterans'
      interest and motivation for changing their alcohol consumption.

      We will recruit 320 hospitalized Veterans admitted to one of the three medical-surgical units
      at the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System. Veterans will be included who are &gt;21 years old, able
      to speak English, and are hazardous, non-dependent drinkers, as defined by criteria
      established by the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and by the Composite
      International Diagnostic Interview Substance Abuse Module. Patients randomized to Arm 1 will
      receive a three-part nurse-delivered BI. Patients randomized to Arms 2 and 3 will receive
      usual care plus healthy lifestyle brochures addressing general healthy lifestyle behaviors,
      such as limited alcohol consumption, tobacco cessation, and weight management. For Specific
      Aim 1, we will use various multivariable linear and logistic regressions that account for
      continuous outcomes, dichotomous outcomes, and clustering within medical units. Poisson
      regressions or negative binomial regressions will be used if the continuous outcome measures
      are not normally distributed. For Specific Aim 2, we will use basic descriptive statistics in
      order to describe the numbers of deviations and interruptions to intervention delivery as
      planned. Based on interventionist field notes, we will categorize the types of
      deviations/interruptions. We will also use these descriptive statistics to describe duration
      of the audio-recorded intervention; the presence/absence of various techniques within the BI;
      the receipt/nonreceipt of additional alcohol feedback, advice, or counseling; and patient
      responsiveness to/perceptions of the BI. We will also code brief free-text perceptions
      responses using a modified grounded theory approach.

    <description>Number of Drinks per Week will be determined by the product of responses to the following two NIAAA questions during the recruitment and screening processes : (1) On average, how many days a week do you have an alcoholic drink?; (2) On a typical drinking day, how many standard-sized drinks do you have? (Appendix 2). &quot;Standard-sized drink&quot; will refer to 12 ounces beer, 5 ounces wine, or 1.5 ounces liquor/spirits.</description>

    <description>Alcohol Screening Status will be assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) (Appendix 2), the 3-item short form of the 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) developed by the World Health Organization. AUDIT-C data will be collected during the recruitment and screening processes.</description>

    <description>Number of Binge Drinking Episodes will be assessed through a third NIAAA question during the recruitment and screening processes: (3) How many times in the past 30 days have you had 5 or more standard-sized drinks in a day (men), or 4 or more standard-sized drinks in a day?

    <description>We will assess readiness to change with the Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale (SOCRATES), Version 8.This instrument was created by one of the initial developers of Motivational Interviewing, the therapeutic style on which SBIRT is based. The SOCRATES is a 19-item instrument with 3 subscales: Recognition (of a potential alcohol problem), Ambivalence (about one's drinking), and Taking Steps (towards behavior change), and normative data are available to aid in subscale score interpretation.</description>

    <description>We will assess adverse consequences of alcohol use with the Short Inventory of Problems (SIP-2R), a widely used 15-item stand-alone short version of the Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC).The SIP-2R will be administered at baseline (for Arms 1 and 2) and at 6 months post-hospital discharge (all groups) to assesses adverse consequences of alcohol use over the past three months in five areas: Interpersonal, Physical, Social, Impulsive, and Intrapersonal.</description>

    <description>Among Veterans randomized to Arm 1, we will analyze the transcripts of Part I of the audio-recorded brief intervention. Descriptive statistics (e.g., frequency distributions, measures of central tendency) will be used to characterize the anonymous sociodemographic, educational, and patient care characteristics of the participants. Transcript data will be analyzed using the grounded theory technique of constant comparison. Similar or related codes will be collapsed into focused codes in order to represent interrelationships, variations, and underlying patterns in the data, allowing for the identification of factors, issues, and themes related to Veterans interest and motivation for changing their alcohol consumption.</description>
