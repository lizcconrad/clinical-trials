  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The severe sepsis (SS) and toxic shock (TS) are both frequent and severe complications of
      infectious diseases. They are one of the top ten causes of death in industrialized countries.
      But an eventual protective role of beta-blockers (anti-hypertensive drug) in their occurrence
      on a community infection has never been studied. The objective of this study is to evaluate
      this role.

    <textblock>
      The severe sepsis (SS) and toxic shock (TS) are both frequent and severe complications of
      infectious diseases. They are one of the top ten causes of death in industrialized countries.
      The adrenergic system is heavily involved in this pathological/physiological context. If the
      effect of various therapeutic strategies allowing the care of the SS/TS was widely estimated,
      the impact, positive or negative, therapeutic prescribed in the long term or more punctually
      - but be that as it may before the arisen of the sepsis - on the evolution of a community
      acute infectious pathology towards the SS/TS, had only little studied.

      The main objective of this study is to estimate the possible protective role of a long-term
      prescription of a beta-blocker on the arisen of the SS/TS in patients having an acute
      infectious pathology of community origin.

      The secondary objective will be to estimate, at the patients having developed a SS/TS, the
      impact of this long-term prescription of beta-blockers on the mortality in intensive care
      unit (ICU).
