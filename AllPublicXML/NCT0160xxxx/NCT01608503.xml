  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The subclavian vein (SCV) is a preferred site for placement of central venous catheter.
      However, pneumothorax is a major concern during subclavian venous catheterization. Lung
      deflation, by decreasing lung volume, may reduce the risk of pneumothorax by increasing the
      distance between the pleura and the SCV. The investigators evaluated the effect of lung
      deflation on the relative position between the pleura and the line of the imaginary needle
      pathway during supraclavicular and infraclavicular approach to the subclavian vein (SCV)
      using ultrasonography.

    <description>The ultra-sonography probe was adjusted to obtain an image containing the long-axis cross section of SCV, the pleura, the clavicle, and the first rib. Images were recorded by the same physician during whole respiratory cycle with the probe held in the identical position.
Imaginary lines for supraclavicular and infraclavicular approach were drawn, and distances from the pleura were measured.
If the pleura touched the INP, the distance was recorded as positive value. If the pleura did not touch the INP, the distance was recorded as negative value.</description>
