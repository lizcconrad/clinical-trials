      Rationale:

      Cognitive deficits are a core feature in schizophrenia. Conventional treatments
      (antipsychotic medication and psychological treatments) have limited effects so cognitive
      remediation programs were designed to alleviate the problems. Interventions typically involve
      a variety of exercises in a paper and pencil or a computerized format with a growing number
      of specialized computer programs now being developed. However, many of these programs lack
      specificity which does not allow an individual's specific needs to be addressed. More
      targeted interventions might increase the effects of therapy so RECOS - COgnitive REmediation
      for Schizophrenia - was developed to fit this gap.

      Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study comparing patients aged 18 to 45
      years suffering from schizophrenia according to DSM-IV-TR. RECOS will be compared to an
      already validated program (CRT).

      220 patients will be randomized as follows :

        -  Arm 1 : RECOS (42 h)

        -  Arm 2 : CRT (42 h) The recruitment is performed by psychiatrists in Lyon, Paris,
           Clermont-de-l'Oise, Niort, Bordeaux, Ville-Evrard and Lausanne.

    <description>RECOS(Cognitive Remediation for Schizophrenia) exercises were designed by SBT Company and adapted by Vianin et al (2007) for specific use in schizophrenia. It includes computer based and paper and pencil exercises that target 5 main cognitive functions. RECOS modules focus on the relevant cognitive domains, which have been recommended by the MATRICS consensus. Each exercise has 10 difficulty levels. Allocation of the training modules in RECOS was determined according to the standard scores obtained in the comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Each patient participated in the module corresponding to his/her most altered cognitive area.</description>

    <description>CRT (Cognitive Remediation Therapy) exercises are the ones used by Wykes et al (1999). The CRT method consists of 3 modules: flexibility, memory (A and B) and planning (A and B). Each module involves a series of paper and pencil exercises with parallel forms providing with gradual difficulty.</description>
