  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to test the efficacy of an in-home intervention, &quot;Activity, Balance,
      Learning, and Exposure&quot; (ABLE), which integrates exposure therapy with cognitive
      restructuring, exercise, and home safety evaluation for older adults with excessive fear of
      falling. The intervention will be conducted by a licensed physical therapist. A control
      intervention will be conducted by a health educator. The specific aims of the study are to
      test the feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and safety of the ABLE intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 7-14% of older adults living independently in the community, including more
      than 5% of those who have never experienced a fall, experience moderate to severe fear of
      falling. Fear of falling leads to decreased physical activity, disability, loss of
      independence, depression, anxiety, reduced social engagement, and poor quality of life. It is
      also a major independent risk factor for falls.

      Interventions targeting fear of falling, typically delivered in groups and incorporating
      cognitive restructuring, education, and exercise, have been shown to increase fall-related
      self-efficacy. Avoidance is resistant to treatment, however, and more than one-third of
      patients enrolled in these interventions drop out. Factors associated with attrition include
      high levels of fear and avoidance, indicating that the individuals most in need of such
      programs are those most likely to withdraw prematurely. These data suggest that avoidance
      should be targeted in treatment, and that interventions should be designed to reach very
      fearful individuals who are most likely to drop out of traditional fear of falling programs.

      Participation in this study will last up to 8 months. Participants will be randomly assigned
      to receive either the ABLE intervention or an education control condition. The control
      condition will consist of in-person education about falls to control for the time and
      attention provided in the ABLE arm.

    <time_frame>2 months (primary)</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of Falling will be measured using the Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I), a version of the most widely used measure of falls self-efficacy. Assessments are performed at baseline, 1 month, 2 months (end of intervention - primary outcome point). We will also collect data at 5 months (3 month follow-up) and 8 months (6 month follow-up).</description>

    <description>Activity avoidance will be assessed using a modified version of the Activity Card Sort, a set of photographs of older adults engaged in various activities that is used in rehabilitation settings. Assessments are performed at baseline, 1 month, 2 months (end of intervention - primary outcome point), 5 months (3 month follow-up), and 8 months (6 month follow-up).</description>

    <description>Accelerometers will also be used to measure physical activity.

    <description>Depressive and anxiety symptoms will be assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a 14-item self-report measure with subscales assessing depressive and anxiety symptoms that does not include somatic items such as fatigue that can be associated with aging or medical conditions rather than psychiatric disorders.</description>
