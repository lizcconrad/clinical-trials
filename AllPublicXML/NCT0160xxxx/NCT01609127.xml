    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of tesetaxel administered
      once every 3 weeks in a 21-day cycle, tesetaxel administered once weekly for 3 consecutive
      weeks in a 28-day cycle, and capecitabine administered twice daily for 14 consecutive days in
      a 21-day cycle.
