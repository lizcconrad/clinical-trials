    <textblock>
      The study drug LY2409021 is being evaluated as a possible treatment for diabetes. The primary
      purpose of this study is to help answer the following research questions, and not to provide
      treatment for diabetes :

        -  The safety of LY2409021 and any side effects that might be associated with it following
           4 weeks of doses

        -  How long it takes the body to absorb and remove LY2409021 following dosing over 4 weeks

        -  How daily dosing of LY2409021 affects blood levels of sugar (glucose), insulin and other
           naturally occurring substances before and after a meal

        -  How LY2409021 works when given with metformin

        -  How daily dosing of LY2409021 affects the cells that produce insulin

             interfering with the interpretation of data

          -  Have used systemic glucocorticoids within 1 month prior to first dosing

          -  Have donated 450 mL or more of blood in the last 3 months or have donated any blood
