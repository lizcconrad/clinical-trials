      A study to investigate the effects of sublingual cannabis based medicine extracts on
      neuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of GW-1000-02 in central neuropathic pain
      associated with spinal cord injury. Patients were screened to determine eligibility and
      completed a seven to 21 day baseline period. Patients then returned to the centre for
      assessment, randomisation and initial dosing. Visits occurred at the end of treatment week
      one and at the end of the study (treatment week three) or upon withdrawal. Throughout the
      study, patients were permitted to take paracetamol as escape analgesic to relieve
      breakthrough pain. Patients in this study could elect to be screened for an open label
      extension study of GW-1000-02.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Central Neuropathic Pain 11-Point Numerical Rating Scale Scores at the End of Treatment (up to 51 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Central Neuropathic Pain Numerical Rating Scale score was recorded three times daily, in the morning (on waking), at lunchtime and in the evening using the scale, 0 = 'No Pain' and 10 = 'Worst Possible Pain'. Patients were instructed to relate 'No Pain' to the time before the start of their spinal cord injury. End of Treatment was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study or the mean of the last three days if the subject withdrew. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spasm Severity Numerical Rating Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day, just before going to bed, patients recorded in their patient diary whether they experienced any spasms that day and, if yes, recorded the overall level of the spasm(s) experienced using an Numerical Rating Scale spasm scale ranging from 0 = &quot;Mildest ever spasm&quot; to 10 = &quot;Worst ever spasm&quot;. The mean spasm severity scores were summarised and analysed analogously to the primary endpoint. A negative value from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spasticity Severity Numerical Rating Scale Scores the End of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day at bed time patients recorded whether they experienced any spasticity that day and, if yes, the overall level of spasticity experienced was quantified using an Numerical Rating Scale from 0 = &quot;Mildest ever spasticity&quot; to 10 = &quot;Worst ever spasticity&quot;. The mean spasticity severity scores and the changes from baseline to End of Treatment were to be calculated. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Percentage of Days on Which Spasticity Was Experienced at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day, just before going to bed, patients recorded in their patient diary whether they had experienced any spasticity that day or not. The percentage of days on which spasticity was experienced (spasticity incidence) was calculated and summarised analogously to the primary efficacy parameter of Numerical Rating Scale pain score. A negative value from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Modified Ashworth Scale Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale is a five-point scale conducted on four pre-identified muscle groups. Only the lower limb was assessed because not all Spinal Cord Injury patients upper limb disability. The assessor used the Modified Ashworth scale ranging from 0 (&quot;No increase in muscle tone&quot;) to 4 (&quot;Affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension&quot;) to rate the muscle tone for knee and ankle for the left and right sides separately at a pre-dose visit and at the end of treatment. The average of the four individual scores and was taken. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

    <description>Patients were asked at baseline and end of treatment, to complete the Short Orientation Memory Function Concentration Test as a measure of cognitive function. The minimum score is 0 and maximum of 28 which denoted good cognitive function .
A negative value from baseline indicates a deterioration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spitzer Quality of Life Index Score at the End of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 51 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index questionnaire consists of five sections, relating to activity, daily living, health, support and outlook. Each section has three choices (numbered 1, 2 and 3) and the patient is required to choose the one that best describes their quality of life during the last week. Choice 1 is scored 2, choice 2 is scored 1 and choice 3 is scored 0. The total Spitzer is the unweighted sum of the five scores. The scale is 0 (bad) to 10 (good). A positive value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). A negative value indicates an improvement in worst pain score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Central Neuropathic Pain 11-Point Numerical Rating Scale Scores at the End of Treatment (up to 51 Days).</title>
        <description>The Central Neuropathic Pain Numerical Rating Scale score was recorded three times daily, in the morning (on waking), at lunchtime and in the evening using the scale, 0 = ‘No Pain’ and 10 = ‘Worst Possible Pain’. Patients were instructed to relate ‘No Pain’ to the time before the start of their spinal cord injury. End of Treatment was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study or the mean of the last three days if the subject withdrew. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Spitzer Quality of Life Index Score at the End of Treatment</title>
        <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index questionnaire consists of five sections, relating to activity, daily living, health, support and outlook. Each section has three choices (numbered 1, 2 and 3) and the patient is required to choose the one that best describes their quality of life during the last week. Choice 1 is scored 2, choice 2 is scored 1 and choice 3 is scored 0. The total Spitzer is the unweighted sum of the five scores. The scale is 0 (bad) to 10 (good). A positive value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items(range 0-10). A negative value indicates an improvement in worst pain score from baseline.</description>
