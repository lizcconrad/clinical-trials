  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK2245035 is a highly selective Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist that stimulates
      preferentially the induction of type I interferons. Intranasal (i.n.) administration of
      GSK2245035 in humans causes immune changes in the upper airways milieu that may alter
      bystander immune responsiveness to aeroallergens and contribute to reduction of allergic
      reactivity in subjects with respiratory allergies. The purpose of this study is to examine
      the safety and pharmacodynamics (PD) of repeat dosing with i.n. GSK2245035 in subjects with
      respiratory allergies. The safety and pharmacodynamic response of four weekly administrations
      of escalating doses of i.n. GSK2245035 will be investigated and the maximum tolerated dose
      will be established. The study will be conducted in patients with symptomatic allergic
      rhinitis and mild asthma. The overall duration of the study will be up to a maximum of
      approximately 122 days considering 90 days screening period, 22 days treatment period and 10
      days follow-up period.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Good general health, as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based
             on a medical evaluation, including medical history, physical examination, laboratory
             tests and cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory
             parameters outside the reference range for the population being studied may be
             included only if the investigator agrees that the finding is unlikely to introduce
             additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.

          -  Males between 18 and 62 years of age inclusive.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one of
             the contraception methods listed in the protocol. This criterion must be followed from
             the time of the first dose of study medication until four days after the last dosing.

          -  Females between 18 and 62 years of age inclusive, if they are of non-childbearing
             potential, defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy, or postmenopausal, defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea (in
             questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
             greater than 40 MlU/ml and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 147 pmol/L) is
             confirmatory). Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods in the
             protocol if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should elapse between the
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.

          -  Body weight greater than and equal to 50 kilogram (kg) and body mass index (BMI)
             within the range 19 - 35 kg/meter square (m^2) (inclusive).

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          -  Available to complete all required study measurements.

          -  Documented history of Symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and mild asthma driven
             by house dust mite (HDM) for more than 3 years, that does not require regular use of
             inhaled steroids. Subjects with symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and mild
             asthma driven by house dust mite (HDM) will need to have a positive skin allergy test
             (wheal ≥ 3 millimeter [mm]) or RAST (≥ class 2) to house dust mite allergens.
             (However, an allergen radio allergosorbent test [RAST] or skin test can be omitted if
             a subject provides clear evidence confirmed by a physician of an analogous positive
             test within the last 3 years).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of immunological disorders or other diseases (including, but not limited to,
             malignancy, cardiovascular, gastro-intestinal, hepatic, renal, haematological,
             neurological, endocrine or pulmonary disease) that in the opinion of the investigator
             and GSK medical monitor may pose additional risk factors

          -  Nasal conditions that according to the opinion of the investigator may affect the
             outcome of the study, i.e. nasal septal perforation, nasal polyps, other nasal
             malformations or history of frequent nosebleeds.

          -  Respiratory tract infection within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody

          -  A positive screening or pre-dose drug/alcohol screen

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as: an
             average weekly intake of greater than 14 drinks for males or greater than 7 drinks for
             females. One drink is equivalent to 12 grams (g) of alcohol: 12 ounces (360 millileter
             [mL]) of beer, 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of 80 proof distilled
             spirits.

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with receipt of an investigational product within 3
             months prior to the first dosing day.

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 6 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  History of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             medical monitor, contraindicates participation in this study.

          -  Donation of blood or blood products in excess of 500 mL within a 56-day period.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia

          -  Subject is mentally or legally incapacitated.

          -  History of severe asthma

          -  Serious asthma exacerbation requiring hospital visit and/ or treatment with oral
             steroids or high doses of inhaled steroids within 6 weeks prior to screening

          -  History of treatment with allergen-specific immunotherapy

          -  Pre-bronchodilator FEV1 less than and equal to 70% of predicted at screening

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including vitamins, herbal and dietary
             supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or 14 days if the drug is a
             potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to first dosing,
             unless in the opinion of the investigator and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) medical monitor
             the medication will not interfere with the study procedures or compromise subject
             safety. Paracetamol is an exception and will be permitted at daily doses of up to 4 g
             from screening to follow-up. During the dosing visits Paracetamol can be used, if
             needed, only if the investigator allows it.

          -  Subjects using steroid treatment for allergic rhinitis and/or asthma may participate
             in the study if they can remain free of medication throughout the study period
             starting from the following periods of time prior to first dosing: Nasal steroids: 4
             weeks; Oral steroids: 12 weeks; Inhaled steroids: 4 weeks

          -  Subjects using other medications for their allergic rhinitis and/or asthma on an as
             needed basis may participate in the study if they can abstain from: Xanthines
             (including theophylline, but not including caffeine), anticholinergics, cromoglycates,
             leukotriene antagonists, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and longacting inhaled
             beta-agonists from 1 week prior to screening and throughout the study Na; Nasal
