  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency is a rare genetic disease that
      results in changes to certain brain chemicals. These chemicals may affect brain excitability,
      or how likely nerve cells are to turn on. Changes in brain excitability may help to explain
      the symptoms of the disease, including learning and memory problems, seizures, and poor
      balance. A supplement called taurine may help people with SSADH deficiency by working on the
      brain chemical GABA. GABA helps to regulate brain activity. Researchers want to see if
      taurine can help people with SSADH deficiency.

      Objectives:

      - To learn more about how taurine affects the brain in people with SSADH deficiency.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 12 years of age who have SSADH deficiency.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide blood and urine samples. They will also take taurine supplements as part of this
           protocol.

        -  Participants will have two sets of study tests. One set will be given while participants
           are taking taurine. The second will be given when they are not taking it. Each testing
           session will take about 2 days to complete.

        -  Half of the participants will have the &quot;off taurine&quot; testing before starting on the
           taurine supplement. The other half will start taking taurine first, have the &quot;on
           taurine&quot; testing, and have the &quot;off taurine&quot; testing about 3 months after stopping
           taurine. Participants may decide the order in which they will have the testing done.

        -  Participants will have the following tests at the two test visits:

        -  Paper and pencil tests of learning and memory.

        -  Transcranial magnetic stimulation to study the excitability of nerve cells.

        -  Imaging studies to show GABA receptors in the brain and measure their activity.

        -  Electroencephalogram to measure brain waves.

        -  Lumbar puncture to collect spinal fluid.

        -  Participants will be monitored with regular study visits while they receive the taurine
           supplement treatment.

      Objective: To study the physiologic effects of taurine therapy in patients with succinic
      semialdehyde Dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency.

      Study Population: Eighteen children and adults with SSADH deficiency receiving taurine.

      Design: This small open label trial will evaluate the effect of taurine treatment on key
      SSADH biomarkers and neurocognitive performance. Study evaluations will include neurological
      and neuropsychological examinations, positron emission tomography (PET) with 11C-flumazenil
      (FMZ), (optional and only for those over age 18), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
      (optional) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection (optional) to measure gamma-aminobutyric
      acid (GABA) levels, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure cortical
      excitation and inhibition, in patients given taurine for SSADH deficiency.

      The evaluations will be performed twice, on and off therapy.
