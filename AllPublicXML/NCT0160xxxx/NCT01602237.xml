      The study is a follow-up of investigations done in the years 1999-2002 in bakery employees.
      The main purposes are to look at the associations between flour dust exposure and respiratory
      disease, and to find out the best ways to reduce the flour dust levels in the working
      environment.

      Background and Methods:

      Supported by the The Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise (CNBI) Working Environment Fund a
      follow-up study of 184 bakery workers in 5 bakeries was done in 2012, appr. 10 years after a
      similar study in 1999-2002. In addition a cross-sectional study in 2 other bakeries (one
      'bread-factory', and a traditional bakery with three small bake shops) was added.

      Altogether 253 participants, among them 61 former bakery workers, were investigated with use
      of questionnaires, allergy-testing (skin prick testing, and blood samples for specific IgE
      and total IgE), spirometry with reversibility testing, exhaled NO-measurement, and nasal
      measurements.

      As in 1999-2002 an extensive exposure assessment was performed including personal samples of
      total dust (Gelman), inhalable dust (PAS6), as well as direct reading measurements of dust
      (Dust Track). A Job Exposure Matrix (JEM) was created enabling each participant to be
      assigned an exposure value of probable mean daily flour-dust exposure based on work-tasks and
      bakery.

      Aim of study:

        -  Follow-up of the participants in the 1999-2002 study, both still active bakery workers
           and former workers, on health-status focusing on respiratory disease, sensitization to
           common and occupational allergens, level of sick-leave and reasons for quitting as a
           baker.

        -  Inclusion of 'new' bakery workers into the cohort as a cross-sectional study, and to
           compare health-status in two cross-sectional cohorts.

        -  To assess personal exposure to flour-dust among workers in 7 bakeries, as part of the
           cross-sectional study described above.

        -  To identify implemented flour-dust exposure reduction measures in bakeries participating
           in 1999-2002, and to assess the potential impact of these measures on the exposure to
           flour dust.
