      The study evaluates degradation of NASHA in breast 4 and 6 years post treatment, long term
      safety and evaluation if a satisfactory breast cancer screening can be performed in subjects
      treated with NASHA-gel in breast. An independent evaluation of the aesthetic changes is also
      performed.
