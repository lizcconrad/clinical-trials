      This clinical trial shall clarify the efficacy and safety of pazopanib in combination with
      weekly topotecan in patients with platinum-resistant or intermediate platinum-sensitive
      recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian and peritoneal carcinoma

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single-arm, open-label, multicenter phase I/II trial. The phase
      I-trial is a dose-escalation trial to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib
      in combination with weekly topotecan. The phase II-trial is a single arm open-label trial to
      further assess the safety and the efficacy of this combination of treatment.
