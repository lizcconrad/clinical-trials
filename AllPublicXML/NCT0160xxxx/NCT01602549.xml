  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric emptying is the end-result of a complex and carefully regulated series of events
      which follow the ingestion of a meal, each of which is dependent on the other and subject to
      neurohormonal control. Motilin is an endogenous peptide, produced mainly in the duodenum,
      whose physiological action is mediated by motilin receptors located on enteric neurons,
      peripheral terminals of the vagus, and on the smooth muscle of the gut. Motilin and
      non-peptide agonists at motilin receptors increases the gastric emptying rate and therefore
      provide a potential approach to the treatment of a range of clinical conditions in which
      delayed gastric emptying is thought to be part of the physiopathology and may be contributory
      to symptoms. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
      characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones. It affects 1.5% of the
      global population over 65 years of age. Cardinal symptoms comprise bradykinesia, rigidity,
      resting tremors and postural instability. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, including
      gastroparesis, is a frequent feature of PD affecting approximately 90% of patients, and is
      caused by autonomic dysfunction as well as an adverse effect of antiparkinsonian drug
      therapy. The therapeutic mainstay for PD treatment is the neutral amino acid
      L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a dopamine prodrug, as it provides the most rapid and
      effective symptomatic control of motor impairment in PD. The primary determinant of L-DOPA
      bioavailability is gastric emptying (GE); delays in GE slow delivery of L-DOPA to its
      proximal small intestinal absorption sites, increasing the extent of presystemic metabolism,
      and leading to slowed and diminished absorption.

      MOT115816 will be conducted as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      study to investigate the ability of the motilin receptor agonist GSK962040 to improve L-DOPA
      pharmacokinetics (PK) by enhancing gastric emptying via motilin receptor agonism. Subjects
      will be randomized to receive 50 mg GSK962040 or placebo in a 2:1 ratio administered orally
      once daily for 7-9 days. The study will consist of a screening/baseline period, a treatment
      period, and a 14-day post treatment safety follow-up visit. During this period participants
      will be asked to attend the study center for 5 visits 3 of which will last approximately 5
      hours. The duration of each patient's participation in the study from screening to follow-up
      visit will be approximately 7-8 weeks. For three of the visits, subjects will visit the
      clinical unit fasted and prior to taking their first morning L-DOPA dose. Volunteers will
      undergo a complete physical (including cardiovascular monitoring (ECG), vital signs, blood
      samples, and medical history), measurement of plasma L-DOPA levels, completion of patient
      diary to capture the amount of awake time (in hours) spent &quot;on&quot; without dyskinesias, &quot;on&quot;
      with troublesome dyskinesias, &quot;on&quot; with non-troublesome dyskinesias, and &quot;off&quot; and gastric
      symptoms, non-motor and motor symptoms assessments (MDS-UPDRS rating scale and &quot;finger taps&quot;)
      and measurement of gastric emptying rate.

    <measure>Gastric Half Emptying Time (GE t1/2) at Baseline (BL), Day 1, and Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric half emptying time is the time taken for half the contents of the stomach to empty. Gastric emptying was measured using the 13C-oral breath test, which is a tracer method that utilizes 13C, a non-radioactive isotope. Basal breath samples were obtained after an overnight fast or otherwise after 4 hours of fasting following a light meal. On Day 1 and Day 8, participants were then dosed with GSK962040 and additional breath test samples were taken prior to administration of a 13C-labelled test meal. The test meal was consumed approximately 80 minutes later. After consumption of the test meal, breath samples were collected at pre-specified time points over an approximately 4 hour period following the test meal. For the duration of the breath test, no food or drink were allowed. The 13C breath content was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GE t1/2 was determined by using the cumulative percentage of the administered dose of 13C excreted in breath over 4 hours.</description>

          -  Unable to refrain from use of prohibited medications listed in Section 9 within the
             restricted timeframe relative to the first dose of study medication.

          -  The patient has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the
             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

        <title>Gastric Half Emptying Time (GE t1/2) at Baseline (BL), Day 1, and Day 8</title>
        <description>Gastric half emptying time is the time taken for half the contents of the stomach to empty. Gastric emptying was measured using the 13C-oral breath test, which is a tracer method that utilizes 13C, a non-radioactive isotope. Basal breath samples were obtained after an overnight fast or otherwise after 4 hours of fasting following a light meal. On Day 1 and Day 8, participants were then dosed with GSK962040 and additional breath test samples were taken prior to administration of a 13C-labelled test meal. The test meal was consumed approximately 80 minutes later. After consumption of the test meal, breath samples were collected at pre-specified time points over an approximately 4 hour period following the test meal. For the duration of the breath test, no food or drink were allowed. The 13C breath content was determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. GE t1/2 was determined by using the cumulative percentage of the administered dose of 13C excreted in breath over 4 hours.</description>

        <description>The MDS-UPDRS is used to assess the status of Parkinson's Disease. It has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination), and Part IV (motor complications). Each part is made up of several questions, with each question given a score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Part I and Part II consist of 13 items each, and have a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 52 (severe). Part III consists of 33 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 132 (severe). Part IV consists of 6 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 24 (severe). The total score is the summed score of all four parts and ranges between 0 (normal) and 260 (severe). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III Scores at Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8 (Pre-dose; 120, 180, and 240 Minutes Post-dose)</title>
        <description>The MDS-UPDRS is used to assess the status of Parkinson's Disease. It has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination), and Part IV (motor complications). Each part is made up of several questions, with each question given a score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Part I and Part II consist of 13 items each, and have a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 52 (severe). Part III consists of 33 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 132 (severe). Part IV consists of 6 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 24 (severe). The total score is the summed score of all four parts and ranges between 0 (normal) and 260 (severe). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

          <title>Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III Scores at Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8 (Pre-dose; 120, 180, and 240 Minutes Post-dose)</title>
          <description>The MDS-UPDRS is used to assess the status of Parkinson's Disease. It has four parts: Part I (non-motor experiences of daily living), Part II (motor experiences of daily living), Part III (motor examination), and Part IV (motor complications). Each part is made up of several questions, with each question given a score ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Part I and Part II consist of 13 items each, and have a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 52 (severe). Part III consists of 33 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 132 (severe). Part IV consists of 6 items, and has a score ranging between 0 (normal) and 24 (severe). The total score is the summed score of all four parts and ranges between 0 (normal) and 260 (severe). A higher score indicates more severe symptoms.</description>

        <title>Number of Times a Participant Could Alternatively Tap Two Counter Keys 30 Centimeters Apart in 1 Minute (Min) at Baseline, Day1, Day 8, and Follow-up</title>
        <description>Participants were asked to alternatively tap two keys 30 centimeters apart in 1 minute in two trials with the most affected hand or the dominant hand in symmetric disease. The finger tapping was scored manually by the study staff. The finger-tapping assessment was repeated at eight separate time points (pre-dose, 0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 180 min, and 240 min post-dose) at each visit (Baseline, Day 1, and Day 8). At each time point, the mean of the two assessments was calculated.</description>
