      There is currently no published algorithm for secondary prevention prognosis of CHD that is
      representative of the England GP-registered population and that includes both symptomatic and
      asymptomatic patients (as identified through primary care). In this paper the investigators
      will exploit routinely collected information in clinical practice to model CHD prognosis
      based on a large contemporary open cohort of stable CAD patients. Although the investigators
      model is based on data from GP practices in England only, the investigators believe that this
      population is sufficiently heterogeneous in terms of ethnic mix, socioeconomic background,
      predisposing characteristics and lifestyles to generate a prognostic model with good
      generalizing power to the wider population.

      Among the research questions the investigators will try to answer is whether established risk
      factors for primary care prevention (smoking, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes) are also
      reliable for risk-stratification of patients who have already developed CAD. Similarly, the
      investigators will examine whether strong predictors of adverse outcomes in ACS patients in
      the short term, such as admission SBP and heart rate, are also associated with their long
      term prognosis.

      Objectives

        1. To use routinely collected primary care and clinical audit (MINAP) data for patients in
           England to develop and validate prognostic models for people with stable CAD.

        2. To identify key prognostic factors for progression to MI or fatal CHD and compare their
           strength among clinically important subgroups.

        3. To estimate the risk distribution to specific time horizons overall and within
           clinically important subgroups.

        4. To use estimates derived from the model to inform subsequent decision models relating to
           e.g. selection of patients for CABG or second-line anti-platelet agents (e.g.
           clopidogrel).

           The outcome of primary interest is fatal CHD &amp; non-fatal MI. As a secondary outcome we
           will model all cause mortality. Incidence for these endpoints will be estimated over a
           period of up to 5 years depending on the quality and availability of follow-up in the
           cohort. We may cautiously extend to other endpoints, including CVD and endpoints that
           reflect symptomatic status (e.g. nitrate use).

           We plan to follow the reporting guidelines set out in the forthcoming work led by Atman
           and Moons.

           Data and methods

           Data sources

           Information will be extracted from the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using
           linked bespoke studies and electronic records) study. CALIBER is a collection of public
           health data repositories, linking the national myocardial infarction register to the
           rich longitudinal primary care record, secondary care data sources and to highly
           phenotyped cohorts in the UCL genetics consortium. Currently, the CALIBER dataset is
           composed by linkage of several datasets:

             -  General Practice Research Database (GPRD)7

             -  Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP)8

             -  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)9

             -  Mortality data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)

           Setting and study population

           Eligible general practices were defined as practices that meet standards for acceptable
           levels of data recording (i.e. audits demonstrated that &quot;at least 95% of relevant
           patient encounters are recorded and data meet quality standards for epidemiological
           research&quot;7), and have consented to linkage with HES and MINAP (approximately 200
           practices).

           To define incident cases we will exclude patients who have not been observed during the
           year prior to their CAD diagnosis date. For prevalent cases we will remove this
           condition.

           Our startpoint population is defined as patients aged 18 years or over diagnosed with
           CAD, under which we include:

             1. patients diagnosed with stable angina

             2. patients with ACS (STEMI, NSTEMI &amp; unstable angina) who survived &gt; 4 weeks.
                Patients with a CAD diagnosis who received revascularization during follow-up will
                enter the cohort after the procedure (given post-procedure survival &gt;4 weeks).

           We will cautiously define broader as well as more specific startpoint populations so as
           to fully exploit the information quantity and richness in the CALIBER data. Thus, we
           will extend our analysis to prevalent CAD cases and to incident cohorts with one of the
           four CAD subtypes (stable angina, unstable angina, STEMI and NSTEMI).

           The study start date will be defined as 1st January 2000, in order to include only those
           patients for whom cause-specific mortality data is potentially available (first linked
           1st January 2001). The study period will end on 20th October, 2009, the last date of
           linkage with ONS mortality data.

           For each patient we will determine the right censor date, which will be the earliest of
           the following dates: date of developing the outcome of interest, the end of study period
           (20 October 2009), date of non-coronary death, date of leaving the practice, or last
           practice data collection date.

           Ethics

           The study uses anonymised dataset from the GPRD, MINAP and HES. The study protocol was
           evaluated and approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC) of the
           Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) (ISAC protocol Nos 07-008 and
           10-106). The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (registration No TBC).

           Explanatory factors considered Initially, we will consider a wide range of risk factors
           and biomarkers that have been implicated in coronary artery syndromes and are broadly
           available at/around the time of a clinical review, including Framingham (&quot;standard&quot;)
           risk factors (age, smoking status, blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes). Because,
           typically, risk factors are not measured concurrently but over a few days around the
           time of diagnosis we will define rules to select 'baseline' measurements and handle
           conflicts in overlapping values between GPRD and MINAP (where these arise).

           Our selection will be drawn from:

             1. demographic, including age at diagnosis, ethnicity and the index of multiple
                deprivation (IMD)

             2. lifestyle, including smoking and alcohol consumption

             3. blood pressure-related, including SBP, DBP, prescription of anti-hypertensives,
                diagnosed hypertension, pulse rate and pulse pressure

             4. lipids-related, including total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides and prescription of
                statins

             5. diabetes-related, including diagnosis of type I or II diabetes, diabetes
                medication, fasting plasma glucose, Hb1Ac and BMI

             6. biomarkers, including creatinine and haemoglobin

             7. Secondary prevention medications (aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, ACE
                inhibitors and beta-blockers)

             8. Previous interventions (PCI and CABG)

             9. CVD severity, including angiographic findings (normal/abnormal left ventricular
                function), CV-coexisting conditions (stroke, peripheral artery disease) previous MI
                and consultation frequency (within the last year)

            10. Non-CV co-morbidities, major chapters included in the Charlson index

            11. For ACS patients we will also consider information specifically recorded in MINAP
                in relation to the hospital episode (acute pulse rate, acute SBP and DBP and
                beta-troponin).

                Treatment of missing values

                Where possible, repeated measurements will be used to replace missing data in the
                baseline record. The approach will be based on a set of rules for transferring
                measurements between different consultations and reconciling measurements from
                different sources that we will develop for the CALIBER project.

                The remaining missing values will be replaced with predicted values under the
                multiple imputation framework, as implemented in the R package 'mice' (version 2).
                This version of 'mice' can handle both missing at random (MAR) and missing not at
                random (MNAR) patterns.

                To identify suitable models for imputing each variable we will take the following
                approach:

                • compute the correlation matrix to select strong predictors for the missing data
                in each variable

                • assess missing data patterns, proportion and covariate distributions

                • identify the strength of association with outcome of interest (fitting a Cox
                model with all variables)

                  -  identify a suitable imputation model and simplify it where possible (but
                     always include standard risk factors and any other predictors we expect to
                     include in the prognostic model based on their clinical importance)

                  -  decide the order in which the variables would be imputed (e.g. in order of
                     decreasing missingness, correlation and/or predictive power).

                All our imputation models will include the outcome of interest (CHD death or
                non-fatal MI) as previously described 10.

                Imputation will form part of variable selection and model estimation as described
                later.

                Variable selection

                We will select our final model based on a combination of approaches including
                statistical performance and clinical feasibility. Our aim is to arrive at a
                generalizable, efficiently estimable model that, at the same time, is sensitive
                enough to capture much of the heterogeneity in the target population.

                We will assess statistical performance in CoxPH models with the outcome(s) of
                interest. Sex will be included as an adjusted or stratifying variable depending on
                whether or not the proportional hazards (PH) assumption is satisfied.

                It is possible that patients from different practices differ in their underlying
                risk (e.g. due to regional variations in case-mix). Hence, we will test the PH
                assumption with respect to sex-specific baseline hazards of the GP practices in the
                data. If the PH assumption is violated we will estimate Cox models within each
                practice and combine coefficients by random effects meta-analysis. If the PH
                assumption is satisfied we will assume the same baseline hazard across practices
                and indicate the clustered patients (in the same GP practice) in the model to
                estimate robust variances.

                We will choose the timescale for the Cox models based on preliminary analysis
                exploring two alternatives, age-at-risk or time to event/censoring. Our choice will
                be based largely on the age-spread of diagnosis and cases in the cohort and which
                timescale is more likely to have fewer PH violations.

                In step 1 we will explore univariate associations between each candidate predictor
                and the primary endpoint in terms of the strength and shape of association and
                evaluate plausible interactions with age, time and sex. Where the shape differs
                significantly from linearity we will consider more flexible modelling, such as
                using restricted-cubic splines. Proportional hazards will be assessed by examining
                Schoenfield residuals. Variables with low statistical significance will not be
                considered further unless there are strong clinical reasons.

                In step 2 we will follow a data-driven approach to identify important variables
                among those retained from step 1 in a multivariate context. For this we will use
                stepwise regression, as implemented in the fastbw function in the 'rms' R package
                (ref), forcing into all candidate models the standard risk factors. We will apply
                the algorithm separately for each panel of candidate predictors, e.g. blood
                pressure variables, CVD severity etc so as to ensure that at least 1 predictor from
                each group is represented in the final model. As a general rule p&gt;0.1 and lack of
                strong association in the univariate setting will be considered evidence for
                exclusion.

                The steps above will be coupled with multiple imputation, as previously
                recommended11, using an efficient and unbiased approach among the options proposed
                for the problem at hand. Final selection will be based on assessing several
                candidate models with similar statistical performance using other criteria, such as
                the proportion of non-imputed data, measurement reliability, clinical feasibility
                and clinicians' advice.

                Once variables to be included in the model have been selected we will update
                imputation models (where necessary) to include these variables. Not doing so could
                bias associations to null12.

                Estimation

                Estimation of coefficients and risks needs to incorporate three types of
                uncertainty:

                • Uncertainty due to imputation of missing data (dealt with by incorporating
                between-imputation variation)

                • Uncertainty in the estimation of model parameters (dealt with by
                cross-validation)

                  -  Sensitivity to data sample (dealt with by bootstrapping the data)

                To perform 10-fold cross-validation the data will be randomly divided into 10
                subgroups. The risks for individuals in subgroup q will be estimated by fitting the
                Cox model to all subgroups except subgroup q. Repeating this for each subgroup
                q=1,..,10 yields predicted risks for all individuals. As a sensitivity analysis we
                will repeat the cross-validation procedure splitting by GP-practice instead of
                randomly across all practices.

                Estimation will proceed as follows:

                  1. All predictors selected to be in the final model that have missing data will
                     be imputed based on the imputation models selected in earlier steps.

                  2. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for the endpoint of
                     interest treating non-CHD deaths as censored observations.

                  3. CoxPH models will be fitted (with cross-validation) for non-CHD treating MI
                     and fatal CHD as censored observations.

                  4. Risks will be estimated for each individual adjusting for non-CHD mortality
                     based on the cause-specific Cox models and the formula described by
                     Kalbfleisch &amp; Prentice13.

                  5. Standard errors will be obtained by repeating steps 2 to 4 on a suitable
                     number (200) of bootstrap samples.

                  6. The procedure will be repeated from step 1 for another 4 rounds of imputation
                     to obtain the between imputation variance.

                  7. Estimates will be combined using Rubin's rules. Evaluation Most standard
                     methods for model evaluation assume absolute risks (not adjusted for competing
                     risks). Because we are dealing with cumulative incidences (i.e. risks adjusted
                     for non-CVD mortality) we will modify evaluation approaches accordingly.

                     • Calibration will be checked by grouping predictions into deciles and
                     computing the mean risk within each decile against the competing
                     risks-adjusted Kaplan-Meier (i.e. cumulative incidence) for that risk group.

                       -  Discrimination will be checked overall and in an age-specific manner
                          using a formulation of the C-index that allows adjusting for competing
                          risks14.

                     Finally, we will compare performance (where possible) with other published
                     risk algorithms, such as GRACE15 and REACH3 that refer to similar starting
                     populations and outcomes. To do this, we will fit models using the set of
                     covariates included in the published algorithms and compare them with our
                     proposed new model. Because no clinically meaningful risk thresholds exist for
                     secondary CHD prevention as yet we will use metrics that do not require risk
                     stratification. Possible examples are the continuous NRI16 and the Brier
                     score.
