      The investigators are attempting to determine if Volume imaging (a new type of ultrasound
      imaging)can accurately diagnose injuries of the muscle ligaments, tendons and bones when
      compared to conventional ultrasound imaging.

    <description>Both ultrasound and volume imaging scans were done on the same day. For all scanned patients, the ultrasound technologist took a volume of images focusing where the patient had symptoms. The study PI reviewed the images, then went back in to do second scan. It took 5 to 10 minutes to complete a conventional ultrasound scan and up to 3 minutes to complete a volume imaging ultrasound scan.</description>
