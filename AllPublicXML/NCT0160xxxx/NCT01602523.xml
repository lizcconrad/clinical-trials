      This study will look at the effects of the drug Symbicort on sleep quality. Symbicort is an
      inhaled medication that contains 2 drugs. One is a medication that opens up the airways
      (formoterol). The other is a steroid to decrease airway inflammation (budesonide). Symbicort
      is not an experimental medication. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use
      in patients with emphysema. Patients with severe emphysema commonly sleep poorly. The cause
      of poor sleep in these patients is unknown. Symbicort may improve sleep quality by opening
      the airways and reducing lung inflammation. It is not known for sure if these effects
      actually improve sleep and quality of life. It is hoped that this study will answer this
      question.

    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed quantitatively by polysomnogram and include measurement of sleep efficiency (total sleep time/time in bed), total sleep time, and arousal index during the night. Subjective sleep quality and assessment of daytime function will be measured using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS), respectively.</description>
