      To assess the bioavailability of dexpramipexole when mixed in soft food and water, and in
      intact tablet form in the fasted and fed states in healthy volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The effect of food on dexpramipexole bioavailability following administration of the proposed
      commercial formulation (capsule-shaped tablet) at the anticipated therapeutic dose (150 mg
      twice daily) has not been studied. Therefore, this study has been designed to evaluate the
      effect of a standard high-fat, high-calorie meal on dexpramipexole bioavailability following
      administration of a single 150 mg dose in healthy volunteers, consistent with US Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendations.

      Additionally, patients with ALS can have difficulty swallowing tablets, necessitating
      alternative methods of administration for the drug. Therefore, this study has also been
      designed to evaluate the bioavailability of dexpramipexole mixed with water or crushed in
      soft food (applesauce).
