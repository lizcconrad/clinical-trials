    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of rapid evaluation and
      administration of ophthalmic Timolol maleate in the treatment of non-arteritic anterior
      ischemic optic neuropathy. Secondary goals are to evaluate if such treatment reduces the
      progression or improves recovery of patients who are randomly assigned to treatment versus
      standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) currently has no widely accepted
      acute treatment to improve recovery or prevent progression in the first month. It causes
      monocular vision loss with potential second eye involvement in 15% at 5 years. This leads to
      significant disability. It is the most common acute optic neuropathy in patients over 55
      years of age. The final mechanism of injury is believed to be ischemic. Increasing perfusion
      of the optic nerve may reduce damage and prevent progression. Reduction in intraocular
      pressure has been shown to increase optic disc perfusion in animal models. Timolol maleate is
      a widely used medication for Glaucoma that reduces intraocular pressure. Treatment with
      Timolol maleate may improve optic disc perfusion in NAION and reduce ischemic damage from
      this condition. This study aims to enroll and treat patients with Timolol maleate 0.5% within
      48 hours of symptom onset to assess feasibility of the study design and potential benefit of
      rapid intraocular pressure reduction.
