  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In these prospective observational study, the investigators are trying to evaluate (1) the
      influence of body-mass index on spinal anesthetic outcome and (2) the determinants on spinal
      anesthetic outcome by logistic regression analysis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the spread of spinal anesthetic drug is unpredictable, patients factors (age,
      gender, height,weight, body-mass index), spinal anatomy, anesthetic drug dose, and
      lumbosacral cerebrospinal fluid volume are known to be the determinants of sensory block
      level. Among these determinants, the influence of body-mass index (BMI) on spinal anesthesia
      is controversial, and there is no specific guideline showing the relative priority of these
      determinants.

      Therefore, in these prospective observational study, the investigators are trying to evaluate
      (1) the influence of body-mass index on spinal anesthetic outcome and (2) the relative
      influence of these determinants on spinal anesthetic outcome by logistic regression analysis.

    <description>when (1) a bilateral T12 sensory block to pinprick within 15 minutes of intrathecal drug administration with sensory/motor block scale ≥ 2 and (2) the level of sensory block at the end of surgery was higher than or equal to T12 with sensory/motor block scale ≥ 2.</description>

    <description>Spinal anesthesia block level as determined by Pinprick sensory test with Bromage scale.
Sensory 0 = an ability to appreciate a pinprick as sharp; 1 = perception of a pinprick as less sharp than in unblocked areas; 2 = perception of a pinprick as touch but not sharp (analgesia); 3 = an inability to feel pinprick(anesthesia).
Bromage Scale 0 = ability to lift an extended knee at the hip; 1 = ability to flex the knee but not to lift an extended leg; 2 = ability to flex toes only; 3 = inability to move.</description>
