  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are doing this research study to see if tocilizumab (Actemra) is safe and
      effective when used for severe or refractory non-infectious uveitis. Uveitis is an
      inflammation of the eye that is caused by the body's immune system reacting against the eye
      tissues.

          -  Failure to respond to methotrexate or at least one other systemic immunosuppressive or
             intolerance to such medications due to side effects. Failure to respond includes
             presence of one plus or greater anterior chamber cell in both eyes; need for topical
             corticosteroid four times or more in either eye; ocular hypertension or glaucoma
             attributable to the topical corticosteroid.

          -  Subjects with bilateral disease.

          -  If subjects are on oral corticosteroids, the dosage must be stable for 2 weeks prior
             to baseline and not exceed 10 mg per day or 2mg/kg/day (whichever is less) of
             prednisone or its equivalent. Subjects must be willing to agree to not alter the
             dosage of oral steroids during the first 16 weeks of the trial.

          -  Must have a chest radiograph within 3 months prior to enrollment with no evidence of
             malignancy, infection or fibrosis.

          -  Parent or guardian must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form.

          -  Pediatric subjects of either gender 2-17 years at time of consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability of parent or guardian to provide voluntary consent

             surgery within 12 months following randomization.

          -  Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, which places the
             subject at unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study or confounds
             the ability to interpret data from the study

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Current liver disease, as determined by the Principal Investigator on the basis of
             history or serum studies

             monoclonal antibodies including tocilizumab.

          -  Evidence of significant uncontrolled concomitant diseases such as nervous system,
             renal, hepatic (patients with prior history of ALT elevation will not be excluded),
             endocrine, or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, which in the Investigator's opinion,
             would preclude patient participation.

          -  Uncontrolled disease states, such as asthma, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease
             where flares are commonly treated with oral or parenteral corticosteroids.

          -  Any major episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV
             antibiotics within 4 weeks of screening or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to
             screening

          -  History of active mycobacterial infection with any species (including Mycobacterium
             tuberculosis) within 2 years prior to screening visit. Subjects with Mycobacterium
             tuberculosis infection more than 2 years prior to screening visit are allowed if
             successful treatment was completed at least 2 years prior to randomization and is
             documented and available for verification.

          -  Immunization with a live/attenuated vaccine within 4 weeks prior to baseline

          -  Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as indicated by a positive Purified
             Protein Derivative [PPD] skin test. Subjects with a positive PPD skin test and
             documented completion of treatment for latent TB are eligible. Subjects with a
             positive PPD skin test and not treated or no documentation of completion of treatment
             are ineligible.

          -  If QuantiFERON® test is performed instead of the PPD test, only those with a negative
             QuantiFERON® test are allowed in the study.

          -  History of incompletely treated Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as indicated by

               -  Subject's medical records documenting incomplete treatment for Mycobacterium
                  tuberculosis

             years) or recurrent viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infections (including but
             not limited to atypical mycobacterial disease, hepatitis B and C, and herpes zoster,
             but excluding fungal infections of the nail beds)
