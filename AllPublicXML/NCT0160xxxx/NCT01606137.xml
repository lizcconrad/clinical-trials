      Subjects who had previously received GW-1000-02 in a GW study who opted to continue using it
      in the long-term were monitored for ongoing tolerability and evidence of clinical benefit.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who had previously participated in a placebo controlled GW clinical study were
      screened and if eligible began dosing with GW-1000-02. Subjects were reviewed for
      tolerability and evidence of clinical benefit at weeks two and four and then every eight
      weeks. Subjects self-titrated to symptom resolution or maximum tolerated/allowable dose of
      130 mg THC and 120 mg CBD.
