  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare, in healthy women, the adipose tissue composition
      between abdomen and thigh and then determine whether differences exist independently of the
      state of obesity.

      The findings of this study may help to explain the mechanism contributing to a beneficial
      role of gluteo-femoral fat contrasting with a deleterious role of abdominal fat on
      cardiovascular and metabolic dysfunctions.
