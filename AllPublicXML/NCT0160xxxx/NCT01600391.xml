  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given that visual information comprises one of the most important and salient sources of
      information used during walking, that visual cues have been shown to be more effective than
      auditory cues in triggering gait adjustments and that stroke survivors have been reported to
      become more dependent on visual cues, the investigators hypothesize that visual cues would be
      more effective in triggering gait recovery and adaptability following stroke than
      interventions not including visual cues.

      The investigators will integrate visual cues with walking and turning practice, and contrast
      this intervention to routine overground walking practice. Stroke participants recruited from
      NHS stroke rehabilitation clinics in the West Midlands, will be randomized to one of three
      gait rehabilitation groups. Each group will receive the same frequency and duration of
      treatment delivered by qualified physiotherapists. Overground visual cue training (OVCT) and
      usual care (UC) groups will be treated in participating NHS sites. Treadmill training with
      visual cues (TVCT) will take place at the University of Birmingham.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The gait of many stroke patients remains impoverished and characterized by impairments
      including asymmetries in propulsive forces between the paretic and non-paretic limbs, step
      lengths, widths and stance and swing phase durations. Currently there is insufficient
      evidence that current rehabilitation strategies improve walking in people who are more than 6
      months post-stroke.

      The purpose of the trial is to determine the necessary information on which to base a future
      definitive trial examining the effectiveness of visual cues for gait training following
      stroke in contrast to conventional over-ground walking practice.

      The study will determine the numbers of patients willing to be recruited into both control
      and VCT groups; the willingness of physiotherapists at each collaborating site to enroll
      patients to usual care OVCT and TVCT groups.

      It will determine the numbers of patients who do not complete the allocated treatment, thus
      dropping out of the study, and the reasons for dropping out.

      The knowledge gathered about recruitment, outcomes and drop-out rates will determine sample
      size for a subsequent definitive trial.

      The study will also measure completeness of outcome data, i.e. percentage of patients with no
      missing values in outcome assessments.
