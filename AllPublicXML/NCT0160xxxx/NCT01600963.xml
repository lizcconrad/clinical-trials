  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to provide safety and efficacy data for TMC207 and to
      demonstrate that TMC207 added to a background regimen (BR) is superior to treatment with the
      BR plus placebo.

      This is a randomized (individuals will be assigned by chance to study treatments),
      double-blind (individual and investigator will not know the identity of study treatments),
      placebo (substance containing no active medication)-controlled, 2-arm study in patients with
      sputum smear-positive pulmonary infection with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
      defined as tuberculosis (TB) due to infection with a strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
      tuberculosis) that is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin, or pre-extensively drug
      resistant (pre-XDR-TB) defined as TB due to infection with an MDR strain of M. tuberculosis
      that is resistant either to at least one of the injectable second-line drugs [amikacin,
      kanamycin, or capreomycin] or to any fluoroquinolone, but not both). Approximately 600
      patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary infection with MDR-TB or pre-XDR TB will
      receive a background regimen (BR) of MDR-TB therapy and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1
      ratio to one of 2 treatment arms (Arms A [TMC207 + BR] and B [placebo + BR]). All patients
      will receive TMC207 or placebo in combination with a BR of MDR-TB therapy. TMC207 (or
      matching placebo) will be taken as oral tablets at a once daily dose of 400 mg for the first
      2 weeks and 200 mg 3 times/week for the remaining period of TMC207 (or matching placebo)
      administration. The study will consist of a screening phase of a maximum of 3 weeks, a
      36-week double-blind treatment phase, followed by a 48-week follow-up phase up to Week 84,
      also referred to as the treatment-free follow-up. After the treatment-free follow-up phase,
      there will be a safety follow-up phase of 48 weeks up to Week 132. Patients from Arms A or B
      who fail treatment according to prespecified criteria will be given the option to receive 24
      weeks of TMC207 plus an individualized salvage regimen taken for a duration consistent with
      national TB guidelines. Efficacy and pharmacokinetic evaluations will be performed at time
      points as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>Cure is defined as an multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patient who has completed the study procedures according to the protocol and has at least five consecutive negative cultures from samples collected at least 30 days apart in the final 12 months of the study. If only one positive culture is reported during that time, a patient may still be considered cured, provided that this positive culture is followed by a minimum of 3 consecutive negative cultures taken at least 30 days apart. Treatment failure is defined as a patient who completed the study procedures and was not cured as per the &quot;Cure&quot; definition based on the WHO classification during the study procedures. Defaults is defined as patients who discontinued study procedures for any reason. Treatment completed is defined as an MDR-TB patient who has completed the study procedures but does not meet the definition for cure or treatment failure due to lack of bacteriologic results.</description>

          -  Has known infection with extensively drug resistant tuberculosis isolate

          -  Has a clinically significant active medical condition such as, but not limited to,
             hepatic, pancreatic, renal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, hematologic, neurologic,
             locomotor, immunologic, ophthalmologic (e.g., corneal opacification or ulcers,
             uveitis, chorioretinitis), metabolic (except stable diabetes based on the
             investigator's judgement), endocrine, oncological disease, muscular disease (e.g.,
             myositis, rhabdomyolysis), or psychiatric, dermatological illness, or any other
             illness that the investigator considers should exclude the patient or that could
             interfere with the interpretation of the study results. Eligibility of patients with
             poorly controlled diabetes as indicated by hemoglobin A1c higher than the normal range
             at screening should be based on the investigators judgment
