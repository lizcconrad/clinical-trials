  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have been shown to be more specific and sensitive for
      the detection of tuberculosis (latent or active infection) than the tuberculin skin test
      (TST) in immunocompetent individuals. However, very little data are available concerning the
      relative performance of IGRA and TST in immunosuppressed individuals from other causes than
      HIV.

      The investigators hypothesize that IGRAs would be more sensitive and specific than the TST in
      a group of renal transplant recipients under chronic immunosuppressive treatment for
      detecting latent tuberculosis infection.

      In a recent study (Triverio PA et al. &quot;Interferon-gamma release assays versus tuberculin skin
      testing for detection of latent tuberculosis in haemodialysis patients&quot;. Nephrol Dial
      Transplant 2009; 24: 1952-6), the investigators had compared 2 IGRAs (T-SPOT.TB and
      Quantiferon Gold) with the TST and shown that one IGRA was clearly more sensitive than the
      TST but that both tests had a very low sensitivity for detecting prior TB.

      This study applies the same protocol to renal transplant recipients undergoing routine annual
      check-up visits: questionnaire with detailed collection of risk factors for latent
      tuberculosis infection (LTBI), history of prior contact with tuberculosis (TB), BCG (Bacille
      of Calmette and Guerin vaccine), prior TB or LTBI, treatment for TB or LTBI, analysis of
      chest X-ray for signs of prior TB, on-going treatment, level of immunosuppression (CD4
      lymphocytes), simultaneous blood sampling for T-SPOT.TB and Quantiferon Gold, and tuberculin
      skin testing.
