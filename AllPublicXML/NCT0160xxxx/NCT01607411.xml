  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery of Test Dentifrices Relative to Placebo Dentifrice</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Surface microhardness recovery (SMHR) test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first demineralization challenge (D1) using formula: [(D1-R)/ (D1-B)]*100.</description>

    <measure>Percent Net Acid Resistance (%NAR) of Enamel Specimens</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in mineral content of enamel specimens exposed to dietary erosive challenge were determined by measuring the length of the indentations. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NAR which compared the indentations values of sound enamel specimens at baseline (B), first demineralization challenge (D1) and second demineralization challenge (D2). Percent NAR was calculated by formula: [(D1-D2)/ (D1-B)]*100.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Enamel Fluoride Uptake</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 4 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Enamel fluoride uptake was determined using the microdrill enamel biopsy technique. The amount of fluoride uptake by enamel was calculated based on amount of F divided by volume of the enamel cores and expressed as micrograms (Î¼g)* F/centimeters(cm)^2. Difference between treatments was calculated with respect to F uptake by enamel.</description>

        <title>Percentage Surface Microhardness Recovery of Test Dentifrices Relative to Placebo Dentifrice</title>
        <description>Surface microhardness recovery (SMHR) test was used to assess the changes in mineralization status of enamel specimens using a Wilson 2100 Hardness tester. SMHR was determined by measuring the length of the indentations of enamel specimens. An increase in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates softening while decrease in the indentation length represents rehardening of enamel surface. Percent SMHR was calculated from indentation values of enamel specimens at baseline (B), after in-situ hardening (R) and after first demineralization challenge (D1) using formula: [(D1-R)/ (D1-B)]*100.</description>

        <population>Per Protocol (PP) Population: All randomized participants who received at least one study product, had one efficacy assessment and did not have any protocol violations deemed to affect efficacy.

        <title>Percent Net Acid Resistance (%NAR) of Enamel Specimens</title>
        <description>Changes in mineral content of enamel specimens exposed to dietary erosive challenge were determined by measuring the length of the indentations. Decrease in the indentation length compared to the baseline indicates hardening of enamel surface. Enamel specimens were exposed to second erosion challenge to determine NAR which compared the indentations values of sound enamel specimens at baseline (B), first demineralization challenge (D1) and second demineralization challenge (D2). Percent NAR was calculated by formula: [(D1-D2)/ (D1-B)]*100.</description>
