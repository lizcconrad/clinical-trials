  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim this prospective longitudinal observational outcomes study is to compare 18
      month functional outcomes and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients undergoing
      salvage versus amputation following severe distal tibia, ankle and/or foot fractures with
      major soft tissue, bone and/or ankle articular surface loss. Functional outcomes and HRQoL
      will be measured using well established self reported measures, including the Veterans Rand
      Health Survey (VR-12) and the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA).

      Hypothesis 1: As a group, salvage patients with severe distal tibia, ankle and/or foot
      injuries with major soft tissue, bone and/or ankle articular surface loss will have similar
      functional outcomes and HRQoL had they undergone a transtibial amputation (within 6 weeks of
      injury).

      Hypothesis 2: The subgroup of salvage patients who have either (1) a soft tissue injury that
      requires tissue transfer; (2) articular damage requiring arthrodesis of the ankle joint; or
      (3) bone loss at the distal tibia or ankle will have better functional outcomes and HRQoL had
      they undergone a transtibial amputation (within 6 weeks of injury).
