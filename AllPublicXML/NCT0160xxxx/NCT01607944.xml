    <textblock>
      Incretin hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) have insulin secretory effects on the pancreas that are
      glucose dependent. Extrapancreatic effects of incretin hormones are reported, however the
      glucose dependency of these effects have not been examined. In type 2 diabetes, pancreatic
      endocrine function and incretin metabolism are impaired. The investigators hypothesize that
      extrapancreatic effects of incretin hormones are glucose depedent and dysregulated in
      subjects with type 2 diabetes.

      Healthy control subjects and type 2 diabetics will undergo pancreatic clamps. In brief,
      somatostatin will be infused to inhibit pancreatic endocrine function and basal levels of
      insulin, glucagon, and growth hormone will be replace via infusion. Metabolic flux will be
      studied during euglycemic and hyperglycemic stages of the pancreatic clamp. Each subject will
      undergo 3 trials involving the co-infusion of either saline(Control Trial), GLP-1, or GIP.
      Glucose metabolism will be assessed using 13C-glucose stable isotope methodology combined
      with indirect calorimetry and expired breath isotope ratio analysis. Blood flow and
      flow-mediated dilation will be measured using ultrasound Doppler. Skeletal muscle and
      abdominal adipose biopsies will be taken to examine intracellular signalling.
