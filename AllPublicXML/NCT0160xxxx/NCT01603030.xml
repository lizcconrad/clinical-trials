      This is a Unicentric, double-blind, randomized, two-arm, parallel-group study to demonstrate
      the efficacy of moxifloxacin/prednisolone acetate fixed combination compared with individual
      administration of moxifloxacin + acetate Prednisolone Eye drops in Prevention of Post
      Operative Inflammation and Infection in LASIK surgery.

    <description>The primary efficacy variable of this study is the percentage of patients with a score of zero postoperative inflammation (anterior chamber inflammation, ie, presence of cells in the anterior chamber (0-4) in the study on Day 15. The absence of bacterial infection on Day 15 ± 1 will be assumed to demonstrate that the antibacterial agents in the association of moxifloxacin / acetate Prednisolona1% and moxifloxacin + acetate Prednisolona1% Eye drops are equal in antimicrobial effectiveness, and that they acted in a prophylactic manner to prevent of bacterial infection.</description>
