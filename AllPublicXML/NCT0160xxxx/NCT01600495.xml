      The objective of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of Transcutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for pain relief in the early active phase of labor. The research
      will be of type randomized controlled trial, consisting of low-risk nulliparous pregnant
      women admitted to the Reference Center for Women's Health in Ribeirão Preto. Mothers will be
      divided into two groups (the use of lumbosacral TENS) and control (routine maternity) and
      will be evaluated before and after therapy, which corresponds to 30 minutes between 4-5 cm of
      cervical dilation. The evaluation will be performed by numerical category scale, location and
      Pain Diagram McGll Pain Questionnaire (short form). After the delivery will be a
      questionnaire of customer satisfaction.

      Pain in the work appears as a subjective experience of interaction, involving a wide
      individual influences physiological, psychosocial and environmental factors, representing a
      major clinical signs of this phase. Despite presenting an important biological function, is
      now well established the need for their relief, since its persistence is associated with
      detrimental effects for both mother and fetus. Among non-pharmacological resources available,
      the investigators highlight the massage therapy that has shown positive effects in relieving
      pain and promote comfort of the mother. The objective of this research is to evaluate the
      efficacy of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for pain relief in the early
      active phase of labor. The research will be of type randomized controlled trial, consisting
      of low-risk nulliparous pregnant women admitted to the Reference Center for Women's Health in
      Ribeirão Preto. Mothers will be divided into two groups (lumbosacral massage) and control
      (routine maternity) and will be evaluated before and after therapy, which corresponds to 30
      minutes between 4-5 cm of cervical dilation. The evaluation will be performed by numerical
      category scale, location and Pain Diagram McGll Pain Questionnaire (short form). After the
      delivery will be a questionnaire of customer satisfaction. After collecting the data, the
      groups are statistically analyzed using the linear regression model with mixed effects (fixed
      and random), taking into account a value of p &lt;0.05 for statistical significance of 5%.

    <description>To evaluate the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation as a resource for pain relief during the active phase of labor will be used the Visual Analogue Scale.
Visual analogue scale (VAS): this scale, represented by a rule, the patient estimated pain on a scale of 100 mm (at one end labeled &quot;no pain&quot; associated with a score of 0 mm and at the other end &quot;worst pain imagined&quot; with a score 100 mm)</description>

    <description>Consider whether the TENS therapy during the active phase of labor could defer request for analgesia use for pain relief for pregnant women. The cervical dilation indicates the value in centimeters (0-10) of cervical dilation. Assessed on admission and during labor by doctors (according to the routine of the institution), as recorded in medical records.</description>

        <description>To evaluate the Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation as a resource for pain relief during the active phase of labor will be used the Visual Analogue Scale.
Visual analogue scale (VAS): this scale, represented by a rule, the patient estimated pain on a scale of 100 mm (at one end labeled &quot;no pain&quot; associated with a score of 0 mm and at the other end &quot;worst pain imagined&quot; with a score 100 mm)</description>
