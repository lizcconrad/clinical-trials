  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a sharp rise in the rate of coronary heart disease diagnoses and chest pain
      consultations in the 90 days before a first heart attack. There is some evidence that chest
      pain and angina symptoms in this period have a beneficial effect on heart attack outcomes in
      hospital and shortly after discharge. However, the available evidence is lacking in three key
      areas. First it is based on a retrospective patient report of symptoms after the heart attack
      has occurred; this means that patients are required to survive their heart attack and may
      make errors when reporting prior symptoms. Second, evidence for an effect on longer term
      outcomes, and coronary outcomes in particular (e.g. coronary death, further heart attacks)
      are unknown. Third, there is conflicting evidence that these effects might differ by age, in
      men and women, and according to treatment in hospital.

      The investigators hope to address the limitations in the evidence by performing a large,
      prospective study of the occurrence, timing and effect of different types of symptoms and
      disease diagnoses occurring before heart attack.

      The investigators hypothesise that prospectively collected, clinical measures of chest pain
      symptoms and cardiovascular diagnoses in primary care will have a beneficial effect on short
      term coronary mortality and may have a beneficial effect on longer term coronary outcomes.

        The study population is comprised of patients with a first myocardial infarction who are
        registered at those GPRD practices that agreed to the linkage with the MINAP database, and
        whose practices are &quot;up to standard&quot; according to GPRD criteria. Practices taking part in
        the GPRD are chosen to be representative of all UK practices, and 98% of people in the UK
        are registered with a GP. Therefore the GPRD should be a representative sample of the UK
        population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in GPRD practices which are deemed &quot;up to standard&quot; by GPRD criteria will be
             included if their practice agreed to be linked to the MINAP, HES and ONS datasets.

          -  Patients must have at least one year of GPRD &quot;up to standard&quot; registration before the
             date of first MI.

          -  Age over 18.

          -  First myocardial infarction occurring between 1st January 2003 and 31st December 2008,
             as recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics data or the Myocardial Ischaemia
             National Audit Project.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded if they do not fulfil one of the inclusion criteria.
