  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the effect of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy) HBOT (100% oxygen;
      2.0 ATA; 90 minute total exposure) and compare against a hyperbaric sham treatment (HBST)
      (patient's breathing room air; 2.0 ATA; 90 minute exposure) in reducing edema and ecchymosis.
      HBOT will be applied as a single pre-operative and a single post-operative treatment for
      patients undergoing eyelid surgery. Briefly, patients will be exposed to HBOT 2-4 hours prior
      to undergoing surgery, 2-4 hours post-surgery and healing will be assessed at day 3, 10, 21,
      30 &amp; 90 days after surgery. Edema and ecchymosis will be assessed in a time series to
      determine the extent that HBOT reduces these clinical signs. The primary null hypothesis to
      test will be that no differences in scores will exist between treatment and control at day 3,
      10 &amp; 21 post-surgery. A secondary null hypothesis to test is the time required to change a
      score will be no different between the two groups.

    <description>We propose to study the effects of two HBOT treatments (one before and one after surgery) with patients who have undergone upper eyelid surgery. Reduction in swelling and bruising will be assessed at 3, 10, 21, 30 and 90 days post-surgery to determine if healing is accelerated by HBOT. Patients that volunteer to participate in this study will be exposed to two treatments of 100% oxygen at 2.0 atmospheres absolute (ATA) or air (sham) 1.2 ATA inside mono-place chambers for 90 minutes. By comparing oxygen treatment groups with a matched control group, we can accurately assess the effectiveness of this treatment for patients. By participating in this study, patients will help in establishing the best treatment practices of using HBOT to accelerate healing and reduce cost in surgical recovery.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients that are able to undergo surgery at the Allure Clinic are capable of
             undergoing exposure to HBOT, as the contraindications of HBOT are similar to eyelid
             surgery, with few exceptions.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will exclude active smokers and those who have quit smoking in the
             last 12 months, those with known lung disease, seizure disorder, congestive heart
             failure, known active cancer, previous treatment with specific chemotherapy agents
             (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Disulfiram, Cis-platinum, Mafenide acetate), those who cannot
             undergo pressurization/ depressurization because of eustachian-tube dysfunction and
             confinement anxiety.
