    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of 3 months use with interactive
      computer game- &quot;My Diabetic Friend&quot;- comparing to conventional diabetes education on
      metabolic control, quality of life and diabetes knowledge.Patients will be randomized into
      two groups- one group will be supplied with interactive computer game, &quot;My Diabetic friend&quot;,
      installed on a computer designed for children's educational needs for a period of three
      months and the other group will be supplied with the same computer without the interactive
      computer game for three months. Metabolic control, quality of life and diabetes knowledge
      will be evaluated before and after the use of the computer.

      The trial is consisting of two main periods: 3 months of the main study period and an
      optional extension period consisting of the following 3 months :

      The study will include two main periods;

        1. Period 1 which will last 3 months, in a randomized controlled manner, this period will
           serve as the main study period to assess the primary and secondary endpoints of the
           study.

        2. Period 2: this extension period will not be an integral part of the study, and only
           patients who are willing will take part at this period, will continue to participate at
           the optional extension period. During the extension period, patients in the intervention
           group will be offered to continue the use of the Computer game -&quot;My diabetic friend) for
           the following 3 months, and patients who participated at the control group during period
           1, will be offered to start to use the Computer Game - &quot;My Diabetic Friend&quot; for the
           following 3 months.
