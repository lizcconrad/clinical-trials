  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized study aims to comparison the effectiveness of intravenous
      lidocaine injection and intraperitoneam lidocaine irrigation on the relief of pain in
      patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      A total of 83 patients will be randomized into one of three groups (group C or group I or
      group P) based on Excel number generation.

      Patients in group C will receive normal saline intravenous injection, and patients in group I
      will receive an intravenous bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine followed by a continuous
      lidocaine infusion of 2 mg/kg/hr.

      Patients in group P will receive intraperitoneal lidocaine irrigation with 3.5 mg/kg
      lidocaine and normal saline 100cc.

      Visual analogue scale pain scores, fentanyl consumption and the frequency at which patients
      pushed the button (FPB) of a patient-controlled analgesia system will be recorded at 2, 4, 8,
      12, 24, 48 hours postoperatively.

    <description>Patients will be assessed for pain using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). It is usually a horizontal line, 100 mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end; left side end which represents 0 is 'No pain', right side end with 100 is 'Very severe pain'. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks.
To check the severity of pain VAS will be measured at post op 2hour.</description>
