  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV associated neurological disorders (HAND), are a major problem even in ART treated people.
      HAND results from chronic inflammation which is largely attributed to expansion and
      activation of monocytes. These activated monocytes, some of which also carry virus to the
      brain, invade the CNS and release cytokines / chemokines resulting in further recruitment of
      monocytes, as well as release viral proteins which injure neurons and cause activation of
      other brain cells. Persistent monocyte/macrophage activation is thus a potential critical
      target for adjunctive therapy to treat or prevent HAND. The investigators therefore propose
      to study the effects of a statin drug (Atorvastatin), which has anti-inflammatory functions,
      on the monocyte activation status in vitro and in ART treated HIV+ individuals.

      The investigators objectives are based on the hypothesis that Atorvastatin treatment will
      reduce the inflammatory and activated phenotype and function of monocytes which have been
      linked to HIV associated neuropathogenesis and occur in HIV infected subjects despite ART. In
      this study the investigators propose to

        1. determine how Atorvastatin modulates monocyte activation, intracellular signaling
           pathways and functions implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND in vitro

        2. define the effect of Atorvastatin on monocyte activation in HIV infected / ART treated
           subjects in a double blind, placebo controlled crossover study

        3. define gene expression patters of monocyte activation before and following statin
           treatment

        4. assess Atorvastatin effects on CNS immune activation markers and neurocognitive function
           in ART treated subjects.
