    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Proof of Concept study is to determine the effects of BYM338 on skeletal
      muscle volume, mass, and strength and patient function (gait speed) in non-demented elderly
      adults with sarcopenia and mobility limitations. In addition, this study will generate data
      on the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of BYM338 in older adults and its response
      on additional physical function measures in this population. Furthermore, the extended study
      duration will provide information on the stability of BYM-induced changes in skeletal muscle
      and patient function in this subgroup of the older population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men or women aged 65 or older with difficulty standing up from a chair or walking for
             longer than 10 minutes on a flat surface or climbing a flight of stairs.

          2. Written informed consent must be obtained before any laboratory or physical assessment
             is performed to establish eligibility. Answering initial questions for qualification,
             whether in person or over the phone does not require written consent.

          3. At the onsite screening, candidates should have gait speed measured over 4 meters of
             &lt;1.0 m/s but ≥0.6 m/s.

          4. Appendicular skeletal muscle index (skeletal muscle in kg/ height in m2) by DXA ≤ 7.25
             kg/m2 for men and ≤ 5.67 kg/m2 for women to be assessed during screening if the gait
             speed criterion in #3 is met.

          5. At screening and baseline, vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and
             pulse rate) will be assessed in the supine position followed by assessment in standing
             within three (3) minutes of changing position. Investigators can be guided by the
             following ranges for the supine measurement and position change:

               -  oral body temperature between 35.0-37.5 °C

               -  systolic blood pressure, 80-160 mm Hg and a reduction of &gt;20mmHg

               -  diastolic blood pressure, 50-90 mm Hg and a reduction of &gt;10mmHg

               -  pulse rate, 50 - 100 bpm

          6. Patients must weigh at least 35 kg to participate in the study, and must have a body
             mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 - 32 kg/m2, inclusive. (See Appendix 4) of
             this protocol for BMI ranges.

          7. Be able to communicate well with the investigator, to understand and comply with the
             requirements of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Use of other investigational drugs at the time of enrollment, or within 30 days or 5
             halflives of enrollment, whichever is longer; or longer if required by local
             regulations, and for any other limitation of participation in an investigational trial
             based on local regulations.

          2. History of hypersensitivity to antibodies.

          3. A history of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may indicate active cardiac disease.

          4. History of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized nonmelanomatous cell
             carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years, regardless of
             whether there is evidence of local recurrence or metastases.

          5. Diseases other than cancer known to cause cachexia or muscle atrophy, including but
             not limited to congestive heart failure of any stage, COPD, chronic kidney disease
             (estimated GFR &lt; 30 mL/min using the MDRD equation), rheumatoid arthritis, primary
             myopathy, stroke, HIV infection, tuberculosis or other chronic infection, uncontrolled
             diabetes mellitus.

          6. Diseases known to cause malabsorption of protein or energy, including inflammatory
             bowel disease, celiac disease, short bowel syndrome, pancreatic insufficiency, etc.

          7. Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests such as
             SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), γ-GT, alkaline phosphatase, or serum bilirubin (except
             Gilbert's

        Disease). The Investigator should be guided by the following criteria:

          -  Any single transaminase listed above may not exceed 3x upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 x ULN, total bilirubin
             should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any case,
             serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL (27 μmol/L). 8. Use of any
             prescription drugs known to affect muscle mass, including androgen supplements,
             anti-androgens (such as LHRH agonists), anti-estrogens (tamoxifen, etc.) recombinant
             human growth hormone (rhGH), insulin, oral beta agonists, megestrol acetate,
             dronabinol, etc. 9. Donation or loss of 400 mL or more of blood within eight (8) weeks
             prior to initial dosing, or longer if required by local regulation. 10. Plasma
             donation (&gt; 250 mL) within 14 days prior to first dosing. 11. Hemoglobin concentration
             below 11.0 g/dL at screening. 12. Significant illness within two (2) weeks prior to
             initial dosing. 13. Patients with known claustrophobia, presence of pacemaker and/or
             ferromagnetic material in their body that would prohibit administration of MRI
