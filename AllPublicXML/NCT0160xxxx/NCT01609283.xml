      The purpose of this study is to determine determine the safety of intraspinal delivery of

      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) using a dose-escalation study.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of intrathecal delivery of
      autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with
      ALS using a dose-escalation study. The trial will include 25 adult, non-ventilator-dependent
      patients with clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated
      from adipose tissue, expanded ex vivo and then, after ~8 weeks, intrathecal (IT) autologous
      delivery of MSCs will be performed. There will be 5 treatment groups of up to 5 patients
      each. Groups 1, 2, and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2
      doses of cells separated by 1 month. Groups will be completed sequentially so that patients
      will not be enrolled into the next treatment group until at least 3 patients in the preceding
      group have completed the treatment and 1 month of additional observation without significant
      toxicity. All patients will be followed on a regular basis until death or for a minimum of 2
      years after completion of the final infusion. Initial clinical follow-up will be weekly with
      scheduled blood, CSF and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations. After 1 month,
      patients will have clinical evaluations at 3 month intervals, or earlier if indicated by
      clinical status.

      Addendum: Five subjects from the Group 5 dosing level will received additional injections of
      MSCs in an extension of the original study, if tolerated.

    <description>There will be five treatment groups of up to five patients each. Groups 1, 2 and 4 will receive a single dose of cells. Groups 3 and 5 will receive 2 doses of cells separated by one month. Intrathecal injections into new subjects will be timed so that there is a minimum of one week between subject injections. The cell dose per group is as follows:
Group 1: single intrathecal dose of 1 x 107 cells
Group 2: single intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells
Group 3: one intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells followed one month later by a second intrathecal dose of 5 x 107 cells
Group 4: single intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells
Group 5: one intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells followed one month later by a second intrathecal dose of 1 x 108 cells</description>
