  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to determine anaesthetists ability to locate the right internal jugular
      vein(IJV) and left IJV using a landmark technique. Initially, a questionnaire was completed
      detecting previous user experience. An ultrasound probe, using the midpoint as an 'imaginary
      needle', was placed on the neck of a healthy volunteer and the image recorded. Both
      anaesthetist and volunteer were blinded to the screen until the image was stored.
      Anaesthetists were grouped into senior or junior by the total number of IJV canulation
      experience. The success rate is going to be measured as pass or fail.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesiologists are usually qualified in internal jugular vein canulation by using anatomic
      landmark technique. The anatomy of right IJV and left IJV may differ each other. The
      hypothesis is that the anatomical difference between right and left IJV may give rise to
      false puncture of especially left IJV by using anatomical landmark technique.Although USG is
      available, most of the experienced anesthesiologist does not prefer to use USG for IJV
      canulation due to different reasons.In addition to this anesthesiologists are generally
      preferring right IJV canulation, thus they are inexperienced in left IJV canulation. So
      especially during left IJV canulation,not by anatomical landmark technique but by USG will be
      recommended for anesthesiologists.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>determine the difference between anesthesiologists ability to show left and right internal jugular vein by usg probe (pass/fail)</measure>
    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of operating room stay, an expected average of 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are going to be graded pass/fail according to whether the midline trajectory of the usg probe intersected any part of the lumen of the internal jugular vein. The participating anesthesiologists will show imaginary puncture site for IJV cannulation bilaterally by ultrasonography. The blind investigator will save the ultrasonographic images as jpeg files and another investigator will consider the images.</description>

    <time_frame>participants will be followed for the duration of operating room stay, an expected average of 15 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The participants are going to fulfill a survey asking their experience about IJV canulation. After the survey the anesthesiologists are going to classified as senior/junior. The participants are going to be graded pass/fail according to whether the midline trajectory of the usg probe intersected any part of the lumen of the internal juguler vein.</description>
