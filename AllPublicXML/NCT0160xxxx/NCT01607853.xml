      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-psoriatic effect of Daivobet® gel applied
      then removed after 10 minutes (+/- 2 minutes), Daivobet® gel applied then removed after 20
      minutes (+/- 2 minutes) compared with Daivobet® gel and Daivobet® gel vehicle applied for 24
      hours (+/- 2 hours), using the psoriasis plaque test modified from the method developed by KJ
      Dumas and JR Scholtz.

             and/or results of screening physical examination) which, in the opinion of the

         20. Subjects who are known or, in the opinion of the investigator, are unlikely to comply
             with the Clinical Study Protocol (e.g. alcoholism, drug dependency or psychotic
             state).

         21. Subjects who are in an exclusion period in the National Biomedical Research Register
             of the French Ministry of Health at randomisation.

         22. Subjects under guardianship, hospitalized in a public or private institution, for a
