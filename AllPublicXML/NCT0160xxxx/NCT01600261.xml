      Comparison study to assess photo image quality of a new color fundus camera compared to that
      of a commercially available color fundus camera.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optovue has developed a new color fundus camera for imaging the eye with up to 45 degree
      field of view and without the use of dilating drops. The purpose of the study is to compare
      the image quality of the new camera with that of a commercially available color fundus
      camera. Consented subjects will undergo a general ophthalmic examination and series of fundus
      photography exams using the study device and comparison device. Photo image quality will be
      assessed for determination of clinically usefulness.
