  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators examined the capsule-IOL interaction including anterior and
      posterior capsule adhesion, contact between posterior capsule and the posterior edge of
      intraocular lense (IOL), configuration of capsular bend and the incidence of posterior
      capsular opacity (PCO) between high myopia eyes and emmetropia eyes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      150 eyes of 150 cataract patients scheduled for phacoemulsification surgery were recruited,
      of which 20 eyes were high myopia (AL &gt; 26mm) and 40 eyes were emmetropia (22 &lt; AL &lt; 25mm) as
      control group.High myopia eyes and 20 emmetropia eyes were implanted with the single-piece
      hydrophobic acrylic IOL (Acrysof IQ SN60WF, Alcon laboratories, Inc. IQ group). Another 20
      emmetropia eyes were implanted with the other single-piece hydrophilic acrylic IOL (Akreos
      Adapt, Bausch &amp;Lomb, AO group).80 eyes implanted with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic
      IOL were examined by SSOCT to build the 3-D model of anterior segment.

      Methods: 60 eyes were examined by custom-built UL-OCT at 4 hours, 1 day, 7 day, 14 day, 28
      day, 3 month, 6 month,12 month after surgery.30 eyes implanted with the single-piece
      hydrophobic acrylic IOL were recruited for evaluation of the SSOCT reliability.50 eyes were
      examined by SSOCT at 1 day, 7 day,1 month, 3 months,6 months,12 months after surgery.

      Measures: Contact of the anterior and posterior lens capsule with the IOL optic surface was
      evaluated. Types of capsular bend were described at the last follow-up. The incidence of
      posterior capsular opacity (PCO) was evaluated.

        This prospective study consisted consecutive patients with high axial myopia (myopia group)
        and age-matched patients with normal axial length (control group). All eyes underwent
        uncomplicated phacoemulsification with a single-piece IOL (AcrySof, Alcon) implantation for
        cataract treatment.
