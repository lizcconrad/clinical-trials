  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the current available therapies for opioid-dependent patients, most patients relapse.
      This research project focuses on the development of a novel compound, cannabidiol, to
      modulate opioid craving in humans based on animal models showing its selective effectiveness
      to inhibit drug-seeking behavior. The development of a targeted treatment for opioid relapse
      would be of tremendous medical and public health value.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid abuse is a significant global public health problem. Of the more than one million
      people suffering today from opiate dependency, less than a quarter of such individuals
      receive treatment. Pharmacotherapeutic approaches traditionally have targeted mu opioid
      receptors since heroin and its metabolites bind with highest affinity to this receptor
      subtype. Although such treatment strategies have improved substance abuse outcomes, they do
      not effectively block opiate craving and thus are still associated with high rates of
      relapse. Using a strategy of indirectly regulating neural systems to modulate opioid-related
      behavior, our preclinical rodent studies consistently demonstrated that cannabidiol (CBD), a
      nonpsychoactive component of cannabis, specifically inhibited cue-induced heroin-seeking
      behavior. CBD's selective effect on drug-seeking behavior was pronounced after 24 hrs and
      endured even two weeks after the last drug administration following short-term CBD exposure.
      The fact that drug craving is generally triggered by exposure to conditioned cues suggests
      that CBD might be an effective treatment for heroin craving, specially given its protracted
      impact on behavior. CBD has already been shown in Phase I of our study and in various
      clinical studies to be well tolerated with a wide safety margin in human subjects. CBD thus
      represents a strong candidate for the development as a potential therapeutic agent in humans
      for opioid craving and relapse prevention. It is the goal of this second exploratory phase of
      the project to characterize the effects of CBD administration on cue-induced craving in
      drug-abstinent heroin-dependent subjects using a random double blind design during a
      post-acute (greater than 6 days since last use) heroin withdrawal period. Study participants
      will be administered CBD during 3 test sessions and studied for the effects on cue-induced
      craving during those sessions as well as one week after the final CBD administration on the
      final test day (session 4).

    <measure>Changes in Cue-Induced In-Clinic Craving (From Baseline to Post-cue or Post-neutral - Via the Visual Analog Scale for Craving (VASC)</measure>
    <time_frame>VASC: test visits I, II and IV - baseline 1, post cue (PC), baseline 2, post neutral cue (PN)</time_frame>
    <description>The VASC will be administered to assess potential variations in the subjective craving effects associated with heroin. Following the administration of the investigational drug, craving induced in response to the cue sessions and neutral cue sessions in the clinic will be measured. In this way, changes in craving from baseline (pre-cue to post-cue and pre-neutral cue to post-neutral cue) within each test visit) will be measured and compared. Scale range: 0 (no craving) - 10 (extreme craving).
**For test visits I, II and IV, there will be two cue sessions at each test visit: a neutral cue video (PN) and a drug-related cue video (PC) will be shown in random order at each visit. Before the beginning of each cue session (PN or PC), baseline measures will be taken. The same questionnaires will be administered immediately following the neutral cue video and the drug-related cue video. Thus there will be two sets of baselines and two sets of post cue measurements per test visit for test</description>

    <measure>Changes in Out-of-Clinic Craving (From Pre-Dose to Approximately 6 Hours Post-Dose for Test Visits I and II; and From Pre-Dose Test Visit I to Pre-Cue Test Visit IV) - Via the Heroin Craving Questionnaire (HCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Test I and II: Change from pre-dose to approx. 6 hours post-dose; Change from pre-dose test visit I to pre-cue test visit IV</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to complete the short version of the HCQ on their own time at home and bring it with them when they return for their next visit. Upon arrival to the clinic, subjects will also complete an HCQ with the coordinator to assess daily baseline cravings. This questionnaire will help us assess changes in craving generated outside of the clinical laboratory session from test visit 1 through test visit 4. Scale: 1 (strongly disagree) - 7 (strongly agree). Total Score Range: 14 (less cravings) - 98 (more cravings).
** The baseline measure for this outcome will be measured at the beginning of test session I prior to the administration of CBD/Placebo. Test measures will be taken approximately 6 hours following each dose for test sessions I, II and III. The final measure will be taken at test session IV, at the beginning of the session.</description>

        <title>Changes in Cue-Induced In-Clinic Craving (From Baseline to Post-cue or Post-neutral - Via the Visual Analog Scale for Craving (VASC)</title>
        <description>The VASC will be administered to assess potential variations in the subjective craving effects associated with heroin. Following the administration of the investigational drug, craving induced in response to the cue sessions and neutral cue sessions in the clinic will be measured. In this way, changes in craving from baseline (pre-cue to post-cue and pre-neutral cue to post-neutral cue) within each test visit) will be measured and compared. Scale range: 0 (no craving) - 10 (extreme craving).
**For test visits I, II and IV, there will be two cue sessions at each test visit: a neutral cue video (PN) and a drug-related cue video (PC) will be shown in random order at each visit. Before the beginning of each cue session (PN or PC), baseline measures will be taken. The same questionnaires will be administered immediately following the neutral cue video and the drug-related cue video. Thus there will be two sets of baselines and two sets of post cue measurements per test visit for test</description>

        <description>Subjects will be asked to complete the short version of the HCQ on their own time at home and bring it with them when they return for their next visit. Upon arrival to the clinic, subjects will also complete an HCQ with the coordinator to assess daily baseline cravings. This questionnaire will help us assess changes in craving generated outside of the clinical laboratory session from test visit 1 through test visit 4. Scale: 1 (strongly disagree) - 7 (strongly agree). Total Score Range: 14 (less cravings) - 98 (more cravings).
** The baseline measure for this outcome will be measured at the beginning of test session I prior to the administration of CBD/Placebo. Test measures will be taken approximately 6 hours following each dose for test sessions I, II and III. The final measure will be taken at test session IV, at the beginning of the session.</description>

        <description>Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses. Anxiety will be assessed using a visual analog scale for anxiety (VASA). Scale: 0 (not at all anxious) - 10 (extremely anxious).
**For test visits I, II and IV, there will be two cue sessions at each test visit: a neutral cue video (PN) and a drug-related cue video (PC) will be shown in random order at each visit. Before the beginning of each cue session (PN or PC), baseline measures will be taken for each variable. The same variables will be measured following the neutral cue video and the drug-related cue video. Thus there will be two sets of baselines and two sets of post cue measurements per test visit for test visits I, II and IV.</description>

        <description>Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will allow us to obtain positive and negative affect measures and observe their changes from baseline over the course of the cue-induced craving session. Scale: 0 (only slightly or not at all) - 5 (extremely). Total Score Range for Positive Affect Assessment (PAS): 10 (minimum) – 50 (maximum). Higher score reflects stronger positive affect.

        <title>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) - Negative Affect Schedule (NAS) Data</title>
        <description>Questionnaires will be used to measure subjective responses. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule will allow us to obtain positive and negative affect measures and observe their changes from baseline over the course of the cue-induced craving session. Scale: 0 (only slightly or not at all) - 5 (extremely). Total Score Range for Negative Affect Assessment (NAS): 10 (minimum) – 50 (maximum). Higher score reflects stronger negative affect.
**For test visits I, II and IV, there will be two cue sessions at each test visit: a neutral cue video (PN) and a drug-related cue video (PC) will be shown in random order at each visit. Before the beginning of each cue session (PN or PC), baseline measures will be taken for each variable. The same variables will be measured following the neutral cue video and the drug-related cue video. Thus there will be two sets of baselines and two sets of post cue measurements per test visit for test visits I, II and IV.</description>

        <title>Vital Signs - Temperature</title>
        <description>Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit) will be monitored throughout the time course of the study and changes from baseline will be studied across the various time points.
**For test visits I, II and IV, there will be two cue sessions at each test visit: a neutral cue video (PN) and a drug-related cue video (PC) will be shown in random order at each visit. Before the beginning of each cue session (PN or PC), baseline measures will be taken. Temperature will be measured again following the neutral cue video and the drug-related cue video. Thus there will be two sets of baselines and two sets of post cue measurements per test visit for test visits I, II and IV.</description>
