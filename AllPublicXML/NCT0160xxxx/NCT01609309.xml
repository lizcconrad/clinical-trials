  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection as minimally
           invasive surgery has gained popularity for the treatment of early gastric cancer in East
           Asian countries, even though the long-term follow-up outcome based on multicenter
           randomized clinical trial (RCT) is still awaited.

        -  For the patient with locally advanced gastric cancer, several studies indicated that
           laparoscopic distal subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy is a technically
           feasible and safe procedure by experienced surgeons in high-volume specialized
           hospitals. However, the application of it is controversial mainly due to lack of solid
           evidence on the oncologic efficacy. Therefore, conventional open approach is still the
           current standard for advanced gastric cancer.

        -  Nowadays, the proportion of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer is estimated
           up to 80 per cent of all gastric cancer cases in China. Before the clinical application
           of laparoscopic procedure for the treatment with curative intent to advanced gastric
           cancer located at the middle- or lower-third of the stomach, the oncologic efficacy must
           be verified.

        -  Accordingly,the comparison of intraoperative and postoperative complications between
           laparoscopic and open distal subtotal gastrectomy for over 65 years old patients with
           gastric cancer based on a randomized controlled trial is needed.
