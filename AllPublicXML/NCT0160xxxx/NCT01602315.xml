  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-center, open-label, Phase Ib dose escalation /Phase II study in recurrent or
      metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RM HNSCC) patients considered to be
      resistant, ineligible or intolerant to platinum-based chemotherapy. The Phase Ib included
      three arms. Three different methods of administration and two different BYL719 formulations
      were studied to determine the MTD and/or RP2D of BYL719 in combination with cetuximab:

      Arm A - film-coated whole tablets were orally administered to patients who were able to
      swallow the tablets; Arm B - a drinkable suspension prepared from crushed film-coated tablets
      was administered orally to patients with swallowing dysfunction Arm C - a suspension from a
      dispersible tablet administered via G-tube, in patients with swallowing dysfunction. Arm C
      was used to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), compared to Arm A (film coated tablet),
      and safety of the dispersible tablet of the dispersible tablet formulation of BYL719.

      The Phase II investigated the clinical efficacy of BYL719 and consisted of an open label,
      randomized Phase II part investigating BYL719 in combination with cetuximab compared to
      cetuximab alone in patients resistant or intolerant to platinum and naïve to cetuximab
      (Scheme 1: Arm 1 and Arm 2), and a non-randomized Phase II part Scheme 2: Arm 3. In addition,
      patients who experienced disease progression in Arm 2 (cetuximab) were allowed to switch to
      the combination regimen (cross-over, Arm 2B). The safety of the BYL719 in combination with
      cetuximab was also further characterized in Arms 1, 2B and 3.

      Patients were treated until progression of disease), unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of
      informed consent, whichever occurred first (except for phase II Arm 2 had the opportunity to
      crossover to the combination treatment (Arm 2B). In the follow-up period all patients had to
      complete the safety follow-up assessments within 30 days after the last dose of the study
      treatment. Patients who did not have disease progression at the time of discontinuation of
      study treatment were radiologically followed for disease status until disease progression,
      initiation of subsequent anticancer therapies, or death, whichever occurred first. In
      addition, all patients enrolled in Phase II were followed for survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Patients with histologically/cytologically-confirmed HNSCC

          -  Patients must be resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy, or be ineligible (due to
             medical comorbidities) or intolerant to platinum-based therapy per medical history

          -  For Phase Ib, there is no restriction on the number of prior therapies for recurrent
             or metastatic disease

          -  For Phase II, patients may have received a maximum of 1 prior line of therapy for
             recurrent or metastatic disease

          -  For Phase Ib, prior cetuximab or other EGFR-targeted antibody therapy is allowed
             regardless of the prior treatment settings.

          -  For Phase II, Arms 1 and 2, prior cetuximab or other EGFR-targeted antibody therapy is
             allowed only if administered in the induction setting, or concurrently with radiation
             in the curative setting, with the last dose of cetuximab administered at least 12
             months prior to starting the study treatment. For Arm 3, prior cetuximab must have
             been administered in the curative, recurrent or metastatic disease setting and disease
             progression documented within 9 months of the last dose of cetuximab administered in
             that setting. This regimen (including both platinum and cetuximab) must be the most

      <recruitment_details>45 patients enrolled in Phase Ib, 106 cetuximab naïve patients in Phase II were randomized to either BYL719+cet (N=71) or cet monotherapy (N=35). Of the 35 patients, 16 crossed over to BYL719+cet combo treatment. 29 patients enrolled in the non-randomized combo treatment arm (cet resistant patients). All patients have completed the trial.</recruitment_details>

Dose recommendation was based on posterior summaries including the mean, median, standard deviation, 95%-credibility interval, and the probability that the true DLT rate for each dose combination lies in one of the following categories: (0%, 16%) under-dosing; (16%, 35%) targeted toxicity; (35%, 100%) excessive toxicity. The combination treatment was considered superior to cetuximab alone if the posterior probability (HR &gt; 1) &lt; 10%, and the posterior median HR &lt; 0.7.</description>
