  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, open label study to examine the effect of ezogabine/retigabine on the
      voiding function of adult subjects with drug-resistant partial onset seizures (POS). Subjects
      fulfilling the study entry criteria at Screening and at Baseline including a comprehensive
      eye examination by an ophthalmologist or retina specialist and a skin assessment by the
      investigator will receive ezogabine/retigabine.

      The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine will be 300 mg/day. Subjects will be up titrated by
      150 mg/day weekly up to the maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg (or the
      highest tolerated dose). During the 49 days of the treatment phase, subjects will undergo
      three repeat non-invasive assessments of voiding function. In addition, subjects who meet
      pre-determined criteria for voiding dysfunction will undergo multichannel cystometry in order
      to characterise bladder hypocontractility, bladder outlet obstruction or a combination of
      events which clinically is manifest with difficulty emptying the bladder or acute urinary
      retention.

      At the end of the Treatment Phase, all subjects will enter the Taper Phase, a 3-week down
      titration period. Subjects who have new findings of abnormal pigmentation of the retina,
      unexplained vision loss, pigmentation of non-retinal ocular tissue or discoloration of skin,
      lip, nail, or mucosa since baseline will be asked to enter the Safety Follow-Up /
      Continuation Phase. All subjects will undergo 6-monthly comprehensive eye examinations during
      the Safety Follow-Up / Continuation Phase. Subjects who have not developed abnormal
      discoloration of the skin, lips, nails or mucosa will continue to undergo skin assessments by
      the investigator. Any subject who has developed abnormal discoloration of the skin, lips,
      nails or mucosa since baseline will be referred to a dermatologist for evaluation and
      6-monthly follow up assessments. All subjects will continue to be followed until the
      pigmentation and/or discoloration has resolved or stabilised, as defined by no change over 2
      consecutive 6-monthly assessments conducted over at least 12 months after discontinuation of
      ezogabine/retigabine.

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This was a multicenter, open label study to examine the effect of ezogabine/retigabine added to existing anti-epileptic drugs on the voiding function of adult participants with drug-resistant partial onset seizures (POS). The study was conducted in two countries: United States and France.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>The study was conducted in 5 phases:Screening (Day–30 to Day-2), Baseline (Day-1), treatment (Day1–49), taper-down titration (Day 50–70). A total of 10 participants were enrolled into the study and received at least one dose of the study medication.</pre_assignment_details>

          <title>Ezogabine/Retigabine</title>
          <description>Participants received ezogabine/retigabine tablets orally in three equally divided doses each day with or without food. The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine was 300 milligrams (mg)/day. Participants were to be up titrated by 150 mg/day weekly up to a minimum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg/day. If participants missed one dose or more, it was recommended that they took a single dose as soon as they remember. After taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours were to elapse before the next dose and then the normal dosing schedule was to be resumed. After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Flow Rate (Qmax) at Visit 5.</title>
        <description>Maximum urine flow rate was measured by uroflowmetry test. It is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the speed of urinary flow. Uroflowmetry was assessed at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visits 3, 4 and 5 (Days 21, 35 and 49 respectively). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value at Visit 5. Safety Population was defined as all participants who received more than or equal to one dose of study medication.</description>

        <description>Maximum urine flow rate was measured by uroflowmetry test. It is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the speed of urinary flow. Uroflowmetry was assessed at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visits 3 (Day 21), visit 4 (Day 35), visit 5 (Day 49) and visit 6 (follow-up visit within 14 days after the end-of-treatment eye examination). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Maximum Flow Rate (Qmax) at Visits 3, 4 and 6</title>
          <description>Maximum urine flow rate was measured by uroflowmetry test. It is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the speed of urinary flow. Uroflowmetry was assessed at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visits 3 (Day 21), visit 4 (Day 35), visit 5 (Day 49) and visit 6 (follow-up visit within 14 days after the end-of-treatment eye examination). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine was 300 milligrams (mg)/day. Participants were to be up titrated by 150 mg/day weekly up to a minimum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg/day. If participants missed one dose or more, it was recommended that they took a single dose as soon as they remember. After taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours were to elapse before the next dose and then the normal dosing schedule was to be resumed. After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>

            <description>Participants received ezogabine/retigabine tablets orally in three equally divided doses each day with or without food. The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine was 300 milligrams (mg)/day. Participants were to be up titrated by 150 mg/day weekly up to a minimum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg/day. If participants missed one dose or more, it was recommended that they took a single dose as soon as they remember. After taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours were to elapse before the next dose and then the normal dosing schedule was to be resumed. After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Voided Volume (VV) at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6</title>
          <description>The volume of urine voided was measured by uroflowmetry test. Uroflowmetry was assessed at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visits 3 (Day 21), visit 4 (Day 35), visit 5 (Day 49) and visit 6 (follow-up visit within 14 days after the end-of-treatment eye examination). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Average Flow Rate (Qmean) at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6</title>
        <description>Average flow rate was measured by uroflowmetry test. It is a non-invasive diagnostic test that measures the speed of urinary flow. Uroflowmetry was assessed at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visit 3 (Day 21), visit 4 (Day 35), visit 5 (Day 49) and visit 6 (follow-up visit within 14 days after the end-of-treatment eye examination). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

            <description>Participants received ezogabine/retigabine tablets orally in three equally divided doses each day with or without food. The starting dose of ezogabine/retigabine was 300 milligrams (mg)/day. Participants were to be up titrated by 150 mg/day weekly up to a minimum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 600 mg/day and a maximum ezogabine/retigabine daily dose of 1200 mg/day. If participants missed one dose or more, it was recommended that they took a single dose as soon as they remember. After taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours were to elapse before the next dose and then the normal dosing schedule was to be resumed. After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA SI) at Visits 3, 4, 5 and 6</title>
        <description>The America Urological Association Symptom Index is a 7-item Likert-scored scale describing urinary bladder function. It is the sum of the responses to the 7 AUA symptom questions. Score ranges from 0 to 5 (0=not at all and 5=almost always for questions 1 to 6; 0=None and 5=five times or more for question 7). The total score ranges from 0-35 where higher scores indicate more severe symptoms. It was completed by the investigator at Baseline visit 2 (Day -1) and on visit 3 (Day 21), visit 5 (Day 49) and visit 6 (follow-up visit within 14 days after the end-of-treatment eye examination). Measurement at visit 2 (Day -1) was considered as Baseline value. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the post-baseline value. Only those participants with data available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X in the category titles).</description>

If participants missed one dose or more, it was recommended that they took a single dose as soon as they remember. After taking a missed dose, at least 3 hours were to elapse before the next dose and then the normal dosing schedule was to be resumed. After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>

After Day 22 of treatment, if a participant was unable to tolerate doses of ezogabine/retigabine greater than 600 mg/day, the investigator was able to decrease the dose as appropriate.</description>
