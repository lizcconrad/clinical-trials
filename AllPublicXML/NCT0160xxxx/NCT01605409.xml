    <textblock>
      Cardiac arrest ist associated with a very poor prognosis. Even though resuscitation
      algorithms and postcardiac arrest care have been improved there is an urgent need for
      measures leading to a higher survival rate.

      Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (ECPB - artificial heart and lung outside the patients body)
      is a method which has shown good results in case reports and animal studies for cardiac
      arrest care.

      The study will be performed as comparison between the new treatment option of ECPB versus the
      standard of care treatment.

      Aim of our study is to determine the feasibility of ECPB installed in an emergency department
      to improve the rate of patients restoration of spontaneous circulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Out of hospital cardiac arrest is associated with a poor prognosis. Overall
      survival varies between 3% and 16% respectively. Measures to improve the chance of survival
      are urgently needed. If return of spontaneous circulation under competent cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation (CPR) measures is not achieved within the first 25 minutes the chance of
      survival decreases even further. Emergency Cardiopulmonary Bypass (ECPB) would be such a
      treatment option for these heavily compromised patients, as it has shown considerably good
      results used as resuscitation device for cardiac arrest in animal studies.

      Material and Methods: This study will be performed as single center (university hospital)
      randomized, controlled and prospective pilot study comprising a highly experienced emergency
      department treating about 200 to 300 cardiac arrest patients a year. Two groups will be
      analyzed, a `Standard ACLS´ group and an `ECPB´ group. Each group will comprise 20 patients.
      Eligible are adult patients with witnessed out of hospital cardiac arrest, with presumed
      cardiac cause and without return of spontaneous circulation after a minimum of 15 minutes of
      advanced cardiac life support.

      Patients in the `Standard ACLS´ group will be resuscitated until return of spontaneous
      circulation or termination of efforts. The `ECPB´ group will receive ongoing cardiopulmonary
      resuscitation during transport to the emergency department where ECPB will be installed.
      Necessary diagnostic examinations and therapeutic interventions for both groups will be
      performed according to guidelines for post resuscitation care and good clinical practice.

      Primary outcome measure is the rate of sustained restoration of spontaneous circulation
      according to Utstein criteria. Secondary outcome measures are 24 hours survival, survival to
      ICU discharge, survival to hospital discharge, rate of best neurological recovery (cerebral
      performance category score 1 or 2) within 6 months after cardiac arrest and modified Rankin
      score at 6 months after cardiac arrest.

      Patients in the `Standard ACLS´ group receive standard treatment without any potential
      additional risks. The `ECPB´ group receives standard advanced cardiac life support as well
      and has the predicted advantage of the extracorporeal oxygenation at the emergency department
      and coronary intervention even before return of spontaneous circulation.

      Aim of this study: To compare current standard therapy for patients after out of hospital
      cardiac arrest (cardiopulmonary resuscitation until return of spontaneous circulation or
      termination of efforts) with a new concept of transportation with ongoing cardiopulmonary
      reanimation and installation of ECPB at the Emergency Department to improve survival.

    <description>ACLS provided for 15 minutes by EMS personnel according to current guidelines of the ERC.
CPR during transportation will be performed by EMS personnel according to ERC guidelines.
At the ED cannulation will be performed percutaneously if feasible. The femoral artery will be cannulated with a 17-19 - Fr and the femoral vein will be cannulated simultaneously with heparin coated 19-25 - Fr catheter or a smart cannula. An antegrade 8 - Fr cannula will be placed to supply perfusion for the cannulated leg if feasible. The procedures will be performed ultrasound-guided and the size of the cannulae will be adapted according to vessel size. Correct placement of the venous cannulae will be verified via ultrasound. Cardiopulmonary bypass will be performed by using the Lifebridge(Sorin®) or the Cardiohelp(Maquet®) ECMO device, according to protocol.</description>

Emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (ECMO: lifebridge (Sorin®) or cardiohelp(Maquet®) will be initiated percutaneously ultrasound guided, during CPR efforts at the Emergency department.
Cannulae and tubing in use will be heparin coated. ECMO flow will be set to 70ml/kgBW/min. Anticoagulation will achieved with unfractionated heparin and monitored using ACT.</description>

    <description>Standard ACLS Standard ACLS provided by EMS personnel according to current guidelines of the European resuscitation council.
Transportation:
Transport will be initiated as soon as the patient achieves ROSC in the field and transportation is feasible. All patients will be admitted to the ED at the Vienna general hospital.
Standard Post resuscitation Management:
After admission to the ED post resuscitation care and standardized intensive care treatment will be provided according to Utstein protocol and current standards for good clinical practice and according to ILCOR recommendations. A crossover to the ECPB group is possible, if indicated by good clinical practice. If so, it will be counted as treatment failure in the standard ACLS group.
If no ROSC can be achieved and the patient dies in the field pathological results will be obtained if feasible.</description>
