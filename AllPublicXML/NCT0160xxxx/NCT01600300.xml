        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of Macular Degeneration, i.e., at least three, hard or soft drusen must be
             present there must be RPE changes (migration, clumping or atrophy) within the central
             6mm of the retina.

          2. As a prerequisite for entry into the study, all patients will have their diagnosis of
             dry AMD confirmed by an ophthalmologist via a retinal exam and Fluorescein Angiography
             will also determine whether or not the subject is a candidate for laser surgery. Only
             subjects who have AMD will be admitted to the study.

          3. Both sexes are eligible.

          4. The best-corrected visual acuity can be no better than 20/40 and no worse than 20/100
             in the treated eyes.

          5. Age greater than 50.

          6. Subjects must be highly motivated, alert, oriented, mentally competent and able to
             understand and comply with the requirements of the study, abide by the restrictions,
             return for all required visits, and provide voluntary informed consent.

          7. Both eyes of the subject must show no evidence of wet AMD. If one eye is wet and the
             fellow eye is dry, the subject will be excluded.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with seizure disorders.

          2. Subjects with additional eye-related diseases that have associated ongoing retinal
             bleeding.

          3. Subjects with any implanted electrical device.

          4. Subjects who have smoked, on average, more than half a pack of cigarettes per day
             during the last 5 years.

          5. Subjects with known allergy to contrast dye.

          6. Subjects who are in poor general health, have unstable diseases, are terminally ill,
             have a life expectancy of less than 12 months, are non-ambulatory or bedridden, live
             in a geographical location which would likely prevent regular attendance at study
             visits or are considered not suitable for participation by the investigator.

          7. Subjects exposed to an investigational device or drug within the past 30 days or
             involved concurrently in other treatment clinical trials. Note: Subjects participating
             in studies investigating the natural progression of AMD may not participate in this
             trial.

          8. Subjects unwilling to adhere to visit or examination schedules as described in the
             study protocol.

          9. Subjects with a known history of alcoholism, drug abuse, psychosis, clinical evidence
             of depression, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual problems, or any other
             conditions which would likely limit validity of consent or appropriate responses to
             participate in the study or who are deemed unsuitable psychologically or
             physiologically for study participation by the investigator.

         10. Any subject experiencing an acute stressor that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             might affect the course or treatment of AMD.

         11. Anyone with diagnosis of malignant or poorly controlled glaucoma in the eye(s) that
             would be treated.

         12. Anyone with diabetic retinopathy.

         13. Anyone with a progressive corneal dystrophy in the eye(s) that would be treated.

         14. Anyone with any noted chorio retinal disease (other than AMD) in the eye(s) that would
             be treated.

         15. Anyone with a progressive nuclear cataract in the eye(s) that would be treated. Stable
             cortical cataract patients may be included. Any patient with an immature cataract, one
             in which scattered opacities are separated by clear zones, may be included in the
             study. All patients with mature, hypermature or morgagnian cataracts in the eye(s)
             that would be treated will be excluded. Patients with a grade 3 or grade 4 cataract in
             the eye(s) that would be treated will be excluded. Grade 1 and Grade 2 cataract
             patients may be included in this study.

         16. Subjects participating in an AMD natural history study.

         17. Subjects with one eye diagnosed with wet AMD.

         18. Subjects with any previous retinal bleeding, injury, or retinal surgery.

         19. Subjects that have previously been diagnosed with amblyopia.

         20. Subjects currently taking blood-thinning medication.

         21. Subjects cannot have previously been involved in a TESMAC™ study.

         22. Subjects that take two or more of the following antioxidants daily at the following
             doses: 500 milligrams of vitamin C; 400 international units of vitamin E; 15
             milligrams of beta-carotene; 80 milligrams of zinc as zinc oxide; and two milligrams
             of copper as cupric oxide and have done this for more than 2 years. These subjects may
             be included, but their study results will be analyzed separately.
