    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to find out if there is any association between a mother's exposure
      to bacteria that normally causes &quot;strep throat&quot; and her baby's developing heart disease/heart
      defect.

      The primary objective of this study is to:

        1. measure maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal carriage as defined by positive throat
           cultures in the absence of symptoms among Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS)
           mothers.

        2. define the incidence of positive strep throat cultures among asymptomatic pregnant
           women, identified at &lt;18 weeks gestation and followed to term.

        3. Measure antibodies that may cross react to select valvular/myocardial antigens in
           HLHS/Congenital Heart Defect(CHD)-other neonates born to mothers in the study

        4. determine serum and/or tissue reactivity against antibodies in matched maternal serum.

      The secondary objectives of this study is to:

        1. measure maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal serology using standard serology testing
           among HLHS mothers.

        2. determine the history of maternal ß-hemolytic streptococcal exposure using a study
           questionnaire among HLHS mothers.

        3. Determine &quot;baseline&quot; strep serologies and history of strep exposure among a cohort of
           asymptomatic pregnant women, identified at &lt;18 weeks gestation and followed to term.

           The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the history of β-hemolytic
           streptococcal pharyngeal exposure, groups A, G and C (&quot;strep throat&quot;) in pregnant women
           whose pregnancies have been complicated by the diagnosis of congenital heart disease.
           Our short-term goal is to identify a potential association of an antecedent maternal
           strep throat exposure in pregnancy to identify a subset of heart defects

        4. To determine if co-infections play a role in congenital heart defects
