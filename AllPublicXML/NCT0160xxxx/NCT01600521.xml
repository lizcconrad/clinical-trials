    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combined therapy for
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The combined therapy contained paeoniflorin (Brand name: Pafulin),
      which has anti-inflammation properties, and Cervus and Cucumis polypeptide injection (Brand
      name: Songmeile), which has bone healing, pain relieving, and anti-inflammation properties.
      The hypothesis is that this remedy, which has long been used by the world's largest RA
      community, is effective and safe when tested by modern clinical standards and criteria.

      This is a double-blinded randomized study on the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. In
      particular, patients were randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:
      Paeoniflorin (PAE) + Cervus and Cucumis polypeptide injection (CCPI), Methotrexate (MTX) +
      Leflunomide (LEF), and MTX + LEF + CCPI. The therapeutic effectiveness was evaluated by the 7
      core set measures of American College of Rheumatology (ACR). Adverse effects, their severity,
      and the evaluators' professional judgments of relationships between the adverse effects and
      the drugs were documented.

    <description>Paeoniflorin (PAE), the extract from peony (Paeonia lactiflora), is an active ingredient with anti-inflammation properties. Polypeptides (3,000 - 10,000 dalton) in Cervus &amp; Cucumis polypeptide injection (CCPI), the extract from Sika deer (Cervus nippon Temmick) bones and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L) seeds, are the active ingredients with bone healing, pain relieving, and anti-inflammation properties. PAE was administrated orally 600 mg twice a day for at least 12 months. CCPI was administered intravenously 8~12 mL daily with 250 mL 5% dextrose injection solution or 0.9% NaCl IV solution for 2 weeks, discontinued 1 week, and restarted for another 2 weeks.</description>
