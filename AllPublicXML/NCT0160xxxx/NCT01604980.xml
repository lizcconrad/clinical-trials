  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minimal data are available on protein requirements throughout the lifespan. Currently
      available recommendations are based on nitrogen balance data. The limitations of the nitrogen
      balance method have been well described. Importantly, nitrogen balanced underestimates
      requirements.

      The current DRI requirement for healthy adult males is based on the reanalysis of the
      nitrogen balance date from Young and Scrimshaw. This data was reanalyzed statistically by
      Rand et al. and he concluded that the protein requirement of healthy adults was 0.65 and 0.83
      (mean and RDA) g/kg/day of good quality protein. Using IAAO, the investigators group
      estimated the protein requirement of young men (mean age 27 years) to be 0.93 and 1.2
      g/kg/day (mean and RDA).

      Currently there are no studies on protein requirement in the elderly. In a recent nutrition
      survey conducted by NHANES, the authors concluded that adults between the ages of 51 - 70
      years old consumed an average on 1.0 g/kg/day (ideal body weight) of protein which represents
      about 15 % of calories. Depending on the calculations used for ideal body weight some older
      adults could be getting higher or lower than requirement. There is no scientifically derived
      protein estimate for older adults. Therefore there is a need to measurer protein requirement
      in that population.

      The goal of this study therefore is to measure the protein requirement of female elderly
      subjects &gt;75 years using the IAAO technique.
