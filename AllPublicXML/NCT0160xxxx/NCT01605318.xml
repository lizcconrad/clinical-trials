  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II, open-label study of IMMU-130 administered in 21-day treatment cycles,
      once or twice weekly for 2 consecutive weeks followed by one week of rest to patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer who have been previously treated with at least one prior
      irinotecan-containing regimen. The study is being done to evaluate whether the study drug is
      safe and tolerable at different dose levels with these dosing schedules and to obtain
      preliminary information on its efficacy.

    <description>Safety and tolerability will be evaluated from adverse events, standard safety laboratories (CBC with differential and platelet count, serum chemistries, urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, and EKG. Adverse events will be classified according to the MedDRA system of preferred terms and system organ class, and all adverse events and abnormal laboratories will be classified for severity using NCI CTCAE v4.0 toxicity grades. Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize adverse events, cytopenias, and other abnormal laboratories.</description>

    <time_frame>measured every 8 weeks during treatement &amp; every 3 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>CT (chest, abdomen, pelvis; other if needed) and serum CEA are done every 8 weeks after first dose until the end of treatment or progression of disease and then every 3 months during follow up. CT may be obtained more frequently at the physician discretion to assess disease status.for up to 2 years or until progression of disease.</description>

Treatment can be continued in the absence of unacceptable toxicity for a period of up to 8 cycles until the first documentation of Progressive Disease by CT (physician discretion), but must terminate study treatment upon the second documentation of Progressive Disease.</description>
