      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Magnetic Marker Monitoring is an
      appropriate opportunity to diagnose and to quantify a suspicious gastroparesis in subjects
      with diabetic polyneuropathy.

    <description>Magnetic Marker Imaging (MMI). It comprises of a high-resolution three-dimensional detector system, that detects passively and continuously the magnetic field of a magnetic marker capsule (1g, 6x12mm), which is taken orally by the subject. Changes in frequency, intensity and duration of oscillating marker movements allow us to delineate migrating gastric motor complexes. The Magnetic Marker Imaging takes up to 4 h in which the patient lies in a bed. Short interruptions (e.g. to visit the restroom) during this 4 h period are possible.</description>
