  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, prospective study is to evaluate the benefits of
      combining aerobic exercise with cognitive training for optimizing cognitive function. The
      study will enroll 109 men and women, age 55-75 years who are in stable health and without
      contraindications to exercise or evidence of dementia or cognitive impairment. Individuals
      will be randomly assigned to one of four groups for six months: Aerobic Exercise and Health
      Education, Home Exercise and Cognitive Training, Aerobic Exercise and Cognitive Training, and
      Home Exercise and Health Education. Participants will undergo measurements of cognitive
      function, physical performance, and complete questionaires about daily activities, physical
      activity, and quality of life at baseline (pre-intervention), and at 6 and 12 months after
      baseline.

    <description>Standardized aerobic training program that is individualized to each participant's fitness level, and supervised by a certified exercise specialist. Participants attend 3 training sessions per week for 6 months. The session begins with a 10-15 minute warm-up. Participants then exercise on a treadmill or stationary bike, followed by &quot;cool-down&quot; activities. Heart rate and rating of perceived exertion are used to evaluate exercise intensity. Participants begin at ~30 min/day 60-70% of HR max and/or an equivalent level of RPE, and progress to 45-50 minutes at 75-85% for HR max.</description>

    <description>Exercise program consisting of stretching, range of motion, and simple yoga exercises designed to improve flexibility. Each participant has a 60-minute sessions with an exercise trainer to teach them how to perform the exercises correctly. They are also given diagrams illustrating the exercises, along with written instructions. They are instructed to perform these exercises at home at least 3 times per week for 30 - 45 minutes. They also go to the recreational center monthly to meet with an exercise trainer to ensure that they are doing the exercises correctly. Participants record their exercise activities on a calendar for the 6 months.</description>

    <description>Computer-based training that is is administered 3 days per week for 8 weeks during months 5 and 6. The training program focuses on 3 types of cognitive processes: task coordination, prospective memory, and retrospective memory retrieval. One day of the week is devoted to each of the three cognitive processes. Some training sessions include a homework assignment for application and practice of the target cognitive processes in everyday activities.</description>

    <description>Weekly educational sessions are administered during months 5 and 6, conducted at the recreational center by research staff. Sessions last 1 hour, and cover health and other topics unrelated to exercise or cognition, such as nutrition, hearing loss, stroke, and saving energy in one's home. At the completion of each session, participants are given a &quot;homework&quot; assignment.</description>
