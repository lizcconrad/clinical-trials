  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a public health problem. Currently, the best treatment is surgery. However, 15% of
      patients after surgery have problems such as nausea, pain, vomiting, heartburn or
      regurgitation. To investigate these problems, an endoscopy is used. Yet, endoscopy has some
      disadvantages such as the need for intravenous sedation, need to take time off work, need for
      special endoscopy units and nurses and a delay in diagnosing because the endoscopy cannot be
      done at the time of the clinic visit. A new technology called clinic-based
      nasopharyngoendoscopy can potentially solve many of the problems with the current endoscopy.
      This study aims to determine that this new technology is just as effective in diagnosing
      problems as the current gold standard.

    <description>The study intervention is an in-office transnasal esophagoscopy. It is done in clinic, immediately after deciding the patient requires investigation of their upper gastrointestinal tract and the patient signs consent. The nasopharynx and oral pharynx is topically anesthetized. Since flexible scope is much thinner than a standard endoscopy, there is no requirement for intravenous sedation and thus, no requirement for specialized monitoring, nursing or recovery units. The procedure takes approximately 10 minutes. This study will be using the E.G. Scan II System.</description>

    <intervention_type>Procedure</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Standard Endoscopy</intervention_name>
    <description>The control procedure is standard endoscopy. Endoscopy will be performed as per standard clinic practice. It is typically scheduled within 2 weeks of seeing the patient in clinic. The patient will be required to fast for 6 hours prior to the procedure. In most cases, patients will require intravenous sedation. If sedation is used, the patient will be required to take the day off work and have someone drive them home. This is the standard treatment for patients who present with upper gastrointestinal symptoms post-bariatric surgery. Patients who choose not to participate in this study will still undergo endoscopy as per standard clinical practice.</description>
