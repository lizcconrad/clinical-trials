  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if MRI perfusion and PET/CT can tell growing tumor and radiation
      injury apart. MRI perfusion looks at the blood vessels in the tumor. PET/CT looks if the
      tumor cells are actively growing. The investigators will do these two tests and see which one
      is better.

      Patients will remain on study until the completion of either the MRI perfusion or PET/CT that
      are within 12 weeks of each other. After one of these scans, the patient will have no active
      interventions and will be off study.

      Optional: Restriction Spectrum Imaging (RSI) Sequence RSI sequence is an advanced way of
      looking at your brain. The scan allows doctors to see how water is moving within brain tumors
      or within brain cells. The extra sequence takes additional 4-5 minutes in the scanner. The
      RSI sequence is optional. The patient will only be asked to participate if the doctor
      believes that it will be helpful.

      Off study: Patients will remain on study until the completion of either the MRI perfusion or
      PET/CT that are within 12 weeks of each other. After one of these scans, the patient will
      have no active interventions and will be off study. Patients will obtain a standard of care
      brain MRI scan about every 2-3 months. These MRI scans will be used to track disease
      progression.

    <description>The MRI perfusion and PET/CT scans will be obtained within 12 weeks of each other. These scans are part of the standard of care for patients with brain tumors and uncertain tumor response or progression after treatment. Although every effort will be made to perform both MRI perfusion and PET/CT on the same day or during the same week, some patients may experience longer intervals between scans due to scheduling conflicts. The disease in question (radiation injury vs. tumor progression) may change slightly during this interval (e.g., the lesion may grow or shrink slightly), but no large changes are expected between the two scans. The patients may continue existing treatments in the interval between scans (e.g., steroids, chemotherapy), but the two scans must be performed before any change or new treatment occurs. Fusion images of MRI and PET/CT will not be reviewed by the neuroradiologist interpreting the MRI perfusion nor the nuclear medicine radiologist interpreting the PET/CT.</description>
