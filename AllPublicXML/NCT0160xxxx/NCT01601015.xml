    <textblock>
      Background. Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common form of primary headache and it is
      a real problem for the subjects suffering from it. Until now, physiotherapy treatments have
      included different techniques combined together, without establishing which of them is more
      effective.

      Objective. The purpose of this study is to know the effectiveness of manipulative and manual
      therapy treatments, with regard to pain perception and neck mobility in patients with
      tension-type headache.

      Methods: A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted, with 84 patients diagnosed
      with tension-type headache, divided into three treatment groups -manual therapy, manipulative
      therapy, and a combination of both techniques-, and a placebo control group. Four treatment
      sessions were administered during four weeks, with post-treatment assessment, and follow-up
      at one month. Cervical ranges of motion were assessed (CROM device), as well as pain
      perception (McGill Pain Questionnaire), and frequency and intensity of headaches (weekly
      register).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>An individual clinical interview was conducted to collect socio-demographic data and characteristics of headache in a one-month base period (the previous 4 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Firstly, socio-demographic data and characteristics of headache were collected during the four weeks prior to the treatment through individual clinical interview carried out by a physiotherapist who did not participate in the outcome assessment nor in the administration of treatments. It included age and sex, location of pain, side dominance of pain, type of pressure, connection with physical activity, frequency, severity of pain, associated symptoms and pain intensity, rated by the patient on the 0-10 Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) (0 = no pain, 10 = most severe pain).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Multidimensional perception of pain, assessed by the McGill Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>includes the following aspects: a) sensory, description of pain in time-space terms; b) affective, description of pain in terms of stress, fear and neurovegetative aspects; and c) evaluative, pain described in terms of general assessment. The McGill Pain Questionnaire is validated in Spanish population [13, 14] and it consists of 66 word descriptors divided into 20 groups, including in each group between 2 and 6 adjectives describing pain. Moreover, it includes a section in which patients register the intensity of pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical ranges of motion, measured with the CROM-device</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The CROM-device combines a system of inclinometers and magnets set on a head mainframe with a nose-piece (positions like eyeglasses) and it measures angles of flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation. As it includes a system of magnets, the CROM must not be used in subjects with heart devices.</description>

    <description>Frequency and intensity of headache, assessed with a seven register weekly. Patients recorded headache frequency as well as intensity of pain measured by the VAS Scale</description>

    <description>Manual therapy of Suboccipital soft tissue Inhibition is performed with patient in supine position. The patient's head leans against the physiotherapist's hands, which palpate suboccipital muscles by sliding fingertips until contacting posterior arch of atlas. At this point, a deep and progressive gliding pressure is applied, for 10 minutes. The purpose of this technique is to release suboccipital muscle spasm, which can be responsible for the mobility dysfunction of the occiput-atlas-axis joint.</description>

    <description>Occiput-atlas-axis joint manipulation is performed in the same position as the previous technique. It is bilaterally administered and it consists of 2 phases: firstly, rotation with gentle head decompression with no flexo-extension and slight lateral flexion is performed, followed by small circumductions aimed at increasing arterial viscoelasticity and searching for adequate joint barrier through selective tension; secondly, a high speed thrust manipulation in pure rotation towards the side to be manipulated is performed, with a head helicoidal movement, with the aim of restoring the mobility of joints between occiput, atlas and axis, which enables to correct a global joint dysfunction.</description>
