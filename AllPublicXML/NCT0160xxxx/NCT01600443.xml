  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is undertaken to investigate if the urethral microtrauma, caused by intermittent
      catheterization, differs between three hydrophilic catheters for intermittent
      catheterization, LoFric; SpeediCath (SC) and SpeediCath Compact Male (SCCM). The study is a
      prospective, randomised, cross-over, single-centre study.

      Each subject will be randomized to use three different catheter types. Three catheterizations
      will be performed with each catheter type during one day, with at least two hours between
      each catheterization. The washout period between catheter switch will be at least one week.

      The primary objective is to evaluate urethral microtrauma for three hydrophilic catheters
      with regards to hematuria after intermittent catheterization.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate urethral microtrauma for three hydrophilic catheters
      with regards to pyuria and subjective evaluation after intermittent catheterization.

      The safety of the three catheters will be evaluated in terms of adverse advents, non-serious
      and serious, rated for causality.

      The hypothesis that level of hematuria is equal after using different catheters will be
      tested using Wilcoxon signed rank test. The hypothesis will be rejected if the p-value is
      less than 5%.
