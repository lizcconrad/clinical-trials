  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis is that plastic bags used in combination with WHO thermoregulation
      care will reduce the incidence of hypothermia in preterm/low birth weight and full term
      infants when compared to routine WHO thermoregulation care alone. Part V is comparing use of
      a plastic torso wrap to no plastic torso wrap in preterm/low birth weight infants following
      removal from their incubator to assist with temperature regulation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to limited resources and numbers of incubators, hospitals in developing countries remove
      infants from incubators at lower weights than in developed countries, putting infants at
      increased risk for hypothermia. This study will compare the incidence of hypothermia during
      the 72 hours after incubator removal of infants randomized to receive standard incubator
      removal (control group) or standard incubator removal with a plastic bag covering their
      torsos and lower extremities (intervention group). The axillary temperature of each infant
      will be taken upon removal from the incubator, every subsequent 6-8 hours, and finally, at 72
      hours as the bags are removed. Blood pressure, blood sugar, seizures, weight gain,
      hyperthermia, death, observation for respiratory distress, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
      sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis,
      intestinal perforation, pulmonary hemorrhage room temperature and humidity, and length of
      time in an incubator will be recorded throughout their hospitalization for all infants. With
      an estimated hypothermia incidence of 30% and a hypothesized 20% absolute risk reduction (66%
      relative risk reduction), a sample size of 118 will be used to have a power of 80% and a
      confidence interval of 95%.
