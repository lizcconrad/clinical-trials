    <textblock>
      There is no study hypothesis. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of the: 1)
      SpHb (Radical 7 Pulse Co-Oximetry with SpHb™) RevF sensor (currently marketed), 2) the SpHb
      RevG sensor (a new, limited release version), and 3) the Pronto-7 sensor (currently marketed
      version) in patients undergoing spine surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of the: 1) SpHb RevF sensor (currently
      marketed), 2) the SpHb RevG sensor (a new, limited release version), and 3) the Pronto-7
      sensor (currently marketed version) in patients undergoing spine surgery. The results from
      the three sensors will be compared to a blood hemoglobin level taken intermittently (as a
      function of the patient's anesthesia care) and analyzed in the UCSF Clinical Laboratories.

      This is an observational study.
