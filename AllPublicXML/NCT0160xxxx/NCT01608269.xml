      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and antivira activity of
      Epzicom in virologically controlled HIV subjects.

      Utilizing the ABC/3TC FDC tablets as the NRTI backbone, this open label study will compare
      the safety and efficacy of ABC/3TC when used as replacement for subjects with suboptimal CD4-
      cells count who are receiving TDF/FTC. TYhis study will be conducted for 48 weeks in HIV
      infected, HLA*B5701 begative subjects who were initially suppressed on a HAART regiment that
      includes TDF/FTC QD.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 RNA ≤ 50 copies/mL by HIV-1 Ultrasensitive RNA, Quantitative.

          -  Treatment experienced subjects on virologically stable HAART regimen containing
             tenofovir-emtricitabine or tenofovir-lamivudine.

          -  Subject with CD4 cells that do not increase by 15% and/or that decrease by 15% over
             previous 12 months period.

             -≥ 18 years of age

          -  Cognitive ability to understand and provide written informed consent and willingness
             to participate in and comply with the study protocol

          -  Less than 7 days of prior ART with any licensed or investigational compound

          -  Patient does not currently have or has not been treated for an active opportunistic
             infection (OI) consistent with CDC definition (Appendix C) within 30 days of screening

          -  Vital signs, physical examination and laboratory results do not exhibit evidence of
             acute illness

          -  A female is eligible to enter and participate in this study if she is of:

          -  Non-childbearing potential (i.e., physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant,
             including any female who is post-menopausal) or

          -  Child-bearing potential, has a negative serum pregnancy test at screen, and agrees to
             one of the following:

          -  Complete abstinence from intercourse from 2 weeks prior to administration of the study
             drug, throughout the study, and for at least 2 weeks after completion or premature
             discontinuation from the study to account for elimination of the investigational drug.
             Should a patient decide to become sexually active during the course of the study, she
             must be counseled and be willing to use one of the birth control methods listed below:

          -  Double barrier method (male condom/spermicide, male condom/diaphragm,
             diaphragm/spermicide)

          -  Any intrauterine device (IUD) with published data showing that the expected failure
             rate is &lt;1% per year (not all IUDs meet this criterion)

          -  Sterilization (female patient or male partner of female patient)

          -  Any other methods with published data showing that the lowest expected failure rate
             for that method is &lt;1% per year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with active AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or disease according to the
             1993 CDC AIDS surveillance definition (Clinical Category C) in the 30 days prior to
             baseline and that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the patient from
             participating in the study (See Appendix C).

          -  Patient who are HLA B5701 Positive

          -  Patient who are determined to have ≥2 thymidine analog mutations to RT

          -  History of active substance abuse, excluding cannabis, or psychiatric illness that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, would preclude compliance with protocol, dosing
             schedule and assessments.

          -  Patient is either pregnant at time of screening evaluation or breast-feeding.
