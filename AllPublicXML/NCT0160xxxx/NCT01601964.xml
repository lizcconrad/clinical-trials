      The aim of this study is to determine plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor level and
      change in patient with ectopic pregnancy who needs to surgical treatment.

      Patient with ectopic pregnancy diagnosed and treated with medically or surgically will be
      included in the study. This is an observational study.The plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth
      Factor level will be measured first day and two day after the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.

      This study is a prospective, observational, single-center study. Ethical approval was
      obtained from the Institutional Review Board. This study will be completed with 30 patients
      with ectopic pregnancy. An intervenous cannula will be centrifuged for 15 minutes at 1000 g
      within 30 minutes of collection. Aliquots of plasma will be added to eppendorf tubes and
      stored at -20°C.

      Plasma Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor levels will be measured using a Human VEGF-A
      Platinum ELISA kit (bioscience company, Catalog No: 00122, Santa Clara, California, USA). All
      assays will be performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The test kit
      sensitivity is 2.5 pg/ml. Intracycle variability is %4-6, intercycle variability is %8-10.
