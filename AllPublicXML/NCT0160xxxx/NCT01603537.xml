  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trauma is the leading cause of death among persons below 60 years of age. It is a
      well-established belief that optimal treatment in the early phase after trauma has a major
      impact on mortality, and the implementation of specific educational programs for trauma care
      have been a widely adopted strategy aimed at improving the outcome. This strategy has high
      face validity, but the underlying evidence is poor. The Prehospital Trauma Life Support
      (PHTLS) program was introduced in 1983 aiming to integrate prehospital trauma care with the
      Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program. Approximately half a million prehospital
      caregivers in over 50 countries have taken the PHTLS course. It has been recognized as one of
      the leading educational programs for prehospital emergency trauma care. However, the
      scientific support for improved patient outcome from courses such as PHTLS and ATLS is
      limited. According to a Cochrane analysis published 2010 there is no evidence to recommend
      advanced life-support (ALS) training for ambulance crews. Another Cochrane analysis
      concerning ATLS gave similar results and a recent study indicated even worsened outcome after
      the implementation of ATLS. An observational study in the county of Uppsala indicated reduced
      mortality after the implementation of PHTLS but the estimate was uncertain due to a low
      overall mortality. The aim of this study is to further investigate the association between
      PHTLS training of ambulance crew members and the outcome in trauma patients in a larger study
      population. To accomplish this the investigators will use an epidemiological semi-individual
      design applied to all victims of traffic injury that occurred during the implementation
      period of the PHTLS course in Sweden (1998-2004). Four outcomes and subsets of patients will
      be analyzed: Mortality before hospital admission, mortality within 30 days, time to death
      among survivors to hospital admission and return to work among survivors to hospital
      discharge.

      Source Population: Sweden is divided in 21 administrative regions providing health care
      (counties). In 2004 Sweden had a population of about 9 million inhabitants with an average
      population density of 20 inhabitants/km2.

      The Emergency Medical Service (EMS)-System: The ambulance staff in Sweden consists of
      registered nurses and emergency medical technician (EMT) equivalents (nursing assistants with
      special ambulance training).

      Statistics: Hierarchical random effects models will be used to model the binary outcomes. Cox
      proportional hazards models to analyze the time to event outcomes. The difference in mean
      predicted outcome between the PHTLS group and the non-PHTLS group will be used to estimate
      the absolute risk reduction.
