  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-type natriuretic Peptide (BNP) is a cardiac hormone secreted from the cardiac myocytes in
      response to volume load. Plasma levels of BNP, as measured by immunoassay methods, are
      elevated in patients with heart diseases. However, the biological effects of BNP are blunted
      in heart failure and other cardiac conditions. Moreover, the peptide levels are also elevated
      in non cardiac conditions such as the neonatal period, sepsis and renal failure. Recent
      investigations suggest alteration of the peptide molecular structure in heart failure. These
      alterations may explain, at least partially, the reduced biological activities of BNP in
      heart failure.

      Immunoreactive BNP and NT-proBNP have been identified in human urine. It has been suggested
      that urinary BNP correlates with plasma BNP, and may serve as a non-invasive measure for this
      cardiac marker. It is unclear what BNP fractions are cleared in the urine in health and
      disease.

      The aim of the proposed studies is to elucidate precisely the molecular form of BNP in
      various disease and specific physiological states in plasma and urine of infants and
      children.
