  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to investigate the association between the amount of
      residual urine and asymptomatic bacterial prostate infection with the occurrence of recurrent
      (&gt;2 /year) symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients suffering from chronic (&gt; 1 year)
      spinal cord injury (SCI) and neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction performing
      intermittent catheterization.

      The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. The amount of residual urine after intermittent catheterization is significantly greater
           in SCI patients suffering from frequent (&gt;2 /year) urinary tract infections compared to
           those without.

        2. The incidence of asymptomatic bacterial prostate infections is significantly higher in
           SCI patients suffering from frequent (&gt;2 /year) urinary tract infections compared to
           those without.

      To investigate the association between the amount of residual urine and asymptomatic
      bacterial prostate infection with the occurrence of recurrent (&gt;2 /year) symptomatic urinary
      tract infections in patients suffering from chronic (&gt; 1 year) spinal cord injury (SCI) and
      neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction performing intermittent catheterization, patients
      perform self-catheterization twice (before and after urodynamic testing. After each
      catheterization, residual urine is assessed by ultrasound. Prior to urodynamic testing,
      prostate massage is performed, bacterial cultures of the fluid and the urine are initiated
      and the results of these cultures will be analysed .
