  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amongst the consequences of missing teeth are change of appearance and difficulties in
      mastication and speech. Dental implants in the maxilla or mandible provide a common treatment
      modality by offering anchorage to fixed or removable fixtures. In many cases, the lack of
      teeth is accompanied by lack of appropriate bone volume in the desired area for dental
      implant placement. Possible causes for this lack of sufficient bone volume are varied and
      include earlier bone atrophy, traumatic tooth extraction and bone resorption due to
      periodontal disease. In such cases, dental implant placement is preceded by alveolar bone
      augmentation . Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) is a common bone augmentation technique in
      which a bulk of bone substitute is placed in the area which needs more volume before placing
      a dental implant. The bone substitute is covered with an inert membrane and may provide a
      scaffold and encourage cells from the patient to reach the area and build new bone volume. A
      common bone substitute in use for that matter is Deproteinized bovine bone mineral (DBBM)
      which resembles human bone and helps encourage new bone formation. On the contrary its
      structural stability during placement and early healing is low. Bi-Phasic Calcium-Sulphate is
      another common bone substitute with easy handling properties and good structural stability
      during early healing. Its replacement by natural bone contributes to the augmentation
      process. Although DBBM efficacy in GBR process has been investigated, using DBBM in
      combination with bi-phasic calcium-sulphate as a binding material during GBR was not
      examined. This prospective study will examine augmented bone quality and quantity following a
      GBR procedure with common approved bone substitutes: DBBM (Bio-Oss, Geistlich) alone or in a
      combination with bi-phasic Calcium-sulphate (BondBone, Augma). The GBR procedures will
      precede dental implant placement as custom. The quality and quantity of the new formed bone
      will be assessed by a C.T (computerized tomography) which is done routinely before dental
      implant placement and by further analyses of bone residues which will follow drilling the
      dental implant placement site while preparing it (as common).

    <description>Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) will be done with no changes from the common (Dahlin 1988). Patients will be given local anasthesia, full thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be raised to expose the bone area that needs augmentation, bone substitute will be placed over the bony crater and covered with a collagen membrane (Bio-Gide, geistlich, FDA and CE approved). Mucoperiosteal flap will be sutured and patients will be instructed to a check-up routine as accepted after this kind of procedure.</description>
