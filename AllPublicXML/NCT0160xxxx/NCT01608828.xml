    <textblock>
      Studies suggest that strabismus has a negative impact on a person's self-image, interpersonal
      relationships, emotional and psychosocial state (4-15). There are, however, few such studies
      based in Asia, and the functional and psycho-social impact of disease is often neglected in
      our management of strabismus in Singapore. The aim of this pilot study is to measure
      quality-of-life (QOL) among strabismic children in Singapore so as to better understand the
      functional and psychosocial issues faced by these children in their daily living. The
      investigators also hope to evaluate the performance of the Intermittent Exotropia
      Questionnaire (IXTQ) (2) and Adult Strabismus Quality of Life Questionnaire (AS-20) (1) and
      to determine if differences between child and parental perceptions exist.

      60 children with strabismus presenting to the KKWCH Eye Centre and their parents will be
      invited to participate in the study and answer questions in 2 Pediatric Eye Disease
      Investigator Group (PEDIG)-validated questionnaires (i.e. the IXTQ and AS-20). 30 children
      aged 5-7 years will answer the 12-question IXTQ (5-7 years), while 30 children aged 8-16
      years will answer the 12-question IXTQ (8-16 years) and the 20-question AS-20 questionnaires.
      Their parents will answer the self-administered IXTQ child-proxy (12 questions), IXTQ
      parental (17 questions) and modified AS20 child-proxy questionnaires (20 questions). For
      comparison, 60 aged-matched children without strabismus or amblyopia (30 aged 5-7 years, and
      30 aged 8-16) and their parents will also be invited to answer similar questionnaires
      (controls).

      Results will be analysed question-by-question and then by composite score, and comparison
      will be made between child and parental-proxy measures, as well as with scores obtained from
      myopic children. It is hoped, that from this study, we will be able to assess the usefulness
      of the IXTQ and AS-20 instruments as measures of QOL in strabismic children, and to assess
      the feasibility of its use in a larger study looking at the impact of strabismus and its
      treatment in Singaporean children.
