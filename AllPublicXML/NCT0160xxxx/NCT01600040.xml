  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton beam radiation therapy is known to spare surrounding normal tissues from radiation.
      Proton beam radiation delivers less radiation beyond the area of the target tissues. This may
      reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with standard (photon) radiation
      therapy which tends to unavoidably include more normal tissue along with tumor target tissue.

      In this research study, the investigators are looking to determine if proton beam radiation
      is effective in controlling your cancer growth. The investigators are also looking to see if
      proton beam radiation can reduce side effects when compared to standard radiation treatment
      (photon radiation).

      Subjects will receive proton beam radiation treatment as an outpatient at the Francis H. Burr
      Proton Center at Massachusetts General Hospital, 5 days per week (Mon-Fri) over 5-6 weeks
      depending on the type of cancer.

      Tests and procedures during study treatment (weekly):

        -  Questions about health and current medications

        -  Physical exam, includes height, weight and vital signs

        -  Performance status

        -  Blood test for complete blood counts and blood clotting (2 tsps). Repeated twice weekly
           for uterine cancer subjects and once weekly for cervix cancer subjects

        -  Pelvic exam (at week 6 only)

        -  Quality of life questionnaires

      After completion of proton beam radiation treatment, subjects will be followed for 5 years.
      Follow-up visits will occur every 3 months for 2 years; every 4 months to year 3 and every 6
      months thereafter. At each visit subjects will receive:

        -  A medical history

        -  Physical exam

        -  Performance status

        -  Pelvic exam

        -  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis every 6 months to year 3

        -  Quality of life questionnaires (6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed primary cancer of the uterus or cervix with histologically
             confirmed metastasis to one or more parametrial, pelvic or paraaortic nodes prior to
             enrollment. Subjects diagnosed at other institutions must have pathology reviewed and
             confirmed at MGH or another DF/HCC institution

          -  Have undergone simple, modified radical, or radical abdominal hysterectomy or vaginal
             hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy by open or laparoscopic assisted technique
