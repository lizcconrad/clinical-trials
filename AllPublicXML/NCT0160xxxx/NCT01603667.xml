      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of PG2 Injection 500 mg
      versus placebo, administered intravenously within 3-6 hrs of stroke onset to patients with an
      acute ischemic stroke, as determined by Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at Day 90.

      The secondary objectives are as follows:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of PG2 Injection 500 mg versus placebo as determined by Barthel
           Index (BI) score at Day 90.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of PG2 Injection 500 mg in reducing the risk of recurrent
           stroke, cardiovascular events and death of all causes.

        -  To evaluate the safety of PG2 Injection 500 mg treatment

         15. Uncontrolled hypertension defined by a blood pressure &gt; 185 mmHg systolic or &gt;110 mmHg
             diastolic on at least 2 separate occasions at least 10 minutes apart, or requiring
             aggressive treatment to reduce the blood pressure to within these limits. The
             definition of &quot;aggressive treatment&quot; is left to the discretion of the responsible
             Investigator
