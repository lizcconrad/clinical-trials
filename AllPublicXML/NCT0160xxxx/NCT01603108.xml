  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the administration of a poorly-absorbable
      antibiotic (rifaximin) for the first three months after liver transplant will reduce the
      amount of fibrosis (or scarring of the liver) in liver transplant patients with recurrent
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) by lowering serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a protein in blood that
      comes from the bacteria in intestines and may cause scarring in the liver.

      Approximately 60 subjects will participate in this study. Subjects will be part of the study
      for approximately 1 year post transplant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic liver infection and remains the leading
      indication for liver transplantation (LT). Although LT is a cure for cirrhosis of the liver,
      it does not always cure HCV infection or reinfection of post-transplanted liver. Post-LT
      recurrent HCV can lead to accelerated liver fibrosis. Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) from gut-derived bacteria has shown to be at elevated levels in patients with cirrhosis
      due to HCV compared to normal controls. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that LPS
      contributes to cause of liver fibrosis, specifically in patients with post-LT recurrent HCV,
      and this effect maybe modified with the poorly absorbed antibiotic, rifaximin, which alter
      the gut flora of the patients.
