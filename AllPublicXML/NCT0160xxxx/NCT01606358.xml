    <textblock>
      In patients with an ovarian cancer, the treatment is currently based on surgery and
      chemotherapy.

      The impact of chemotherapy on the expansion and functional abilities of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T
      cells has never been evaluated.

      The long term goal is to give a rational to combine conventional treatment of ovarian cancer
      with immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is associated with a high mortality rate. Treatment of ovarian cancer is
      currently based on surgery and chemotherapy.

      The first surgery is a radical surgical procedure aiming to achieve no residual disease.
      Patients who could not benefit from the first surgery may be offered neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      with a new surgical procedure after 3 or 6 chemotherapy cycles. Chemotherapy is currently
      based on Taxol and Carboplatin. Immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells could provide a
      promising therapeutic strategy, however, the impact of chemotherapy on the expansion and
      functional abilities of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells has never been evaluated.

      We want to study the effect of chemotherapy of ovarian cancer on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells rates
      in the peripheral blood of patients with ovarian cancer.

      Functional abilities of the Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells will be studied: expansion after
      chemotherapy and their cytotoxic abilities in an autologous context before or after
      chemotherapy.

      The long term goal is to give a rational to combine conventional treatment of ovarian cancer
      with non-conventional treatment such as immunotherapy based on Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells.
