    <measure>12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 was a patient reported outcome survey that represented overall health status by measuring 8 health-related aspects of an individual: Body pain, general mental health, perception of general health, physical functioning, role limitations caused by mental condition, role limitations caused by a physical condition, social functioning, and vitality. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), higher scores indicating good health condition. Responses on the SF-12 were also used to calculate 2 summary scores: Physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS). The score range for each of these 2 summary scores was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), where 100 indicated good health condition.</description>

HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items and the participant responds as to how each item applies to him/her over the past week prior to baseline visit, on 4-point response scale. Separate scores were calculated for anxiety and depression with score ranges from 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score range was from 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>SF-12 was a patient reported outcome survey that represented overall health status by measuring 8 health-related aspects of an individual: Body pain, general mental health, perception of general health, physical functioning, role limitations caused by mental condition, role limitations caused by a physical condition, social functioning, and vitality. The score range for each of the 8 health aspects was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), higher scores indicating good health condition. Responses on the SF-12 were also used to calculate 2 summary scores: Physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS). The score range for each of these 2 summary scores was from 0 (poor health) to 100 (better health), where 100 indicated good health condition.</description>

        <description>HADS: participant rated 14-item questionnaire with 2 subscales; HADS-anxiety scale (HADS-A) and HADS-depression scale (HADS-D). HADS-A assesses state of generalized anxiety (anxious mood, restlessness, anxious thoughts, panic attacks); HADS-D assesses state of lost interest and diminished pleasure response (lowering of hedonic tone). Each subscale comprised of 7 items and the participant responds as to how each item applies to him/her over the past week prior to baseline visit, on 4-point response scale. Separate scores were calculated for anxiety and depression with score ranges from 0 (no presence of anxiety or depression) to 3 (severe feeling of anxiety or depression). Total score range was from 0 to 21 for each subscale; higher score indicating greater severity of anxiety and depression symptoms.</description>

        <description>EQ-5D-3L: participant rated questionnaire to assess generic health status in two parts: single utility score and visual analog scale. For utility score, participants rated their current health state on 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort, and anxiety and depression with each dimension having three levels of function: 1 indicates no problem; 2 indicates some problem; 3 indicates extreme problem. Scoring formula developed by EuroQol Group assigns a utility value for each domain in the profile. Score was transformed and results in a total score range of 0.05 to 1.00; higher scores indicating a better health state.</description>

        <title>Work Productivity and Activity Impairment- Specific Health Version: Percent Impairment While Working</title>
        <description>The WPAI assesses work productivity and impairment. It was a 6-item questionnaire used to assess the degree to which a specified health problem affected work productivity and regular activities over the past 7 days prior to baseline visit. The questionnaire asks about current employment status, hours worked, hours missed from work and degree to which a specified health problem (ATTR) or caregiving affected work productivity and regular activities. Component scores included percent work time missed due to the health problem; percent impairment while working due to problem; percent overall work impairment due to problem; and percent activity impairment due to problem. The computed percentage range for each sub-scale was from 0-100, where higher numbers indicating greater impairment and less productivity.</description>

        <description>KCCQ was a 23-item participant-completed questionnaire that assessed health status and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in participants with heart failure. It was quantified in to following 10 summary scores: physical limitation, symptom frequency, symptom severity, and symptom stability, total symptoms, quality of life, social interference, self-efficacy, overall summary and clinical summary. Each summary score was scaled to range from 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum), with higher scores representing greater disability. Total score ranged from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicated better functioning, fewer symptoms, and better disease specific quality of life.</description>

        <title>Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI): Total Scores</title>
        <description>ZBI was a 22-item questionnaire designed to evaluate five broad aspects of caregiver burden in terms of personal and role strain associated with caregiving. Five broad aspects were: burden in the relationship, emotional well-being, social and family life, finances, loss of control over one's life. Each item rated on a 5 point scale anchored at 0 for &quot;never&quot; and 4 for &quot;nearly always.&quot; Total score ranges from 0-88 with higher scores indicating increased burden of care.</description>
