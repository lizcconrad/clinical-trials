  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have found that many patients getting treatment for cancer have trouble
      getting enough to eat, or do not always have enough money for food. When a patient has these
      problems it can lead to difficulties with completing cancer treatment. Across New York City,
      there are many hospitals that offer their patients food pantry services on location. The
      investigators would like to compare how food pantries within the hospital and two other food
      assistance options: monthly food vouchers and weekly grocery deliveries maybe possible
      solutions to this problem. The patient will be randomly assigned to one of the three
      different food program groups, which means everyone has an equal chance in being in any
      group, like a flip of a coin. The investigators hope to learn how to best help patients with
      trouble getting food and to see if this will help with completing cancer treatment.

    <description>The primary analytic approach for these secondary outcome variables will be a series of Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMS) modeling the change scores from baseline to each of the follow-up assessments, separately for each of the questionnaire outcome variables [51]. Analyses based on change scores have the advantage of creating easily interpretable results and clearly indicating the direction of individual change (e.g., increased protein intake).</description>
