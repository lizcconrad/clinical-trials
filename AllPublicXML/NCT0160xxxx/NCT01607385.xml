    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.
             Laboratory assessments may be repeated if outside of normal ranges. The Investigator
             may interpret screening vital sign data based on the subject's age, physical state and
             level of fitness. Subjects with vital sign readings marginally outside the normal
             ranges below may be included in the study if in the Investigator's opinion these
             values are not clinically significant and will not present a safety risk or affect
             study assessments.

          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form. Subjects must understand the
             aims, investigational procedures and possible consequences of the study and must be
             able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions and
             protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  Male or female between 18 and 60 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the
             informed consent.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of: Non-childbearing potential
             defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or
             postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhea. In questionable cases,
             a blood sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone greater than 40 MlU/ml
             and estradiol less than 40 pg/ml (less than 140 pmol/L) is confirmatory in the absence
             of a clear postmenopausal history; Females on hormone replacement therapy must
             discontinue hormone replacement therapy to allow confirmation of post-menopausal
             status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of hormone replacement therapy, at
             least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this
             interval depends on the type and dosage of hormone replacement therapy. Following
             confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of hormone
             replacement therapy during the study.

          -  Body mass index within the range 19 - 32kg/m2 (inclusive).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin greater than 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin
             greater than 1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin
             less than 35%.

          -  Current or chronic history of inflammatory bowel disease, chronic diarrhea, Crohn's
             disease or malabsorption syndromes.

          -  Current or chronic history of cholelithiasis, inflammatory gall bladder disease,
             cholestatic liver injury, and cholecystectomy.

          -  Current or chronic history of liver disease, or known hepatic abnormalities (with the
             exception of Gilbert's syndrome).

          -  Fecal occult blood positive test at screening.

          -  Triglycerides greater than 250mg/dL.

          -  History of chronic or acute pancreatitis.

          -  Mean QTc greater than and equal to 450msec on three tracings obtained at least 5
             minutes apart.

          -  A positive pre-study Hepatitis B surface antigen or positive Hepatitis C antibody
             result within 3 months of screening.

          -  A positive test for HIV antibody.

          -  A positive pre-study drug/alcohol screen. A minimum list of drugs that will be
             screened for include amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids and
             benzodiazepines.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption within 6 months of the study defined as an
             average weekly intake of greater than 14 drinks for males or greater than 7 drinks for
             females. One drink is equivalent to 12g of alcohol: 12 ounces (360mL) of beer, 5
             ounces (150mL) of wine or 1.5 ounces (45mL) of 80 proof distilled spirits.

          -  The subject has participated in a clinical trial and has received an investigational
             product within the following time period prior to the first dosing day in the current
             study: 30 days or 5 half-lives of the investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.

          -  Unable to refrain from the use of prescription or non-prescription drugs, including
             vitamins, herbal and dietary supplements (including St John's Wort) within 7 days (or
             14 days if the drug is a potential enzyme inducer) or 5 half-lives (whichever is
             longer) prior to the first dose of study medication, unless in the opinion of the
             Investigator and GSK Medical Monitor the medication will not interfere with the study
             procedures or compromise subject safety.

          -  History of sensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator or GSK
             Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Where participation in the study would result in donation of blood or blood products
             in excess of 500mL within a 56-day period.

          -  History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Urinary cotinine levels indicative of smoking or history or regular use of tobacco- or
             nicotine-containing products within 6 months prior to screening.

          -  Subject is either an immediate family member of a participating investigator, study
             coordinator, employee of an investigator; or is a member of the staff conducting the
             study.
