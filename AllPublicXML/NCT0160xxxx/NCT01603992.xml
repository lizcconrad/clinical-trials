      Background:

      - Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, yet relatively little is known
      about users who try to quit without formal treatment ( spontaneous quitting). Studies have
      suggested that there are some common strategies that many individuals use in spontaneous
      quitting, such as changing one s lifestyle or identity, reminding oneself of negative
      consequences, support from family and friends, and religion. However, more research is needed
      to determine potential treatment strategies for marijuana use.

      Objectives:

        -  To identify strategies used to help with marijuana quitting among non-treatment seeking
           adult marijuana users.

        -  To identify withdrawal symptoms experienced during marijuana quitting and their
           relationship to the quitting strategies used and the outcome of the quit attempt.

        -  To evaluate whether subgroups of marijuana users differ in their experience of marijuana
           quitting.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have made at least one attempt to quit marijuana
      use.

      Design:

        -  The study will consist of one visit of approximately 1 to 2 hours.

        -  Participants will fill out three questionnaires. The questionnaires have different types
           of questions, and will ask about background and lifestyle, marijuana use and craving
           patterns and behaviors, and difficulties in previous attempts to quit using marijuana.

      Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in the world, yet relatively little is known
      about users who try to quit without formal treatment (so-called spontaneous quitting). This
      study will use two self-report questionnaires to collect information on the socio-demographic
      characteristics, marijuana use history, most difficult marijuana quit experience, and
      marijuana craving from a convenience sample of 1230 adult, non-treatment-seeking marijuana
      users. The questionnaires take 45-60 minutes to administer. Data will be analyzed for
      patterns and correlations among the characteristics of the quit attempt, including any
      withdrawal symptoms, quitting strategies used, and its success. The marijuana craving data
      will be analyzed to evaluate the validity of this measure of marijuana craving. There are no
      direct benefits to subjects from study participation. The scientific benefit is an improved
      understanding of spontaneous quitting of marijuana use, which may lead to improved
      interventions for marijuana users in the future. There are no physical risks to subjects.
      There are risks of anxiety or embarrassment while taking the questionnaire and of loss of
      confidentiality of sensitive information collected about subjects.
