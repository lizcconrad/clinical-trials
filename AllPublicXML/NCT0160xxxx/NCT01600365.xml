  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the use of ganciclovir gel 0.3% for treatment of
      conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of ganciclovir ophthalmic gel for the treatment of
      conjunctivitis comparing to placebo (ophthalmic gel). Visual acuity test and slit lamp
      examination (biomicroscopy) will be performed at each visit to assess the signs/symptoms and
      the regression of the disease.
