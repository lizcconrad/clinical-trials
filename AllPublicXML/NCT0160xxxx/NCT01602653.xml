  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant Murley Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in the mean Constant Murley Scale (CMS) scores at 3 and 6 months was the primary endpoint.</time_frame>
    <description>Constant-Murley scale is the scoring system used to assess shoulder function in four of the studies being reviewed. It combines physical examination tests with subjective evaluations by the patients and consists of 35 points and 65 points respectively. Its strength is the method of its application, which is quite clearly described, and its being an improvement on pre-existing scales</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogic Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>The change in the mean Visual Analogic Scale scores from baseline to 3 and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>It is a horizontal line, 10 cm in length with 0 cm labeled &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 cm labeled &quot;worst pain I have ever had&quot;. The patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state</description>
