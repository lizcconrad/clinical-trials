  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is initiated to investigate the effect of a new infant formula in healthy term
      subjects on growth, body composition, tolerance and safety.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a &quot;best after breast design&quot; to measure the effect of this new infant formula in
      healthy term subjects on growth, body composition, tolerance and safety including immune
      status, gut microbiota, and early indicators (markers) of disease. These markers will be
      explored if they could predict the risk of eczema and other allergic disease, and to evaluate
      if these markers are influenced by early nutrition.
