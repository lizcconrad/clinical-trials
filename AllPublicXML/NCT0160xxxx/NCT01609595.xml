  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta thalassemia intermedia is an inherited blood disease caused by molecular mutations which
      reduce the beta globin protein chain of adult hemoglobin A, the protein in red blood cells
      which carries oxygen throughout the body. Beta thalassemias cause progressively severe
      anemia, widespread organ damage, and often require blood transfusions. There is no FDA
      approved therapeutic to treat the underlying cause of beta thalassemia. Fetal hemoglobin is
      another type of endogenous hemoglobin which can replace the reduced beta globin protein,
      reduce the anemia, and even abolish transfusion requirements. This type of hemoglobin is
      normally suppressed in infancy.

      Sodium 2,2 dimethylbutyrate (ST20, or HQK-1001) is a small molecule which stimulates
      production of fetal hemoglobin in nonhuman primates and in human patients in Phase I/II
      trials.

      This is a Phase 2 open-label trial to evaluate the ability of this oral therapeutic to reduce
      anemia in patients with beta thalassemia intermedia, when administered once daily for 26
      weeks. All participants will receive the study drug.

      This trial will:

        1. Determine the proportion of patients in which treatment with the study drug results in
           an increase in total hemoglobin by 1.5 g/dl above baseline levels when administered for
           26 weeks in Thai patients with beta thalassemia intermedia, including Hemoglobin E beta
           thalassemia.

        2. Determine the number and proportion of participants in whom treatment with the study
           drug results in an increase in fetal hemoglobin.

        3. Determine the number of participants who have adverse events.
