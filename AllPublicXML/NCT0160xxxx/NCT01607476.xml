  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this research protocol is to test the equivalency of two amyloid imaging drugs
      (C11 Pittsburgh Compound B and F18 Flutemetamol). The investigators hypothesize that there
      will be no significant difference in the distribution of the agents to areas of amyloid
      deposition in the brain or to other normal brain structures. Recent data have shown
      similarity in the distribution of the drugs in subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). No comparison data of the two PET drugs in normal subjects has
      been published. It is important to understand differences in the images and biodistribution
      from the two drugs in normal subjects as nonspecific accumulation of the drugs in brain
      structures such as white matter appear to differ slightly and could affect image performance.

    <textblock>
      Some of the current thinking in regards to the pathophysiology of AD involves the production
      of amyloid Beta protein (AB) by secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP).
      While AB is thought to be toxic to neurons its role leading to AD pathogenesis, this is not
      without debate. In any case, it appears that AB forms amyloid plaques that are largely
      ubiquitous in AD. Neuronal cell death as a result of the disease is another clear
      pathophysiologic finding. Because of the importance of these findings in the development of
      AD, targeted therapies are being investigated to selectively inhibit AB production and/or
      manipulate amyloid load.

      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality used to noninvasively
      measure functional processes of the body. A trace amount of a radiopharmaceutical is injected
      into a patient and the radiopharmaceutical will be taken up or localized in the body as a
      function of certain biological processes. The detectors of a PET scanner then measure the
      radiopharmaceutical distribution externally and the reconstructed PET images should represent
      the true distribution of the radiopharmaceutical within the body.

    <description>The imaging analysts use a global atlas of the brain to measure the uptake of the radioactive tracer (or brightness) globally. This global uptake was normalized to the uptake in the cerebellar crus region of the brain to get a global Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR). The cerebral crus (crus cerebri) is the anterior portion of the cerebral peduncle which contains the motor tracts.
The standard uptake value (SUV) is a way of determining activity in PET imaging. The SUVR is the ratio of SUV from two different regions within the same PET image. For the SUVR, the injected activity, the body weight and the volume to mass conversion factor that are all part of the SUV calculation, cancel.</description>

        <title>Global Distribution of C11 PiB in the Brain</title>
        <description>The imaging analysts use a global atlas of the brain to measure the uptake of the radioactive tracer (or brightness) globally. This global uptake was normalized to the uptake in the cerebellar crus region of the brain to get a global Standard Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR). The cerebral crus (crus cerebri) is the anterior portion of the cerebral peduncle which contains the motor tracts.
The standard uptake value (SUV) is a way of determining activity in PET imaging. The SUVR is the ratio of SUV from two different regions within the same PET image. For the SUVR, the injected activity, the body weight and the volume to mass conversion factor that are all part of the SUV calculation, cancel.</description>
