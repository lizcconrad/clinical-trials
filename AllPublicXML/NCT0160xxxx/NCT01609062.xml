    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of a 2.0 mg/kg/week and a 4.0
      mg/kg/week of BMN 110 in patients with Morquio A syndrome for up to 196 weeks. Secondary
      objectives were to investigate the effect of the two doses on exercise capacity for up to 196
      weeks. In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of both doses of BMN 110 was
      assessed.

    <measure>Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) - Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12, 24, and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The APPT is a validated, multidimensional tool to evaluate pain in children, adolescents, and young adults. The complete APPT is measured in three parts - Part 1 of the APPT scale determines the subject's pain locations using a body template. Part 2 of the APPT scale determines the intensity of the pain using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) with the lowest point of the scale (0) labeled No Pain and the highest point on the scale (10) labeled Worst Possible Pain. Intermediate regions of the sale were labeled with 3 intermediate descriptors (Little Pain, Medium Pain, and Large Pain). Part 3 of the APPT scale characterizes the pain by tracking the number and percentage of words selected by subjects to describe their pain from a total of 57 choices. Part 2 corresponds most closely to other typically used pain scales (based on VAS) and for this reason the results from Part 2 are presented here.
Change from baseline to Week 12, 24, and 52 in pain intensity.</description>

        <title>Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool (APPT) - Pain Intensity</title>
        <description>The APPT is a validated, multidimensional tool to evaluate pain in children, adolescents, and young adults. The complete APPT is measured in three parts - Part 1 of the APPT scale determines the subject's pain locations using a body template. Part 2 of the APPT scale determines the intensity of the pain using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) with the lowest point of the scale (0) labeled No Pain and the highest point on the scale (10) labeled Worst Possible Pain. Intermediate regions of the sale were labeled with 3 intermediate descriptors (Little Pain, Medium Pain, and Large Pain). Part 3 of the APPT scale characterizes the pain by tracking the number and percentage of words selected by subjects to describe their pain from a total of 57 choices. Part 2 corresponds most closely to other typically used pain scales (based on VAS) and for this reason the results from Part 2 are presented here.
Change from baseline to Week 12, 24, and 52 in pain intensity.</description>
