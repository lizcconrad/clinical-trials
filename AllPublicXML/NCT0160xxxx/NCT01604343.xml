  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of sirukumab as measured by the reduction
      of the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inhibition of radiographic
      progression in patients with active RA who are unresponsive to treatment with
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups, and they and study personnel will not
      know the identity of the treatments given. Some patients will receive a placebo, which
      resembles a medication, but does not contain an active substance. This helps to determine if
      the study agent is effective. Patients will receive placebo or sirukumab by injection under
      the skin. The expected duration of the study is 120 weeks, which includes 104 weeks of
      treatment. Participants who complete participation in the study will be eligible for
      inclusion into the long-term safety and efficacy study, if enrollment at a participating site
      is available to them. If they do not participate in the long-term study, they will continue
      into the safety follow-up for approximately 16 weeks. The placebo-controlled portion of the
      study is through Week 52, when placebo patients will cross over to one of two sirukumab dose
      regimens. Patient safety will be monitored throughout the study.

The joint erosion assessment is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion and 5 indicating complete collapse of bone whereas the JSN assessment including subluxation, is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 448 (worst) with higher scores indicating more joint damage. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>vdH-S score measures structural damage progression as sum of joint erosion(JE) and joint space narrowing(JSN) scores(S).JE is summary of erosion severity in 32 of hands(H) and 12 of feet(F) joints, scored as per surface area- from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete(CM) collapse of bone). Maximum (MAX) JES for H-160 (32*5) and MAX JES for F- 120 (12*10 [5*2 sides of foot]). MAX JES is 280 whereas JSN is summary of severity of 30 of H and 12 of F joints, scored to subluxation from 0(normal) to 4(bony ankylosis or CM luxation). MAX JSNS for H-120(30*4), and MAX JSS for F-48(12*4). MAX JSNS is 168.Thus MAX JES-280 combined with MAX JSNS-168 gives worst possible vdH-SS (i.e., JE score + JSN score) of 448. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 24 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>vdH-S score measures structural damage progression as sum of joint erosion(JE) and joint space narrowing(JSN) scores(S). JE is summary of erosion severity in 32 of hand and 12 of feet joints, scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) whereas the JSN is summary of severity of 30 of hand and 12 of feet joints, scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The SDC is smallest change in score that is considered to be assessed correctly based on limits of agreement (that is., above the measurement error). The SDC for change from baseline in vdH-S Score is determined as: SDC=1.96 * SD / (root 2 * root k), where SD is the standard deviation of the difference between 2 readers in change from baseline in vdH-S score; k is the number of readers. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde-modified Sharpe (vdH-S) Score at Week 52</title>
        <description>The van der Heijde-modified Sharpe (vdH-S) score is defined as a measurement of progression in structural damage. It is the sum of joint erosion (32 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score and joint space narrowing (JSN) (30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score. The joint erosion assessment is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion and 5 indicating complete collapse of bone whereas the JSN assessment including subluxation, is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 448 (worst) with higher scores indicating more joint damage. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received. Here, EE= early escape.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score is an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range: 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28) (C-reactive Protein (CRP) Remission at Week 24</title>
        <description>The DAS28 based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. The Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28) C-reactive protein (CRP) remission is defined as a DAS28 (CRP) value of less than 2.6 at a visit. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 50 Response</title>
        <description>An ACR 50 response is defined as &gt;= 50 % improvement in both tender joint count (68 joints) and swollen joint count (66 joints) and &gt;= 50% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: Participant’s assessment of pain using VAS (0-10 scale, 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain), Participant’s global assessment of disease activity by using VAS (the scale ranges from 0 to 10, [0 = very well to 10 = very poor]), Physician’s global assessment of disease activity using VAS (the scale ranges from 0 to 10, [0=no arthritis activity to 10=extremely active arthritis]), Participant’s assessment of physical function as measured by HAQ-DI (the scale ranges from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area) and Serum CRP. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 70 Response Through Week 52</title>
        <description>An ACR 70 response is defined as &gt;= 70 % improvement in both tender joint count (68 joints) and swollen joint count (66 joints) and &gt;= 70% improvement in 3 of the following 5 assessments: Participant’s assessment of pain using VAS (0-10 scale, 0=no pain and 10=worst possible pain), Participant’s global assessment of disease activity by using VAS (the scale ranges from 0 to 10, [0 = very well to 10 = very poor]), Physician’s global assessment of disease activity using VAS (the scale ranges from 0 to 10, [0=no arthritis activity to 10=extremely active arthritis]), Participant’s assessment of physical function as measured by HAQ-DI (the scale ranges from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area) and Serum CRP. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <description>DAS28 based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP), a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28), swollen joints (28), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both upper right extremity and upper left extremity as well as knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. Good responders: improvement from baseline greater than (&gt;) 1.2 with DAS28 less than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2; moderate responders: improvement from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or improvement from baseline &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 &lt;=5.1; non-responders: improvement from baseline &lt;=0.6 or improvement from baseline &gt;0.6 and &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1.

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28) C-reactive Protein (CRP) Through Week 52</title>
        <description>The DAS28 based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. A negative change from baseline in DAS28 (CRP) (that is, a decrease from baseline) indicates improvement from baseline. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values. Last Observation at or prior EE/LE was used to replace the data after EE/LE for participants who met EE/LE criteria.</population>

Participants who met early escape (EE) criteria at Week 18, or late escape (LE) at Week 40, or cross-over (CO) at Week 52 were rerandomized to receive sirukumab 50 or 100 mg through Week 104.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28) (C-reactive Protein (CRP) Remission Through Week 52</title>
        <description>The DAS28 based on C-Reactive Protein (CRP) is a statistically derived index combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), CRP and patient's global assessment of disease activity. The set of 28 joint count is based on evaluation of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP) MCP1 to MCP5, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) PIP1 to PIP5 joints of both the upper right extremity and the upper left extremity as well as the knee joints of lower right and lower left extremities. The values are 0=best to 10=worst. The Disease Activity Index Score 28 (DAS28) C-reactive protein (CRP) remission is defined as a DAS28 (CRP) value of less than 2.6 at a visit. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score Through Week 52</title>
        <description>The SDAI score is a derived score combining tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, physician's global assessments of disease activity, and CRP. The total score range is from 0 to 86 with a lower score indicating less disease activity. A negative change from baseline indicates an improvement and a positive change from baseline indicates a worsening. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values. Last Observation at or prior EE/LE was used to replace the data after EE/LE for participants who met EE/LE criteria.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score Through Week 52</title>
        <description>The CDAI score is a derived score of 4 components: tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and physician's global assessments of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to 76 with a lower score indicating less disease activity.

          <title>Change From Baseline in Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score Through Week 52</title>
          <description>The CDAI score is a derived score of 4 components: tender joints (28 joints), swollen joints (28 joints), patient's global assessment of disease activity, and physician's global assessments of disease activity. The total score ranges from 0 to 76 with a lower score indicating less disease activity. A negative change in CDAI score indicates an improvement in disease activity and a positive change in score indicates a worsening of disease activity. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score Through Week 52</title>
        <description>The Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) score is an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Negative change reflects an improvement and a positive change reflects a worsening. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48 and 52</time_frame>
        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values. Last Observation at or prior EE/LE was used to replace the data after EE/LE for participants who met EE/LE criteria.</population>

Participants who met early escape (EE) criteria at Week 18, or late escape (LE) at Week 40, or cross-over (CO) at Week 52 were rerandomized to receive sirukumab 50 or 100 mg through Week 104.

        <title>Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Change From Baseline in HAQ-DI Score From Week 0 Through Week 24 and From Week 0 Through Week 52</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI has 20-question in 8 functional areas: dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and daily living activities, scored from 0=no difficulty to 3=inability to perform task in that area. Overall score computed as sum of domain score divided by number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0= least difficulty to 3= extreme difficulty. AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score is AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score versus time. AUC was calculated based on measurement (observed HAQ-DI score change from baseline) at scheduled visits using trapezoidal rule.Functional status was determined as cumulative measure of HAQ-DI over 1 year by using AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI score through week 52. Decreases in AUC of change from baseline in HAQ-DI means greater average improvement in physical function over time. Participants analyzed according to randomized treatment groups they were assigned, regardless of treatments they actually received.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI response was defined as change of less than -0.22 from baseline in HAQ-DI score. The HAQ-DI score is an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) Score of Less Than or Equal to 0.5</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI score is an evaluation of the functional status for a participant. The 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficulty a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dressing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty, to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0-3 where 0 = least difficulty and 3 = extreme difficulty. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde-modified Sharpe (vdH-S) Score at Week 24</title>
        <description>vdH-S score is defined as a measurement of progression in structural damage. It is the sum of joint erosion (32 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score and joint space narrowing (JSN) (30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score. The joint erosion assessment is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion and 5 indicating complete collapse of bone whereas the JSN assessment including subluxation, is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 448 (worst) with higher scores indicating more joint damage. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 24</time_frame>
        <population>Efficacy full analysis set (radiographic endpoints) had randomized participants received at least 1 (partial/complete) dose of study drug with non-missing baseline vdH-S score. It was based on imputed value by EE Rules: set scores after EE missing for placebo arm; and then missing data rules in all treatment arms using linear extrapolation method.</population>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde-modified Sharpe (vdH-S) Score at Week 24</title>
          <description>vdH-S score is defined as a measurement of progression in structural damage. It is the sum of joint erosion (32 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score and joint space narrowing (JSN) (30 joints of the hands and 12 joints of the feet) score. The joint erosion assessment is scored according to the surface area involved, from 0 to 5, with 0 indicating no erosion and 5 indicating complete collapse of bone whereas the JSN assessment including subluxation, is scored from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The total score ranges from 0 (best) to 448 (worst) with higher scores indicating more joint damage. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
          <population>Efficacy full analysis set (radiographic endpoints) had randomized participants received at least 1 (partial/complete) dose of study drug with non-missing baseline vdH-S score. It was based on imputed value by EE Rules: set scores after EE missing for placebo arm; and then missing data rules in all treatment arms using linear extrapolation method.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde-modified Sharpe (vdH-S) Sub-score by Type of Damage (Erosion or JSN) at Week 24 and 52</title>
        <description>vdH-S score measures structural damage progression as sum of joint erosion(JE) and joint space narrowing(JSN) scores(S).JE is summary of erosion severity in 32 of hands(H) and 12 of feet(F) joints, scored as per surface area- from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete(CM) collapse of bone). Maximum (MAX) JES for H-160 (32*5) and MAX JES for F- 120 (12*10 [5*2 sides of foot]). MAX JES is 280 whereas JSN is summary of severity of 30 of H and 12 of F joints, scored to subluxation from 0(normal) to 4(bony ankylosis or CM luxation). MAX JSNS for H-120(30*4), and MAX JSS for F-48(12*4). MAX JSNS is 168.Thus MAX JES-280 combined with MAX JSNS-168 gives worst possible vdH-SS (i.e., JE score + JSN score) of 448. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Change From Baseline in Van Der Heijde Modified Sharpe Score (vdH-S Score) Greater Than Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>vdH-S score measures structural damage progression as sum of joint erosion(JE) and joint space narrowing(JSN) scores(S). JE is summary of erosion severity in 32 of hand and 12 of feet joints, scored according to the surface area, from 0 (no erosion) to 5 (complete collapse of bone) whereas the JSN is summary of severity of 30 of hand and 12 of feet joints, scored according to the subluxation from 0 (normal) to 4 (bony ankylosis or complete luxation). The SDC is smallest change in score that is considered to be assessed correctly based on limits of agreement (that is., above the measurement error). The SDC for change from baseline in vdH-S Score is determined as: SDC=1.96 * SD / (root 2 * root k), where SD is the standard deviation of the difference between 2 readers in change from baseline in vdH-S score; k is the number of readers. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <population>Efficacy full analysis set (radiographic endpoints) had randomized participants received at least 1 (partial/complete) dose of study drug with non-missing baseline vdH-S score. It was based on imputed value by EE Rules: set scores after EE missing for placebo arm; and then missing data rules in all treatment arms using linear extrapolation method.</population>

MAX JSNS for H-120(30*4), and MAX JSS for F-48(12*4). MAX JSNS is 168.Thus MAX JES-280 combined with MAX JSNS-168 gives worst possible vdH-SS of (i.e., erosion score + JSN score) 448.

        <description>Serum CRP is a marker of systemic inflammation. A negative change from baseline in CRP represents improvement. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values. The last observation at or prior to EE/LE was used to replace the data after EE/LE for participants who met EE/LE criteria.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Duration of Morning Stiffness Through Week 52</title>
        <description>Duration of morning stiffness was defined as the time elapsed when participant woke up in the morning and was able to resume normal activities without stiffness in minutes (If none was present = 0; If morning stiffness was continuing at the time of assessment or was unusual compared to the recent past, average of duration of stiffness over the past 3 days was reported; If stiffness persisted the entire day, 1440 minutes was recorded). Negative values for this outcome measure represent improvement, i.e. shortening of duration of morning stiffness. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Physical and Mental Component Summary Scores of 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at Weeks 24 and 52</title>
        <description>SF-36 questionnaire is health related quality of life (QOL) instrument with 36 questions with 8 multi-item scales (evaluated limitations in): physical functioning due to health problems; usual role activities due to physical health problems; Bodily pain; General mental health (psychological distress and well-being); usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems; social functioning due to physical or mental health problems; Vitality (energy and fatigue); General health perception. Each 8 scales scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Based on scale scores, summary scores, physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) will be derived. Scoring is derived based on algorithm developed in software provided by developer. Summary MCS and PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Participants were analyzed according to randomized treatment groups they were assigned regardless of treatments they actually received.</description>

          <description>SF-36 questionnaire is health related quality of life (QOL) instrument with 36 questions with 8 multi-item scales (evaluated limitations in): physical functioning due to health problems; usual role activities due to physical health problems; Bodily pain; General mental health (psychological distress and well-being); usual role activities due to personal or emotional problems; social functioning due to physical or mental health problems; Vitality (energy and fatigue); General health perception. Each 8 scales scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Based on scale scores, summary scores, physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) will be derived. Scoring is derived based on algorithm developed in software provided by developer. Summary MCS and PCS score is also scaled from 0 to 100 with higher scores= better health. Participants were analyzed according to randomized treatment groups they were assigned regardless of treatments they actually received.</description>
          <population>Full analysis set included all randomized participants. Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) method was used to impute missing values. The last observation at or prior to EE/LE was used to replace the data after EE/LE for participants who met EE/LE criteria.</population>

        <description>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue) is a questionnaire that assesses self-reported tiredness, weakness, and difficulty conducting usual activities due to fatigue. The questionnaire consists of 13 questions that assess a participant’s level of fatigue and tiredness over the last 7 days. Each question is graded on a 5-point scale (0 - 4); and accordingly, the total FACIT-Fatigue scores can range from 0 to 52, with lower score reflecting more fatigue and higher scores reflecting less fatigue. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in EuroQol Health State Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS)</title>
        <description>The EuroQol Health State Visual Analogue Scale (EQ VAS) records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical line, VAS where the endpoints are labeled as 0= ‘Worst imaginable health state’ and 100= ‘Best imaginable health state’. The EQ VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-3L Descriptive System comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension is assessed on a 3-point ordinal scale (1=no problems, 2=some problems, 3=extreme problems). The responses to the five EQ-5D dimensions were scored using a utility-weighted algorithm to derive an EQ-5D health status index score between 0 to 1, with 1.00 indicating &quot;full health&quot; and 0 representing dead. Participants were analyzed according to the randomized treatment groups they were assigned to, regardless of the treatments they actually received.</description>
