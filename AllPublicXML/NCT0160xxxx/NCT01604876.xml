  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate whether light therapy is a suitable
      treatment option for depression and insomnia in Parkinson's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease and their caretakers is mainly
      influenced by so called non-motor symptoms. This includes neuropsychiatric consequences of
      the disease like depression and sleeping problems. The incidence of depressed mood in
      patients with Parkinson is approximately 50%, the incidence for sleeping problems is 90%.
      These symptoms are often overlooked and even if recognized, inadequately treated. The
      treatment of mood and sleep disturbances in Parkinson patients is hampered by adverse
      effects, incomplete responses to the usual treatments and the absence of specific treatment
      options for these symptoms in Parkinson's disease. On the basis of the hypothesis of
      disturbed functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus in Parkinson's disease it is expected
      that stimulation of this nucleus by bright light therapy will result in improved functioning
      on multiple different domains: mood, sleep, motor functions, quality of life and circadian
      rhythms. Because there are virtually no side effects and the possibility of home treatment,
      light therapy is expected to be highly appreciated by the patients.
