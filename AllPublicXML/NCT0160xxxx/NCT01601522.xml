  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine how a type of treatment for peanut allergy known as
      oral desensitization works in the immune system.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Allergic reactions to peanuts and tree nuts account for the majority of fatal and near fatal
      food allergic reactions, and the only treatment is complete avoidance of peanut. Despite
      avoidance, the majority of peanut allergic people will accidently ingest peanut. OIT has been
      shown to desensitize peanut allergic subjects (Hofmann et al. 2009). This would protect
      patients who have no other treatment, and may even form the basis for true tolerance to
      peanut in the future.

      To determine the dose and kinetics of peanut desensitization (clinically and immunologically)
      in peanut allergic individuals who undergo low and high dose OIT.

      To examine whether the severity of peanut allergy as determined by measurements of PAF and
      PAF AH (possible markers of reaction severity) correlate with the ability of patients
      undergoing OIT to achieve desensitization To assess quality of life in peanut allergic
      subjects before and after OIT

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be between 5 and 10 years of age.

          -  Patients will be confirmed to have peanut allergy based on a history of significant
             clinical symptoms within 60 minutes after the ingestion of peanut,the presence of
             specific IgE to peanut (a positive skin prick test to peanut, defined as a wheal 3 mm
             larger than that of the saline control; and a positive in vitro IgE [CAP-FEIA] result
             of &gt;15 kU/L..

          -  Patients will also be accepted into the study if they have a clinical reaction to
             peanut ingestion within the past 6 months, a positive skin prick test to peanut as
             defined previously, and an in vitro peanut IgE (CAP-FEIA) result of 7 kU/L or greater.

          -  Subjects must be free of any clinically significant disease which may interfere with
             study evaluations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of antihistamines or decongestant therapy 7 days prior to the clinic visit.
             (antihistamines eg. diphenhydramine, desloratadine etc or throughout the
             desensitization phase of the study.

          -  Patients who had an acute allergic reaction to food other than peanut, drugs, or
             stinging insects one month prior to the recruitment clinic visit

          -  Patients who have had a respiratory infection one month prior to the recruitment
             clinic visit.

             day or the corresponding combination inhalers, oral prednisone in the preceding 1
             month and FEV1 &lt; 80% predicted). Nasal steroids, bronchodilators and leukotriene
             inhibitors will be permitted. If Prednisone is taken, it must also be stopped 1 month
             prior to blood being drawn if possible.

          -  Patients who received allergy injections (immunotherapy) to environmental allergens at
             any time in the past. Symptomatic atopic dermatitis or chronic urticaria which may
             interfere with ability to evaluate oral immunotherapy and /or requiring daily
             medication including antihistamines.
