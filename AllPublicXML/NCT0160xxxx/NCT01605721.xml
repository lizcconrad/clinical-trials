      Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the safety and long-term effectiveness of coronary stenting with the XIENCE
           PRIMETM in a cohort of &quot;real world&quot; patients and lesion subsets.

        2. To determine clinical device and procedural success during commercial use of XIENCE
           PRIMETM coronary stent

      Study population : Approximately consecutive 2000 patients treated with XIENCE PRIMETM

      Study period

        -  Patient enrollment: 2011.05 ~ 2012.04

        -  End of follow-up period: 2015. 02 (3 years of follow-up)

      Primary endpoint

      : Target Lesion Failure (TLF) rate at 12 months

      Secondary endpoint:

        -  In-stent &amp; In-segment Late Loss at 9 months

        -  Stent Thrombosis at 24 hours (acute), 30 days (subacute), 1 year (late), yearly up to 3
           years (very late)

        -  Target Vessel Failure at 12 months (composite of cardiac death, MI, and TVR)

        -  Any death, cardiac death, MI, TLR, TVR at 30 days, 9months, 1 year, 3 years

        -  Composite rate of cardiac death and any MI up to 3 years

        -  Composite rate of all death and any MI up to 3 years

        -  Composite rate of all death, any MI (Q-wave and non Q-wave) and any repeat
           revascularization up to 3 years

        -  Compliance and therapy interruptions with prescribed adjunctive antiplatelet therapy up
           to 3 years

        -  Procedural success up to 1 day

        -  Angiographic success up to 1 day
