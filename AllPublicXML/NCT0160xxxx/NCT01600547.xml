  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis and falls occur with increasing frequency among the elderly. Osteoporosis and
      fall increases the risk of fracture. Falls in the elderly are associated with a high
      morbidity and mortality with potentially life-threatening consequences of falls including
      fractures. Besides fracture fall may cause long term problems such as disability fear of
      falling and loss of independence. Today osteoporosis is diagnosed by bone scan of the hip and
      spine. The investigators want to investigate whether other more accessible and less expensive
      testing methods can be used to diagnose osteoporosis. Additionally, the investigators will
      examine the incidence of osteoporosis among the elderly in the municipality of Odense.
      Finally, the investigators would like to investigate the association between factors that can
      lead to falls and to investigate the performance of older and whether there are changes in
      functional ability over time.

      Study Objectives

        1. To define the prevalence of osteoporosis in a falls clinic population, and compare it
           with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic and
           non-fallers.

        2. To evaluate the usefulness of peripheral bone scanning techniques in a falls clinic
           population.

        3. To determine the prevalence of vertebral fractures in a falls clinic population and
           compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the falls clinic
           and non-fallers

        4. To investigate functioning, disability, health related quality of life and perceived
           need for rehabilitation in a falls clinic population including variation in a one year
           period, and compare it with two aged matched control groups - fallers not attending the
           falls clinic and non-fallers.
