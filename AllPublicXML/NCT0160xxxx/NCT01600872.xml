  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both oxidative stress and Bisphenol A (BPA) had been associated with polycystic ovary
      syndrome (PCOS). BPA, one of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), is an environmental
      estrogen used in the synthesis of plastics, is a &quot;high-volume production&quot; chemical with
      widespread human exposure. BPA was been reported in several female reproductive disturbance.
      However, the pathological pathway of BPA impact on female reproductive system had not been
      well-understood. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have a role in the modulation of gamete
      quality and gamete interaction. Persistent and elevated generation of ROS leads to a
      disturbance of redox potential that in turn causes oxidative stress (OS). The first part of
      The investigators study is aim to evaluate the oxidative stress impact on the biochemical
      parameters in women with PCOS; the secondary part of the investigators study is to
      investigate the BPA on the clinical and biochemical of women with PCOS; finally, the
      investigators plan to test the hypothesis that BPA might increase oxidative stress and then
      elevated ROS in women with menstrual disturbance, furthermore, the role of oxidative stress
      and BPA impact on insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance will be also investigated.

      Study and control cases will be included. Serum total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant
      status (TAS), Bisphenol A (BPA), and clinical/biochemical parameters will be obtained for all
      cases. Oxidative stress and BPA will be evaluated with all clinical/biochemical parameters
      for all subjects.
