  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subsidence of cervical cages is a common problem. For the study, a new polyacrylmethacrylate
      cage was designed and prospectively implanted in patients with a mono- or bilevel cervical
      pathology. As control, a commercially available PEEK-cage was used, patients were randomized
      using minimization randomization, controlling for age and bone mineral densitiy. The
      investigators hypothesize that the newly developed cage has similar clinical and radiological
      qualities compared to the PEEK-cage, but at a much more favourable cost-performance ratio.

    <description>VAS-neck will be measured prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. A difference of 20% between both groups is considered to be clinically significant, which is proposed for the experimental implant (PMMA-cage).
Cage Subsidence will be measured using lateral radiographs prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. Due to an improved cage design, significantly less subsidence is proposed for the experimental implant (PMMA-cage).</description>
