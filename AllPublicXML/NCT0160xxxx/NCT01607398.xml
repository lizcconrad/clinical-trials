  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in a respiratory specialist institute in Japan, with standardized
      techniques and data assurance checks to optimize data quality. The licensed dosage and
      administration of Adoair in Japan will be applied in this study. Each subject will receive
      treatment options in a randomized blinded fashion. Subjects will be randomized following a
      4-week wash-out phase to take either Adoair 50/250mcg twice daily or placebo twice daily for
      12 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group,
      12-week-treatment study in Japanese patients with COPD.

      At Visit 1, patients confirmed to be fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and not meeting
      any of the exclusion criteria will start the 4-week run-in period. During the entire study
      period, including the run-in period, the only drug allowed to use in addition to the study
      drug will be oxitropium (short-acting anticholinergic drug) as relief medication. At the end
      of the run-in period (Visit 2), subjects eligible for randomisation will be evenly randomised
      to one of the following two treatment groups and start the 12-week treatment period.

        -  ADOAIR®250 one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler

        -  Placebo one inhalation twice daily from the DISKUS inhaler

      Study completers will be defined as subjects who have completed all examinations,
      assessments, and study procedures in the study period, including the run-in period and the
      follow-up period. At completion/discontinuation of the treatment period, subjects will be
      switched to appropriate COPD treatment at the discretion of the investigator (or
      subinvestigator).

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Neutrophil Count in Induced Sputum at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Induced sputum samples were collected at Baseline and at Week 12. The neutrophil count in induced sputum was measured with the use of a cytological specimen of inflammatory cells in the induced sputum. Change from Baseline in neutrophil count was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value (percentage of neutrophil of total cells in induced sputum at Week 12 minus the Baseline value).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>INF-gamma-positive cells and perforin-positive cells were not detected in samples collected in this study due to the conditions of the samples and/or antibodies.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 and FVC are measures of lung function. FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Respiratory function tests were performed for the measurement of FEV1 and FVC at Baseline and at Week 12. The values were measured at 15 to 60 minutes following the use of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. Three technically acceptable values were obtained, and the highest value was recorded. Change from Baseline in FEV1 and FVC was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Week 12</title>
        <description>FEV1 and FVC are measures of lung function. FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Respiratory function tests were performed for the measurement of FEV1 and FVC at Baseline and at Week 12. The values were measured at 15 to 60 minutes following the use of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. Three technically acceptable values were obtained, and the highest value was recorded. Change from Baseline in FEV1 and FVC was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) at Week 12</title>
          <description>FEV1 and FVC are measures of lung function. FEV1 is defined as the maximal amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. FVC is defined as the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. Respiratory function tests were performed for the measurement of FEV1 and FVC at Baseline and at Week 12. The values were measured at 15 to 60 minutes following the use of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler. Three technically acceptable values were obtained, and the highest value was recorded. Change from Baseline in FEV1 and FVC was calculated as the Week 12 value minus the Baseline value.</description>

The CAT questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire (comprised of Question [Q] 1 to Q8) designed to assess the health status of participants with COPD. In Question 1, participants were asked to rate how much they cough on a scale of 0 to 5: 0, &quot;I never cough&quot;; 5, &quot;I cough all the time.&quot; Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 score minus the Baseline score.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) Question 6 Score at Week 12</title>
        <description>Participants completed the CAT questionnaire before undergoing respiratory function tests at Baseline and at Week 12. The CAT questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire (comprised of Question [Q] 1 to Q8) designed to assess the health status of participants with COPD. In Question 6, participants were asked to rate how confident they are leaving home despite their lung condition on a scale of 0 to 5: 0, “I am confident leaving my home despite my lung condition”; 5, “I am not at all confident leaving my home because of my lung condition.” Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 score minus the Baseline score.</description>

The CAT questionnaire is an 8-item questionnaire (comprised of Question [Q] 1 to Q8; each question scored from 0 to 5) designed to assess the health status of participants with COPD. The total score is calculated as the sum of the scores from Questions 1 to 8, for a range of possible scores of 0 to 40. A higher total score represents a lower quality of life, and vice versa. Change from Baseline was calculated as the Week 12 score minus the Baseline score.</description>

COPD exacerbations were classified based on severity as a mild exacerbation (exacerbation of COPD symptoms were manageable by the participant, not requiring systemic corticosteroid or antimicrobial therapy), a moderate exacerbation (exacerbation of COPD symptoms required systemic corticosteroid or antimicrobial therapy), or a severe exacerbation (exacerbation of COPD symptoms required hospitalization).
