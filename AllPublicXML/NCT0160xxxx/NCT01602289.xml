             investigator

          -  Part B2: Have histologic or cytologic diagnosis of advanced NSCLC with epidermal
             growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutation, Stage IV per the 7th edition of the
             AJCC Staging Criteria for NSCLC. The participants must have no other effective
             therapeutic option and be eligible for gefitinib therapy per Japanese package insert
             in the opinion of investigator

          -  Have the presence of measurable or nonmeasurable disease as defined by the Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or Revised Response Criteria

             study enrollment, whichever is shorter, and recovered from the acute effects of
             therapy (treatment-related toxicity resolved to baseline or ≤ Grade 1). Participants
             must have discontinued mitomycin-C or nitrosourea therapy for at least 42 days

          -  Males and females with reproductive potential: Must agree to use medically approved
