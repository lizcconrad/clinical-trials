    <textblock>
      Comorbidity of alcohol use disorder (AD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common.
      Currently available treatments often do not lead to sustained recovery from these disorders,
      possibly because they typically do not include exposure therapy which is considered best
      practice treatments for PTSD. This study compares exposure-based integrated treatment to
      integrated coping skills psychotherapy (a well disseminated practice) for comorbid AD and
      PTSD with the hypothesis that exposure therapy will allow those with PTSD to better sustain
      PTSD symptom reduction and reduction in alcohol use. The aim of this grant is to change
      common treatment practices for comorbid AD and PTSD by increasing the availability of
      evidence-based PTSD treatment for those with AD.

      Objectives. Co-occurrence of alcohol use disorder (AD) and posttraumatic stress disorder
      (PTSD) is common. Research supports exposure therapy as the front line treatment for PTSD as
      this approach is most likely to lead to sustained recovery from the disorder. However,
      individuals with AD are generally not offered exposure therapies because of beliefs that
      exposure would lead to engagement in greater alcohol use and other dangerous behaviors. Most
      research and clinical treatment for comorbid AD and PTSD (AD/PTSD) have involved coping
      skills based therapies that have generally not shown sustained reductions in alcohol use and
      PTSD symptoms. A growing body of evidence suggests these individuals with AD/PTSD are able to
      handle and benefit from exposure. This proposed trial will compare an integrated exposure
      psychotherapy to an integrated coping skills psychotherapy for the treatment of AD/PTSD. In
      addition, mechanisms of change for Veterans with AD/PTSD in both treatment conditions,
      including therapy process variables, changes in negative affect, and sleep problems, will be
      explored. This project addresses a critical barrier in the field - the widely held belief
      that individuals with AD and PTSD cannot tolerate exposure therapy, although it is the best
      practice treatment for PTSD. The fundamental rationale is to improve the evidence base that
      informs how patients with AD/PTSD can attain sustained recovery. The investigators propose a
      randomized controlled trial to evaluate an integrated exposure-based treatment for concurrent
      AD and PTSD. The primary aim will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the
      effects of integrated exposure psychotherapy when compared to a present-focused coping skills
      based intervention (Seeking Safety; SS) in 148 male and female Veterans who have AD and PTSD.
      The hypotheses are that at post-treatment both groups will show reductions in alcohol use,
      but the integrated exposure group will demonstrate greater reductions in PTSD symptoms than
      SS. At 5- and 8-month post-baseline follow-up, the integrated exposure group will have
      significantly fewer percent drinking days and fewer PTSD symptoms than SS. In addition,
      mechanisms of change in both treatment conditions will be examined.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Veterans who were victims of psychological trauma that occurred in childhood or
             adulthood.

          -  At least one month post-trauma.

          -  Age 18 or older.

          -  Meeting diagnostic criteria for current alcohol dependence and PTSD.

          -  Literate in English.

          -  Intend to stay in San Diego during study participation.

          -  Willing to attend psychotherapy and measurement sessions.

          -  Willing to stay cut down alcohol use significantly during treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Moderate or severe cognitive impairment on the Brief Neuropsychological (NP)
             Assessment Battery as this may interfere with ability to benefit from treatment.

          -  Acutely suicidal individuals will be referred for more appropriate treatment.

          -  Histories of psychosis or mania independent of substance use will be excluded because
             the presence of these disorders can impede therapy progress.

          -  Individuals who use intravenous drugs will be excluded.

          -  Participants who do not have adequate memory of the trauma will be excluded because
             such memory is necessary for exposure therapy.

          -  Only Veterans residing within 50 miles of the site will be included.

          -  Those with life threatening or unstable medical illness, documented neurological
             disorder, or inability to read will be excluded.
