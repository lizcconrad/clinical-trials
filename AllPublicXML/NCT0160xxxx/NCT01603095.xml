             nature of the study has been explained and prior to performance of any
             research-related procedure. Also, willing and able to provide written assent (as
             needed) after the nature of the study has been explained and prior to performance of
             any research-related procedure.

             pseudoachondroplasia)

          -  Have any of the following disorders:

               -  Hypothyroidism

          -  Have a history of any of the following:

               -  Renal insufficiency

               -  Anemia

          -  Cardiac or vascular disease, including the following:

               -  Cardiac dysfunction (abnormal echocardiogram [ECHO] including left ventricle [LV]
                  mass) at Screening Visit

               -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

               -  Congenital heart disease

               -  Cerebrovascular disease, aortic insufficiency

               -  Clinically significant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias

          -  Current treatment with antihypertensive medications, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II
             receptor blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac
             glycosides, systemic anticholinergic agents, any medication that may impair or enhance
             compensatory tachycardia, drugs known to alter renal function that is expected to
             continue for the duration of the study

          -  Have been treated with growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or
             anabolic steroids in the previous 6 months or long-term treatment (&gt; 3 months) at any
             time

          -  Have had regular long-term treatment (&gt; 1 month) with oral corticosteroids (low-dose

             treatment of ACH or short stature

          -  Have had bone-related surgery or expected to have bone-related surgery during the
             study period. Subjects with previous limb-lengthening surgery may enroll if surgery
             occurred at least 18 months prior to the study and healing is complete without
             sequelae.

          -  Have any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high
             risk of poor compliance with the visit schedule or of not completing the study.

          -  Concurrent disease or condition that, in the view of the Investigator, would interfere
             with study participation
