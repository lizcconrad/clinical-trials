    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to determine whether endotoxin levels and/or their
      trends can be considered predictive of morbility or mortality in septic shock caused by
      gram-negative bacteria, searching also for a possible correlation with Simplified Acute
      Physiology Score (SAPS II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), White Blood Cells
      (WBC) and Platelets (PLT).

    <textblock>
      Medical literature states that Endotoxin (a structural molecule of the Gram-negative bacteria
      extracellular membrane) is able to activate target cells such as macrophages and neutrophils,
      inducing them to produce and release cytokine, nitric oxide and other mediators that cause a
      systemic inflammatory response that can evolve until to endothelial damage, shock and
      multi-organ failure (MOF).

      Since 2004 it has been possible to better determine the concentration and the activity of
      endotoxin in plasma, thanks to a reliable and quick to implement method: the EAA (Endotoxin
      Activity Assay) test, which is an alternative technique for detecting endotoxin in whole
      blood based on the detection of enhanced respiratory burst activity in neutrophils following
      their priming by complexes of endotoxin and a specific anti-endotoxin antibody. The EAA shows
      excellent performance characteristics in recovering endotoxin from spiked samples and can be
      performed within 30 min, using less than 100Âµl whole blood.

      Participants of this study (all affected by gram-negative septic shock) will show different
      values of endotoxin in their blood samples during their stay in Intensive Care Unit (ICU),
      and the investigators will try to figure out if these values and their trends can be somehow
      predictive of morbility and/or mortality, despite the small number of septic patients and the
      heterogeneity of their clinical picture.

      So, if endotoxin induces sepsis, can the investigators also state that high values and/or
      trends of endotoxin can be correlated to severity of disease?
