  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary research goals of this application are to characterize social factors including
      health literacy and numeracy skills of CKD patients and examine associations with knowledge,
      self-efficacy, self-care behaviors, and clinical outcomes, and to examine the impact of an
      efficient interactive educational intervention to facilitate patient-provider communication.
      The investigators will accomplish these goals by executing a cluster-randomized controlled
      trial and performing detailed analysis of baseline measures. The specific aims of this study
      are:

      Specific Aim 1: Determine the association of social factors with patient kidney knowledge,
      self-efficacy, participation in self-care behaviors, and clinical outcomes in moderate to
      advanced CKD.

      Hypothesis: In patients with CKD, low health literacy and numeracy is common and associated
      with older age, non-white race, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic (income)
      status, less kidney knowledge, lower self-efficacy of self-care, and less adherence with
      medication and diet self-care recommendations. Low literacy/numeracy is also associated with
      higher blood pressures, more proteinuria, and more severe dysfunction of renal clearance.

      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of a tailored literacy-sensitive educational tool used
      cooperatively by physicians and patients to improve self-care and outcomes in CKD.

      Hypothesis: Utilization of a concise literacy-sensitive physician-delivered educational tool
      will be feasible and associated with higher patient kidney knowledge, self-efficacy of
      self-care and greater adherence to medication and nutrition recommendations compared to usual
      care.
