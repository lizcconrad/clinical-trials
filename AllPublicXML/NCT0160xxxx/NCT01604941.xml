    <measure>Change From Baseline in Liver Iron Concentration (LIC) as Assessed by FerriScan R2 Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by determining LIC. Abdominal MRI data were collected by using FerriScan R2 standard procedures and used to determine LIC. A negative change from baseline indicates that LIC decreased. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in LIC Adjusted by Transfusional Iron Intake And Assessed by FerriScan R2 MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by determining LIC and adjusting for transfusional iron intake. Abdominal MRI data were collected by using FerriScan R2 standard procedures and used to determine LIC. A negative change from baseline indicates that LIC decreased. For participants who had a blood transfusion on the MRI exam date, the blood transfusion done immediately prior to the MRI exam date was included in the calculation of daily transfusion intake. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Cardiac T2* Relaxation Rate, an MRI Parameter Used to Estimate Cardiac Iron Load</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 and 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by estimating cardiac iron load. T2* data from cardiac MRI were collected by using standard procedures and used as an estimate of cardiac iron load. T2* is an MR relaxation parameter that is reported in milliseconds. Iron within a tissue decreases homogeneity of the magnetic field and shortens the T2* relaxation rate (Anderson, 2001). Low cardiac T2* values are associated with increased risk of heart failure (Kirk, 2009). A negative change from baseline in the T2* relaxation rate indicates that iron load increased. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants Classified as a Responder by FerriScan R2 MRI Analysis of LIC</measure>

    <description>A responder was defined as a participant whose observed liver iron concentration (LIC) at the measured time point was less than the baseline value.

        <title>Change From Baseline in LIC Adjusted by Transfusional Iron Intake And Assessed by R2* MRI</title>
        <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by determining LIC and adjusting for transfusional iron intake. Abdominal MRI data were collected by using R2* standard procedures (liver and pancreas) and used to determine LIC. A negative change from baseline indicates that LIC decreased. For participants who had a blood transfusion on the MRI exam date, the blood transfusion done immediately prior to the MRI exam date was included in the calculation of daily transfusion intake. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Cardiac T2* Relaxation Rate, an MRI Parameter Used to Estimate Cardiac Iron Load</title>
        <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by estimating cardiac iron load. T2* data from cardiac MRI were collected by using standard procedures and used as an estimate of cardiac iron load. T2* is an MR relaxation parameter that is reported in milliseconds. Iron within a tissue decreases homogeneity of the magnetic field and shortens the T2* relaxation rate (Anderson, 2001). Low cardiac T2* values are associated with increased risk of heart failure (Kirk, 2009). A negative change from baseline in the T2* relaxation rate indicates that iron load increased. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

Abdominal MRI data were collected by using FerriScan R2 standard procedures and used to determine LIC. A negative change from baseline indicates that LIC decreased. For participants who had a blood transfusion on the MRI exam date, the blood transfusion done immediately prior to the MRI exam date was included in the calculation of daily transfusion intake. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in LIC Adjusted by Transfusional Iron Intake And Assessed by FerriScan R2 MRI</title>
          <description>The efficacy of SPD602 was assessed by determining LIC and adjusting for transfusional iron intake. Abdominal MRI data were collected by using FerriScan R2 standard procedures and used to determine LIC. A negative change from baseline indicates that LIC decreased. For participants who had a blood transfusion on the MRI exam date, the blood transfusion done immediately prior to the MRI exam date was included in the calculation of daily transfusion intake. Early Termination was within the protocol defined visit date +/- 14 days window and was mapped to next scheduled MRI visit for 3 participants.</description>
