  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of probiotic administration (Saccharomyces
      boulardii) on patients undergoing colorectal resections comparing to the routine protocol by
      assessing: (1)intestinal microbiota modulation using RT-PCR to measure cytokine in the
      mucosa; (2) assess postoperative complications, mainly infectious and mortality, as well as
      length of hospital stay

    <textblock>
      The intestinal microbiota, a complex and dynamic population of different bacterial species,
      under normal circumstances, represents an important contribution to the health of the host.
      This plays a key role by maintaining the integrity of the epithelial barrier and helping the
      development of mucosal immunity. However, under some stressful situations, such as after
      gastrointestinal surgery, infectious complications may be originated from the patient's own
      intestinal microbiota. This leads to the so called &quot;gut origin of sepsis&quot; hypothesis. On the
      other hand, under similar conditions, the supply of probiotics, the good bacteria, has been
      shown to be beneficial, despite few controversial results. Therefore, it is important to
      carefully assess the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of complications
      in surgical patients, as well as to evaluate the safety of its use.
