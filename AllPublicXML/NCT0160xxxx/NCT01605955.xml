        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects participate in the study on a voluntary basis

          -  All subjects should be in good health at the time of the study. Unless specified
             otherwise in the protocol, the following values could be applied: COHb&lt;3 %, MetHb&lt;2 %,
             ctHb&gt;10 g/dl;

          -  Inclusion criteria should serve the purpose of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Smokers or individuals exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide that result in
             elevated carboxyhaemoglobin levels, unless specific dyshaemoglobins are called for in
             the study protocol.

          -  Individuals subject to conditions that result in elevated levels of methaemoglobin,
             unless specific dyshaemoglobins are called for in the study protocol.

          -  Subjects who would be placed at undue medical risk associated with any procedures
             called for in the protocol (e.g. arterial cannulation or hypoxia).

          -  Age: young person and that of more than 50 years old.
