  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective evaluation of the cognitive function of in-house patients suffering from an acute
      traumatic spinal cord injury before and three months after the initiation of antimuscarinic
      treatment.

      The following hypothesis will be tested: Antimuscarinic treatment results in significantly
      worse cognitive test results three months after traumatic spinal cord injury compared to the
      pre-treatment results and the results of the control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be two groups: 1) patients receiving antimuscarinic treatment 2) patients without
      antimuscarinic treatment (control).

      The control group will be investigated in order to determine the effects of traumatic spinal
      cord injury on cognition and the natural history of potential cognitive impairment within the
      first three months after spinal cord injury.

      Six to eight weeks after traumatic spinal cord injury, patients are examined in order to
      determine the type of neurogenic bladder dysfunction they are suffering from. Patients
      suffering from an overactive bladder will receive antimuscarinic treatment in order to
      prevent high urine storage and voiding pressures, that put the kidneys at risk.

      Prior to the urologic examination, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be contacted.
      If informed consent is given, cognitive function will be evaluated in both patient groups
      using different standard neuropsychologic tests. The same neuropsychologic tests will be
      repeated three months later. Evaluation will take place under standardized conditions (e.g.
      time of day).

      Furthermore,different factors influencing cognition, e.g. depression, pain, medication, will
      be assessed at the beginning and end of the study.
