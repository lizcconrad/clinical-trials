  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use of information campaigns and educational interventions directed to citizens and supported
      by physicians, aimed at promoting the appropriate use of medicines, have been evaluated by
      several studies with conflicting results. These interventions are potentially relevant,
      favouring the reduction of unnecessary use of medicines and related risks. Several studies
      have specifically evaluated the promotion of the appropriate use of antibiotics in adults and
      children, with variable results. A controlled study has been proposed to evaluate the
      feasibility and effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention aimed at reducing antibiotic
      prescription by increasing awareness on risks of their unnecessary use.

      Information has been provided to citizens through several media (posters, local TV, radio and
      newspapers, video terminals, websites of Local Health Authorities). Brochures with
      information on expected benefits and risks of antibiotics has also been available, either
      with direct access in waiting rooms and pharmacies or handed out and mediated by doctors.
      Physicians and pharmacists received specific data on local antibiotic resistance. A small
      group of representative doctors have also actively participated in defining the campaign key
      messages. A sample of general practitioners and paediatricians have been trained in patient
      counselling strategies.

      The information campaign has been implemented in two Provinces of Emilia-Romagna during the
      fall-winter season (November 2011-February 2012). Change in the overall prescribing rate of
      antibiotics (expressed as DDD per 1000 inhabitants/day) in the intervention area will be
      compared versus other areas in the same Region. Knowledge and attitudes of the general
      population will be evaluated through a phone and internet survey on a representative sample.

      This study could observe a reduction lower than 5% in the prescribing rate of antibiotics.
