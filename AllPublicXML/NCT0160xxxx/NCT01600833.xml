      The purpose of this study is to study the association of serum ferritin and homocysteine
      levels with insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in women with polycystic ovary syndrome
      The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease, affecting 5-10% of women
      with reproductive age. Insulin resistance and metabolic disturbance are well-known long-term
      consequence of women with PCOS. Recent evidence suggests that increased body iron might be
      involved in the pathogenesis of insulin-resistance disorders, furthermore,
      hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic and
      thromboembolic disorder. The investigators plan to retrospectively review the medical records
      of female patients who visited the Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic at the Wan Fang Medical
      Center at Taipei Medical University from Jan 1, 2008, to November 30, 2011.
