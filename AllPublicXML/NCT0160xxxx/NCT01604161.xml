      This study is conducted in Japan. The aim of this study is to collect information about the
      efficacy and safety of Norditropin® (somatropin) in the long-term treatment of short stature
      with GHD (Growth Hormone Deficiency) where epiphysial discs are not closed and short stature
      with Turner Syndrome where epiphysial discs are not closed.
