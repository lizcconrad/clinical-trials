  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose escalation, phase I study to estimate the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) or a lower Recommended Dose for Expansion (RDE) of LJM716 in combination
      with trastuzumab in patients with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)
      overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) or gastric cancer (MGC). The study consists of
      a dose escalation part and a dose expansion part. LJM716 will be administered intravenously
      once weekly unless a less frequent dosing regimen such as every 2 weeks or once every 4 weeks
      is introduced. Patients will continue on their trastuzumab dosing, administered intravenously
      once weekly at 2mg/kg. During dose escalation, a minimum of 15 patients are anticipated to be
      treated in successive cohorts. The dose escalation will continue until the MTD/RDE is
      declared. The RDE dose selected will either be the MTD or a dose below the MTD based on
      safety and Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) considerations. Following the MTD/RDE
      declaration, approximately 20 MBC and 20 MGC patients will be enrolled in separate arms in
      the dose expansion part and treated at the MTD/RDE to further assess the safety,
      tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of the combination.
