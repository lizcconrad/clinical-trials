  <brief_summary>

      Objectives:

      Aim 1. Develop a prototype intervention electronic game that implements a baseline testable
      feature set, including features for social networking within a virtual game space, managing
      an intermittent mediated reward cycle, goal setting and tracking, and collaborative problem
      solving.

      Aim 2. Evaluate the technical merit, feasibility, user perception and acceptance of the
      prototype system with adolescents and young adults (AYAs) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCTs) patients in recovery.

      Feasibility Evaluation Phase:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will meet with the study staff during a clinic
      visit.

      You will receive instructions on using the video game through the internet. During the game,
      you will complete many different &quot;real world&quot; tasks that relate to things you should do to
      help with your recovery from HSCT. You will also be able to communicate with and compete
      against other participants in the study.

      You can use your own computer to play the game or one will be loaned to you for use during
      the study. You will be asked to play the game at home for 3 weeks. The number of times you
      will play during the 3 weeks will depend on your treatment schedule.

      You will be given contact information to report any problems or questions you may have to the
      study staff. You will also be called by phone after your appointment with your doctor or
      asked at a clinic visit if you have any problems or questions.

      Within 1 week after the 3-week period ends, you will have an interview over the phone or at a
      clinic visit. You will be asked about what you liked or did not like about the game.

      If you have been loaned a computer, you will return it at the end of the study.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 32 will take part in this phase
      of the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

      Needs Analysis Phase:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will take part in a focus group discussion.
      During the discussion, you will be asked questions about your likes and dislikes about a
      video game being designed by researchers. The game will be designed around tasks you should
      do to help with your recovery from HSCT. You will be asked questions about what features you
      might like to see in the game and what you think it should look like. The focus group session
      may last up to 1½ hours. The session may be audiotaped and researchers may take notes during
      the session.

      Several weeks after the focus group session, you will be asked to return and provide your
      opinions on documents and drawings researchers created about the game. This may be done
      one-on-one or in a small group session.

      This is an investigational study.

      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study. Up to 8 will take part in this phase of
      the study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <description>Primary feasibility benchmark based on responses to questions regarding users' perceptions of the technology. If 75% of respondents have a mean score reflecting positive responses (e.g., strongly agree or agree) to each of the 7 constructs related to users' perceptions, as described above, then feasibility benchmark met. Responses to open-ended questions analyzed qualitatively using Atlas.ti software. Responses to individual questions evaluated to look for common themes, and findings used to inform future development of the prototype.</description>
