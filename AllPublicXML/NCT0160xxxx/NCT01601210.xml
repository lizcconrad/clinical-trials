  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if creatine, which is a naturally occurring chemical in
      the body, is effective for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in female teenagers.

      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 2g, 4g, and 10g of creatine monohydrate
      for eight weeks will be associated with a significant increase in brain phosphocreatine (PCr)
      concentrations.

      The purpose of this study is to see if creatine, which is a naturally occurring chemical in
      the body, is effective for treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in female teenagers.
      Creatine may have effects of interest in the brain. The reason for the MRI component of this
      study is to learn about new ways to see inside the brain. The investigators will use magnetic
      fields and radio waves to look at the brain and chemicals in the brain. The investigators
      hope that this technique will have medial use in the future.

      The primary hypothesis is that compared to placebo, 2g, 4g, and 10g of creatine monohydrate
      for eight weeks will be associated with a significant increase in brain phosphocreatine (PCr)
      concentrations. A secondary hypothesis is that decreased depressive symptoms measured with
      the Children Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R) and Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating
      Scale (MADRS) will be reciprocally correlated with increased Î²-NTP concentrations.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Participants must be female.

          -  Participants must be able to grant informed consent (age &gt; 18), or parent/guardian
             permission plus participant assent (age &lt; 18).

          -  Participants must meet DSM-IV criteria for MDD, with current mood state depressed for
             &gt; 2 weeks.

          -  Participants must be between the ages of 13 and 21.

          -  Current CDRS-R raw score of &gt; 40 or MADRS score &gt; 25; and CGI-S score &gt; 4.

          -  Participants may be enrolled in individual and/or group psychotherapy, if it has been
             ongoing for at least 8 weeks.

          -  Participants must have been in treatment with an SSRI for at least 8 weeks, the last 4
             of which were at a dosage of &gt; or equal to 20 mg per day of fluoxetine or its
             equivalent, e.g. 20 mg per day of paroxetine, 20 mg citalopram, 10 mg escitalopram, or
             100 mg sertraline. If the participant attempted, but could not tolerate, a dose
             comparable to 20 mg fluoxetine, they will be considered eligible.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Unstable co-morbid medical, neurological, or psychiatric disorder.

          -  Current DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse or dependence (excepting
             nicotine/cigarettes).

          -  Clinically significant suicidal or homicidal risk.

          -  Pre-existing renal disease.

          -  Proteinuria on baseline urinalysis testing.

          -  Treatment with antiepileptic drugs, antipsychotic drugs, or lithium.

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding.

          -  Sexually active and unwilling to practice contraception during the study.

          -  Contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g. ferromagnetic implant or
             claustrophobia)

          -  History of hypersensitivity to creatine.

          -  History of a previous failed therapeutic trial of creatine.

          -  Participants may be outpatients or inpatients, but incarcerated persons will be
             excluded because this study is not approved for &quot;Research Involving Prisoners.&quot;
