    <textblock>
      The Cutaneous Heart Sounds Data Collection During CRT Optimization study is an acute,
      prospective, non-randomized multi-center feasibility clinical trial. The purpose of this
      clinical trial is to collect data to assist in the testing and finalization of a hemodynamic
      sensor-based cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) optimization scheme.
