      Older individuals suffer from falls and fear of falling. The purpose of this study was to
      determine the effectiveness of a novel virtual gait training on walking performance and fear
      of falling in older adults, and to evaluate the feasibility of the virtual gait training
      program. The investigators hypothesize that virtual gait training in older adults over a
      three week period will both improve gait parameters as measured by a GAITRite速 electronic
      walkway system, and reduce their fear of falling as measured by the Falls Efficacy
      Scale-International version.

      The objectives of this study are to determine the effectiveness of virtual gait training on
      walking performance and fear of falling in older adults and to evaluate the feasibility of
      the virtual gait training. This prospective interventional study plans to include twelve
      residents of senior assisted living facilities in Basel, Switzerland, aged 65 years or older
      with no severe physical or cognitive disabilities, and who had fallen at least once in the
      preceding 12 months. Each participant will complete 14 12-minute virtual gait training
      sessions within a three-week period. Gait parameters will be quantified with the GAITRite速
      electronic walkway system, and fear of falling evaluated with the Falls Efficacy
      Scale-International version. The investigators hypothesize that 14 virtual gait training
      sessions in older adults over a three week period will both improve gait parameters as
      measured by a GAITRite速 electronic walkway system, and reduce their fear of falling as
      measured by the Falls Efficacy Scale-International version.

    <description>The intervention consisted of 12-minute virtual gait training sessions once daily for a total of 14 weekdays within a three-week period. The intervention video showed walking legs of a 30-year-old woman for female and a 46-year-old man for male participants. The video screen was adjusted in height such that it corresponded to the legs of the standing participant, with a mirror placed above it. Participants began the training session with a circa one minute of concentration on the upcoming intervention. Afterwards, the video was started. Participants were instructed to stand (when necessary, to sit) and observe the video and mirror, and to imagine themselves walking. Training sessions were supervised by a physical therapist who gave additional instructions and comments regarding participants' visual/kinesthetic imagination of themselves performing the observed movement. Verbal and physical reactions during training sessions were documented in written form and sometimes videotaped.</description>
