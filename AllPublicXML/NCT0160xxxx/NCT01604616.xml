      The purpose of the article is, to investigate the efficacy and safety of perfluorocarbon
      liquid (PFCL) ,as a short term postoperative tamponade for treating retinal detachment
      ,associated with giant retinal tears.

    <textblock>
      a retrospective study wich compared 2 groups that had giant tear repair in one group, PFCL
      was left for few days as an intermediate measure until silicone oil or SF6 gas was used to
      reattach the retina ,and in the control group SF6 or Silicone oil were used, with no PFCL.
