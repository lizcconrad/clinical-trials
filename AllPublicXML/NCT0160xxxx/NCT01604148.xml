  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent detrusor overactivity (DO) after transurethral prostatectomy results in
      symptomatic failure in more than one third of the patients. Storage symptoms are major
      complaints in the early postoperative period after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate
      (HoLEP). To investigate the effect of DO in the patients with Benign Prostatic Obstruction
      (BPO), the investigators evaluated the changes in the storage symptoms following HoLEP in
      conjunction with the prescription of the anticholinergic drugs.

      Eighty men with urodynamically proven BPO underwent HoLEP at our hospital. All patients were
      evaluated preoperatively with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International
      Continence Society male questionnaire short form (ICS-SF), 3-day frequency - volume charts
      (FVC), transrectal ultrasonography, and uroflowmetry with postvoid residual urine volume. The
      patients were divided into two groups; BPO without DO (Non-DO group) and BPO with DO (DO
      group). We assessed the patients postoperatively at 2 weeks, 1, 3 and 6 months after surgery.
