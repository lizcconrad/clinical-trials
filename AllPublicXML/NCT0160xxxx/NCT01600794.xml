    <textblock>
      Because the society convention is changed, people are late for getting married, leading to
      increasing the bearing age in women. According to the previous study, if the age is over 30,
      the oocyte number in ovary has left only 10％ and 3％ in over 40 years old. The data is
      collected by Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health shows that there are about 7000
      people treating the infertility and it spends about 150000 to 250000 NT dollars in every in
      vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle, but the live birth rate is only 30％. So it is important to
      know how to estimate and approve the ovary function that lead to increase the live birth
      rate. The investigators plan to estimate the correlation between the serum androgens levels
      and pregnancy outcome in the women who have infertility problem. Furthermore, for the
      repeated IVF cycle, the ovary function might be re-evlauated because of the possible effect
      from stimulated drugs used on previous cycle. It's important to understand the ovary function
      for IVF patient to choose the appropriate drugs and dose.

      The investigators use blood and clinical test to analyze, the items for analysis are below:

        1. Routine blood test: FSH、LH、E2、P4、Anti-Mullerian Hormone(AMH)、

        2. Studied blood test: Inhibin B、total testosterone (TT)、Androstenedione、DHEA-S

        3. Clinical test: Ultrasound

        4. Personal condition. In order to finishing the test, every patient will be asked to
           collect about 10 to 15 cc blood for the research.
