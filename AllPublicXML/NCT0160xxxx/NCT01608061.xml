      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to evaluate the safety of DBS-f in
      patients with mild Alzheimer's disease by assessing all device and/or therapy related adverse
      events. The secondary objective is to preliminarily estimate the treatment effect size on the
      outcomes of interest at 12 months post-randomization. The objectives do not involve formal
      tests of hypotheses.

             medication for at least 60 days

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Must meet certain criteria on cognitive and behavioral rating scales
