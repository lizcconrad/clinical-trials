             during the past 6 months and according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
             Mental Disorders IV (DSM-IV) criteria. Subtype should be generalized and not due to
             etiological factors that would be unlikely to be related to hormone function (eg,
             depression, relationship discord, alcoholism, surgery, injury). Hypoactive sexual
             desire disorder as a co-morbid disorder is allowed only if it began after the female
             orgasmic disorder diagnosis;

          -  Have a score of &gt;15 with a score of ≥2 for question #15 on the FSDS DAO at Screening
             Visit;

          -  Be a sexually active, hetero- or homosexual woman in a steady relationship for at
             least 6 months and agree to have at least 4 sexual events over 28-day period of time.
             The subject's partner should not have any untreated sexual dysfunctions;

          -  Be on a reliable birth control method (ie, stable systemic hormonal contraception for
             the whole duration of the study and 30 days after study completion [for at least 3
             months prior to study], IUD, barrier method) or not engaging in heterosexual
             intercourse. Birth control method used by subject at screening is not to be changed
             during the course of the study;

          -  Have a normal ENT examination;

          -  Have a body mass index ≤35;

          -  Have a clinically acceptable pelvic examination and Pap smear as read by a licensed
             laboratory facility (no evidence of malignancy) within the 2 years prior to
             Randomization;

          -  Have a clinically acceptable mammogram;

          -  Be able to complete a web-based questionnaire within 24 hours of each sexual event;

          -  Be able to read English and provide written informed consent; and

        At Visit 2:

          -  Have at least 4 sexual events and an absence of orgasm during the 28 day
             Screening/Baseline Period as determined by MONASH WHP FSSQ.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will not be eligible to participate in the
        study:

          -  Have a known history of hypersensitivity to testosterone or any component of the study
             drug;

          -  Have a history of any clinically relevant psychiatric disorder that could impact
             sexual functioning, contribute to increased risk for patient safety, or significantly
             compromise participation in the study (eg, bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders,
             severe anxiety, eating disorders, borderline personality disorder, untreated Major
             Depressive Disorder);

          -  Have a score of ≥14 on the Beck Depression Inventory II at Screening Visit. Subjects
             with a score of ≥14 and ≤19 at Screening may be eligible to participate in the study
             if a specialist (psychologist or psychiatrist) concludes that the subject is not
             clinically depressed;

          -  Have other concurrent female sexual dysfunction disorders as defined by DSM-IV
             criteria, eg, Sexual Aversion Disorder, Substance-Induced sexual dysfunction,

          -  Be currently receiving treatment with selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors
             (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or medications that

             testolactone, ketoconazole, spironolactone, histamine 2 [H2 receptor blockers, etc.]);

          -  Have a history of, or current evidence of, abuse of alcohol or any drug substance,
             licit or illicit, or be a regular drinker of more than 3 units of alcohol daily (1

             decongestants, clinically relevant nasal septum deviation, recurrent epistaxis), sinus
