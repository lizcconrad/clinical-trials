    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PC-A11 with superficial
      and/or interstitial laser light application in patients with recurrent SCCHN.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 650 000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed worldwide each year
      (2). Europe alone, it is estimated that there are approximately 143 000 new cases and more
      than 68 000 deaths each year (3). The vast majority (&gt;90%) of head and neck malignancies are
      squamous cell carcinomas. Most (60-70%) patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
      neck (SCCHN) present with loco regionally advanced disease (2).

      Standard treatment options for SCCHN include surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
      Single-modality treatment with surgery or radiotherapy is generally recommended for the 40%
      of patients who present stage I or II disease. Each of the two modalities results in similar
      survival with cure rates ranging between 60% and 90% (3).

      For the 60% of the patients who present with locally advanced disease at diagnosis, combined
      modality therapy is generally recommended. For patients with unresectable disease the current
      standard treatment is concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiation. This is also the standard
      for patients with resectable disease when organ preservation is desired and, as adjuvant
      treatment, for patients with high-risk pathological findings at surgical resection.

      Despite such an approach, a substantial percentage of patients (20-30%) develop local and/or
      regional recurrences and distant metastases (3). Recurrent disease is often not resectable,
      and even in resectable cases, some patients decline the surgical procedure due to quality of
      life considerations. Additionally, in recurrent disease the radiation tolerance of the normal
      tissues makes re-irradiation technically challenging and frequently more toxic than the
      initial course (4). The prognosis of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN is generally
      poor, with a median survival of 6-9 months (5).

      The therapeutic ratio in recurrent SCCHN is narrow. Therefore, there is a large unmet medical
      need for novel treatments in this patient group, both to lengthen overall survival, and to
      improve the patients' quality of life

             sterile or with female partners of childbearing potential: absence of highly effective
             method of contraception resulting in a low failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year).
             These methods of contraception according to the note for guidance on non-clinical
             safety studies for the conduct of human trials for pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95,

             injectables, combined oral contraceptives, hormone containing intrauterine devices,
             surgical sterilization, sexual abstinence and vasectomy. Note: Abstinence is only
             acceptable as true abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual
             lifestyle of the subject, periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
             symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of
             contraception.

         21. Planned surgery, endoscopic examination or dental treatment in first 30 days after
             PC-A11 treatment.

         22. Co-existing ophthalmic disease likely to require slit-lamp examination within the
             first 90 days after PC-A11 treatment.

         23. Congestive heart failure NYHA Class III and IV. Cardiac arrhythmias (except for
             atrioventricular block type I, Mobitz type II, and Wenckebach type) signs and symptoms
             of relevant cardiovascular disease.

         24. Known allergy or sensitivity to photosensitisers.

         25. Ataxia telangiectasia

         26. Concomitant malignant disease, with exception of adequately treated basal cell
             carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma or other non-melanomatous skin cancer, or in-situ
             carcinoma of the uterine cervix.

         27. Evidence of any other medical conditions (such as psychiatric illness, infectious
             diseases, physical examination or laboratory findings) that may interfere with the
             planned PC-A11 treatment, affect patient compliance or place the patient at high risk
             from treatment-related complications.
