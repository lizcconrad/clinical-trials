          -  Male or female subject of any race and at least 18 to 90 years old

          -  Lower extremity full thickness diabetic foot ulcer of 30-364 days duration

          -  Subject's wound must be between 2cm² and 20cm² at screening

          -  Subject's wound must be at or below the malleolus

          -  Documented ABI is between 0.8 and 1.2 on the study limb or transcutaneous partial
             pressure oxygen (TcpO2) &gt; 40 mmHG; or a toe pressure &gt; 40 mmHG; or a Doppler waveform
             consistent with adequate flow in the foot (biphasic or triphasic waveforms) within 30
             days of screening.

          -  Subject or subject's legally authorized representative understands the nature of the
             procedure(s) and provides written informed consent prior to study enrollment

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with all specified care and visit requirements

          -  Index ulcer wound presents with clinical signs of acute infection, suspected or known

          -  Subjects with evidence of osteomyelitis or cellulitis or gangrene in the study limb

          -  Subjects with active Charcot's foot on the study limb

          -  Subjects with amputation above a Trans Metatarsal Amputation (TMA) in the affected
             limb

          -  Subjects with active malignancy on the study limb except non-melanoma skin cancer

          -  Subjects with planned vascular surgery, angioplasty or thrombolysis procedures within
             the study period

          -  Subjects within 6 weeks post-operatively of a vascular procedure.

          -  Subject has had prior skin replacement, negative pressure therapy, or ultrasound
             therapy applied to the index wound in the 14 days prior to screening

          -  Subjects who have received oral, or IV antibiotic/antimicrobial agents or medications
             have been used within 2 days (48 hours) of baseline.

          -  Subjects who have received topical antibiotic/antimicrobial agents or dressings at the
             index wound site within 2 days (48 hours) of baseline.

          -  Subjects currently taking steroids of &gt;10mg dosage

             renal, hepatic, hematologic, neurologic, or immune disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator would make the subject an inappropriate study candidate

          -  Subject allergic to a broad spectrum of primary &amp; secondary dressing materials,
             including occlusive dressings and the adhesives on such dressings.

          -  Female subjects that are pregnant or refuse to utilize adequate contraceptive methods
