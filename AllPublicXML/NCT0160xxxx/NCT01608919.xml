  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study plans to learn more about the role of 2 blood tests in predicting who might
      develop a blood clot in their arm or leg after major surgery. The investigators know that
      patients who have cancer and major surgery have a higher than normal risk of getting blood
      clots in the veins of their arms or legs. This can be very dangerous because the clot can
      move into your lungs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) after cancer surgery hospitalization is the most common cause of
      death at 30 days after cancer surgery, and is a significant source of patient morbidity and
      health care cost. Pharmacoprophylaxis has proven efficacy in preventing post-discharge VTE in
      surgical cancer patients, but perceived risks and costs pose barriers to widespread adoption
      by clinicians. Risk stratification of this patient population is necessary to allow
      appropriate prescription of prophylaxis to the highest risk patients. Can the investigators
      develop a risk stratification model that includes a readily available laboratory test, the
      thromboelastogram with or without platelet mapping?
