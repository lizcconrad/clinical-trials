      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the effects of two fixed doses of SSR149415 (250 mg bid and 100 mg bid) on
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function in patients with major depressive disorder.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the tolerability and safety of SSR149415 in patients with major depressive
           disorder.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of two fixed doses of SSR149415 compared to placebo in patients
           with major depressive disorder.

        -  To evaluate plasma concentrations of SSR149415.

      The study consisted of three segments (A, B and C). Segment A was a 1 to 4-week, drug-free,
      screening and baseline period. Segment B was a 4-week, double-blind period. After the last
      dose of double-blind study medication in Segment B, all patients had to enter Segment C, a
      1-week drug-free, follow-up period.

      The total study duration for one patient participating in all segments of the study was 6
      weeks.
