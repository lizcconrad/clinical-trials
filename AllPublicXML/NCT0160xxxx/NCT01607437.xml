  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No former studies have done long-term evaluation on patients reconstructed with hamstrings
      graft, the use of Howells tibial guide and transtibial drilling of the femoral graft tunnel.
      The investigators aim to evaluate clinical, radiographic and subjective outcome at a minimum
      of 10 years after surgery. According to former published studies on alike methods, the use of
      transtibial drilling of the femoral graft tunnel causes an increased rotational instability
      of the knee. The investigators aim to map the clinical stability of this group as well as
      evaluating the general outcome at the long-time horizon.

      Patients will be invited to a clinical follow-up with x-ray of the knee, scoring of Lysholm
      and IKDC subjective scores, clinical examination including instrumented testing with a
      KT-1000. After informed consent data will be collected from patient records and stored in a
      secured internal database. Analysis will be done with the SPSS package.
