  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential effectiveness of a new
      treatment for advanced and recurrent melanoma involving the combination of Ipilimumab and
      IFN-α2b before surgery and to test for biomarker studies in blood and/or tumor to better
      understand this disease, how best to treat it and what patients should be treated with this
      combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant therapy allows new insights into melanoma and its biological and immunologic
      response to therapeutic interventions, such as ipilimumab. Neoadjuvant ipilimumab therapy for
      high-risk melanoma patients with bulky regional stage IIIB-C lymphadenopathy may result in
      improved clinical outcome in this group of patients that are more likely to respond to
      immunotherapeutic interventions and without increased morbidity. Through the design of
      neoadjuvant trials in which it is possible to obtain biopsy samples, a greater understanding
      of the dynamic interaction between tumors and the immune system is possible. This should lead
      to the identification of new targets for the treatment of melanoma and aid in the development
      of new combinations that may have greater efficacy and acceptable toxicity, to build on the
      clinical, immunologic, and molecular effect of this therapy for patients with melanoma.

          -  Patients with intransit or satellite metastases with or without lymph node involvement
             are allowed if considered surgically resectable at baseline by the treating medical
             oncologist and surgical oncologist.

        eligible for this neoadjuvant study.

          -  Patients must undergo biopsy (punch) or open biopsy (if done as part of a clinically
             indicated baseline diagnostic procedure) within 14 days of entry into the study.
             Lymphadenectomy/definitive surgery will be performed after at least 2 and generally
             not longer than 4 weeks of induction HDI-ipilimumab therapy. Additional delays for
             definitive lymphadenectomy/surgery are allowed if clinically indicated while awaiting
             the resolution of potential adverse events from HDI-ipilimumab therapy.

          -  Patients must have been evaluated by standard-of-care full body imaging studies (CT,
             PET-CT or MRI) as part of the initial clinical work-up at baseline (no more than 4
             weeks prior to study enrollment) and after completion of induction HDI-ipilimumab (at
             6-8 weeks after the first dose of ipilimumab/HDI and prior to the definitive
             lymphadenectomy procedure).

          -  AST/ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical, radiological/laboratory, or pathological evidence of distant metastatic
             disease.

          -  Evidence of soft tissue involvement by gross extranodal extension of tumor manifest by
             fixation to the fascia, or matting of nodal tissue that would compromise surgical
             resection as determined by the surgical oncologist.

          -  History of acute diverticulitis, intra-abdominal abscess, GI obstruction and abdominal
             carcinomatosis which are known risk factors for bowel perforation.

             Guillain-Barre Syndrome).

          -  Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the
             Investigator/Sub-Investigator will make the administration of ipilimumab or HDI
             hazardous or obscure the interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with
             frequent diarrhea.

          -  Underlying heart conditions if deemed ineligible for surgery by cardiology consult.

          -  Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases (for up to
             1 month before or after any dose of ipilimumab).

          -  Prior treatment with ipilimumab or CD137 agonist or CTLA-4 inhibitor or agonist.

          -  Prior radiotherapy, chemotherapy, including infusion or perfusion therapy for current
             disease or any immunotherapy including tumor vaccines, interferon-alfa, interleukins,
             levamisole or other biologic response modifiers within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Concomitant therapy with any of the following: IL 2 or other non-study immunotherapy
             regimens; cytotoxic chemotherapy; immunosuppressive agents; other investigation

          -  Women of childbearing potential (who:

          -  Are unwilling or unable to use an acceptable method of contraception to avoid
             pregnancy for their entire study period and for at least 26 weeks after cessation of
             study drug, or

          -  Have a positive pregnancy test at baseline, or
