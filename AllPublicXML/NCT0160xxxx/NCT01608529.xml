  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has patented a restriction and filtering device ventilatory nasal flow FeelBreathe with
      the aim of increase nasal airflow resistance, therefore the objective was to examine the
      effects of FeelBreathe with lung ventilation and gas exchange during exercise.

      Background: Different devices are currently used to train inspiratory muscles, thus showing
      an increase in the physical performance. It is a control trial to investigate the effects of
      a new restriction and filtering device ventilatory nasal flow (FeelBreathe).

      Methods: A total of 27 trained male caucasian subjects (age: 32.5 ± 7.23 years) were
      recruited from different sports clubs. Measurement of maximum static inspiratory pressure
      were taken before exercise testing and an incremental test in cycle ergometer to volitional
      fatigue for the determination of gas exchange data. Each subject performed three identical
      submaximal exercises at 50% of ventilatory thresholds under different breathing conditions:
      1) oronasal breathing 2) nasal breathing and 3) nasal breathing with Feel Breathe,
      Restriction and Filtering Device Ventilatory Nasal Flow.

      Discussion: Researchers try to find if the new device called FeelBreathe causes changes in
      the lung ventilation and gas exchange during exercise. If the results show altered breathing
      pattern and cardiometabolic variables, FeelBreathe could be used to training respiratory
      muscles.

Jaeger ER-900. Germany) using three different conditions of breathing: oronasal, nasal and nasal breathing with FeelBreathe, with 10-sec sampling intervals using a open circuit spirometry (CPX Cardinal Health, 234 GmbH, Leibnizstrasse 7, D-97204 Hoechberg, Germany).</description>

    <description>Before experimental trials each subject performed a incremental protocol on a cycle ergometer (ERGO-Line GmbH + CoKG, mod. Jaeger ER-900. Alemania) for the determination of gas exchange. The test was stopped upon volitional fatigue of the subject gas-exchange data were measured breath-by-breath using open circuit spirometry (CPX Cardinal Health, 234 GmbH, Leibnizstrasse 7, D-97204 Hoechberg, Alemania).</description>

    <description>Inspiratory muscle testing was performed using a mouth pressure meter (Micro Medical Inc., Chatham, Kent, UK). The manufacturer states that the test-retest reliability of this device is ±3%. Maximum static inspiratory pressure was measured at residual volume and the best result from three inspiratory attempts was taken. At least one minute was allowed between attempts to minimize the effects of muscle fatigue.</description>

    <description>The Feel Breathe (FB) consisted of a small adhesive strip that is placed across the bridge of the nose during exercise. The FB was place following procedures for placement as indicated by the manufacturer's directions, while the placebo nasal, was placed over the nostrils of the subject, without interfering nasal breathing; thus, nasal airflow resistance was not increase. Each subject was required to perform three identical submaximal exercises with intensity at 50% VT1-VT2 under different breathing conditions. The breathing conditions were: oronasal, nasal and FB breathing. All participants performed three trials of stable load (50% VT1-VT2) for 10 minutes in the three conditions mentioned above, setting the cadence at 70-75 rpm, and controlling the same in all three exercise conditions.</description>
