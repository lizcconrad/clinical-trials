  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The extension protocol is a continuation of treatment with IPI-926, as administered to each
      individual patient during participation in their original IPI-926 protocol.

      Patients who are completing their participation in the original IPI-926 protocol in which
      they enrolled, as defined in the original protocol, and, have stable disease or confirmed
      complete or partial response as defined by the original protocol may continue to receive
      treatment with IPI-926 in the extension protocol.

    <description>IPI-926 is administered orally as a capsule formulation, as a fixed dose in mg/day. Patients will be administered the same dose with same cycle length of IPI-926 and combination therapy that they were receiving in the original protocol at the time of transition into the extension study. The following are potential once-daily doses that patients are receiving in original protocols: 60 mg, 90 mg, 100 mg, 110 mg, 130 mg, or 160 mg.</description>

          2. Currently receiving IPI-926 while participating in an Infinity-sponsored IPI-926
             study. Note: For blinded studies, patient's treatment assignment must be unblinded
             according to the instructions in the original protocol to confirm they are receiving
             IPI-926.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0 or 1.

          4. Documented response or stable disease, as defined in the original protocol, at the
             time of entry to the extension study.

          5. Willingness and ability to continue IPI-926 dispensation and follow-up procedures at
             the current investigational site.

          6. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, and
             laboratory tests and other study procedures.

          7. Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP), defined as a sexually mature woman who has
             not undergone a hysterectomy or tubal ligation or who has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months, must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test prior to treatment. All WCBP, all sexually active male patients, and
             all partners of patients must agree to use adequate methods of birth control
             throughout the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Discontinued IPI-926 or withdrew informed consent to participate in original
             Infinity-sponsored IPI-926 study.
