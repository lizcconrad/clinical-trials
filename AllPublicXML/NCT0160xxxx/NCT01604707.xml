      Background An increasing number of patients are suffering from stress-related symptoms and
      diseases. No scientific studies have examined the effects of Medical yoga on stress-related
      symptoms in patients in primary care. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Medical yoga
      treatment in patients with stress-related symptoms and diagnosis in primary health care.

      Methods A randomized, controlled study was performed at a primary health care centre in
      Sweden from March to June 2011. Patients were randomly allocated to a control group receiving
      standard care, or a yoga group treated with Medical yoga for 1 hour, once a week, over a
      12-week period in addition to the standard care. A total of 37 men and women, mean age 53±12
      years, seeking care for stress-related symptoms at the primary health care centre were
      included and followed up after the 12-week study period. General stress level (measured using
      Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)), burnout (Shirom-Melamed Burnout Questionnaire (SMBQ)), anxiety
      and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), insomnia severity (Insomnia
      Severity Index (ISI)), pain (visual analogue scale (VAS)) and overall health status (Euro
      Quality of Life-VAS (EQ-VAS)) were measured before and after 12 weeks.

      Main outcome:

      The Perceived Stress Scale is a 10-item self report questionnaire that measures persons'
      evaluation of the stressfulness of the situations in the past month of their lives. The
      citation for the 10-item scale is Cohen, S., &amp; Williamson, G. (1988). Perceived stress in a
      probability sample of the United States. In S. Spacapan &amp; S. Oskamp (Eds.). The Perceived
      Stress Scale is the only empirically established index of general stress appraisal. &quot;The PSS
      measures the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful&quot; (Cohen, et
      al., 1983; p. 385).

      PSS-10 scores are obtained by reversing the scores on the four positive items, e.g., 0=4,
      1=3, 2=2, etc. and then summing across all 10 items. Items 4,5, 7, and 8 are the positively
      stated items. Scores can range from 0 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater stress.

      The PSS is not a diagnostic instrument, so there are no cut-offs. There are only comparisons
      between people in a given sample. There are some normative data on the PSS based on a 1983
      Harris Poll of a representative U.S. sample. These data may be helpful in providing
      comparisons, but they are over 20 years old. See: Cohen, S., &amp; Williamson, G. (1988).
