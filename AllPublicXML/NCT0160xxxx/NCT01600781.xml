  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, controlled, open-label intervention study. It is hypothesized that
      supplementation with a fibre enriched sip feed will improve the nutritional status, gut
      microbiota and quality of life (QOL) of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and may
      enhance their immune response. This could give them a better chance to finish their induction
      chemotherapy successfully with fewer side effects.

      Study objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with a fibre supplemented paediatric sip feed
      on the nutritional status of Egyptian children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) compared
      to standard dietary counseling.

      Secondary objective:

      To evaluate the effect of oral supplementation with a fibre supplemented paediatric sip feed
      on the gut microbiota and quality of life (QoL) of Egyptian children with ALL compared to
      standard dietary counseling.
