  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study where AZD3241 or placebo is given to patients with Parkinson's disease in a
      blinded and randomized assignment. The main objective is to see if safety and tolerability of
      the drug is acceptable.

    <measure>Change from baseline in vital signs.</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (baseline), randomization, after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks after termination of treatment (week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs: systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse including orthostatic challenge will be assessed. Change from baseline at each visit will be calculated as the visit value minus the baseline value for each vital sign: Blood Pressure, pulse rate (supine and standing), weight and oral temperature.</description>

    <time_frame>screening (baseline), randomization, after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks after termination of treatment (week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Suicidality as assessed by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) The CSSRS assesses the suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation in patients. Occurrence of suicidal behavior is defined as having answered &quot;yes&quot; to a least 1 of the 4 suicidal behavior sub categories (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and preparatory acts or behavior) at any post randomization evaluation. Occurrence of suicidal ideation after randomization is defined as having answered &quot;yes&quot; to at least one of the suicidal ideation sub-categories (wish to be dead, non-specific active suicidal thoughts, active suicidal ideation with any methods [not plan] without intent to act, active suicidal ideation with some intent to act [without specific plan], and active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) at any post randomization evaluation.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening (baseline), randomization, after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks after termination of treatment (week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at each visit will be calculated as the visit value minus the baseline value for each continuous clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis measurements.
Abnormal or out-of-range values will be flagged.</description>

    <time_frame>Screening (baseline), randomization, after 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks after termination of treatment (week 14)</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline at each visit will be calculated as the visit value minus the baseline value for each ECG parameter: heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, RR interval, QT and calculated QTcF interval. Abnormal or out-of-range values will be flagged.</description>

    <time_frame>Randomization and after week 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples (5 mL) for determination of AZD3241 concentration in plasma will be collected in accordance with the information in the Study Plan. PK analysis will be based on the PK analysis set. Plasma concentrations of AZD3241 will be determined and PK analyzed by a population PK model.
PK analysis will be based on the PK analysis set and will include determination of observed Cmax, Cmin, and AUC0-t. Plasma drug concentrations of AZD3241 will be determined and PK analyzed by a population PK model. If the quality of the data does not allow a population PK analysis, plasma concentrations from all patients will be analyzed graphically and by descriptive statistics, as appropriate.</description>
