    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigational study is to establish the safety and effectiveness of
      electrical stimulation delivered to the spinal cord in subjects with chronic, intractable
      pain of the trunk and/or limbs and will be a comparison of the Senza System with commercially
      available SCS systems.

    <description>The primary endpoint is a composite of effectiveness and safety. Specifically, the primary endpoint is the percentage of randomized subjects (the ITT analysis population) and subjects completing the Primary Efficacy Assessment (the PP analysis population) who respond to SCS therapy (as assessed by VAS) for back pain and do not have a stimulation-related neurological deficit at the Primary Efficacy Assessment (non-inferiority analysis). Subjects who do not have a successful Trial Phase are considered failures (non-responders) toward the primary endpoint.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been diagnosed with chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs (VAS ≥ 5)
             which has been refractory to conservative therapy for a minimum of 3 months.

          -  Be an appropriate candidate for the surgical procedures required in this study based
             on the clinical judgment of the implanting physician

          -  Be 18 years of age or older at the time of enrollment

          -  Be willing and capable of giving informed consent

          -  Be willing and able to comply with study-related requirements, procedures, and visits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a medical condition or pain in other area(s), not intended to be treated with
             SCS, that could interfere with study procedures, accurate pain reporting, and/or
             confound evaluation of study endpoints, as determined by the Investigator

          -  Have evidence of an active disruptive psychological or psychiatric disorder or other
             known condition significant enough to impact perception of pain, compliance of
             intervention and/or ability to evaluate treatment outcome, as determined by a
             psychologist

          -  Have a current diagnosis of a coagulation disorder, bleeding diathesis, progressive
             peripheral vascular disease or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus

          -  Have a diagnosis of scoliosis that precludes lead placement

          -  Have an existing drug pump and/or SCS system or another active implantable device such
             as a pacemaker

          -  Have prior experience with SCS

          -  Have a condition currently requiring or likely to require the use of MRI or diathermy

          -  Have metastatic malignant disease or active local malignant disease

          -  Have a life expectancy of less than 1 year

          -  Have an active systemic or local infection

          -  Be pregnant (if female and sexually active, subject must be using a reliable form of
             birth control, be surgically sterile or be at least 2 years post-menopausal)

          -  Have within 6 months of enrollment a significant untreated addiction to dependency
             producing medications or have been a substance abuser (including alcohol and illicit
             drugs)

          -  Be concomitantly participating in another clinical study

          -  Be involved in an injury claim under current litigation

          -  Have a pending or approved worker's compensation claim
