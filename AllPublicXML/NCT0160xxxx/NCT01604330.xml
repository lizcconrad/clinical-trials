  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to show the effectiveness to a year of baclofen compared
      to placebo, on the proportion of patients with a low risk alcohol consumption or no,
      according to the WHO standards.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baclofen, a gamma-aminobutyric acid 'B-receptor' agonist, has long been used to treat
      spasticity from neurological diseases, at a dose of 30-90 mg/day. It appears today to be a
      promising but controversial candidate for treating alcoholic patients (Enserick, 2011) by
      reducing or even suppressing their craving to drink. A few case reports (Ameisen, 2005;
      Bucknam, 2007; Dore et al., 2011) and a retrospective study (Rigal et al, 2012) suggest that
      some patients might respond favorably to baclofen at higher doses than 90 mg/day. This is a
      randomized controlled trial versus placebo testing such doses.

      An extraction of patients DNA and a genetic analysis will be done after the end of the trial.
      In a gene candidate approach, the association of several genes with the efficiency of the
      treatment and its side effects, based on the literature, will be investigated using
      micro-array technology.
