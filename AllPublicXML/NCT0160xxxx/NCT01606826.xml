      The mission of the SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma through integrated
      study of its clinical and biological features and to evaluate their changes over time. The
      ultimate goal of these efforts is to promote better treatments for severe asthma.

      The mission of the SARP is to improve the understanding of severe asthma to develop better
      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.
      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, the SARP
      investigators have each identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the
      shared longitudinal protocol. Together, these longitudinal and mechanistic approaches will
      enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and pharmacologic responses and
      identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.

        The target recruitment goal for each center is 75% adults (age 18 and older) and 25%
        children age 6-17 years. Within the pediatric age group, an attempt will be made to enroll
        equal numbers of children 6-11 and 12-17 years of age. Similarly, an attempt will be made
        to enroll at least 50% females and 30% minorities.

        Given the mission of SARP, a diverse sample of subjects with asthma is needed to gain
        better understanding of asthma and its endotypes. Because there are a number of respiratory
        disorders that may be confused with asthma or confound asthma assessment, SARP enrollees
        must meet the eligibility criteria as outlined below.

        Approximately 49 Healthy Control patients, matching the demographic characteristics of the
        asthma patients, will also be recruited across the 7 site partnerships in order to generate
        reference data for biospecimens collected from asthmatic patients.

        Asthmatic Patients:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Physician diagnosis of asthma,

          2. Age 6 years and older

          3. Evidence of historical reversibility, including either:

               -  FEV1 bronchodilator reversibility ≥ 12%, or

               -  Airway hyperresponsiveness reflected by a methacholine PC20 ≤16 mg/mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy during the characterization phase,

          2. Current smoking,

          3. Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack years
             if &lt;30 years of age (Note: if a subject has a smoking history, no smoking within the
             past year),

          4. Other chronic pulmonary disorders associated with asthma-like symptoms, including (but
             not limited to) cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
             bronchitis, vocal cord dysfunction (that is the sole cause of respiratory symptoms and
             at the PI's discretion), severe scoliosis or chest wall deformities that affect lung
             function, or congenital disorders of the lungs or airways,

             asthma treatment or study procedures,

          8. Planning to relocate from the clinical center area before study completion,

          9. Any other criteria that place the subject at unnecessary risk according to the
             judgment of the Principal Investigator and/or attending physician(s) of record, or

         10. Currently participating in an investigational drug trial for asthma therapies.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. History of chronic diseases that affect the lungs,

          2. A history suggestive of allergic rhinitis, eczema or chronic sinusitis,

          3. An improvement in FEV1 of more than 12% following 4 puffs of albuterol,

          4. Smoking history &gt; 10 pack years if ≥30 years of age, or smoking history &gt; 5 pack years
             if &lt;30 years of age, or any smoking within the past year,

          5. Respiratory tract infection within the past 4 weeks,
