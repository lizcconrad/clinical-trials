      The purpose of the study is

        1. To establish the feasibility of fMRI studies of the interaction of guanfacine and
           ketamine.

        2. To explore the possibility that guanfacine can ameliorate the negative effects of
           ketamine on task-related prefrontal activation.

        3. To assess the strength of any interaction between guanfacine and ketamine.

      Potential subjects will be interviewed over the phone and, if appropriate, will be scheduled
      for a screening session. Participants who meet study criteria will participate in two study
      sessions separated by at least two weeks. The sessions will be identical except on one day
      they will receive guanfacine and on the other, they will receive a placebo.

      This study was initially completed in 2014. Upon analysis of the collected data, it was
      decided to add additional subjects and gather additional data to verify results seen in the
      collected data. The study was reopened and new data was added beginning in September 2016.
      Information about the study beginning in 2016 is available in a separate record.

    <description>Subjects will be given 3mg of guanfacine before the fMRI scan. Then when in the scanner, a bolus of ketamine (0.23mg/kg over 1 min) will be given during the visual fixation scan. Immediately after completion of the 1 min bolus, the participant will receive a steady state ketamine infusion of 0.58 mg/kg/hour and brain activation will be measured during a spatial working memory task. The entire scan will last approximately two and a half hours and the ketamine infusion will be up to one hour and 15 minutes.</description>

          <title>Guanfacine Then Placebo</title>
          <description>During the first study session, the participant will receive guanfacine before undergoing a ketamine-infusion fMRI. During the second study session, at least two weeks later, the participant will receive a placebo before undergoing a ketamine-infusion fMRI.
Guanfacine then Placebo: During the first study session, the patient will be given 3mg of guanfacine before the fMRI scan. Then when in the scanner, a bolus of ketamine (0.23mg/kg over 1 min) will be given during the visual fixation scan. Immediately after completion of the 1 min bolus, the participant will receive a steady state ketamine infusion of 0.58 mg/kg/hour and brain activation will be measured during a spatial working memory task. The entire scan will last approximately two and a half hours and the ketamine infusion will be up to one hour and 15 minutes.
The second study session will be identical except that the patient will be given a placebo instead of the guanfacine.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Amelioration of Ketamine-related Task Activation as Measured by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Superior Frontal Gyrus</title>
        <description>Difference Score: Percent Signal Change in Regions of Interest (ketamine - saline)</description>

            <title>Guanfacine</title>
            <description>Subjects were given 3mg of guanfacine before the fMRI scan. Then when in the scanner, a bolus of ketamine (0.23mg/kg over 1 min) was given during the visual fixation scan. Immediately after completion of the 1 min bolus, the subjects received a steady state ketamine infusion of 0.58 mg/kg/hour and brain activation was measured during a spatial working memory task. The entire scan lasted approximately two and a half hours and the ketamine infusion lasted up to one hour and 15 minutes.</description>

Immediately after completion of the 1 min bolus, the participant received a steady state ketamine infusion of 0.58 mg/kg/hour and brain activation was measured during a spatial working memory task. The entire scan lasted approximately two and a half hours and the ketamine infusion lasted up to one hour and 15 minutes.</description>
