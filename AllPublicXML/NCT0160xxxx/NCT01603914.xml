      The aim of this project is to answer the following questions:

      To determine the incidence of catheter related bacteremia (CRB) with three strategies of
      central venous catheter exchange in critically ill adult patients with major burn and to
      determine the regimen that will minimize the risk of bacteremia.

      To determine the incidence rate of catheter colonization in adult patients with major burns.

      The scientific knowledge to be acquired through this project is of likely benefit to the care
      of critically ill patients with burns injury as follows:

      The intention is to improve the outcomes in critically ill patients by minimizing one of the
      most frequent causes of infection in the Burn Intensive Care Unit, those from central venous
      catheters. Decreasing infections will decrease morbidity, decrease length of stay, decrease
      costs, and decrease mortality.

      Aim: To determine the incidence of catheter-related bacteremia (CRB) with three primary
      schedules of central venous catheter exchange in adult critically ill patients with major
      burn injury.

      Hypothesis: A strategy of catheter exchange according with clinical criteria will result in
      no more CRB compared with a routine catheter changes without guidewire exchange strategy or
      frequent guidewire exchange or frequent new-site replacement.

      Background: The intravenous catheter-related bacteremia (ICRB) is a nosocomial infection
      affecting patients admitted to intensive care and that leads to increased morbidity.
      Accumulative incidence rates of ICRB are 5.5 infections per 1000 catheters-day. Several
      strategies have been proposed to decrease of the rate of ICRB in critically ill patients.
      However, there is not agreement to recommend a replacement pattern of central venous
      catheters in adult critically ill patients with major burns as a strategy for the reduction
      in intravenous catheter-associated bacteremia.

      Objectives. To compare three strategies of replacement from central venous catheters for the
      prevention of ICRB. Find out the risk of mechanical complications associated with each
      strategy of central venous catheter replacement.

      Method. Randomized, multicenter clinical trial, single blind to compare three strategies for
      intravenous catheter replacement in patients with major burns: a scheduled wire-guided
      strategy every six days: second, a scheduled strategy of replacement every six days in a
      different punction and third, a re-change strategy guided by clinical criteria for suspicion
      of catheter-associated infection. Primary outcome: catheter colonization rate and rate of
      intravenous catheter-associated bacteremia. Secondarily, we calculate the incidence rate of
      colonization of central venous catheter and finally we will analyze the associated
      complications.

      This project requires enough patients to show a difference between three intervention groups.
      A significant decrease in infection rate would be from the current 20 infections per 1000
      catheter days to approximately 15 per 1000 catheter days. This would require a minimum of
      1000 catheter days per group.

    <description>Routine practices for the type of catheter of each participating Unit will be respected. Multilumen central venous catheter will be used (i.e Arrowgard Blue plus Quad-Lumen CVC set). Impregnated Catheter with antiseptics or with antibiotics will be allowed.The anatomical locations selected for the replacement of central venous catheter are: subclavian vein, internal jugular vein, femoral vein and the change will be addressed according to the randomization.
The dressing and maintenance of the catheter will be guided according with the Guides of The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) and a check-in lists will be fill in for each catheter.
A pre-defined stratified analysis will be performed according with: type of catheter, participating unit, and insertion site.</description>
