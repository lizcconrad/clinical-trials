      Biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) occupy an essential place in recently formulated
      diagnostic criteria for AD where their role is to identify the pathophysiological processes
      underlying cognitive impairment or to predict time to dementia. Three of these biomarkers are
      brain imaging tests (amyloid PET, fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET, and structural MRI). In order to
      effectively use AD biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, continuous values much
      be divided into normal and abnormal ranges. This requires that a cut point(s) be established
      in the continuous distribution of values for each biomarker.

      The investigators objective in this proposal is to obtain imaging biomarker data in a group
      of individuals who are appropriate for establishing normative values for AD biomarkers. The
      investigators believe the most valid approach to establishing biomarker cut points is to base
      them on the upper bound of the range observed in young to early-middle-age subjects in whom
      the presence of occult AD pathology is extremely unlikely. Based on a large volume of
      community-based autopsy data, that upper age limit would be about 50 years old. The lower age
      bound for a group of subjects used to establish normative AD biomarker values would have to
      be based on considerations of brain maturation, which may continue into the middle- to
      late-20s. Thus, taking the above into consideration, the ideal age range for establishing
      normative AD imaging biomarker data (amyloid PET, FDG PET, and structural MRI) may be ages
      30-49 years old.
