      The purpose of this study is to determine if eszopiclone relative to placebo (sugar pill) is
      effective and tolerable for people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-related sleep
      disturbance. The investigators will also examine the impact of treatment on sleep patterns,
      memory recall bias, and level of inflammatory markers (cytokines). The investigators predict
      eszopiclone will lead to greater improvement than placebo in measures of PTSD symptoms,
      memory recall bias, and level of inflammatory markers.
