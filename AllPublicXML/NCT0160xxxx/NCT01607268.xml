  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will be conducted in patients with primary autonomic failure, a disabling
      condition that is associated with low blood pressure upon standing. These patients are also
      not able to control for changes in their blood pressure due to a loss of cardiovascular
      reflexes that are mediated within the brain. The purpose of this study is to determine
      whether magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a non-invasive imaging technique, can measure
      levels of chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the dorsal medulla, a brain area important for
      control of cardiovascular function, in autonomic failure patients. Importantly, this study
      will determine whether there are differences in brain chemicals between patients with
      peripheral versus central origins of their autonomic failure. The hypothesis is that the
      neurotransmitter profile in the medulla will be intact in patients with peripheral autonomic
      failure compared to those with central impairment. Overall, this study will provide insight
      into understanding the mechanisms involved in autonomic failure and will determine whether a
      single session of MRS imaging can improve the ability to make an accurate diagnosis in these
      patients. This would lessen the need for more extensive and invasive clinical testing.

    <description>Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy [1H-MRS] is an emerging imaging tool that allows for non-invasive assessment of brain neurochemistry in human subjects. This technique allows for in vivo quantification of the concentration of neurotransmitters and metabolites in discrete brain regions through detection of hydrogen nuclei in these molecules. Autonomic failure patients will undergo a single imaging session lasting 30 to 90 minutes (0.5-1.5 hours) in the Vanderbilt Human Imaging Institute.</description>

        Primary autonomic failure patients will be recruited from patients already in the hospital
        participating in the approved protocol &quot;The Evaluation and Treatment of Autonomic Failure.&quot;
        Prospective participants come from several sources including clinic patients, former
        patients, referrals from other physicians, and subjects that read about the Autonomic
        Dysfunction Center on the Vanderbilt website.
