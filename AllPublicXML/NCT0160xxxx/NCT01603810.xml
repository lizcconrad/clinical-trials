  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technique which shows the internal structure
      of living tissue (in vivo). It is safe, quick and painless to perform, and does not damage
      the tissue in any way. Recent advances in the technology mean that it can now be used to take
      images of the internal structure of the skin. This is useful because certain conditions, such
      as skin cancers, alter this structure. At present a suspected skin cancer is identified by
      taking a sample (a biopsy) which is analysed under the microscope to confirm the diagnosis.
      The cancer is then excised including a margin of apparently healthy-looking skin around it to
      ensure that the entirety of the tumour is removed. The excised tumour is then analysed again
      under a microscope to confirm that it was indeed completely removed (histology), after which
      a further operation is required to repair the defect.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate OCT imaging of a particular type of skin cancer
      called a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and in particular BCCs affecting the skin around the
      eyes (periocular). The study will compare the ability of OCT to define the margin of the BCC
      with the current 'gold standard' of histology. OCT could potentially improve the
      investigators ability to define the margins of the tumour before surgery and become a guide
      for minimally invasive surgery. The preservation of healthy tissue represents a priority,
      particularly in the area of the skin surrounding the eye.
