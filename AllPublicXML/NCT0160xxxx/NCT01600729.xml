    <measure>Inter-rater Reliability of Assessment of Facial Lines Using the 4-Point Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Inter-rater (among raters) agreement of the FWS-A scores (0= none; 1= mild; 2= moderate; 3= severe) was evaluated by Kappa statistics. Kappa statistics were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 66 participant's severity of facial lines in 4 areas (Glabellar Lines, Forehead Lines, Crow's Feet Lines on the Left side of the face and Crow's Feet Lines on the Right side of the face) at rest and maximum expression using the FWS-A scale. The overall inter-rater agreement for Kappa statistics for all raters combined was estimated by pooling Kappa statistics for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of Kappa statistics was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤ 0= poor, 0.00-0.20= slight, 0.21-0.40= fair, 0.41-0.60= moderate, 0.61-0.80= substantial and 0.81-1.00= almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for Kappa statistics was provided.</description>

    <measure>Intra-rater Reliability of Assessment of Facial Lines Using the 4-Point Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the FWS-A scores (0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics (WKS). WKS were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 65 participant's severity of facial lines in 4 areas (Glabellar Lines, Forehead Lines, Crow's Feet Lines on the Left side of the face and Crow's Feet Lines on the Right side of the face) at rest and maximum expression using the FWS-A scale at 2 different time-points on Day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for WKS for all raters combined was estimated by pooling WKS for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of WKS was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤0=poor, 0.00-0.20=slight, 0.21-0.40=fair, 0.41-0.60=moderate, 0.61-0.80=substantial and 0.81-1.00=almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for WKS was provided.</description>

        <title>Intra-rater Reliability of Assessment of Facial Lines Using the 4-Point Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS-A)</title>
        <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the FWS-A scores (0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics (WKS). WKS were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 65 participant's severity of facial lines in 4 areas (Glabellar Lines, Forehead Lines, Crow's Feet Lines on the Left side of the face and Crow's Feet Lines on the Right side of the face) at rest and maximum expression using the FWS-A scale at 2 different time-points on Day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for WKS for all raters combined was estimated by pooling WKS for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of WKS was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤0=poor, 0.00-0.20=slight, 0.21-0.40=fair, 0.41-0.60=moderate, 0.61-0.80=substantial and 0.81-1.00=almost perfect. The 95% confidence interval for WKS was provided.</description>

          <title>Intra-rater Reliability of Assessment of Facial Lines Using the 4-Point Facial Wrinkle Scale (FWS-A)</title>
          <description>Intra-rater (within raters) agreement of the FWS-A scores (0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe) was evaluated by weighted Kappa statistics (WKS). WKS were calculated for each of 7 raters who evaluated 65 participant's severity of facial lines in 4 areas (Glabellar Lines, Forehead Lines, Crow's Feet Lines on the Left side of the face and Crow's Feet Lines on the Right side of the face) at rest and maximum expression using the FWS-A scale at 2 different time-points on Day 1. The overall intra-rater agreement for WKS for all raters combined was estimated by pooling WKS for each rater using a chi-square statistic. The degree of agreement of the point estimates of WKS was interpreted according to the reference range scale that was predefined as: ≤0=poor, 0.00-0.20=slight, 0.21-0.40=fair, 0.41-0.60=moderate, 0.61-0.80=substantial and 0.81-1.00=almost perfect.
