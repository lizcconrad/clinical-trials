    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of
      activated recombinant human factor VIIgiven in conjunction with standard therapy in patients
      undergoing major orthopaedic surgery following traumatic pelvic or pelvic and acetabular
      fractures.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Injury due to a blunt or penetrating trauma causing pelvic or pelvic and acetabular
             fracture amenable to surgical reconstruction

          -  Scheduled for a semi-elective reconstruction surgery for fracture(s) of pelvis or
             pelvis and acetabulum, which was expected to be a &quot;large&quot; complex procedure with the
             potential of blood loss more than 50% of circulating blood volume

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral
             thrombosis)

          -  Patients with severe head injuries or an abnormal computed tomography (CT) scan of the
             head due to head injuries

          -  Body weight exceeding 135 kg

          -  Cardiac arrest following trauma and prior to surgery

          -  Known congenital bleeding disorders

          -  Known pregnancy or positive pregnancy test at enrolment
