          -  Co-sensitisation to any allergen possibly leading to clinically relevant respiratory

             treatment period.

          -  Patient with a past or current disease, which as judged by the Investigator, may
             affect the patient's participation in or the outcome of this study.

             to have a dental extraction during the study.

          -  Female patient pregnant or breast-feeding/lactating.

          -  Female patient of childbearing potential not using a medically accepted contraceptive
