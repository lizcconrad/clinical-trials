  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upon the completion of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for curative intent cancers,
      many cancer survivors suffer from a myriad of symptoms ranging from physical symptoms such as
      hot flashes, insomnia, and fatigue to psychosocial symptoms including depression and anxiety.
      Mindfulness Based Cancer Recovery (MBCR) is a type of mind-body intervention. Mind-body
      interventions are defined as practices or interventions that focus on the connection and
      integration of the mind and body and the ability for these connections to effect changes on
      physical, emotional and spiritual levels for the purpose of promoting health and well being.

      MBCR is a step wise standardized behavioral intervention of MBSR. The program is usually
      conducted in eight weekly class sessions that are 2-2.5 hours in length. During class
      sessions, participants are presented with mindfulness meditation techniques and share their
      experiences related to these meditation practices. There is a home practice component with an
      expectation of regular home meditation practice of 45 minutes per day. In addition to home
      meditation practice there are often reading assignments and reflective exercises that relate
      to mindfulness. A full day retreat generally occurs in the second half of the course,
      providing an opportunity for class participants to gain extended experience with mindfulness
      techniques.
