      This research is being conducted to test an imaging technique that may be able to detect
      small amounts of prostate cancer that can not be detected by standard imaging.

      Many patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer undergo surgery to remove the prostate.
      After this surgery, some patients have a PSA blood test that reveals a low but detectable
      level of PSA. This PSA may be produced by cancer cells in one of two locations: (1) near the
      area where the prostate used to be, or (2) elsewhere in the body. If the cancer is only in
      the area where the prostate used to be, it can be successfully treated with radiation to that
      area. If the cancer is elsewhere, radiation is not helpful. Currently, there is no available
      scan that can detect cancer when the PSA is still so low.

      The test used in this study is called [11C] acetate PET screening. [11C] acetate is a
      radioactive tracer that is given by vein to patients before PET scanning. The PET scanner
      then detects radioactivity from the tracer that is attached to cells within your body and
      uses this information to create images (pictures) on a computer screen.

      [11C] acetate PET scanning has been shown in early studies to detect smaller amounts of
      prostate cancer that can be detected by standard imaging tests such as CT scan and bone scan.
      If it is successful at detecting very small amounts of prostate cancer, [11C] acetate PET
      scanning will help doctors identify patients who will benefit from radiation therapy after
      their prostate has been surgically removed. It will also help them identify patients who have
      small amounts of prostate cancer in other parts of the body and will not benefit from
      radiation to the prostate area.

      This type of PET scan is investigational. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the scan is still
      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means
      that the FDA has not approved this type of PET scan for your type of cancer. The information
      collected by this scan will determine whether this type of scanning is helpful but it will
      not be used to make decisions about your medical care.

      If you decide to participate in the study and are eligible, you will undergo a single [11C]
      acetate PET scan. This scan is designed to detect small amounts of your tumor that were not
      detected by the CT scan or the bone scan. On the day of the scan, you will fast for at least
      four hours prior to being given the tracer injection by vein. You will then be scanned in the
      PET scanner. The entire procedure will take approximately 2 hours.

      The investigators would like to keep track of your medical condition after you have completed
      your scan. The investigators would like to do this by looking up information in your medical
      record during the year following the scan to see how you are doing. Checking your condition
      helps us understand whether the [11C] acetate PET scan will be helpful to other patients in
      the future.

    <description>Preliminarily demonstrate that the 11C acetate PET imaging of subjects who have experienced PSA relapse after prostatectomy for prostate cancer is more sensitive than currently available imaging techniques. Enrolled participants will have no evidence of recurrent disease on gold-standard imaging with CT abdomen/pelvis and 99mTc MDP bone scan (approximate sensitivity of 0%). The primary outcome is evidence of residual/recurrent disease as demonstrated by 11C acetate PET uptake outside of the prostatectomy bed.</description>
