  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II/III vehicle controlled, double masked, single center study. A single eye
      of 60 individuals with mild to moderate nonexudative Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)
      will be randomly assigned to receive either topical 1% MC-1101 or a vehicle control over 2
      years. The study design will assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of MC-1101 for
      these patients.

      An analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted when all subjects have
      completed 12, 18 and 24 months.
