      Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) is a life-long, chronic condition affecting an individuals' ability to
      regulate glucose levels in the blood. Diabetes can cause many severe complications if not
      treated properly. Hyperglycemia is a regular effect of uncontrolled diabetes and can lead to
      complications such as cardiovascular disease, chronic renal failure, diabetic retinopathy and
      inability to maintain a healthy body weight.

      Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is now the leading cause of death worldwide, affecting millions
      of people in both developed and non-developed countries. The buildup of cholesterol in the
      bloodstream may cause the excess to be deposited in the coronary arteries of the heart and
      the carotid arteries of the brain. The cholesterol deposits are a factor of the plaques that
      cause blockage of the arteries which can in turn lead to heart disease and stroke. By
      lowering the blood levels of cholesterol, risks of heart disease, strokes and heart attacks
      are reduced. Medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates are useful in the
      prevention of CVD.

      Pravastatin is a member of the drug class of statins, also known as HMG-CoA reductase
      inhibitors, and is shown as an adjunctive therapy to diet. It is known to reduce the amount
      of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood. In addition, pravastatin is indicated
      to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction, revascularization and cardiovascular mortality
      in hypercholesterolemic patients who do not have clinically apparent coronary heart disease.
      The recommended starting dose for adults is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not reach
      the LDL-C goal with 40 mg, it is recommended to use an 80 mg dose. For persons with
      significant renal impairment the recommended dose is 10 mg. Children aged 8-13 years have a
      recommended starting dose of 20 mg daily. Adolescents aged 14 to 18 years have a recommended
      starting dose of 40 mg daily.

      Depression is known as the most common mental disorder and most prevalent type of mood
      disorder today. It can be seen as a state of mood, a symptom, a syndrome or as a clinical
      diagnosis. Depression is a common disorder, affecting about 121 million people worldwide.
      Depression is more likely to co-occur with medical illnesses such as stroke, heart disease,
      cancer and diabetes. Up to one-quarter of people with diabetes are estimated to experience
      depression which is two times more than those who do not suffer from diabetes. Studies have
      shown that major depression mainly occurs in 2¬4 percent of people in the community, in 5-10
      percent of primary care patients and 10-14 percent of medical inpatients. Also, recent
      studies have estimated that the symptoms continue over a 6 month to one year period in
      patients with major depression. The severity of the symptoms and the incidence of medical
      illness are expected to predict the persistence of depression. Depression can be treated
      effectively by a variety of antidepressants and/or psychotherapies. If treated appropriately,
      over 80 percent of people who suffer from depression can be helped.

      Paroxetine is an orally administered selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)
      antidepressant. It was the first antidepressant that was formally approved in the United
      States for the treatment of panic attacks, major depression, post¬traumatic stress disorder,
      social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive
      disorder. Paroxetine has a well-established safety profile and it shares the common side
      effects and contraindications of other SSRI's which include nausea and somnolence and is
      associated with weight gain.

      This study proposes to conduct a retrospective cohort study to assess the risk of new onset
      diabetes among patients undergoing treatment with Pravastatin or other statins, and
      Paroxetine or other SSRI's. This study will compare the risk of co administration of two drug
      classes versus the use of each agent alone. In addition, the risk among patients prescribed
      Paroxetine and fibrates in combination, relative to the use of Paroxetine singly, will be
      examined to determine whether any interaction found between Paroxetine and statins extends to
      other drugs indicated for hypercholesterolemia.

      The first primary objective of the study is to estimate the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes
      (T2DM) among patients newly exposed to pravastatin in combination with paroxetine, or other
      SSRIs, compared to those newly exposed to pravastatin alone. The second primary objective is
      to estimate the incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) among patients newly exposed to
      paroxetine in combination with pravastatin, other statins, or fibrates, compared to those
      newly exposed to paroxetine alone.

        Data will be ascertained from the Thomson-Reuters Marketscan database, which contains
        administrative healthcare data among an insured population in the US between 2000 and 2009.
        The MarketScan® Databases capture person-specific clinical utilization, expenditures, and
        enrollment across inpatient, outpatient, and prescription drug from a selection of large
        employers, health plans, and government and public organizations (MarketScan Users manual).
        The MarketScan Databases link paid claims and encounter data to detailed patient
        information across sites and types of providers, and over time. The annual medical
        databases include private sector health data from approximately 100 payers. Historically,
        more than 500 million claim records are available in the MarketScan Databases. These data
        represent the medical experience of insured employees and their dependents for active
        employees, early retirees, COBRA continues and Medicare-eligible retirees with
        employer-provided Medicare supplemental
