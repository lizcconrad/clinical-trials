  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of toric high cylinder power intraocular
      lenses in a larger population in clinical practice and assure the continued safety of these
      approved devices.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective, non-randomized, unmasked study, subjects with pre-existing corneal
      astigmatism ≥2.57 diopters will choose to be implanted with either the AcrySof® IQ Toric High
      Cylinder Power IOL or the AcrySof® IQ Aspheric NATURAL monofocal IOL.
