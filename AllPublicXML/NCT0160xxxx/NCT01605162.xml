    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter study to assess the PFS-6m of E7016 at the
      selected dose of 320-mg once daily (QD) in combination with 150-mg/m2 of Temozolomide (TMZ)
      in subjects with wt BRAF Stage IV or unresectable Stage III melanoma with disease
      progression. Eligible subjects must have measurable disease according to Response Evaluation

                  aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 times ULN (less than or equal to 5
                  x ULN if subject has liver metastases)

         12. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than 50% on echocardiography or

             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [B-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity of
             25 IU/L or equivalent units of B-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is required if a
             negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before the first
             dose of study drug. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential
             unless they are postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the
             appropriate age group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been
             sterilized surgically (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or
             bilateral oophorectomy, all with surgery at least 1 month before dosing). Females of
             childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 days
             prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception
             (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method [such as
             condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive, or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

         14. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation).
