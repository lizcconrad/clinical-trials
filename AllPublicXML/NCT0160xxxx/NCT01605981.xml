  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, non randomized, prospective, multicenter, phase II clinical trial
      evaluating nilotinib 400 mg BID for the treatment of newly diagnosed CML-AP patients.

      Patients enrolled into the study will receive 400mg of nilotinib, orally, twice daily
      (800mg/day)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be evaluated for safety throughout the study and for response every month for
      the first 3 months, then every 3 months thereafter up to month 24.

      BCR-ABL transcripts measurement by QRT-PCR and mutation analyses will be done on peripheral
      blood samples and cytogenetic analyses on bone marrow aspirates.

      Laboratory tests (hematology, blood chemistry), ECG and physical examination will be done on
      every visit.

      Drug pharmacokinetics will be assessed in this study. For the screening Baseline periods, see
      chart attached

             considered of non-childbearing potential. Male and female patients must agree to
