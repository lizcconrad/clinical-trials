  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low systemic flow as measured by Doppler-echocardiography has been associated with poor
      neurological outcome. Yet, it has not been systematically evaluated whether the treatment of
      this hemodynamic condition is beneficial or not. This study aims to evaluate if treating low
      systemic flow in preterm infants with dobutamine has any effect on the cerebral circulation
      and in newborn prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While rates of survival for very preterm infants are increasing, a significant number of
      these patients suffer from neurodevelopmental disabilities. The pathophysiology of brain
      injury in the preterm infant is unclear, although haemodynamic disturbances during the period
      of transitional circulation after birth leading to ischemia-reperfusion events seem to play
      an important role. Up to one third of infants born under 30 weeks of gestation develop low
      systemic flow as measured by Doppler-echocardiography (low superior vena cava flow, SVCF);
      this finding has been associated with poor neurological outcome. Yet, it has not been
      systematically evaluated whether the treatment of this hemodynamic condition is beneficial or
      not. This study aims to evaluate if treating low systemic flow in preterm infants with
      dobutamina, DB, (inotrope-sympathicomimetic drug) has any effect on the cerebral circulation;
      specific interest of our research would be to target DB dose for individual patient´s
      response. Secondly, by means of two non-invasive technologies (cerebral and cardiac
      ultrasonography-Doppler and near infrared spectroscopy, NIRS), the investigators search to
      characterise eventual differences in brain perfusion patterns during the adaptation to the
      transitional circulation that might be associated with the development of brain injury in the
      most vulnerable population.

    <description>Patients with low SVCF in the first 12 hours of life will be randomized to receive Dobutamine or Placebo. First dose: 5 microg/k/min; second dose: 10 microg/k/min; third dose: 15 microg/k/min; forth dose: 20 microg/k/min. Dobutamine concentration will be prepared in a 20 ml syringe and the dose will be adjusted so each 0.1 ml/kg per hour increase in flow rate would deliver the corresponding step-increase in the drug infusion dose. Dose increments will be 5, 10, 15, 20 microg/kg per minute The study drug was increased in a stepwise manner every 30 minutes until the optimal SVCF was attained and maintained for 60 minutes (SVCF-OP). Treatment duration: 24 hours of postnatal age, maintaining the infusion rate which achieves the SVCF-OP.</description>
