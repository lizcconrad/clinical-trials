  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a geriatric syndrome leading to physical deterioration including muscle wasting
      (sarcopenia) and unintentional weight loss. There are currently no approved therapies for
      frailty. Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in the
      brain. The purpose of this study is to determine the optimal subcutaneous ghrelin dose as a
      potential intervention for frail elderly individuals. We will examine food intake and
      metabolic parameters after placebo and ghrelin administration at three escalating
      subcutaneously administered doses.

      This study is to determine the optimal ghrelin dose for use in a daily subcutaneous dosing
      study in frail individuals. Using data from our previous study and the published literature,
      we have designed a single blind, single dose administration study in which we will examine
      food intake after ghrelin administration and metabolic parameters (plasma glucose, insulin,
      free fatty acids, and cortisol) pre and post ghrelin administration.We have selected a dose
      range using our own and previously published studies from which we will determine
      subcutaneous doses to use in subsequent studies. The selection criteria for subsequent
      studies will be the dose that maximizes food intake by more than 30% without inducing
      hyperglycemia or raising cortisol levels. Participants must meet all inclusion criteria and
      have no exclusion criteria. Data will be analyzed after the first three participants have
      completed the protocol and used to inform dose modifications for the next three participants.
      Data from this portion of the study will be analyzed immediately after its completion, to
      allow updates to the design of the next study.

    <description>The first three participants will receive 2 mcg/kg as a single subcutaneous dose at Visit 3, 5 mcg/kg as a single subcutaneous dose at Visit 4, and 10 mcg/Kg as a single subcutaneous dose at visit 5. There will be 3-10 days between visits. The next three participants will receive either the same dosing at the first three, a regimen that includes an intermediate dose (e.g., 7.5 mcg/kg), or higher (e.g., 12, 15, and 18 mcg/kg) doses.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will include men and women aged 70 or older who are able to provide informed
             consent and are frail by the Fried criteria (Table 1).

          -  Table 1. Frailty criteria. Individuals with three, four, or all five criteria are
             frail.

          -  Weight loss: Unintentional weight loss of &gt;5% over the previous year

        Exhaustion: Two statements are read:

          -  I felt that everything I did was an effort

          -  I could not get going. The question is asked &quot;How often in the last week did you feel
             this way?&quot; 0 = rarely or none of the time (&lt;1 day), 1 = some or a little of the time
             (1-2 days), 2 = a moderate amount of the time (3-4 days), or 3 = most of the time. A
             &quot;2&quot; or &quot;3&quot; response to either question is a positive response.

               -  Low physical activity: Kcal/week of physical activity calculated from the short
                  version of the Minnesota Leisure Time Activity questionnaire.40 &lt; 383 kcals in
                  men or &lt; 270 kcals/wk in women is positive for this criterion.

               -  Slow walking speed: A usual pace, 15-ft walk timed from a defined standing start.

                  159 cm, ≥ 6 sec is positive for this criterion.

               -  Weakness: Hand grip strength measured with a Jamar dynamometer (Fred Sammons,
                  Inc., Burr Ridge, IL). The average of three measurements performed in the
                  dominant hand is used. For men with BMI ≤ 24 kg/m2, the cutoff is ≤ 29 kg, for
                  BMI 24.1 to 26 the cutoff is ≤ 30 kg, for BMI 26.1 to 28 the cutoff is ≤30 kg,
                  and for BMI &gt; 28 the cutoff is ≤ 32 kg. For women with BMI ≤ 23 kg/m2, the cutoff
                  is ≤ 17 kg, for BMI 23.1 to 26 the cutoff is ≤ 17.3 kg, for BMI 26.1 to 29 the
                  cutoff is ≤ 18 kg, and for BMI &gt; 29 the cutoff is ≤ 21 kg for a positive
                  criterion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             preparations

          7. Therapy with megestrol acetate or dronabinol within the last 6 weeks

          8. TSH measured as &lt;0.4 mU/L or greater than 10mU/L
