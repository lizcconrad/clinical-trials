    <time_frame>From pre-dose on day 1 until 12 hours post dose on day 8</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of co-administration of sildenafil on the pharmacokinetics of LCZ696 (analytes of LCZ696: AHU377, LBQ657 and valsartan) was assessed. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose from day 1 to day 7, 24 hours post-dose from day 7, and day 8 at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose. AUC is a mathematically-derived value from all measurements. AUC is a measure of the area under the curve that is obtained from plotting the plasma concentration by time point. All time-points were used to derive the single PK parameters.</description>

        <title>Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to the End of the Dosing Interval (AUCtau) of LCZ696 Analytes</title>
        <description>The effect of co-administration of sildenafil on the pharmacokinetics of LCZ696 (analytes of LCZ696: AHU377, LBQ657 and valsartan) was assessed. Blood samples were collected at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose from day 1 to day 7, 24 hours post-dose from day 7, and day 8 at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 hours post-dose. AUC is a mathematically-derived value from all measurements. AUC is a measure of the area under the curve that is obtained from plotting the plasma concentration by time point. All time-points were used to derive the single PK parameters.</description>
