    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study in healthy people is to evaluate safety, toleration and time course
      of plasma concentration of single oral doses of PF-06273340. The effect of food on the
      Pharmacokinetic of PF-06273340 may also be investigated.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects or female subjects of non-child bearing potential between the
             ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) of 17.5 to 30.5 kg/m2; and a total body weight &gt;50 kg (110 lbs).

          -  An informed consent document signed and dated by the subject

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,
             laboratory tests, and other study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or
             allergic disease (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic,
             seasonal allergies at time of dosing).

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (e.g., gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 14 drinks/week for females or 21
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 30 days (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  Screening supine blood pressure &gt;= 140 mm Hg (systolic) or &gt;= 90 mm Hg (diastolic), on
             a single measurement (confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary) following at least 5
             minutes of rest.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 msec at screening. If QTc exceeds 450 msec, the ECG
             should be repeated two more times and the average of the three QTc values should be
             used to determine the subject's eligibility.

          -  Females of child bearing potential.

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription drugs and dietary supplements within 7 days or
             5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose of study medication. Herbal
             supplements must be discontinued 28 days prior to the first dose of study medication.
             As an exception, acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used at doses of 1 g/day. Limited
             use of non-prescription medications that are not believed to affect subject safety or
             the overall results of the study may be permitted on a case-by-case basis following
             approval by the sponsor.

          -  Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 56 days prior to dosing.
             History of sensitivity to heparin or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with the Lifestyle guidelines described in this
             protocol.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
