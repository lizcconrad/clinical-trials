  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how well the drug valrubicin (VALSTAR®)
      works to help treat the patient's cancer when administered through a nephrostomy tube
      inserted through their back into their kidney. The study is also being done to determine how
      safe and easy it is to tolerate valrubicin at specific dose levels, as well as the way in
      which the drug is eliminated from the human body (Pharmacokinetics or PK).

      Eligible patients will receive percutaneous valrubicin beginning no sooner than 10 days
      following nephrostomy placement and within 6 weeks of tumor treatment/resection. Therapy will
      be administered at one of three dose levels in a 3 + 3 design (200 mg/75 ml diluent, 400
      mg/75 ml diluent or 800 mg/75 ml diluent). It is anticipated that at least 3 patients will be
      accrued at both of the 200 and 400 mg dose levels. Assuming acceptable toxicity, the accrual
      target for the 800 mg dose level will be 9 patients. If the maximum tolerated dose is
      determined to be 200 mg or 400 mg, expansion to 9 patients will occur at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) dose level. Drug will be administered on a weekly basis for 8 total
      treatments.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Zubrod: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2

          -  Tissue confirmation of UTUC

          -  Available tumor grade information

          -  Treated UTUC (complete resection and or fulguration of tumor as is safely possible,
             based on the judgment of the investigators and based on visual inspection of the
             involved kidney and ureter) and at least one of the following:

               -  Low grade urothelial carcinoma

               -  Percutaneous upper tract Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) failure and: High grade
                  urothelial carcinoma or Carcinoma in situ (CIS) with imperative indications for
                  nephron preservation (solitary kidney, renal insufficiency, bilateral upper tract
                  tumors, etc.) as determined by study Principal Investigators (PIs)

               -  Contraindications to percutaneous BCG (e.g. previous adverse systemic or local
                  reaction to BCG exposure as judged by PIs, or immunosuppression, or other
                  contraindications to BCG therapy) and: High grade urothelial carcinoma or CIS
                  with imperative indications for nephron preservation (solitary kidney, renal
                  insufficiency, bilateral upper tract tumors, etc.) as determined by study PIs

             present).

          -  Concurrent malignancy (except basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell
             carcinoma of the skin, or concurrent non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that has been
