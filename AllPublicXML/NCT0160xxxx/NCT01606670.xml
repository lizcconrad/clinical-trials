  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in the Sum Score Calculated From the 4 Items of the Affective Dimension of the Pain Description List (Schmerzbeschreibungsliste SBL, Question 10) of the German Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 0) to Visit 2 (after at least 4 weeks on a maintenance dose of Neupro®)</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Description List (SBL, question 10) is part of the validated German Pain Questionnaire (DSF).
The SBL consists of a 12 item list of adjectives. Each adjective is ranked from 0 (not applicable) to 3 (exactly applicable).
8 of the 12 adjectives will be used to assess the sensory items of pain and 4 adjectives to describe the affective items of pain.
The 8 sensory items are used to assess qualitative description of pain. For the 4 affective pain items, a sum score ranges from 0 (not applicable) to 12 (exactly applicable). Values above 8 can be considered noticeable.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 0) to Visit 2 (after at least 4 weeks on a maintenance dose of Neupro®)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a scale for the assessment of function in Parkinson's disease. Part II measures 'Activities of Daily Living'. It consists of 13 questions, each ranging from 0 (none) to 4 (severe abnormalities). The sum score of the UPDRS Part II ranges from 0 (normal) to 52 (worst score possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 0) to Visit 2 (after at least 4 weeks on a maintenance dose of Neupro®)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a scale for the assessment of function in Parkinson's disease. Part III measures 'Motor Function'. It consists of 14 items with 27 questions, each ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe abnormalities). The sum score of the UPDRS Part III ranges from 0 (normal) to 108 (worst score possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II+III</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 0) to Visit 2 (after at least 4 weeks on a maintenance dose of Neupro®)</time_frame>
    <description>The UPDRS is a scale for the assessment of function in Parkinson's disease. Part II measures 'Activities of Daily Living' and Part III 'Motor Function'. They consist of 40 questions, each ranging from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe abnormalities). The sum score of the UPDRS Part II+III ranges from 0 (normal) to 160 (worst score possible).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Visit 2 in the Short-form Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline (Day 0) to Visit 2 (after at least 4 weeks on a maintenance dose of Neupro®)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-8 is a self-administered 8 item questionnaire that assesses the overall health status. The questions will be rated from 0 (never) to 4 (always [or cannot do at all]). The total score ranges from 0 (never) to 32 (always [or cannot do at all]) with lower scores indicating a better health status.</description>

        <description>The Pain Description List (SBL, question 10) is part of the validated German Pain Questionnaire (DSF).
The SBL consists of a 12 item list of adjectives. Each adjective is ranked from 0 (not applicable) to 3 (exactly applicable).
8 of the 12 adjectives will be used to assess the sensory items of pain and 4 adjectives to describe the affective items of pain.
The 8 sensory items are used to assess qualitative description of pain. For the 4 affective pain items, a sum score ranges from 0 (not applicable) to 12 (exactly applicable). Values above 8 can be considered noticeable.</description>
