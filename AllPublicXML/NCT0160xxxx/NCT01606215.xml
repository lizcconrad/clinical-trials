  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind crossover study to study the effect of intravenous
      treatment with autologous (derived from the individuals themselves) mesenchymal stem cells
      (MSCs)in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).

      Current treatments for MS target the immune system and are not curative. There is much
      interest in MSCs as they have the potential to not only affect the immune system but may also
      promote repair. This study will use MSCs that are harvested from the bone marrow and grown
      for up to 52 days before being given back to the person from whom they were harvested. This
      avoids any chemotherapy so is therefore safer than other types of stem cells. In this
      crossover study, everyone will receive their own stem cells back but in half it will be
      delayed by 24 weeks.

      The primary outcomes are to check that the procedure is safe and to measure any changes on
      the MRI at 24 weeks. Other more exploratory measures will try to assess effects on repair in
      the central nervous system (CNS).
