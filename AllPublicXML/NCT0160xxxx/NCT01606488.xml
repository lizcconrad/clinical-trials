  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) affects up to 50% of non-cardiac surgical patients
      greater than or equal to 65 years of age.

      This study will test the hypothesis that preoperative presence of brain beta-amyloid plaques
      in non-demented subjects increases postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) in elderly subjects
      scheduled for hip or knee replacement.

      The investigators hypothesize that preoperative beta-amyloid plaques will predict
      postoperative cognitive decline.
