      Each subject will be evaluated by test battery which is accepted to driving assessment and
      include: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Clock Drawing Task, Color Trail Test, Motor Free
      Visual Perception, Visual Spatial Search Task , Awareness Questionnaire and on road driving
      test.

      The difference between outcome measures of the on road test between the patient group and the
      control group will be tested. The correlation between outcome measures of the on road test
      and the cognitive tests will be examined.
