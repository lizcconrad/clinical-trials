  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to analyze whether initiation of the NICHD Neonatal Research Network
      SUPPORT trial was followed by a change in frequency of endotracheal intubation the delivery
      room in non-participants and whether these changes were associated with changes in management
      and outcomes.

      The investigators hypothesized that the investigators would observe following the initiation
      of the SUPPORT trial a 33% reduction in the rate of intubation in the delivery room among
      non-participants preterm infants at Parkland Memorial Hospital.
