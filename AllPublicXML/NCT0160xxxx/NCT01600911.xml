  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vegetable is well known to prevent chronic disease,however, the mechanism of its nutrients
      and non-nutrients still remains to be discovered.We design a feeding study which provides
      plant foods to subjects one by another and monitoring metabolomic changes up to 7 hours.The
      goal of this study is to establish a protocol for documenting metabolomics response to plant
      foods and try to characterize plant foods in terms of their anti-hypertension potentials with
      metabolomic profiling information.
