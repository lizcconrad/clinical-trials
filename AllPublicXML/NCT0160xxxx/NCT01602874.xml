    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the safety of tigecycline versus a ceftriaxone
      regimen in pediatric subjects (aged 8 to 17 years) with complicated intra-abdominal
      infections (cIAI) and community acquired pneumonia (CAP).

Subjects 12 to 17 years old will receive tigecycline 50 mg IV every 12 hours, metronidazole placebo IV will be administered every 8 hours. In addition, at the discretion of the investigator, an aminoglycoside placebo IV may also be administered.</description>

    <description>Subject with CAP:
IV therapy period: Dosing information for subjects 8 to 11 years old is currently under investigation and will be determined later. Subjects 12 to 17 years old will receive tigecycline 50 mg IV every 12h. At the discretion of the investigator oral clarithromycin placebo may be given every 12h.
Oral therapy period: If oral switch criteria are met, on or after Day 4 amoxicillin/clavulanate may be prescribed (40 mg/kg per day divided into 3 equal doses, maximum of 500 mg/dose to subjects weighing less than 40 kg and 500 mg every 8h to subjects weighing 40 kg or greater). In addition, if oral clarithromycin or placebo had been given during the IV period, oral clarithromycin may be given every 12h (7.5 mg/kg, maximum dose 500 mg for subjects 8 to 11 years old, 500 mg for subjects 12 to 17 years old).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects 8 to 17 years old. Children with bone maturation less than 8
             years old should be enrolled with caution due to potential risk of tooth
             discoloration.

          -  Have a diagnosis of a serious infection (complicated intra-abdominal infections [cIAI]
             or community acquired pneumonia [CAP] as applicable) requiring hospitalization and
             administration of IV antibiotic therapy.

          -  Criteria related indication (cIAI or CAP - as applicable), e.g., sign of systemic
             infection, signs and symptom.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with any concomitant illness/condition that, in the investigator's judgment,
             will substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in
             and/or completion of the study, or could preclude the evaluation of the subject's
             response (e.g., life expectancy &lt;30 days).
