  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal death worldwide, with an
      estimated mortality of 140 000 per year. Uterine atony is one of the most important causes of
      PPH. The traditional treatment of which is the use of uterotonic agents. Oxytocin is the most
      conventional drug which was proved effective. However, it has the shortcomings of short half
      life and the necessity of intravenous administration. Misopristol, and more recently
      Carbetocin were introduced for treatment of atonic PPP not responding to Oxytocin.

      Aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Carbetocin, Misopristol, and Oxytocin
      for treatment of atonic PPH.

      The study will be conducted at the departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Sohag, Qena,
      Al Azhar, and Assuit university hospitals, Egypt. All patients with atonic PPH who delivered
      vaginally will be invited to participate in the study. Patients who delivered by caesarean
      section, with retained placenta, with traumatic PPH, associated coagulopathy and those
      refused to participate in the study will be excluded. The patients will be randomly
      categorized into 3 groups; the first (n = 100) will receive 30 IU oxytocin intravenously; the
      second (n = 100) will receive 600 ug misopristol sublingually; the third (n = 100) will
      receive 100 ug Carbetocin IV. The randomization will be done using opaque sealed envelops
      containing computer-generated codes. The primary outcome of the study is cessation of
      bleeding which will be judged by visual inspection of the blood loss by the trialist and by
      loss of &lt; 300 mL of blood during the first hour after enrollment. The secondary outcomes are
      time of control of bleeding (minutes), amount of blood loss till control of bleeding (mL),
      changes in the hemoglobin levels (gm) before and after treatment, Changes in the hematocrite
      values (%) before and after treatment, the use of additional uterotonic drugs, the rate of
      complications (%), and the necessity for surgical intervention, and the cost of each
      medication.

      Written consent will be obtained from all participants and approval from the local
      institutional ethical committee will be included.
