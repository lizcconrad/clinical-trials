      The goals of this project are

        -  1) to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBT treatment module addressing the mental health
           and functional impact of killing in the war zone,

        -  2) to gather data on Veteran stakeholders' perceptions of acceptability and feasibility
           of the CBT treatment module, which would be used to further refine the intervention, and

        -  3) to gather data on clinician stakeholders' perceptions of acceptability and
           feasibility of the CBT treatment module, which would be used to ensure that the module
           could be easily integrated into EBT for PTSD.

      Background: There is mounting evidence that Veterans from multiple eras who kill in war are
      at increased risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol abuse, suicide, and
      functional difficulties after returning home. Despite high rates of exposure to killing and
      associated maladaptive responses, the military and VA do not routinely assess exposure to
      killing, which could assist with prevention and treatment efforts. Furthermore, the impact of
      killing is not currently addressed as a component of evidence-based treatment (EBT) for PTSD.
      In fact, in the current system, a Veteran can receive PTSD evaluation and evidence-based
      treatment without ever being asked about killing and its impact. Some researchers have
      cautioned against using one type of PTSD treatment, one commonly used in the VA, suggesting
      that it may be harmful for these patients. Consequently, it is possible that failing to
      directly treat the mental health impact of killing could result in inappropriate treatment,
      cause harm to Veterans, and cost lives.

      Objectives: Our first aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of a CBT treatment module
      addressing the mental health and functional impact of killing in the war zone, which would be
      added onto existing EBT for PTSD. Our second aim is to gather data on Veteran stakeholders'
      perceptions of acceptability and feasibility of the CBT treatment module, which would be used
      to further refine the intervention. Our third aim is to gather data on clinician
      stakeholders' perceptions of acceptability and feasibility of the CBT treatment module, which
      would be used to ensure that the module could be easily integrated into EBT for PTSD.

      Methods: The investigators propose a 12-month pilot, cross-sectional Hybrid Type 2 study,
      given that The investigators will be adding a treatment module to existing EBT for PTSD. The
      investigators will conduct a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial to better understand
      if the six-week treatment module addressing the impact of killing has added benefit, compared
      to PTSD treatment as usual (N = 50). The investigators will employ a concurrent design mixed
      method study to test the perceptions of Veteran stakeholders who receive the treatment
      module, obtaining ratings of acceptability and feasibility through self-report measures and
      interviews. The investigators also will interview clinicians who provide EBT for PTSD, and
      interviews will be guided by Roger's five intrinsic characteristics, as outlined in his
      Diffusion of Innovations Theory.

      Impact: Through involving Veteran and clinician stakeholders, the main impact of this project
      will be to obtain information that will assist in revising the CBT treatment module and help
      prepare for implementing the module in already existing settings, where EBT for PTSD is
      provided.

    <description>The BSI is a 53 item self-report scale used to measure nine primary symptom dimensions (somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism). Respondents rank each feeling item (e.g., &quot;your feelings being easily hurt&quot;) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Rankings characterize the intensity of distress during the past seven days. The total score is the sum of all responses [minimum = 0 (better outcome), maximum = 212 (worse outcome)].</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Combat Veterans ranging in age from 18-70 years will be recruited to participate in
             this study. Combat veterans ranging in age from 70 to 90 years will also be considered
             for enrollment in the study on a case-by-case basis.

          -  Veterans will need to endorse having taken a life in a war zone context, to meet
             criteria for PTSD, and to have received some prior treatment for PTSD to be included
             in the study.

          -  Participants in current PTSD treatment will not be excluded; however, if receiving
             medications, they will need to be stabilized on current medications for at least one
             month.

          -  If receiving Prolonged Exposure (PE) or Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), the two
             treatments the VA recognizes as evidence-based treatment for PTSD, individuals will
             need to wait two weeks after they have completed the treatment in order to enroll in
             the study, and new baseline measures will be obtained at that time.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Potential participants will only be excluded if they meet current or lifetime criteria
             for a psychotic disorder.

        <title>Change in Psychological Symptoms as Measured by the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-53)</title>
        <description>The BSI is a 53 item self-report scale used to measure nine primary symptom dimensions (somatization, obsessive-compulsive behavior, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism). Respondents rank each feeling item (e.g., &quot;your feelings being easily hurt&quot;) on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Rankings characterize the intensity of distress during the past seven days. The total score is the sum of all responses [minimum = 0 (better outcome), maximum = 212 (worse outcome)].</description>
        <time_frame>The BSI will be administered at Baseline or the first study visit and the end of treatment (Week 7)</time_frame>
