      The purpose of this study is to improve their outcome by either changing the chemotherapy
      drugs or giving them radiation therapy with concurrent chemotherapy, hoping that this will
      improve their outcome.

      This study is aimed at improving the outcome of resectable non PET responders, esophageal
      carcinoma, by either changing the chemotherapy drugs or giving them radiation therapy with
      concurrent chemotherapy, hoping that this will improve their outcome.
