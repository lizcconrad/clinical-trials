  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The UltraShape® Contour I- Y system uses focused ultrasound to produce localized mechanical
      motion within fat tissues and cells for the purpose of producing mechanical cellular membrane
      disruption. It is intended for reduction in body circumference.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Contour I - Y System
      on abdominal circumference reduction relative to baseline pretreatment values using different
      treatment methods.

      The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial is Statistical Difference of Circumference
      reduction between Baseline measurement and at follow-up measurement.

    <description>The Contour I - Y System is a non-invasive focused ultrasound, for body contouring purposes, designed to selectively disrupt sub-dermal fat cells at a designated focus employing focused ultrasound. All other types of tissue, such as blood vessels, muscles and peripheral nerves remain intact. There are no thermal effects. Fat cell destruction is achieved by ultrasound-induced mechanical effects during a very short exposure time.</description>
