  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the effect of minimal (MECC) versus conventional (CECC)
      extracorporeal circulation on perfusion characteristics and remote end-organ protection
      (lungs, brain, kidneys, liver, stomach, intestine), after elective coronary bypass grafting
      (CABG).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether coronary surgery with MECC offers advantage
      over conventional CPB (CECC). In order to draw an evidence-based conclusion, the
      investigators aim to evaluate perfusion characteristics during coronary surgery with MECC and
      associated remote end-organ function. Improved end-organ protection translates into improved
      clinical outcome which greatly affects quality of life. This is the first study in the
      literature adequately powered to analyse organ pathophysiology during surgery with MECC and
      at the same time correlating common clinical variables with a detailed quality of life
      evaluation. Superiority of MECC could provide firm evidence towards widespread use of MECC in
      coronary surgery as standard of care.

    <description>The MECC system (Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Hirlingen, Germany) consists of a pre-connected closed CPB circuit containing a RotaFlow centrifugal pump and a Quadrox D diffusion membrane oxygenator. A flow meter and a bubble sensor are integrated in the drive unit of the centrifugal pump. The system features a tip-to-tip heparin coating (Bioline Coating, Maquet Cardiopulmonary, Hirlingen, Germany). No arterial or venous line filters are included. Initial priming volume of the system is 500 mL, while using retrograde autologous priming (RAP) the circuit could be filled in with autologous blood, thus reducing hemodilution. Since no cardiotomy suction is used, shed blood is collected with a cell-saving device (Haemonetics Corp, Braintree, MA).</description>

    <description>A standard open CPB circuit is used, consisting of uncoated PVC tubing, a hard-shell venous reservoir, a microporous membrane oxygenator (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and a roller pump (Stöckert S3, Munich, Germany). The circuit contains a 40 μm arterial line blood filter (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and it is primed with 1500 mL of a balanced crystalloid/colloid solution (1000 mL of Ringer's solution, 200 mL of mannitol 20%, and 300 mL of hydroxyethyl starch 6%). Cardiotomy as well as sump sucker are integrated to the circuit.</description>
