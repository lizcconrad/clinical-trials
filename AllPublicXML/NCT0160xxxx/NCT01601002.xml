    <textblock>
      Patients with an episode of depression in late life prescribed mirtazapine recruited from a
      clinical sample will be monitored for weight and receive a blood test during their usual
      course of treatment to determine polymorphisms in a specific gene (LEPR) thought to affect
      weight gain.
