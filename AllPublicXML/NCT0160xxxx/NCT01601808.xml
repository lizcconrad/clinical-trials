        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

             relapsed following previously resected Pancreatic Cancer can be included.

          -  Contrast enhanced computerised tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis
             within 28 days prior to commencing treatment.

          -  Unidimensionally measurable disease as shown by CT scan, in accordance with RECIST
             guidelines (version 1.1)

          -  ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2 where the investigator feels that treatment with
             combination chemotherapy.

          -  Platelets ≥100 x 109/l; WBC ≥ 3 x 109/l; neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/l at entry.

          -  Documented Life expectancy &gt; 3 months.

          -  Informed written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

               -  Haemoglobin &lt; 10G/dl

               -  Creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/minute (calculated by Cockcroft-Gault formula)**.
                  Patients with a creatinine clearance of ≥30mL/minute and &lt;50mL/minute should
                  begin vandetanib on a reduced dose of 200mg.

               -  Potassium, ≤4.0 mmol/L despite supplementation; or &gt; 5.5 mmol/L

               -  Magnesium below the normal range despite supplementation, or &gt; 1.23 mmol/L

               -  Serum calcium is &gt; 2.9 mmol/L. In cases where serum calcium is below the normal
                  range this can be substituted with the value for calcium adjusted for albumin, if
                  this is below the normal range despite supplementation patients should be
                  excluded.

               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alkaline

          -  Medical or psychiatric conditions compromising informed consent.

          -  Intracerebral metastases or meningeal carcinomatosis.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks or incompletely healed surgical incision before starting

          -  Clinically significant cardiovascular eventclassification of heart disease ≥2 within 3
             months before entry; or presence of cardiac disease that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.

          -  History of arrhythmia which is symptomatic or requires treatment (CTCAE grade 3) or
             asymptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation, controlled on

          -  QTc prolongation with other medications that required discontinuation of that
             medication.

          -  Congenital long QT syndrome or 1st degree relative with unexplained sudden death under
             40 years of age.

          -  Presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB).

          -  QTc with Bazett's correction that is un-measurable or ≥ 480 msec on screening ECG.
             Patients who are receiving a drug that has a risk of inducing Torsades-de-Pointes are
             excluded if QTc is ≥ 460 msec.

          -  Any concurrent medication with a known risk of inducing Torsades-de-Pointes, that in
             the investigator's opinion cannot be discontinued, are allowed.

          -  Previous chemotherapy for locally advanced and metastatic disease. Adjuvant
             chemotherapy for resected pancreatic cancer will be permitted provided that
             chemotherapy was completed &gt; 12 months previously.

          -  Radiotherapy within the last 4 weeks prior to start of study treatment.

          -  Concurrent malignancies or invasive cancers diagnosed within past 5 years.
