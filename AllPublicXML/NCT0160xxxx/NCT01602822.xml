  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate how safe and tolerable a combination of taking three-drugs will be
      for the purpose of preventing HIV transmission after a high-risk sexual contact exposure in
      HIV uninfected adults.

      Participants are given a regimen containing TDF 300mg and FTC 200mg fixed-dose combination
      tablet (TDF/FTC) once daily, and atazanavir, one 300mg tablet and one 100 mg ritonavir given
      once daily,for 28 days.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety of regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3- Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Safety and tolerability of the regimen will be assessed by the percentage of participants who at or by visit 3: (1) report moderate-to-severe symptoms on the symptom-directed physical exam, (2) report adverse or serious adverse events that are considered related to the use of the drug regimen, and/or (3) have unsafe biological test results as part of the laboratory screen for safety levels (e.g., CBC, Creatinine, etc.).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Awareness of NPEP</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 5- Day 170</time_frame>
    <description>First we will determine how many participants had initially heard of NPEP prior to the incident exposure, as well as how many participants had ever taken NPEP before. Next, using the McNemar's Test, we will assess pre- and post-test attitudes about NPEP by comparing the proportion of participants who endorsed any level of disagreement with those who endorsed any level of agreement among the seven statements on PEP attitudes from baseline (visit 0) to the 6-month follow-up appointment (visit 5).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare adherence rates</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 3- Day 30</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence to the regimen will be assessed by whether the regimen was completed as prescribed or not. Additionally, if the regimen was not completed as prescribed, we will calculate the proportion adherence (i.e., the number of pills taken compared to the number of pills in the regimen). Ï‡2 tests will be used to assess differences in the proportion of both completion and adherence between participants in the current study and participants in previous studies of NPEP at Fenway Health (historical controls)</description>
