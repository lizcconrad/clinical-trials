      MAIN FEATURES OF THE STUDY: therapeutic intervention. Constipation is a frequent complication
      in critical ill patients. The disaccharide lactulose has a laxative osmotic activity. Given
      the scant evidence and the potential risk associated with constipation in seriously ill
      patients, this study aims to assess the impact of laxative therapy in the prognosis of
      critically ill patients.

      Study hypothesis: Constipation is part of the clinical spectrum of intestinal dysfunction and
      if treated can result in improved prognosis for critically ill patients.

      OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the impact of daily laxative therapy in the prognosis of critically ill
      patients through the evaluation of organ failure by the sequential organ failure score
      assessment (SOFA). Will also be evaluated morbidity data, namely incidence of bloodstream
      infection, pneumonia and severe sepsis, days free of mechanical ventilation, length of
      hospital stay, ICU and hospital mortality.

      The study will be conducted in two intensive care units of Hospital Sao Paulo, UNIFESP.
      Inclusion criteria: patients who are mechanically ventilated, with prediction to stay in the
      ICU for more than three days and getting at least 20% of full nutritional support in the form
      of enteral nutrition. Patients will be randomized into two groups: Group 1 - patients treated
      according to medical prescription. Group 2 - patients will receive lactulone in order to
      evacuate daily. The patient included in the intervention group will receive latulose 30 ml of
      8 in 8 hours. Patients will be monitored, adjusted doses and procedures, if necessary. It is
      intended to include 44 patients per group.
