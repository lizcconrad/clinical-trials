    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial to compare clinical improvement, cost
      effectiveness and patency rates between new and improved Nitinol stents and open bypass
      surgery in the superficial femoral artery disease.

      Secondary outcomes also include comparing quality of life, re-intervention rate, mortality,
      morbidity and time to return to work or regular activities.

      Patients with superficial femoral artery lesions will be considered. Patients with TASC II A
      lesions will not be randomized but treated with PTA/stenting as standard of care. Patients
      with TASC II B and C lesions will be prospectively randomized into either receiving open
      bypass or stenting.

      Patients with TASC D lesions will be treated with open bypass surgery after angiography.

      The investigators will collect pre-procedure, peri-procedural and clinical follow-up data on
      all enrolled the patients.
