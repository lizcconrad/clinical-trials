  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a medication called mannitol, can help the
      kidney maintain its function after kidney surgery. Mannitol is used to cause an increase in
      urine production (it is a diuretic). For many years, mannitol has been given to patients in
      the hope it would improve the kidney's circulation, and in doing so reduce the impact of the
      surgery on the kidney.

      Mannitol is given during the surgery before the blood supply to the kidney is stopped. The
      blood supply to the kidney is stopped in order to minimize any blood loss during the removal
      of the tumor, and also to assist the surgeons view of the kidney anatomy. Once the tumor is
      removed the blood supply to the kidney is resumed. Sometimes a side effect of this temporary
      reduction in blood supply to the kidney is the loss of some kidney function. This may happen
      either in the short term (right away) or long term (months or years later). In studies done
      on animals, mannitol was able to lessen this damage to kidney function. However, no human
      study has ever confirmed that mannitol has the same helpful effect in humans. There is some
      suggestion that it may have no effect. Because sufficient research has yet to be done on
      humans, many surgeons do not give mannitol. A recent study, conducted at Memorial Sloan
      Kettering which looked back at patients who had undergone partial nephrectomies, an operation
      where only the portion of the kidney that contains the tumor is removed and enables the
      normal, unaffected portion of the kidney to be preserved. The results of this study
      demonstrated no significant difference in kidney function when the investigators compared
      patients who were given mannitol to those who were not. The investigators hope that this
      study will help clarify the effectiveness or not of mannitol on kidney function. During the
      surgery to remove the kidney tumor, patients will receive either mannitol or a placebo. A
      placebo, is a harmless medication that has no effects. The impact of mannitol compared to the
      placebo will be assessed by routine blood tests and imaging (kidney scan) 6 months after your
      surgery.

    <description>The difference will be assessed with an ANCOVA model with eGFR 6 months after surgery (+/- 2 months) as the outcome and treatment group, surgical technique, and preoperative eGFR as covariates. We will report a two-tailed p-value and a 95% confidence interval for the difference between groups. If a patient does not have an eGFR measurement between 5-7 months after surgery and has both a measurement between 3-5 months and 7-12 months after surgery, then the 6 month eGFR measurement will be linearly interpolated.</description>

    <description>between treatment groups at 6 weeks (+/- 4 weeks) after surgery with postoperative eGFR as the outcome, and treatment group, surgical technique, and preoperative eGFR as covariates. We will also use the ANCOVA on the absolute level of eGFR because this has the greatest statistical power. However, the estimate produced by ANCOVA - a mean difference in eGFR levels - is of incomplete clinical interpretability.</description>

After the first hour of surgery IV fluid will be administered at 6cc/kg (+/- 1cc/kg) intended to maintain a minimum systolic blood pressure of 90-100mmHg and a minimum urine output of 0.5cc/kg/hour. The treatment arm will receive a standard dose of 12.5 grams of mannitol (200 cc of a 6.25% mannitol solution) intravenously completely infused through an existing intravenous access catheter within 30 minutes prior to renal artery clamping.</description>
