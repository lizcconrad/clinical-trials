  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease(CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed
      nations. CVD is primarily caused by atherosclerosis, a systemic disease characterized by
      lipid deposition in the subendothelial space with a concomitant, low-grade inflammatory
      reaction.(Fuster, Moreno et al. 2005) To date, most therapeutic interventions aimed at
      lowering CVD have thus far focused on modulating lipid levels, either lowering LDLc or
      increasing HDLc levels. Yet, since the introduction of statins 20 years ago, there have been
      few breakthroughs in the treatment of this disease. A promising strategy to reduce CVD is to
      directly target inflammation at the level of the vessel wall.(van Leuven, van Wijk et al.;
      Libby 2002) A potential drawback of anti-inflammatory strategies pertains to the thin line
      between inhibiting 'inappropriate' inflammation versus inducing immuno-suppression.
      Therefore, continuous low dosed anti-inflammatory drugs have great potential as novel
      treatment strategies. In the present project, the investigators propose to inject liposomal
      glucocorticoids intravenously in patients with an increased risk of atherosclerotic disease
      aiming to reduce vessel wall inflammation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Population with target to background ratio of 2.2 of the aorta or carotid artery on
             PET-CT

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current medical history of auto-immune disease/vasculitis, active inflammatory
             diseases, Recent (&lt;1 month prior to screening) or ongoing serious infection requiring
             IV antibiotic therapy.

          -  Recent or current treatment with medications that may have a significant effect on
             plaque inflammation as measured by plaque TBR, including but not limited to:

               -  Steroids for at least 6 weeks prior to baseline measurement and during study
                  (with the exception of inhaled acute use steroids).

               -  Biological based medicines (anti-TNF (ex. Infliximab), anti-IL-6 therapy (ex.
                  Tocilizumab) or anti-IL-1 (ex. anakinra)) within 8 weeks before the baseline
                  visit and during the study

               -  No other disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMRADS) within 6 weeks of
                  baseline and during study (such as cyclosporine, azatioprine, etc.)
