    <textblock>
      This study used a three way crossover study design. Eligible patients recorded their symptoms
      during a one to two week baseline period, then entered a three period, double blind,
      randomised crossover of GW-1000-02, GW-2000-02 and placebo. Each period lasted two weeks,
      with no washout between periods. There were six possible treatment sequences. The primary
      analysis was based on Box Scale-11 pain severity scores recorded throughout the study in
      patient daily diary booklets. Blood samples were taken from patient-volunteers at the
      beginning of each period, for measurement of plasma cannabinoid concentration.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Box Scale-11 Pain Review Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day patients recorded in their patient diary, the severity of their pain during the previous 24 hours using a Box Scale-11 pain score ranging from zero &quot;no pain at all&quot; to 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. The Box Scale-11 pain score endpoint for each assessment period was the average of all available data recorded during the seven whole days prior to the visit immediately subsequent to that period, but only including data from Day 8 onwards. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain score from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Sleep Disturbance Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day patients recorded in their patient diary the number of times they were woken due to pain during the previous night. The results were recorded as &quot;None&quot;, &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;Twice&quot; and &quot;More Than Twice&quot; and converted to a four point scale, zero to three respectively. The treatment days and the assessment periods were defined in the same way as for the Box Scale-11 pain score. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Box Scale-11 Sleep Quality Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Each day patients recorded in their patient diary the quality of their sleep during the previous night using a Box Scale-11 sleep score ranging from zero &quot;Worst Imaginable&quot; to 10 &quot;Best Imaginable&quot;. The treatment days and the assessment periods were defined in the same way as for the Box Scale-11 pain score. A positive value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean McGill Pain Questionnaire Part 1 Score for 'Total Pain Intensity' at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Part 1 of the questionnaire related to the intensity of 15 different types of pain. Intensity was recorded separately for each type of pain on a zero to three scale, where zero = &quot;None&quot;, one = &quot;Mild&quot;, two = &quot;Moderate&quot; and three = &quot;Severe&quot;. The total intensity was defined as the unweighted sum of the 15 scores, giving a minimum possible score of zero (lowest pain score) and a maximum possible score of 45 (highest pain score). The distribution of each of the 15 types of pain was summarised at baseline and for each treatment. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean McGill Pain Questionnaire Part 2 Score for 'Intensity of Pain' at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Part 2 of the questionnaire recorded the intensity of pain at present. Results were recorded on a VAS ranging from zero &quot;No pain&quot; to 100 &quot;Worst possible pain&quot;. Intensity of pain was summarised and analysed in the same manner as the primary efficacy parameter of Box Scale-11 pain score. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Number of Patients Who Reported 'No Pain' or 'Mild Pain' Using a McGill Pain Questionnaire Part 3 Score for 'Strength of Pain at Present' at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>Part 3 of the questionnaire recorded the strength of pain at present. Results were recorded in six categories which were classified as &quot;No Pain&quot;, &quot;Mild&quot;, &quot;Discomforting&quot;, &quot;Distressing&quot;, &quot;Horrible&quot; and &quot;Excruciating&quot;. The change from baseline in the number of patients who reported &quot;No Pain&quot; or &quot;Mild Pain&quot; at the end of the respective treatment periods is presented. An increase in number indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean Pain Disability Index Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain Disability Index consisted of seven assessments representing different aspects of disability due to pain. Each assessment was scored on a zero to 10 scale, where zero equated with &quot;no disability&quot; and 10 equated with &quot;total disability&quot;. The total Pain Disability Index score was the unweighted sum of the seven pain scores, ranging from zero to 70. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in the Mean 12-Item General Health Questionnaire Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 74 days</time_frame>
    <description>The 12-Item General Health Questionnaire consisted of 12 general health questions. Each question was scored on a zero to three scale, where zero represented the better assessment. The total score was the unweighted sum of the 12 scores, ranging from zero to 36. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean Sleep Disturbance Score at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days).</title>
          <description>Each day patients recorded in their patient diary the number of times they were woken due to pain during the previous night. The results were recorded as “None”, “Once”, “Twice” and “More Than Twice” and converted to a four point scale, zero to three respectively. The treatment days and the assessment periods were defined in the same way as for the Box Scale-11 pain score. A negative value indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Mean McGill Pain Questionnaire Part 1 Score for 'Total Pain Intensity' at the End of Each Treatment Period (Each Lasting 14-20 Days)</title>
        <description>Part 1 of the questionnaire related to the intensity of 15 different types of pain. Intensity was recorded separately for each type of pain on a zero to three scale, where zero = “None”, one = “Mild”, two = “Moderate” and three = “Severe”. The total intensity was defined as the unweighted sum of the 15 scores, giving a minimum possible score of zero (lowest pain score) and a maximum possible score of 45 (highest pain score). The distribution of each of the 15 types of pain was summarised at baseline and for each treatment. A negative value indicates an improvement in pain from baseline.</description>

        <description>Part 3 of the questionnaire recorded the strength of pain at present. Results were recorded in six categories which were classified as “No Pain”, “Mild”, “Discomforting”, “Distressing”, “Horrible” and “Excruciating”. The change from baseline in the number of patients who reported “No Pain” or “Mild Pain” at the end of the respective treatment periods is presented. An increase in number indicates an improvement from baseline.</description>
