    <textblock>
      The aim of this R34 study is to develop and test the feasibility of a Stepped Care
      intervention for young children with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Phase I will focus
      on developing and testing the feasibility of Stepped Care Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy (SC-TF-CBT) in a small open trial (N=10). Phase II will consist of a randomized
      controlled trial (N=54) examining the efficacy of SC-TF-CBT relative to standard
      Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT)on a number of outcome measures,
      treatment acceptability and satisfaction, and costs of treatment delivery. Findings from this
      pilot study will establish the feasibility and preliminary efficacy (see Kraemer et al.,
      2006) of SC-TF-CBT before progressing to a larger, randomized R01 to examine the
      effectiveness of SC-TF-CBT for early childhood PTSD.

    <textblock>
      Young children who are exposed to traumatic events such as abuse, disasters, accidents,
      illnesses, injury and the death of a person close to them are at risk for developing PTSD.
      While effective treatments for childhood PTSD exist, novel interventions that are more
      accessible, efficient, and cost-effective are needed to improve access to evidence-based
      treatment. The purpose of this study is to develop and test the feasibility of an
      intervention called Stepped Care Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which has the
      potential to greatly improve service delivery approaches to make treatment more accessible
      and less costly, thereby reducing childhood PTSD and related societal impacts and costs.

             symptom of avoidance.

          3. Child must be between 3 and 7 years of age at the time of enrollment.

          4. The parent must be willing and able to participate in the treatment and complete

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Psychosis, mental retardation, autism, or related pervasive developmental disorders in

          2. Parent has had substance use disorder within the past 3 months.

          3. Child or parent is suicidal (the DIPA will be used to screen for child suicidal
             ideation and the SCID-RV will be used to screen for parent suicide ideation; assessed
             by all available information). A delayed entry once the parent or child is stabilized

          5. Child is currently taking psychotropic medication and is not on a stable medication
             regimen for at least 4 weeks prior to admission to the study. If appropriate, a
             delayed entry will be allowed so that once a child is on a stable dosage the child may
             be enrolled in the study.

          6. Child is receiving trauma-focused psychotherapy when study treatment is provided.

          7. Parent or caregiver who would be treatment participant was the perpetrator, or the
