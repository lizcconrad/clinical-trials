  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The normal, the anticipated difficult and the unanticipated difficult airway are trained in
      the patient safety simulation center (University Hospital ZÃ¼rich) and the training is being
      observed by video installation.

      Step 1: normal airway (Phantom), technical training

      Step 2: difficult airway (SimMan 3G), technical training

      Step 3: Simulation of normal and difficult airway management on ICU (SimMan 3G), technical
      and non-technical (CRM - crew resource management) training.
