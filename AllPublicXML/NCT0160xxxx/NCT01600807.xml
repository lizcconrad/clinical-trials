  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OSI-906 is a new drug that may stop cancer cells from growing abnormally. This drug has been
      used in other research studies and information from those suggests that OSI-906 may help
      block cell receptors involved in tumor growth.

      Gemcitabine and erlotinib are used as standard treatment for pancreatic cancer. In this
      research study, the investigators are looking for the highest dose of OSI-906 that can be
      given safely in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib. This dose will then be given
      together with gemcitabine and erlotinib to a further group of patients with pancreatic
      cancer.

      This study will be conducted in two parts: a phase I study and a phase II study. In both
      instances, a treatment cycle is 28 days (4 weeks). Subjects will take OSI-906 by mouth, twice
      a day, every day. Subjects will receive gemcitabine through an IV in clinic over 30 minutes
      on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Subjects will take erlotinib by mouth, once a day,
      every day.

      At every visit subjects will have a physical exam and blood tests. An EKG will be done on
      days 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and on day 1 of all subsequent cycles. A CT scan will be done
      every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

      Subjects will complete a daily drug diary and perform glucose monitoring (finger stick) once
      daily at home.
