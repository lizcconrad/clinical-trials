  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For simple fractures treated in the emergency department with cast immobilisation only,
      ibuprofen has been shown to be superior to, or a least or equivalent to codeine with less
      side effects. These and other studies have commented that their results may not be applicable
      to children who have fractures that require reduction. There is currently no literature on
      the management of postoperative pain following reduction of paediatric fractures. The
      investigators aim therefore is to investigate whether either of the two most commonly
      prescribed analgesics is superior to the other for postoperative pain management following
      closed reductions of paediatric forearm fractures. Also, if one agent has more side effects
      than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective randomised controlled trial with the null hypothesis that there is
      no difference between ibuprofen and codeine in terms of pain relief or side effects.

      Following ethics approval (submitted and approved) by the University of Manitoba ethics board
      a study group of fifty patients (25 in each arm) will be recruited to participate in the
      study.All patients will complete informed consent following both a verbal and written
      explanation of the study. Following the closed reduction they will all receive regular
      acetaminophen; (dose 15mg/kg) and either ibuprofen (10mg/kg) or codeine (1mg/kg) depending
      upon the group they were randomised to. This will have to be single blinding as the codeine
      formulation used by the hospital is a clear red liquid (5mg/ml) and the ibuprofen a cloudy
      colourless liquid (20mg/ml). They will also be given a &quot;rescue&quot; medication to be taken if the
      caregivers feel that the pain relief is not sufficient 1 hour after the study medication.
      This rescue medication will be the alternative medication in the study.

    <description>Caregivers, or the children if old enough, will be asked to keep a pain diary. This will consist of the times the analgesia was taken and a pain score at awakening, at bedtime and before and 1 hour after each dose of medication.
Caregivers/children will also be asked to include any side effects noted to medication and whether play, school, sleep, and eating are affected by pain each day. Caregivers will record whether the function was increased, decreased, or unchanged.</description>
