    <textblock>

      This study will evaluate the efficacy of an eight-module, online, self-directed treatment for
      chronic pain using Acceptance-Based Behavioural Therapy (ABBT) as the treatment modality. The
      online modules are tailored to the unique issues of individuals with a military background.
      The modules will be delivered via the WebCAPSI Therapy program, an online, password-protected
      program that allows participants to anonymously progress through all modules at their own
      pace. ABBT modules cover the following: Introduction, Acceptance, Values, Cognitive Defusion,
      Mindfulness, Exercise/Pacing/Communication Skills, Self-as-Context, and Willingness. Modules
      encourage understanding of the information through audio files, military-specific vignettes,
      written materials, and homework exercises. Modules are designed to be completed in 60 minutes
      or less. Participants will have access to the online treatment for a three month period and
      will be encouraged to complete one module per week.
