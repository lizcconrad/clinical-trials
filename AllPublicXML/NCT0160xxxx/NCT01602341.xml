    <measure>Improvement From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8</time_frame>
    <description>ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from Baseline was calculated as Baseline score minus follow-up score.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug to the end of study treatment (Day 29), that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events By Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. AE was assessed on basis of severity as follows: mild=does not interfere with participant's usual function; moderate=interferes to some extent with participant's usual function; severe=interferes significantly with participant's usual function. Number of participants with mild, moderate and severe treatment-emergent AEs were reported in this outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Local Tolerability Symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 29</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who experienced local tolerability symptoms: mild itching or burning/stinging at sites of study drug application were reported in this measure.</description>

    <measure>Improvement From Baseline in ADSI Component Scores (Erythema, Pruritus, Exudation, Excoriation and Lichenification) at Day 8, 15, 22 and 29</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 8, 15, 22, 29</time_frame>
    <description>ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from baseline was calculated as baseline evaluation minus the follow-up evaluation.</description>

        <title>Improvement From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 8</title>
        <description>ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from Baseline was calculated as Baseline score minus follow-up score.</description>

        <title>Improvement From Baseline in Atopic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI) Score at Day 29</title>
        <description>ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from Baseline was calculated as Baseline score minus follow-up score.</description>

An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; Initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent were events between first dose of study drug to the end of study treatment (Day 29), that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state.</description>

        <title>Improvement From Baseline in ADSI Component Scores (Erythema, Pruritus, Exudation, Excoriation and Lichenification) at Day 8, 15, 22 and 29</title>
        <description>ADSI was used to assess the severity of atopic dermatitis (AD) based on five subscale scores of erythema, pruritus, exudation, excoriation, and lichenification. The severity of each subscale was measured on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), where higher scores indicating more severity. ADSI was calculated as the sum of these 5 subscale scores with a total possible score range of 0 (none) to 15 (most severe) where, higher scores indicating more severity. Improvement from baseline was calculated as baseline evaluation minus the follow-up evaluation.</description>
