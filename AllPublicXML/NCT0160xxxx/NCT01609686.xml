  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is associated with extensive blood loss in upto 20% of
      patients. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a routinely administered antifibrinolytic agent that
      reduces blood loss and blood transfusion requirement. However, standard dosing of TXA in
      patients suffering from renal dysfunction and undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery may
      lead to higher blood concentration of TXA when compared to the patients with normal renal
      function. Solid phase microextraction (SPME) is a fast and simple method to measure TXA
      levels. This prospective study on cadiac surgical patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass
      aims to study the pharmacokinetics of TXA in patients with renal dysfunction. Two patient
      groups will be studied who will receive either TXA 50mg/kg bolus or BART regimen (30 mg/kg,
      16 mg/kg/h + 2 mg/kg pump prime) depending on the type of cardiac surgical procedure and
      bleeding risk.

      Hypothesis: Standard dosing of TXA used in cardiac surgery result in higher blood
      concentration of TXA in patients with renal dysfunction when compared to patients with normal
      renal function.
