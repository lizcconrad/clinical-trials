  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients who undergo shoulder manipulation for idiopathic adhesive capsulitis, a
      postoperative indwelling analgesic pain catheter will improve patient outcomes by decreasing
      shoulder pain and improving range of motion compared to a single-dose interscalene block.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder manipulation under anesthesia to treat idiopathic adhesive capsulitis is performed
      only when conservative treatment fails to remedy the condition.

      It is common practice to use an interscalene nerve block as anesthesia for this surgical
      intervention. This randomized prospective study is designed to evaluate the effects of two
      different anesthesia methods on patient's post-surgical rehabilitation after manipulation.
      Forty patients scheduled for surgery will be entered into this study. Patients will be
      randomly assigned to receive a single-doseinterscalene block or a single-dose interscalene
      block and an indwelling nerve catheter which will provide a continuous infusion of local
      anesthetic. Patients with the continuous infusion of local anesthetic will receive the
      additional anesthesia for 24 hours. Patient's range of motion will be evaluated pre-op,
      intra-op and post-operatively at 10 days, 4,8,16 weeks and 6 months
