  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether corneal collagen crosslinking is effective
      in the treatment of progressive keratoconus.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconus is a noninflammatory, asymmetrical, progressive corneal ectasia caused by
      biomechanical instability of the corneal stroma. Treatment modalities are primarily glasses
      or contact lenses. It has been estimated that one out of five patients will progress to such
      an extent that a corneal transplant is necessary to regain useful vision.

      Corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) is a treatment modality that intends to halt progression
      of keratoconus. This study investigates the efficacy av CXL in stabilizing the cornea in
      keratoconus by means of a randomized controlled clinical trial.

      Participants are eligible for inclusion if progressive keratoconus is confirmed and the
      inclusion criteria are met. Follow-up after inclusion is at 1 week (treatment group), 1, 3, 6
      and 12 months. Pre- and post-inclusion examinations include measurement of uncorrected
      distance visual acuity (UCDVA), best spectacle corrected distance visual acuity (BSCDVA),
      Scheimpflug-topography and slitlamp examination.

    <description>Kmax is defined as the steepest radius of curvature of the anterior corneal surface. It is measured by Scheimpflug-topography (Pentacam, Oculus Inc.). An increase of less than 1 diopter (D) from baseline at 12 months is defined as non-progression.</description>

    <description>Sim-K-astigmatism (Sim-K-ast) is defined as the absolute amount of anterior corneal astigmatism related to the Sim-Ks as measured by Scheimpflug-topography (Pentacam, Oculus Inc.). An increase of less than 1 D from baseline at 12 months is defined as non progression.</description>

    <description>Manifest Refractive Spherical Equivalent. The spherical equivalent is calculated by algebraic addition of the spherical power and half the cylindrical power of an eye. An eye with a specific spherical equivalent power has the closest overall effect to a given toric lens. A decrease of less than 0.5 D from baseline at 12 months is defined as non-progression.</description>

    <description>UCDVA is defined as the uncorrected distance visual acuity measured with an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-chart and expressed in numbers of letters. A decrease of less than 5 letters (one line) from baseline at 12 months is defined as stable BCDVA.</description>
