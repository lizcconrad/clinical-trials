  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial evaluating ibuprofen and placebo for the prevention of neurological forms of altitude
      illness [including high altitude headache (HAH), acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude
      cerebral edema (HACE), and an emerging concept of High Altitude Anxiety]. The study will take
      place in the spring and summer of 2012 at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center
      in the Eastern Sierras near Bridgeport, California. US Marines from near sea level will
      participate in battalion-level training exercises at between 8,500-11,500 Feet, where some
      altitude illness is expected. Concurrent measures used to determine objective markers of
      altitude illness, such that validated clinical scales, rapid cognitive screening tests, will
      inform us of symptoms of altitude illness.

        including (but not limited to) conditions that may directly antagonize mechanisms of
        acclimatization to altitude, organ failure, metastatic/malignant neoplasm, space-occupying
        brain lesions or diagnoses typically known to raise intracranial pressure, and disorders
        that are likely to antagonize adequate respiration, blood oxygenation, and/or circulation.
