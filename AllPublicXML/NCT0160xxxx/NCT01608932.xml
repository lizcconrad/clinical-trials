  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether telemonitoring of frail patients with
      chronic diseases produces benefits in terms of reduced readmissions, improved health related
      quality of life, and improved health status. In addition, the trial evaluates the economic
      and organisational impact of the telemonitoring service and examines its acceptability by
      patients and health professionals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the impact of telemonitoring on the follow-up of elderly
      patients with one or more chronic diseases among heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease and diabetes. The particular target of patients selected has the particularity of
      being &quot;frail&quot; according to a set of social eligibility criteria, agreed by the clinicians
      participating at the study. General practitioners are the first clinicians in charge of
      managing these patients during the trial follow-up. The term of comparison is represented by
      a control group, followed by outpatient usual care.

      From a clinical point of view, the trial will investigate how the remote monitoring of some
      clinical parameters contributes to reduce the access to healthcare facilities (emergency and
      planned hospitalization, bed-days, ER, specialist and GP visits), to improve the patients
      health-related quality of life and to reduce the anxiety about health conditions. A
      cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis will be carried out in order to determine if and
      how telemonitoring helps to limit the healthcare expenditure. The evaluation will deal also
      with organizational changes and task shift due to telemonitoring introduction and patients
      and professionals perception towards the service.

    <description>Patients are equipped with a telemonitoring kit that can be composed by a portable wrist clinic device, a digital weight scale and a glucometer for clinical parameters measuring, according to the pathologies of the patient. The equipment is completed by a gateway device for data transmission.
The patient can monitor a complete set of clinical parameters, such as pulse-oxymetry, heart rate, blood pressure, ECG, body weight and glycemia with a frequency set by the clinician in the personalized treatment plan. In the same protocol the clinician includes also the alarm thresholds that determine when the clinical measures are out-of-range. Data are transmitted to a regional eHealth centre where a group of operators keeps these information under control and alerts the general practitioner in case of worsening of symptoms.</description>
