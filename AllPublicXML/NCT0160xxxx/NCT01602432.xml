      Cancer increases the risk of deep vein blood clots and clots traveling to the lungs (emboli)
      which cause morbidity (leg swelling, pain, and shortness of breath), sudden death, delays
      cancer treatment, and decreases cancer survival by 66% compared to similar cancer patients
      without blood clots. Blood thinners may prevent clots but major bleeding is also a problem,
      so preventive therapies are not used routinely. Identifying patients at highest risk for
      clots is critical. A tool exists but it has not been used outside of research. We propose to
      study how to apply this tool in clinical practice and test if it works.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Cancer have a risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep-vein
      thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) that is markedly higher than non-Cancer
      patients. An acute episode of VTE has deleterious effects on the quality of life and
      long-term survival of cancer patients. Cancer patients with VTE have survival rates that are
      only one third of otherwise identical patients without VTE. Once VTE is diagnosed over 10% of
      cancer patients suffer a further event while on standard therapy and over 5% suffer a major
      hemorrhagic event.

      The best way to treat VTE is its prevention (thromboprophylaxis). Studies suggest that among
      ambulatory cancer patients, risk for VTE varies markedly between patients and that the lack
      of knowledge of this risk, delays diagnosis and hampers efforts to effectively prevent VTE.
      Therefore, the identification of patients at high-risk for VTE may enable faster diagnosis of
      VTE and better use of thromboprophylaxis.

      Recent studies have developed a novel tool to stratify VTE risk in cancer patients before
      they initiate anti-cancer treatment. We hypothesized that this risk tool will accurately
      identify cancer patients at high-risk and that its implementation in our clinical practice
      will result in a faster clinical diagnosis of VTE.

      Our objective is: a) to evaluate the ideal strategy to incorporate the tool in our clinical
      setting as seamlessly as possible, and b) to determine whether the tool accurately predicts
      risk and results in a faster investigation for VTE.

      Patient eligibility will be determined during the patient's initial consult to the Ottawa
      Cancer Center after cancer diagnosis has been confirmed by the medical Oncologist and before
      initiation of anticancer treatment. Follow-up for this study will be for 12 months and
      patients will be seen at the time of scheduled appointments for cancer treatment.

    <description>Defined as patients whose primary malignancy is located in the brain, bladder, lung, testicle, stomach, pancreas and lymphatic system and whose risk score before the beginning of anticancer treatment is ≥ 2 according to the Risk Stratification Method proposed by Khorana et al. (2008).
Based on this method, the model includes 5 predictive variables as follows:
Site of cancer: classified as very high-risk (+2 points) or high-risk (+1 point).
Platelet count: (&gt;350 x 109/L) (+1 point)
Hemoglobin level (&lt;100 g/L) and/or use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (+1 point)
Leukocyte count (&gt; 11 x 109/L)(+1 point).
body mass index (≥ 35 Kg/m2) (+1 point).</description>

    <description>Defined as patients whose primary malignancy is located in the brain, bladder, lung, testicle, stomach, pancreas and lymphatic system and whose risk score before the beginning of anticancer treatment is &lt; 2 according to the Risk Stratification Method proposed by Khorana et al. (2008).
In order to confirm the patient low risk status, we will draw a blood sample to determine serum levels of D- dimer and soluble P selectin in patients of this low risk group according to Ay et al. (2010). If levels of D-dimer are ≥ 1.44 µg/mL and/or soluble P selectin ≥ 53.1 ng/mL, we will add one point for each one of the increased biochemical marker and the total score recalculated.</description>

        VTE within the group of cancer patients whose primary malignancy is located in the brain,
        bladder, lung, testicle, pancreas, stomach and lymphomas.
