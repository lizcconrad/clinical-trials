      The investigators are investigating the benefits of a mind/body intervention, Mindfulness
      Based Stress Reduction, for adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a prospective, randomized controlled pilot trial assessing the feasibility and
      safety of a study investigating mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) as an intervention
      in adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). We are assessing safety and feasibility of
      this intervention, as well as using neuroimaging (fMRI) to assess improved connections in the
      default mode network. We will also be assessing the impact of this intervention on cognitive
      function and measures of well-being.

    <description>To judge the feasibility of the trial, recruitment efforts will be documented in terms of number of eligible patients approached, number who declined participation, number successfullyl recruited, and number who completed the trial. The trial will be feasible if 85% (the absolute percentage of patients) complete the trial.</description>
