  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open-label, non-randomised, single-dose study in 6 healthy male subjects.
      Subjects attended a screening visit within 28 days before drug administration. Subjects were
      admitted to the clinical unit on the morning of the day before dosing (Day -1) and received a
      single oral administration of study drug in a fasted state on Day 1. Subjects were resident
      in the clinic for up to 7 days after dosing; they could be discharged sooner if a mass
      balance cumulative recovery of &gt;95% was achieved, or if a mass balance cumulative recovery of
      &gt;90% was achieved and &lt;1% was collected within 2 separate, consecutive 24 h periods. At
      specified times during the study period, blood samples were taken and urine and faeces were
      collected for PK analysis. Safety assessments were also performed.

          7. Good state of health (mentally and physically) as indicated by a comprehensive
             clinical assessment (detailed medical history and a complete physical
             examination),electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory investigations (haematology, blood
             chemistry and urinalysis).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          5. Subjects who admit to any current or previous use of Class A drugs such as opiates,
             cocaine, ecstasy, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and intravenous amphetamines
             (Subjects who admit to occasional past use of cannabis will not be excluded as long as
             they have a negative drugs of abuse test and have been abstinent for at least 12
             months)

             monoxide reading of greater than 10 ppm at admission

          7. Radiation exposure from clinical studies, including that from the present
             study,excluding background radiation but including diagnostic X-rays and other medical
             exposures, exceeding 5 mSv in the last twelve months or 10 mSv in the last five years.
             No occupationally exposed worker, as defined in the Ionising Radiation Regulations
             1999, shall participate in the study
