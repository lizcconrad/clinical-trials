      The purpose of this study is to determine the best initial test in patients admitted to the
      hospital complaining of chest pain.

    <textblock>
      Currently, physicians can either choose a stress test or a CT scan of the heart to evaluate
      patients admitted with with chest pain. Very little is known about which test provides the
      best information to physicians, positively impacts patients medical care, and decreases
      future hospital admissions and testing. To study this the investigators are randomizing
      patients admitted to our hospital with chest pain to a stress test or coronary CT
      angiography. The investigators will then follow these patients for a 2 year period.
