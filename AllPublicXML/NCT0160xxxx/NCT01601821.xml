  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Efficacy Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy failure was defined as first occurrence of either biopsy confirmed acute rejection, graft loss or death within 12 months of post-transplantation. Percentage of participants with efficacy failure was reported.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Serum Creatinine Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males; however, the normal values are age-dependent as elderly patients typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Creatinine Clearance</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Creatinine clearance (CCr) is a measure of kidney function. CCr is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 millimeters per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) by Nankivell Method</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3, 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using the Nankivell formula. GFR by Nankivell equation= (6.7 per serum creatinine) plus (0.25*body weight) minus (0.5*serum urea) minus (100 per height square) plus (35 for male or 25 for female). A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;)90 mL/min per 1.73 m^2 [mL/min/1.73 m^2], although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;)15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 indicated kidney failure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Biopsy-Confirmed Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnosis of acute rejection was made via kidney biopsy using Banff criteria. Percentage of participants with biopsy-confirmed acute rejection was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Histologic Grade of First Acute Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnosis of acute rejection was made via kidney biopsy. Categorization of biopsies with suspected acute rejection was based on histological findings using updated 1997 Banff criteria. Grade 1A: cases with significant interstitial infiltration (&gt;25% of parenchyma affected) and foci of moderate tubulitis (5-10 cells/tubular cross section), Grade 1B: with severe tubulitis (&gt;10 cells/tubular cross section), Grade 2A: mild-moderate intimal arteritis, Grade 2B: severe intimal arteritis and Grade 3: transmural arterits and/or fibrinoid necrosis. Data is reported as percentage of participants.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Survived</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Survival defined as participants living with or without a functioning graft.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Graft Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Graft survival defined as those participants who did not experience graft loss. Graft loss defined as physical loss (nephrectomy), functional loss (necessitating maintenance dialysis for &gt;8 weeks), retransplant or death during the first 12 months after randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Presumptive or Documented Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Presumptive or documented infection during the 12 months after transplantation; was confirmed by culture, biopsy, or serology and reported. Percentage of participants with presumptive or documented infection was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Histologically Confirmed Lymphoproliferative Disease</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Lymphoproliferative disorder represents an abnormal proliferation of B cells in response to either primary or reactivated infection with Epstein-Barr virus. Percentage of participants with histologically confirmed lymphoproliferative disease was reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Efficacy Failure or Premature Elimination</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy failure was defined as the first occurrence of acute rejection, graft loss, or death. Premature elimination was defined as elimination from the study for any other reason.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of Anemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Diagnostic criterion for anemia was based on the laboratory results; in men: hemoglobin (Hb) &lt;14 gram per deciliter (g/dL), hematocrit (Hct) &lt;42%, or red blood cells (RBCs) &lt;4.5 million/liter (million/L); for women: Hb &lt;12 g/dL, Hct &lt;37%, or RBC &lt; 4 million/L.

        <title>Serum Creatinine Level</title>
        <description>Serum creatinine is an indicator of kidney function. Creatinine is a substance formed from the metabolism of creatine, commonly found in blood, urine and muscle tissue. It is removed from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. An increased level of creatinine in the blood indicates decreased kidney function. Normal adult blood levels of creatinine are 0.5 to 1.1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) for females and 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for males; however, the normal values are age-dependent as elderly patients typically have smaller muscle mass.</description>

        <title>Creatinine Clearance</title>
        <description>Creatinine clearance (CCr) is a measure of kidney function. CCr is the volume of blood plasma that is cleared of creatinine by the kidneys per unit time. Normal values for healthy, young males are in the range of 100-135 millimeters per minute (mL/min) and for females, 90-125 mL/min. Creatinine clearance decreases with age. A low creatinine clearance rate indicates poor kidney function.</description>

        <title>Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) by Nankivell Method</title>
        <description>GFR is an index of kidney function. GFR describes the flow rate of filtered fluid through the kidney. GFR was calculated using the Nankivell formula. GFR by Nankivell equation= (6.7 per serum creatinine) plus (0.25*body weight) minus (0.5*serum urea) minus (100 per height square) plus (35 for male or 25 for female). A normal GFR is greater than (&gt;)90 mL/min per 1.73 m^2 [mL/min/1.73 m^2], although children and older people usually have a lower GFR. Lower values indicated poor kidney function. A GFR less than (&lt;)15 mL/min/1.73 m^2 indicated kidney failure.</description>
