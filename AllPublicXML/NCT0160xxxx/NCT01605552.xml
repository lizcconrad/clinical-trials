      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate whether a computerized depression
      treatment, delivered before the onset of heart disease, reduces the risk of heart disease in
      the future. Participants in this trial will be primary care patients who are depressed but do
      not have a history of heart disease. Half of these patients will receive a standard treatment
      (usual care), and the other half will receive eight weeks of an evidence-based psychological
      treatment called Beating the Blues®, which is a computerized, cognitive behavioral treatment
      program for depression. To evaluate change in heart disease risk, the investigators will
      measure the functioning of the arteries using ultrasound before and after the treatment. It
      is hypothesized that patients who receive Beating the Blues® will show greater improvements
      in both depression and artery function than patients who receive standard treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD); unfortunately,
      past trials have not detected a cardiovascular benefit. A promising and unexplored
      explanation for these results is that the interventions were delivered too late in the
      natural history of CAD. Because no study has evaluated this possibility, there is a critical
      need to determine whether evidence-based depression treatment, delivered before the onset of
      clinical CAD, reduces cardiovascular risk. Accordingly, the objective of the proposed
      clinical and translational research is to perform a preliminary evaluation of the efficacy of
      a highly disseminable depression intervention in decreasing CAD risk. To achieve this goal, a
      clinical trial of depressed primary care patients free of cardiovascular disease is being
      conducted. Patients will be randomized to usual care or a computer-based, cognitive
      behavioral intervention called Beating the Blues®, the most widely used and empirically
      supported computerized treatment program for depression. The primary outcome is brachial
      artery flow-mediated dilation, a noninvasive measure of endothelial function. The specific
      aim of the proposed trial is to evaluate whether Beating the Blues®, delivered prior to the
      onset of clinical CAD, improves endothelial dysfunction. Demonstrating that earlier treatment
      of depression with Beating the Blues lowers CAD risk, the long-term expected outcome, would
      place computed-based depression treatment in the armamentarium of CAD prevention strategies
      of the primary care provider. This change to clinical practice should result in improved
      cardiovascular risk management, which in turn would translate into reduced CAD morbidity and
      mortality.

    <description>Patients will undergo ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery will be obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff will be inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then will be rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles will be acquired. FMD values will be computed as the % change in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation.</description>

    <description>Self-reported depressive symptom severity was measured at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment visits by the 20 depression items from the Symptom Checklist 90 (Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale; SCL-20). Each item on the scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores are the average across all response items and range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

            <description>Patients and their primary care providers were informed of the positive depression screen, and follow-up was encouraged.
Usual Care: Patients randomized to usual care will be informed that they have clinically significant depressive symptoms and will be encouraged to follow-up with their primary care physicians, who will receive a letter from our team indicating that their patient has elevated depressive symptoms and was randomized to the control condition. The letter will also encourage physicians to follow-up with their patients and will provide a list of local mental health services. Like those in the intervention group, usual care patients will continue to have access to and will receive any medical and mental health services that are part of usual care in the targeted health care systems. Thus, there are no restrictions regarding the care that these patients can receive.</description>

          <title>Change in Brachial Flow-Mediated Dilation (FMD) From Pre- to Post- Treatment</title>
          <description>Patients will undergo ultrasound assessment of brachial FMD in accordance with established guidelines. After a 10-minute supine rest, high-resolution baseline images of the brachial artery will be obtained from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles. Next, the forearm cuff will be inflated to 250 mmHg for 5 minutes and then will be rapidly deflated. At 60 and 90 seconds post-deflation, images from 3 consecutive cardiac cycles will be acquired. FMD values will be computed as the % change in brachial diameter at either 60 or 90 seconds after cuff deflation.</description>

        <description>Self-reported depressive symptom severity was measured at pre- (0 weeks) and post- (12 weeks) treatment visits by the 20 depression items from the Symptom Checklist 90 (Hopkins Symptom Checklist depression scale; SCL-20). Each item on the scale ranges from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Total scores are the average across all response items and range from 0 to 4 with higher scores indicating greater levels of depressive symptoms.</description>

        <population>One participant in the usual care group did not complete the SCL-20 at the pre-treatment visit. Therefore a change score could not be computed for this participant. The remaining number of participants in usual care for this analysis was 13.</population>

Beating the Blues (BtB): BtB is a widely used, empirically supported, computer-based, CBT program for depression designed for use in primary care clinics. BtB utilizes an interactive, multimedia format to deliver and eight 50-minute, weekly therapy sessions. General topics covered include identifying and challenging automatic thoughts, cognitive errors, core beliefs, and attributional styles; activity scheduling; problem solving; graded exposure; task breakdown; sleep management; and relapse prevention. In addition to session work, patients are assigned homeworks that are customized to their needs and reviewed at the start of each session. A progress report, including whether the patient is experiencing suicidal ideation, is generated at the end of each session.</description>
