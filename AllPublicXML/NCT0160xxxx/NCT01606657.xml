    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators are trying to find out if washing out the abscess (pocket of
      pus) with fluid will help, instead of only taking out the pus. Your care will be the same as
      usual, except that you will be selected randomly to have your abscess washed out with fluid,
      or not.

    <textblock>
      Irrigation of the abscess cavity is commonly described as part of the procedure of incision
      and drainage of cutaneous abscesses (1-4). Despite this, there are no randomized controlled
      trials that demonstrate the benefit of irrigation in treatment of these abscesses. Potential
      disadvantages of irrigation include increased procedural time, pain, increased cost with
      sterile irrigation solutions and materials to capture the irrigation effluent, and increased
      risk of microbiologic contamination of the surrounding area. The goal of this study is to
      examine patients undergoing incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses to determine if
      irrigation of the abscess cavity affects the need for further interventions.
