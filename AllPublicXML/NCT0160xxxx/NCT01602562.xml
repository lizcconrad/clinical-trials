      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preventive efficacy for HSV infection and safety
      of valaciclovir (VACV) in the adult and pediatric HSCT patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is a multicenter open-label study on the adult and pediatric
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients. The primary objective is to confirm
      the preventive efficacy for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of 256U87 (VACV:
      valaciclovir) due to the treatment before or immediately after hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation. The secondary objective is to confirm the safety of VACV in the case of its
      use for such a purpose.

      This clinical study consists of the following two periods: the screening period lasting 7
      days at the longest and the administration period from 7 days before HSCT to 35 days after
      HSCT (43 days in total). During the administration period, adult patients are orally given a
      VACV tablet twice daily, while pediatric patients are orally given VACV granules twice daily
      at a dose of 25 mg/kg b.w. (maximum dose per treatment: 500 mg). Pediatric patients weighing
      40 kg or over may be orally given a VACV tablet twice daily.

    <measure>Number of Participants With a Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infection</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day -7 (7 days before HSCT) to Day 35 (35 days after HSCT)</time_frame>
    <description>Viral isolation/identification was conducted if the investigator (or subinvestigator) suspected HSV infection according to the relevant clinical symptoms (oral mucositis, skin infection, genital herpes, and pneumonia). If the result of viral isolation/identification was positive, the participant concerned was defined as a case of HSV infection. For reference, a virus deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) identification (PCR) was simultaneously performed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day -7 (7 days before HSCT) to Day 35 (35 days after HSCT)</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury. Refer to the general AE/SAE module for a list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

    <description>Urinalysis parameters included: urine bilirubin (UB), urine occult blood (UOB), urine glucose (UG), urine ketones (UK), urine protein (UP), and urine urobilinogen (UUG). The dipstick is a strip used to detect the presence or absence of these parameters in the urine sample. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative (Neg), Trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ (in order of increasing levels). Data are reported as the number of participants who had Neg, Trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ levels at Screening, Day 14, and Day 35. If a category has not been reported for a specific parameter, then no participants were measured in that category.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE)</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition, or is an event of possible drug-induced liver injury.

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Result for the Indicated Urinalysis Parameters Tested by Dipstick at Screening, Day 14, and Day 35</title>
        <description>Urinalysis parameters included: urine bilirubin (UB), urine occult blood (UOB), urine glucose (UG), urine ketones (UK), urine protein (UP), and urine urobilinogen (UUG). The dipstick is a strip used to detect the presence or absence of these parameters in the urine sample. The dipstick test gives results in a semi-quantitative manner, and results for urinalysis parameters can be read as negative (Neg), Trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ (in order of increasing levels). Data are reported as the number of participants who had Neg, Trace, 1+, 2+, and 3+ levels at Screening, Day 14, and Day 35. If a category has not been reported for a specific parameter, then no participants were measured in that category.</description>
