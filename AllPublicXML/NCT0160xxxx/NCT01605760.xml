    <textblock>
      The safety and efficacy of specific sublingual immunotherapy for house dust mite allergens in
      patients over 60 years of age with allergic rhinitis and a confirmed allergy to house dust
      mites were the focus of the stu First, 111 patients, ages 60-75 years, with allergic rhinitis
      and with a confirmed allergy to D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae by the use of skin prick
      tests, serum-specific IgE and nasal provocation tests were included. Patients were
      individually randomised to groups: active or placebo using a double-blind method. A total of
      51 subjects in the sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy (SLIT) group (Staloral 300R,
      Stallergens, France) and 57 in the placebo group were monitored for three years. The patients
      had to record on a diary card whenever they used anti-allergic medications.

    <description>Staloral (R) 300 is a sublingual solution of allergen extracts for allergen immunotherapy. During a 16 day incrementally increasing dose period, patients took daily increasing doses period, patients took 1-8 drops of the 100 IR/ml extract during the first 8 days. Then, on days 9-16, patients took 1-8 drops of the 300 IR/ml extract. Next, patients received maintenance treatment consisting of five applications of eight drops (equivalent to 0.5 mL) of 300 IR/mL extract five times a week. The mean duration of the treatment was 28.2 months (range: 3-36 months).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with allergic rhinitis who fulfilled the ARIA criterion and had a positive
             skin prick test (SPT), were positive for specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) and had
             positive nasal provocation tests (NPTs) by Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p) and
             Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) were included in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any of the following characteristics were excluded:

               -  hypersensitivity to other allergens,

               -  non-allergic rhinitis (especially senile or vasomotor rhinitis) or

               -  severe non-stable diseases (especially bronchial asthma). However, stable
                  coronary disease, diabetes, arterial hypertension and well-controlled, mild or
                  atopic bronchial asthma were permitted.
