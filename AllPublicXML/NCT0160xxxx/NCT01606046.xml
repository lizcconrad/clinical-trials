      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of vapocoolant spray and topical
      lidocaine 2.5% + prilocaine 2.5% cream (EMLA) on reducing pain during needle
      electromyography.

      The study was conducted on patients with patients that underwent needle EMGs in the lower
      extremity between July and August 2011 at the university hospital. The patients were divided
      into a total of three groups by random assignment: a control group that did not receive
      pretreatment, a group that received ethyl chloride vapocoolant spray and a group that
      received topical anesthetic cream (EMLA cream®).The patients with spray group, they were
      sprayed with ethyl chloride vapocoolant spray for 5 seconds from a distance of 30 cm just
      before the needle EMG, and patients with EMLA cream, they received an application of topical
      anesthetic cream on the needle electrode insertion site 60 minutes before the needle EMG. The
      37-mm monopolar needle electrode was vertically inserted into the medial head of the
      gastrocnemius muscle in all patients.

      To assess the degree of pain for each group, patients were asked to indicate their level of
      pain on a 100 mm VAS (0, no pain; 100, worst intolerable pain) after the needle EMG in the
      gastrocnemius muscle.

      In both experimental groups, a 5-point Likert scale was used to evaluate patient satisfaction
      with the pain reduction method used and their willingness to use the same analgesic method in
      another EMG.
