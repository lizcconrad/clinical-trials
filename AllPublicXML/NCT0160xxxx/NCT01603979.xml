  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center, open-label, multiple dose, dose escalation study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, dose limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and/or Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamics, and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity of AV-203, an ERBB3 inhibitory antibody, administered once
      every 2 weeks via intravenous (IV) infusion in subjects with metastatic or advanced solid
      tumors. Once the RP2D is determined, patients with tumor types of interest will be evaluated
      in an expansion cohort at the RP2D for safety and anti-tumor activity.

    <description>The antibody AV-203 is a humanized immunoglobulin G1/kappa (IgG1/κ) monoclonal antibody that targets the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) ERBB3 and inhibits ERBB3 activities. AV-203 will be administered as a 60 to 75-minute IV infusion once every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
