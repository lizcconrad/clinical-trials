  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of volatile anesthetics in cardiac anesthesia is very common, because of their
      cardioprotective effects and their ability to ensure a sufficient depth of anesthesia. In
      line with the development of fast track concepts in cardiac anesthesia, volatile anesthetics
      are widely used to avoid a delayed recovery from cardiac surgery and anesthesia. Volatile
      anesthetics are delivered from calibrated vaporizers in the anesthesia machine or the
      cardiopulmonary bypass machine (during extracorporeal circulation).

      Isoflurane and Sevoflurane are the most commonly used volatile anesthetics in patients
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The vaporizer of the anesthetics is on the
      cardiopulmonary bypass machine and the volatile agent is blended with air and oxygen. Until
      now, the pharmacokinetics of halothane, enflurane, isoflurane and desflurane during CPB have
      been described.

      Sevoflurane might be of advantage because of additional myocardial protective effects during
      cardiac anesthesia and cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the pharmacokinetics of sevoflurane
      during CPB have not been investigated so far, although its being used at many hospitals.

      The investigators will conduct a randomized prospective study with either sevoflurane or
      isoflurane during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. The study will help to answer the questions
      about the possible cardioprotective effects of the widely used volatile anesthetics and the
      hemodynamic stability during cardiopulmonary bypass. Knowing the pharmacokinetics of these
      drugs allows the anesthesiologist to titrate the volatile anesthetics more precise.

      The investigators hypothesizes that the maximal postoperative increase in troponin T will be
      smaller in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group. The investigators hypothesizes
      that the total amount of noradrenaline needed during the entire period of cardiopulmonary
      bypass will be smaller in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group. The
      investigators hypothesizes that kinetics of washin and washout at the CPB will be faster in
      the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group. The investigators hypothesizes that the
      time to extubation, respectively the length of stay in intensive care unit and hospital is
      shorter in the sevoflurane group than in the isoflurane group.

      Endpoints Primary Endpoint: Troponin

      The study will compare the maximum postoperative troponin levels in the isoflurane and
      sevoflurane groups as a direct quantitative marker of damaged myocardial cells. Maximum
      troponin levels should be reached within the first 24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary Endpoints:

      A) Hemodynamic stability during on-pump

      The investigators will compare the hemodynamic stability during CPB between the isoflurane
      and sevoflurane group. Therefore the total dosage of noradrenaline used during the surgery
      will be measured.

      B) Washin and Washout Kinetic

      Kinetics of washin and washout of sevoflurane and isoflurane during CPB will be investigated
      and described.

      C) Extubation time and length of stay in the intensive care and in hospital

      Time to extubation and the length of stay in intensive care unit and in hospital will be
      documented.

      D) Mortality after 30 days

      The mortality after 30 days will also be monitored. If the patient is no more in the hospital
      a phone call will be made.
