  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is the most common cause of early morbidity and mortality
      following lung transplant and is characterized by acute lung injury and capillary leak
      leading to an increase in extravascular lung water index (ELWI) and impaired graft function.
      PGD has many features in common with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). PGD may be
      life-threatening and can also lead to impaired long term lung function. In ARDS, a
      restrictive fluid strategy has been associated with an improvement in lung function and
      outcomes. Accurate methods of evaluating, quantifying and guiding the hemodynamic / fluid
      management and limiting the extent of ELWI that accumulates in the setting of PGD are
      lacking. Using transpulmonary thermodilution to estimate ELWI and the pulmonary permeability
      index (PPI) represents a novel approach to fluid management, which has been used in patients
      with ARDS, but to date not in the transplant setting. To determine if these measurements may
      better guide the management of lung transplant patients, the investigators first wish to
      establish whether these methods are able to predict the onset of clinical pulmonary edema
      earlier, whether they correlated with traditional markers of PGD, and whether they may be
      useful for predicting outcomes.

      AIM 1: The investigators will evaluate the correlation between ELWI and current surrogates of
      pulmonary edema in lung transplant patients with and without Primary Graft Dysfunction (PGD)

      AIM 2: The investigators will correlate the use of ELWI and PPI to determine the presence and
      severity of PGD.

      AIM 3: a) The investigators will determine whether early measurements of ELWI and PPI can
      predict the onset of PGD.

      b) Across different strata of PGD, the investigators will determine whether ELWI and PPI have
      a differential effect on duration of mechanical ventilation.

      The results of the study will be used for the following:

        1. Provide the rationale for routine monitoring of ELWI to detect PGD if found to be more
           discriminatory and have a stronger association with outcome compared to the current gold
           standard.

        2. Provide the means of early identification of those as risk of developing PGD in order to
           guide management decisions or future therapeutic interventions aimed at preventing or
           treating PGD.

        3. Provide the requisite groundwork for a clinical trial comparing the effects of an
           ELWI-driven protocol versus usual care on ICU outcomes in lung transplant recipients.

    <description>On post operative day 1 (24 hours following lung transplant), the investigators will evaluate whether extravascular lung water measured at 24 hours correlates with pulmonary edema determined by reviewers of the CXR blinded to the extravascular lung water measurement.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>24 hours following lung transplant, the investigators will evaluate whether the combination of extravascular lung water and pulmonary permeability measurements at 24 hours correlate with the presence and severity of primary graft dysfunction (PGD) at 24 hours. The median extravascular lung water and pulmonary permeability measurements will be calculated. The combinations of above/below median extravascular lung water with above/below median pulmonary permeability will be correlated to the presence of PGD. (eg. high ELWI + high PPI, high ELWI + low PPI, low ELWI + high PPI, low ELWI + low PPI) using Pearson's and Spearman's correlation where appropriate.
