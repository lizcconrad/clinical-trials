  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate whether transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation (TENS) could reduce pain during cannulation of vein.

    <textblock>
      One hundred patients were allocated randomly to two groups: In the active TENS group TENS was
      delivered via two electrodes on the venous cannulation site (radial side of the wrist of
      dominant forearm) 20 min prior to venous cannulation and control group received placebo (no
      current) TENS. Venous cannulation with a 22 gage cannula was performed. During venous
      cannulation the pain intensity (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable) was measured. Any
      side effects during study periods were recorded

    <description>In the active TENS group, TENS at 80 pulsed currents per second (PPS) with a pulse duration of 200 Î¼s were delivered for 20 minutes. Current amplitude was slowly increased until a level was reached that participants reported was the maximum level they could tolerate below pain threshold without noticeable muscle contraction and maintained this intensity.</description>
