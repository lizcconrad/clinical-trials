    <textblock>
      This study will measure the amount of lidocaine and tetracaine in the blood after 2-, 4-, and
      12-hour application of 4 Synera patches and a 4 hour application of 4 patches without heat.

      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of lidocaine and
      tetracaine after 2-, 4-, and 12-hour application of 4 Synera® patches and a 4-hour
      application of 4 lidocaine/tetracaine patches without heat in healthy adult subjects and to
      monitor the frequency and nature of adverse events. In addition to determining the
      pharmacokinetics for a one-time application of 4 Synera® patches, steady-state
      pharmacokinetics were modeled and residual patch concentrations of lidocaine and tetracaine
      were determined.
