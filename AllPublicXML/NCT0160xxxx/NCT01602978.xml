  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether a validated sensor that is able to
      measure how much oxygen-carrying molecules called hemoglobin using pulse hemoglobin and Pleth
      Variability Index (PVI)] are in your blood during surgery can help your doctors manage how
      much fluid and possibly blood you need to get during your surgery. The hope of the study is
      that the device may provide an early indication you are having bleeding and this may mean you
      need to be treated with a transfusion. Our current method of checking this is by getting a
      blood sample for analysis. The investigators hope is that this device may be able to alert
      the clinician of the need for blood or fluids without a blood draw being needed.
