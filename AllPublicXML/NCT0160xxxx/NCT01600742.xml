  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vorinostat is a potent and well tolerated HDAC inhibitor. It has been reported to enhance
      radiosensitivity of cancer cells. We hypothesize that the addition of vorinostat to WBRT may
      increase therapeutic efficacy for patients with brain metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with
      brain metastases. Although WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27~56%) and is
      effective in palliation of neurologic symptoms, the response duration is limited and
      neurologic progression remains the main cause of death in a significant number of patients.

      Vorinostat is reasonably well tolerated and there is also compelling evidence that vorinostat
      may serve as a radiosensitizer. Preclinical studies of HDAC inhibition have also shown
      efficacy in neuron protection. These data suggest that the addition of vorinostat to the
      standard therapy of WBRT may potentially increase their therapeutic efficacy without
      increasing neurotoxicity, and support the rationale of this phase II trial of vorinostat with
      WBRT in patients with brain metastases.
