  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal outlines the design of a cluster randomized controlled trial to compare the
      effectiveness of a new approach to integrating smoking cessation services into routine
      interactions with patients in the primary care setting using an adaptation of the Ottawa
      Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC). The OMSC aims to systematically identify the smoking
      status of all patients, provide brief cessation advice, and offer evidence-based cessation
      support to those interested in embarking on a quit attempt. This study will provide important
      new evidence to assist with the development of a more comprehensive cessation system in the
      province of Ontario and across Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multi-component intervention has been designed to facilitate the uptake of the OMSC using
      best evidence regarding the integration of smoking cessation intervention into primary care
      practice. The secondary objective of the study is to examine the incremental value of
      providing tailored performance feedback to primary care practitioners when delivered as part
      of the OMSC intervention program.

    <description>The primary objectives of this study are to determine whether the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC) increases:
the delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions within family doctors' offices,
number of patient quit attempts, and
patient bio-chemically verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence measured at 6-months compared to standard care control practices.</description>

    <description>The secondary objectives of this study are to examine the incremental impact of audit and feedback on:
provider delivery of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions,
number of patient quit attempts, and
7-day point prevalence abstinence measured at 6-months in family doctors' offices compared to the OMSC alone and standard care control practices.</description>

    <description>The OMSC Group will receive a multi-component intervention which includes:
Coaching and Outreach Facilitation Visits: Each practice will receive on-site support to implement the intervention components.
Practice tools and real time prompts: Practices will be provided with 4 tools to support the integration of evidence-based cessation practices into brief clinical encounters as part of a practice-level strategy.
Provider Training in Smoking Cessation Interventions: All clinic providers will be invited to a 3 hour training workshop on smoking cessation(CME).
Telephone follow-up support program: Clinics will be able to refer smokers embarking upon a quit attempt to the smoker's telephone follow-up counseling program.</description>

    <description>The OMSC + Performance Feedback Group will receive the same intervention program as the OMSC group. In addition, clinicians will complete a one-hour audit and feedback session prior to the implementation of the OMSC program at their clinic. The goal of the audit and feedback is to increase provider self-efficacy in the delivery of smoking cessation interventions, raise awareness of the current delivery of evidence-based cessation practices, identify areas for improvement, and motivate providers to deliver evidence-based treatments.</description>
