    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate different side effect in contraceptive use of two
      oral combined contraceptive pills (OCP)in combination of 30 mcg ethinylestradiol/2 mg
      chlormadinone acetate (Belara®) and 30 mcg ethinylestradiol/3 mg drospirenone (Yasmin®),
      especially body weight change.

    <textblock>
      Oral combined contraceptive pills (OCP) is the most contraceptive use in reproductive women.
      The various type of progestins in OCP give various effects either benefit (non-contraceptive
      benefit) and side effect. These effects depend on pharmacological activity of each progestin.
      Many studies showed causes of discontinuation use of OCP, such as increase body
      weight,androgenic effect and vaginal spotting. OCP in combination of 30 mcg
      ethinylestradiol/2 mg chlormadinone acetate (Belara®) and 30 mcg ethinylestradiol/3 mg
      drospirenone (Yasmin®)are the common used in practice. The each type of progestin
      (chlormadinone and drospirenone) might effect different outcomes in women especially in body
      weight change during use. Chlormadinone is a C-21 progestin which has glucocorticoid and
      antiandrogenic effect. Drospirenone is a progestin in spironolactone derivative which has
      antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic effect. Both progestins might has less effect in
      body weight change and provide other non-contraceptive benefits. So investigator want to
      study the different effects from these progestin in two type of OCP. The result from this
      study could give information to choose the proper OCP for each reproductive woman.

    <measure>efficacy in contraception (pregnancy rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate contraceptive efficacy of two OCP. Urine pregnancy test was used to evaluate pregnancy, the participant was tested in every visit of the study.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Other side effects</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate other side effects during using both OCP,such as vaginal spotting, androgenic effect, blood pressure, headache and GI effect. Vaginal spotting was classified by number of pad (WHO definition) which the participant used in each cycle and record in menstrual card. Androgenic effect was classified by Modified Ferriman - Gallway Score for hirsutism (score &gt; 7), American Academy of Dermatology Consensus 2009 on acne classification (mild, moderate, severe)for acne, systolic/diastolic blood pressure and the presence or no presence of headache and GI discomfort.</description>

    <measure>satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6 month</time_frame>
    <description>To compare satisfaction in study process. In each visit (first, 3rd month and 6th month of study period). The participant was evaluated satisfaction in topics of diagnosis, timing of study process, information from the staff about the study process and the way to use oral pills, quality of the oral pills and conclusive satisfaction. The rating of satisfaction was categorised in five levels as five scoring numbers by using questionnaire; 5=extreme satisfaction, 4=very satisfaction, 3=moderate satisfaction, 2= little satisfaction, 1=no satisfaction.</description>
