      This phase I clinical trial studies the side effects of vaccine therapy and cyclophosphamide
      in treating patients with stage II-III breast cancer or stage II-IV ovarian, primary
      peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an
      effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving vaccine
      therapy and cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of administering one cycle of cyclophosphamide and six subsequent
      monthly vaccinations with a peptide-based vaccine targeting folate receptor (FR)-alpha
      (multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine).

      II. To assess the ability of this vaccination protocol to elicit an immune response as
      measured by activated FR-alpha-specific T lymphocytes or high-affinity antibodies.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine FR-alpha expression status of primary tumors when available as
      formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material and whether expression correlates with the ability
      to generate an immune response.

      II. To identify human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I binding peptides from FR-alpha that
      are recognized by lymphocytes from patients prior to and after vaccination.

      III. To determine whether cyclophosphamide treatment, prior to vaccination, results in
      regulatory T cell depletion by assessing regulatory T cells before and immediately after
      cyclophosphamide treatment.

      IV. To compare FR-alpha (FRa) expression levels in tumor removed at primary surgery to FRa
      expression levels in tumor removed for clinical purposes at disease recurrence. (For ovarian
      cancer patients whose disease recurs.)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7 and 15-21 of
      course 1. Within 3-5 days, patients receive multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide
      vaccine intradermally (ID) on day 1. Vaccine treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
