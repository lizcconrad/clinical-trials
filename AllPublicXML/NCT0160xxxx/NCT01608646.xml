  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A new oral DPD inhibitory fluoropyrimidine (DIF), S-1, is reportedly effective against
      gastrointestinal carcinoma. In this study, the relationship between activity of DPD in
      peripheral blood and the effects of chemotherapy were investigated in 200 patients treated
      with first-line S-1 combined with platinum chemotherapy for gastrointestinal carcinoma.
