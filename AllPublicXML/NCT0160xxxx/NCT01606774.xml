      The investigators plan to identify 80 pregnant women at low risk for obstetrical
      complications and replace 4-5 routine third trimester visits with a structured program of
      home weight, blood pressure and urine protein monitoring along with regular structured phone
      interviews and a 28 week ultrasound. The investigators hypothesis is that this protocol is
      both safe and acceptable.

          -  No prior second trimester miscarriage/fetal loss after 13 weeks

          -  Previous delivery

          -  If yes, all had uncomplicated antepartum course

          -  All Deliveries &gt; 37 weeks

          -  All birth weight &gt; 2700 grams

          -  Spontaneous conception

          -  No family history of pre-eclampsia

          -  Agrees to first trimester aneuploidy screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on routine physical exam or routine laboratory
             results

          -  Multiple pregnancy

          -  Fetal abnormalities detected on either the 11-14 week or the 18 week ultrasound
             including a nuchal translucency &gt; 3 mm but not including second trimester markers for
             aneuploidy or a low lying placenta

             &lt; 1 %ile (abnormalities of these serum analytes routinely obtained as part of
             aneuploidy screening are associated with an increased risk of adverse outcome)
