  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators propose a conversion scheme with 50% reduction in CNI
      dosage until adjustment of everolimus dosage, in order to reach a trough blood level of 6-10
      ng/mL, thus avoiding overimmunosuppression or alternatively breakthrough rejection episodes.

      The hypothesis of this study is to demonstrate that the therapeutic regimen with Myfortic®
      and Certican® significantly improves renal function compared with the standard regimen of
      CNI.

    The inclusion of proposed sample turned to be infeasible due to Ethical Non-approval of 2

    <description>The eGFR will be calculated by Cockcroft-Gault, CKD-EPI and MDRD equations, firstly 4-5 months after transplantation (baseline), and then 6 and 12 months after conversion to everolimus (Certican ®) and suspension of CNI, associated with Myfortic ® (mycophenolate sodium enteric-coated - MSEC).</description>

    <description>35 randomized Patients Converted to Certican® (Everolimus C0=6-10 ng/mL) + Myfortic® 1440mg/day + Steroids.
On the day of conversion (day 1), 2 mg everolimus will be introduced in the morning and at night, as morning dose of CsA or Tac will be maintained and evening dose of CsA or Tac will be reduced by 50%.
In two days, 2 mg everolimus will be associated with 50% of CsA or Tac original dosage, both in the morning and evening. After that, everolimus dose will be adjusted to achieve a C0 target level of 6-10 ng/mL. Once target levels of everolimus are met, the CNI drug will be suspended.</description>
