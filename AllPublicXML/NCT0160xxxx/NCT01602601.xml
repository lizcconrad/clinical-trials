  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study IDS116406 will be a non-interventional, phlebotomy study in Hunter Syndrome patients
      who are currently being treated with idursulfase, an enzyme replacement therapy, and in at
      least a single patient who is na誰ve to treatment, if possible to recruit. All patients
      enrolled into the study will have a single blood draw for the analysis of antibodies induced
      by this enzyme replacement therapy (idursulfase). Patient samples with positive responses to
      antibodies induced by idursulfase will be used to further evaluate whether the antibodies
      induced by idursulfase bind to GSK2788723 molecules in vitro and if these antibodies
      neutralize the bioactivity of GSK2788723 in vitro. Each subject will have a screening visit,
      which may occur at their regularly scheduled out-patient visit. If the patient consents to
      participate in the study, a blood sample (total volume of approximately 3mL) for
      immunogenicity analysis will be drawn before their current treatment infusion

        Inclusion Criteria:

        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if patient meets criteria 1 and
        2 or 1 and 3:

          -  Diagnosed with Hunter syndrome

          -  Patients with Hunter syndrome who are being treated with idursulfase

          -  Patients with Hunter syndrome who are na誰ve of idursulfase treatment (if possible*)
             *This study will also attempt to recruit 1 patient who has never received idursulfase.
             If a na誰ve patient has not been identified within an agreed amount of time between GSK
             and the investigator, the study will concluded without this sample

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who are currently participating in another clinical trial are not permitted
             to be enrolled in this study.
