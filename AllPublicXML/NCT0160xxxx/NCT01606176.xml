      To investigate the ability of a cannabis based medicine extract to relieve chronic refractory
      pain of neurological origin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Multiple Sclerosis or other defect of neurological function with a qualifying
      symptom of chronic refractory pain, entered a seven day baseline period, followed by a 21 day
      randomised, double blind, parallel group comparison of GW-1000-02 with placebo, self-titrated
      to symptom resolution or maximum tolerated dose. The ability of the cannabis based medicine
      extract to relieve chronic refractory pain was assessed by the change from baseline in pain
      score using Box Scale-11 (BS-11) scores recorded in the patients' daily diary.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Pain Box Scale-11 Score at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each day, in the morning (on waking), at lunchtime and in the evening (just before going to bed), patients recorded in their patient diary their level of pain using a Box Scale-11 pain score ranging from zero &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;worst possible pain&quot;. Week 3 analysis was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study. The last day was taken as the last day with complete diary card pain data that occurred on or before the last day the patient took study medication. A negative value from baseline indicates and improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sleep Disturbance Score at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Each day patients were asked to record in their patient diary, whether or not they were woken due to pain the previous night. Answers were recorded as &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;Twice&quot;, &quot;More than twice&quot; and &quot;Awake most of the night&quot;; these were converted to a five point scale, zero to four, respectively. Sleep disturbance was summarised and analysed in the same manner as the analysis of the primary efficacy parameter of Box Scale-11 pain score. A negative value from baseline indicates and improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Pain Disability Index Score at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The index consists of seven assessments of pain (representing different aspects) with each assessment scored on a zero &quot;no disability&quot; to 10 &quot;total disability&quot; scale. The total Pain Disability Index was calculated as the un-weighted sum of the seven pain scores; if one or more of the pain scores were missing then the total Pain Disability Index was set to missing. A reduction in score from baseline indicates and improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Total Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) Score at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items (range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Spitzer Quality of Life Index Scores at 3 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index questionnaire consists of five sections, relating to activity, daily living, health, support and outlook. Each section has three choices (numbered 1, 2 and 3) and the patient was required to choose the one that best described their quality of life during the last week. Choice 1 is scored two, Choice 2 is scored one and Choice 3 is scored zero. The total Spitzer Quality of Life Index was calculated as the unweighted sum of the five scores. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Change at the End of 3 Weeks of Treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>0 - 3 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Change consisted of a single question relating to improvement in overall condition since the start of the study. The results were recorded as &quot;Very Much Improved&quot;, &quot;Much Improved&quot;, &quot;Minimally Improved&quot;, &quot;No Change&quot;, &quot;Minimally Worse&quot;, &quot;Much Worse&quot; and &quot;Very Much Worse&quot; and were converted to a seven point scale ranging from one to seven, respectively. The number of patients who reported being &quot;Very Much Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved&quot; is presented.</description>

        <description>Each day, in the morning (on waking), at lunchtime and in the evening (just before going to bed), patients recorded in their patient diary their level of pain using a Box Scale-11 pain score ranging from zero “no pain” to 10 “worst possible pain”. Week 3 analysis was defined as the mean of the last seven days in the study. The last day was taken as the last day with complete diary card pain data that occurred on or before the last day the patient took study medication. A negative value from baseline indicates and improvement.</description>

        <description>The index consists of seven assessments of pain (representing different aspects) with each assessment scored on a zero “no disability” to 10 “total disability” scale. The total Pain Disability Index was calculated as the un-weighted sum of the seven pain scores; if one or more of the pain scores were missing then the total Pain Disability Index was set to missing. A reduction in score from baseline indicates and improvement.</description>

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items (range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) is a 14-item questionnaire that asks patients to rate pain over the prior week and the degree to which it interferes with activities on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0=no pain and 10=pain as bad as you can imagine. Severity is measured as worst pain, least pain, average pain, and pain right now. The severity composite score was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the four severity items (range 0-10). The minimum value is zero and maximum is 10. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

        <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index questionnaire consists of five sections, relating to activity, daily living, health, support and outlook. Each section has three choices (numbered 1, 2 and 3) and the patient was required to choose the one that best described their quality of life during the last week. Choice 1 is scored two, Choice 2 is scored one and Choice 3 is scored zero. The total Spitzer Quality of Life Index was calculated as the unweighted sum of the five scores. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Spitzer Quality of Life Index Scores (Multiple Sclerosis Subset) at 3 Weeks.</title>
          <description>The Spitzer Quality of Life Index questionnaire consists of five sections, relating to activity, daily living, health, support and outlook. Each section has three choices (numbered 1, 2 and 3) and the patient was required to choose the one that best described their quality of life during the last week. Choice 1 is scored two, Choice 2 is scored one and Choice 3 is scored zero. The total Spitzer Quality of Life Index was calculated as the unweighted sum of the five scores. A reduction in score from baseline indicates an improvement.</description>
