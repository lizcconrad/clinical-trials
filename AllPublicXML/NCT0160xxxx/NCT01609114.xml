    <textblock>
      The concurrent use of chemotherapy during radiation therapy (CCRT) is now the important
      treatment stratagem for locally advanced head and neck cancer or nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC).
      For these cases, 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CDDP) are the most commonly used agents
      of CCRT. It plays an important role to improve the treatment outcome and increases the
      opportunities for organ preservation.

      In the past, Radiotherapy (RT) was solely used as a local treatment and its effect was
      estimated by local effect model. However, growing evidence shows that irradiation has direct
      DNA damage-dependent effects as well as sending signals to neighboring cells. Recently, the
      investigators reported that abdominal irradiation could significantly modulate the systemic
      pharmacokinetics of 5-FU at 0.5 Gy, off-target area in clinical practice, and at 2 Gy, the
      daily treatment dose for target treatment in an experimental rat model. Additionally, the
      results from a clinical investigation showed that colorectal cancer patients with lower AUC
      of 5-FU during adjuvant chemotherapy had lower disease-free survival. Taken together, these
      lines of evidence support the importance and necessity to search for the mediators
      responsible for the unexpected effect of local RT on systemic pharmacokinetics of
      chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-FU.

      In the present study, the investigators examined whether the phenomena and mechanism of
      RT-PK(pharmacokinetics) is a fact for different anticancer drugs and for different part in
      human.
