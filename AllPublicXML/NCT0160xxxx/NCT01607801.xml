  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      background Operation for small umbilical hernias is one of the most common surgical
      procedures, but the best surgical technique, including the choice of suture or mesh remains
      unknown.

      It is well known that using non-absorbable sutures in closure of the abdomen, diminishes the
      risk of incisional hernias and wound healing problems.It has also been found that the use of
      resorbable suture in fixation of the mesh in Lichtesteins procedure leads to greater risk of
      recurrence of the hernia. Furthermore, it has been stated in smaller studies, that the use of
      the mesh in open operation for a small umbilical hernia has lower risk of recurrence (approx.
      1-3%) than sutured repair (10-12 %). However, the scientific literature is deficient, with
      few patients.

      The purpose of this study is to describe reoperation rate of recurrence after small umbilical
      hernias, depending on choice of sutures in both regular repair and in mesh repair.

      Hypothesis: sutured repair with non-absorbable suture has lower recurrence rates than with
      other types of sutures, whereas mesh repair has even lower recurrence rates in small
      umbilical hernia repairs.

      National prospective registry study with data from the Danish ventral hernia Database (DVHD)
      and the National Patient Register (LPR) in patients undergoing open to umbilical or
      epigastric hernia repair during the period 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2010.

      Apart from operator-registered perioperative data from DVHD, operations can be characterized
      with different types of sutures, choice of mesh and other relevant information, with possible
      impact on long-term outcome after surgery, including recurrence.

      There will be used frequency analyzes and Kaplan Meyer statistics, supplemented by
      multivariate Cox regression analysis, as well as non-parametric statistics.

      Eligibility criteria: OPen mesh or sutured repair for small umbilical hernias from 1th of
      January 2007 to 31th of December 2010.

      Outcome measures: Reoperation as a surrogate for recurrence.
