    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (the study of the way a drug
      enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) and safety of paliperidone palmitate in
      participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms of emotional instability,
      detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations, and withdrawal into the
      self).

      This is a multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical
      research study), open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized
      (the study drug is assigned by chance), parallel-group (Each group of participants will be
      treated at the same time), comparison study to assess the pharmacokinetics and safety of
      paliperidone palmitate (study medication) in participants with schizophrenia. The study
      comprises a 64-day Treatment period and a 155-day Follow-up period. The participants will be
      randomly assigned to one of the four study groups. The study medication will be administered
      on Days 1, 8, 36 and 64. Pharmacokinetics of the study medication will be assessed as primary
      outcome. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

          <title>Number of Participants with Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) Score</title>
          <description>Drug Induced Extra-Pyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) is a scale used to evaluate the severity of drug induced extra-pyramidal symptoms occurring during antipsychotic drug treatment. Scale consists of 8 individual symptom scales with scores ranging from 0 (none/normal) to 4 (severe). The total score is the average of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Overall severity was assessed at 5 levels (0 [none, normal]; 1 [Very Mild]; 2 [Mild]; 3 [Moderate]; 4 [severe]).</description>

          <description>The DIEPSS is a scale used to evaluate the severity of drug induced extra-pyramidal symptoms occurring during antipsychotic drug treatment. Scale consists of 8 individual symptom scales with scores ranging from 0 (none/normal) to 4 (severe). The total score is the average of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Overall severity was assessed at 5 levels (0 [none, normal]; 1 [Very Mild]; 2 [Mild]; 3 [Moderate]; 4 [severe]).</description>
          <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who were enrolled in the study and received the study medication at least once. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) Score at Day 162</title>
        <description>The DIEPSS is a scale used to evaluate the severity of drug induced extra-pyramidal symptoms occurring during antipsychotic drug treatment. Scale consists of 8 individual symptom scales with scores ranging from 0 (none/normal) to 4 (severe). The total score is the average of the 8 item scores, for a total range of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). Overall severity was assessed at 5 levels (0 [none, normal]; 1 [Very Mild]; 2 [Mild]; 3 [Moderate]; 4 [severe]).</description>

        <population>Safety analysis set included all participants who were enrolled in the study and received the study medication at least once. Here 'N' (number of participants analyzed) signifies those participants evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With Clinical Global Impression Severity (CGI-S) Score</title>
        <description>The CGI-S rating scale is a 7 point (1-absent, 2-minimal, 3-mild, 4-moderate, 5-moderate severe, 6-severe, 7-extreme) global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 is equivalent to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 is equivalent to &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <population>The PPS included all participants who were enrolled in the study, received study medication at least once and had at least one efficacy evaluation. LOCF imputation method was used. Here ‘n’ signifies participants evaluable for this measure at specified time point for each arm group.</population>
