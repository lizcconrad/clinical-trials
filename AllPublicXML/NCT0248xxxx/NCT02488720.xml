  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LEARN study a multicenter, observational study will that will evaluate the rate of
      cognitive change in approximately 500 clinically normal older individuals who &quot;screen-fail&quot;
      for the A4 trial on the basis of their screening PET imaging not demonstrating evidence of
      elevated amyloid accumulation (Aβ negative) but meet all other A4 study eligibility criteria.
      This study will leverage the A4 infrastructure and maximize the data acquired in screening a
      large number of well-characterized older adults for the A4 trial.

      The LEARN observational cohort will provide a critical comparison group for the A4 placebo
      arm, and future trials in preclinical AD. Although accumulating longitudinal data suggest
      that older individuals with elevated Aβ burden are at increased risk of cognitive decline, it
      is important to demonstrate a differential rate of clinical decline between Aβe (&quot;Aβ
      elevated&quot;) and Aβne (&quot;Aβ not elevated&quot;) individuals on a standardized set of clinical
      outcomes. Over 2000 well-characterized, highly motivated older volunteers will &quot;screen fail&quot;
      for the A4 trial. The LEARN study will follow 500 of these individuals, matched as closely as
      possible to the two treatment arms, in this observation cohort. The LEARN study may
      selectively recruit from a specific range of SUVr that fall below the threshold for &quot;elevated
      amyloid&quot; in order to support analyses of the relationship of baseline SUVr to subsequent
      cognitive change and amyloid accumulation. The observational cohort will be followed for 168
      weeks with identical clinical/cognitive testing performed every 24 weeks, running parallel to
      the A4 treatment study.

        500 subjects without evidence of elevated ABeta on screening PET scan. Subjects will have
        consented to participate in the A4 trial and previously met demographic, cognitive and
        clinical criteria and have an A4 screening PET scan results that fallows below the ABeta
        threshold levels required for randomization into the treatment arms for the A4 trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Consented to participate in the A4 study and previously met A4 demographic, cognitive
             and clinical criteria (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Clinical Dementia
             Ratin (CDR); Logical Memory test, part IIa (LMIIa); medications; medical history).

          2. Has a florbetapir PET scan that falls below the Aβ threshold levels required for
             randomization into the treatment arms of the A4 trial.

          3. In general, permitted medications should be stable for 8 weeks prior to LEARN Visit 1.
             Changes to medications that, in the opinion of the investigator, are not likely to
             impact LEARN Visit 1 assessments are permissible.

          4. Has a study partner that is willing to participate as a source of information and has
             at least weekly contact with the subject (contact can be in-person, via telephone or
             electronic communication). The study partner must have sufficient contact such that
             the investigator feels the study partner can provide meaningful information about the
             subject's daily function.

             interfere with the analyses of safety and efficacy in this study.

          3. Has any contraindications for MRI studies, including claustrophobia, the presence of
             metal (ferromagnetic) implants, or a cardiac pacemaker that is not compatible with
             MRI.

          4. Has a LEARN Visit 1 MRI scan with results showing &gt;4 hemosiderin deposits (definite
             microhemorrhages or areas of superficial siderosis); or any amyloid-related imaging
             abnormalities - edema/effusions (ARIA-E).

          5. Has received any exclusionary medication, including those with significant central
             nervous system (CNS) anticholinergic effects, within 3 months prior to LEARN Visit 1
