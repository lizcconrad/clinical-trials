  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the AboutFace peer education website for the purpose
      of reducing stigma and improving attitudes toward seeking mental health services among
      Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research suggests that at least 1 in 10 Veterans will meet criteria for posttraumatic stress
      disorder (PTSD) related to their military experience. Treatment is widely available to
      Veterans with PTSD, and national dissemination initiatives have increased Veterans' access to
      best practice interventions. However, treatment seeking remains strikingly low among Veterans
      with PTSD. In fact, most Veterans with PTSD do not seek mental health services due to
      perceived stigma and other associated barriers. The National Center for PTSD recently
      developed and launched AboutFace, a peer education resource for Veterans. The investigators
      of this study believe that AboutFace has tremendous potential to reduce stigma and improve
      attitudes toward seeking mental health services among Veterans. However, it has not yet been
      evaluated. Investigators have partnered with the National Center for PTSD to launch this
      mixed methods pilot evaluation of AboutFace.
