    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of selinexor when given after stem
      cell transplant in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that is at intermediate or
      high risk of spreading or coming back (intermediate- or high-risk), or myelodysplastic
      syndrome that is at high risk of spreading or coming back (high-risk). Selinexor works to
      stop cancer growth by blocking an enzyme, which may cause cancer cells to die and also kill
      cells that cause the cancer to grow, which commonly do not respond to regular chemotherapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of selinexor in patients with hematologic
      malignancies, especially acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), after
      allogeneic (allo)-stem cell transplant (SCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of selinexor as maintenance treatment after allo-SCT.

      II. To determine the incidence of non-relapse mortality. III. To determine 2 years post SCT
      progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival rates.

      IV. To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      V. To assess lymphoid and myeloid chimerism post transplantation.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To analyze donor immune re-constitution after allo-SCT with selinexor maintenance.

      II. To monitor minimal residual disease (MRD) by Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) during selinexor treatment in AML/MDS patients.

      III. To characterize the physiopathology of the leukemia initiating cells (LIC) at the time
      of disease relapse on selinexor maintenance and compare that at initial diagnosis of the
      disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Beginning on day 60-100 after allo-SCT without evidence of GVHD above grade 1 and disease
      relapse with stable hematopoietic recovery, patients receive selinexor orally (PO) on day 1
      of each week or on days 1 and 3 of weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

The number and percentage of patients with any treatment emergent AE (TEAE) will be summarized for each treatment group, classified by system organ class and preferred term. The number and percentage of patients with TEAEs assessed by the investigator as at least possibly related to treatment will also be tabulated. The number and percentage of patients with any grade &gt;= 3 TEAE will be tabulated in the same manner. Serious adverse events also tabulated.</description>
