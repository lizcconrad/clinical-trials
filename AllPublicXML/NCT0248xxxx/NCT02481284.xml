      The purpose of this study was to perform a quantitative perfusion study of the undermined
      abdominal skin in deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap breast reconstruction
      patients in order to obtain more knowledge on perfusion dynamics. Laser Doppler perfusion
      imaging (LDPI) was used to evaluate this.

      Microcirculatory changes were monitored in the abdominal skin of 20 consecutive patients.
      Measurements were taken and recorded within four standardized zones covering the skin between
      the xiphoid process and the upper incisional boundary of the flap (zone 1-4; cranial to
      caudal).

      Background: No studies have assessed the perfusion of the undermined abdominal skin in breast
      reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap. A greater understanding
      of the procedure's impact on the perfusion of the abdominal skin can be valuable in
      predicting areas susceptible to necrosis.

      Methods: Microcirculatory changes were monitored in the abdominal skin of 20 consecutive
      patients undergoing breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric artery perforator
      flap. Quantitative mapping was performed with laser Doppler perfusion imaging at seven set
      intervals. Measurements were taken and recorded within four standardized zones covering the
      skin between the xiphoid process and the upper incisional boundary of the flap (zone 1-4;
      cranial to caudal).

        20 women consecutively undergoing secondary, unilateral breast reconstruction with a DIEAP
        flap were identified and recruited to participate in the study. The patients were informed
        about of risks and benefits and gave written consent prior to participation. All smokers
        stopped smoking 4 weeks prior to surgery.
