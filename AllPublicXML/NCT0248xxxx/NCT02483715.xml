  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to now, there is few randomized, large scale study prospectively and simultaneously
      comparing the efficacy, adverse effects and patient adherence of high-dose dual therapy
      (HDDT) and bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT) as 1st-line regimens for H. pylori
      eradication.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. to compare the efficacy of HDDT, and BQT as 1st-line regimen in H. pylori eradication;

        2. to compare the patient adherence and adverse effects of these treatment regimens;

        3. to investigate factors that may influence H. pylori eradication by these treatment
           regimens.

      Participants, aged ≥ 20, having H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis with/without peptic
      ulcers (duodenal or gastric ulcers) will be recruited. All undergo endoscopy with biopsy for
      rapid urease teat, histology, and bacterial culture before treatment. Four to eight weeks
      after termination of treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined by the 13C-urea
      breath test. The CYP2C19 genotype of each participant will be analyzed by the polymerase
      chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymerase (PCR-RFLP) method. A computed
      generated random numbers sequence will be blocked into two subgroups, say A, and B.

      If the participants did not receive anti-H. pylori therapy previously, they will be invited
      to enter this study for evaluated the efficacy of these 1st-line regimens. Participant who
      meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any one of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomized to receive one of the following regimens:

      group A- HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg qid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid for 14 days);

      group B- BQT ( rabeprazole 20 mg qid + tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg qid +
      metronidazole 250 mg qid + tetracycline 500 mg qid for 10 days);

      All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and drug
      consumption daily during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the participants will be
      followed up at the Outpatients Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse effect of
      treatment.
