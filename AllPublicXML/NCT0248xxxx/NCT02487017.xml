  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma, who had received Transcatheter Arterial
      Chemoembolization (TACE) , will be randomly divided into group A (receive DC-CIK+ TACE
      treatment) or group B (just receive TACE), and the randomize ratio will be 1:1.
