    <textblock>
      Team-based learning (TBL) is a learner-centered, instructor-directed strategy for small group
      active learning in large group educational settings. When TBL is conducted correctly, the
      students' performances are equivalent or improved in comparison to either lecture-based
      formats or more traditional small group learning models.1 Nevertheless, few studies have been
      published regarding the insertion of innovative audiovisual tools in the TBL context. The
      Virtual Human Project is described as powerful sequences of three dimension (3D) computer
      graphics video of the human body that aids learning by facilitating an understanding in
      relation to a specific subject. The Virtual Human is composed by video sequences combining
      anatomy, physiology, and morphology in the context of various diseases. There are video
      sequences available for many disciplines, including dermatology and with capacity to produce
      anatomical structures by 3D printer. Despite the incredible potential applications of the
      Virtual Human, few studies have assessed its impact on medical education. The investigators
      did not find any study evaluating TBL with the insertion of iconographic educational material
      that assessed whether this intervention could change the learning progress of students. This
      is the aim of the present study, by comparing students tests scores after a TBL session with
      the VIrtual Human videos about leprosy or a standard TBL session, and to evaluate the
      student's satisfaction with the Virtual Human videos.
