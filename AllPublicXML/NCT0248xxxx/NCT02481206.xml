      A multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial with 1:1 assignment of
      treatment and control. This study will evaluate the impact of wearable cardioverter
      defibrillator use on sudden cardiac death in incident hemodialysis patients. The study will
      enroll up to 2,600 subjects. A maximum of 200 sites in the USA will be used for enrollment.

      Objective:

      To study the impact of wearable cardioverter defibrillator (WCD) use on sudden cardiac death
      in hemodialysis patients.

      Study Population:

      Participants will be patients beginning hemodialysis (&lt;2 months from initiation) who are ≥ 50
      years old.

      Intervention:

      A WCD will be used for protection against sudden cardiac death (SCD).

      Study Design:

      The study will be a multi-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial with 1:1
      assignment of treatment and control.

      Study Size:

      The study will enroll up to 2,600 subjects. A maximum of 200 sites will be used for
      enrollment.
