      Background: Individuals with COPD may present reduced peripheral muscle strength, which leads
      to impaired mobility. Comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should include strength
      training, in particular to lower limbs. Furthermore, simple tools for the assessment of lower
      extremity muscles' performance are required. Objectives: To assess the muscle strength of
      COPD patients by the sit-to-stand test (STST) as compared to the one-repetition maximum
      (1-RM), considered as the gold standard in non-laboratory situations, and to evaluate the
      responsiveness of STST to a PR program with specific strength training (SPR), compared to
      usual PR program (UPR). Methods: 60 moderate-to-severe COPD inpatients were randomly included
      into either the SPR or into the UPR. 30-sec STST, 1-min STST, 1-RM and 6MWT were assessed
      before and after PRs.
