  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether combining electronic nicotine
      delivery systems (ENDS) with nicotine patch treatment will augment abstinence rates compared
      to either treatment alone.

      Cigarette smokers, who are motivated to quit smoking but who rate the inhalation aspects of
      smoking as important will be randomized to three groups: Group 1. Nicotine ENDS + nicotine
      patch; Group 2: Nicotine ENDS + placebo patch; Group 3: Placebo ENDS + Nicotine patch.
      Participants will initially receive 1 week of 21 mg nicotine (or placebo) skin patches while
      continuing to smoke their usual cigarettes ad lib, in order to assess responsiveness to
      Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Starting with week 2, participants will receive
      nicotine-containing (or placebo) ENDS devices (menthol or non-menthol versions in accordance
      with their baseline preference). They will also be instructed to substitute ENDS for as many
      cigarettes as possible in this week. The target quit-smoking date will occur at the beginning
      of week 3. Treatments will continue until week 8 post-quit, at which time participants will
      be instructed to reduce ENDS use over the next 4 weeks, at which time ENDS will no longer be
      dispensed. Subsequently, the nicotine patch dose will be gradually reduced according to
      standard weaning regimen from 21 mg/24 h to 14 mg/24 h for 2 weeks, and 7 mg/ 24 h for 2
      weeks. All nicotine-based treatments will end at week 16 after the quit date.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4-8 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 4-8 post target Quit Day while treatment is ongoing. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 8). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking after withdrawal of ENDS</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 9-12 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 9-12 post target Quit Day while participants are decreasing their use of ENDS. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 12). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Continuous four-week abstinence from smoking after withdrawal of nicotine patches</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 13-16 post target Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be continuous four-week abstinence from smoking during weeks 13-16 post target Quit Day while participants are using decreasing doses of nicotine patches. This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 16). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Seven-day point abstinence from smoking at 6 months post Quit Day</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months post Quit Day</time_frame>
    <description>A secondary outcome measure will be seven-day abstinence from smoking at six months post target Quit Day. This will be determined by self-report of no smoking for the previous seven days when called for 6-month follow-up, verified by expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at 6-month follow-up visit). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>
