    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combining of radiofrequency ablation (RFA)
      and cytokine-induced killer cells (CIK) transfusion can prolong survival of patients with
      ovarian carcinoma.

      The primary objective is to evaluate whether RFA followed by CIK transfusion can prolong
      survival of patients with ovarian carcinoma.
