      To study the risk prediction of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) by the
      clinical bioinformatics and genomic profile.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, cohort study, monitoring the chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neurotoxicity by traditional clinical scales, neurological examinations, and
      semi-quantitative assessments. Moreover, all the genetic changes will be analyzed by next
      generation sequencing and we will try to identify relevant variants in individuals who suffer
      from chemotherapy-induced neurotoxicity.
