  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1a/b dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability,
      and PK of OMP-131R10 as a single agent for advanced solid tumors and in subjects with
      metastatic colorectal cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1a portion of the study in subjects with advanced solid tumors will consist of a
      dose escalation part followed by a dose-expansion cohort. OMP-131R10 will be administered IV
      on the first day of each 14-day cycle.

      Dose escalation will follow a traditional 3+3 framework. Treatment will be continued until
      progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity.

      The Phase 1b portion of the study will be conducted in subjects with metastatic colorectal
      cancer whose tumors have progressed after at least 1 line of therapy for metastatic disease.

      Treatment will consist of OMP-131R10 and the FOLFIRI chemotherapy regimen.

        Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for the study:

          1. Phase 1a portion: Histologically confirmed advanced relapsed or refractory solid
             tumors that have exhausted standard of care therapy or either refuse or are not
             considered to be candidates for any remaining standard therapy.

          2. Age ≥18 years

          3. ECOG performance status 0 or 1 (see Appendix B)

          4. Must have evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1. (see Appendix C)

          5. Subjects must have Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue available either
             archived or fresh core or punch needle biopsied at study entry (two fresh
             cores/punches preferred whenever possible).

          6. Must have received their last anti-cancer therapy, including radiotherapy,
             chemotherapy, biologic therapy, or herbal therapy at least 3 weeks or 5 half-lives
             (for systemic agents), whichever is shorter, from initiation of study treatment.

             and have no requirement for a corticosteroid dose (indicated to reduce brain edema)
             that is equivalent to a prednisone dose of &gt;10mg orally per day or anti-seizure
             medication for at least 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug.

          4. Significant intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements
