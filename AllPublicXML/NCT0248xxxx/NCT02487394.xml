    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to better understand the function of asthma and COPD, and
      response to therapy. There are two Phases to this study broken into two arms. In Phase I, our
      propose is to use discovery proteins and techniques to identify protein expression
      signatures. In Phase II, is to establish and validate the predictive value of protein
      signatures for treatment responses using inhaled corticosteroids.

      There are two Phases to this study broken into two arms. In Phase I, our propose to use
      discovery proteomics and high throughput techniques to identify protein expression
      signatures. The total planned size of Phase I is 100 patients. Patients will be divided into
      two identical arms based on smoking status. One arm will contain subjects who are active
      smokers and the other arm will contain subjects with no active smoking. Active smoking will
      be defined as daily use of cigarettes, pipes, cigarillos or cigars at time of entry into the
      study and through duration of study. No active smoking defined as never smoking or having
      stopped smoking for 5 years or greater. Each arm will contain 50 subjects, 26 with COPD
      (Stage II and III with 13 subjects in each) along with 24 asthmatics (Mild to Moderate
      disease with 12 subjects in each). The investigators will not recruit Stage IV COPD due to
      the heightened risk of bronchoscopy in these patients.

      In the second Phase, is to establish and validate the predictive value of proteomic
      signatures for therapeutic responses using inhaled corticosteroids. For Phase II, the
      investigators will recruit a total of 80 subjects that will include subjects who are
      continuing in the study from Phase I. Patients continuing from Phase I will wait 4-6 weeks
      from bronchoscopy before starting Phase II. This will be done in order to avoid having the
      prior bronchoscopy affecting the Phase II results. Phase II will again be divided into two
      arms based on active smoking status as discussed previously. Each arm will contain 40
      subjects, 20 with COPD (Stage II and III with 10 subjects in each) along with 20 asthmatics
      (Mild to Moderate disease with 10 subjects in each).

    <description>Molecular phenotyping, based on protein expression and modification signatures, may be used to identify subsets of COPD that may be at risk for disease progression, have particular pathogenic features, or derive benefit from specific therapeutic agents, and hence bring closer an era of personalized medicine. Protein expression data may be able to distinguish markers of airway inflammation between asthma and COPD to prospectively identify patients based on these markers</description>
