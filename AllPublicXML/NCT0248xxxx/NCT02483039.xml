  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the impact of an AKI Follow-up Clinic on major adverse
      kidney events (MAKE) in comparison to hospitalized patients surviving an episode of AKI who
      are not exposed to the AKI Follow-up Clinic intervention.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Survivors of acute kidney injury (AKI) are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      and death, but have inconsistent follow-up care. Our team has developed and tested a model to
      deliver structured follow-up kidney care (the AKI Follow-up Clinic) that is feasible and
      sustainable, with standardized assessments based upon clinical practice guidelines that are
      transferable to any setting. This study will randomize patients with Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2-3 AKI to the AKI Follow-up Clinic or usual care (control
      group). The usual care group will have a letter outlining their AKI diagnosis mailed to their
      family physician; the usual care group may still be referred to a nephrologist by their
      healthcare provider if desired, but these participants will not have access to the AKI
      Follow-up Clinic pathways. The primary outcome is development of a major adverse kidney event
      (MAKE), a composite of death, chronic dialysis, and estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) decline. Outcomes will be ascertained after one year of follow-up, which is when AKI
      Follow-up Clinic patients are transitioned back to their family doctor or general
      nephrologist based upon pre-specified graduation criteria. Participants will also be followed
      using local hospital electronic resources and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences
      (ICES) administrative databases in order to assess the long-term impact of early nephrologist
      follow-up on AKI outcomes.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will be referred to the AKI Follow-up Clinic where they will see a nephrologist who will coordinate follow-up care. The target appointment date is within 30 days of hospital discharge. Routine laboratory investigations will be performed at minimum every three months. Additional in-person visits with a nephrologist at the AKI Follow-up Clinic will be determined at the local sites based upon the participant's clinical status. If in-person visits at 12, 24, and/or 36 weeks are not necessary given the patient's clinical status, they may be replaced with a telephone visit</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will have a letter outlining their AKI diagnosis mailed to their family physician. Participants may still be referred to a nephrologist by their inpatient or outpatient healthcare provider, but these participants will not have access to the AKI Follow-up Clinic. Rather, they will proceed through the standard local nephrology referral pathway. In addition, all usual care participants will be contacted via telephone by study staff every three months to assess their clinical condition and ensure study engagement. All usual care participants will be offered a nephrologist assessment and/or bloodwork one year after randomization to determine if ongoing nephrology care is indicated based upon the same criteria applied to AKI Follow-up Clinic participants.</description>

At the AKI Follow-up Clinic, assessment forms that were developed during the pilot study at St. Michael's Hospital may be used, but this decision will be left to individual sites. Routine laboratory investigations will be performed at minimum every three months.</description>
