  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: An anatomical surgical resection is considered to be the standard of care in fit
      patients who present with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, surgery is
      less frequently performed in both elderly patients (aged ≥75 years), who represent the
      fastest-growing group of patients with stage I/II NSCLC, and in patients who have significant
      co-morbidity. Following the introduction of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), an
      outpatient treatment that is typically delivered in between 3-8 fractions, the median
      survival of all elderly patients undergoing radiotherapy in The Netherlands increased by 9.3
      months. Randomized trials comparing SABR and surgery have yet to be completed and results of
      the ongoing ACOSOG Z4032 studies will not be available in the within 5 years. A recent data
      retrospective study comparing both modalities has raised interesting questions about the
      impact of local therapy on recurrence patterns. It was found that a better loco-regional
      disease control rate was achieved with SABR.

      Objective: To study the effect of surgery and SABR on both immunostimulatory (with primary
      endpoint CD8 positive cells) and immunosuppressive cells in peripheral blood in patients with
      early stage non-small cell lung cancer who are treated with either modality.

      Study population: 40 patients with cT1-2aN0M0 either cytologically or histologically proven
      NSCLC.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: To determine whether an increase in CD8 activity can be
      established after SABR in patients with early stage lung cancer and to compare this increase
      with that in patients undergoing a surgical intervention. Nature and extent of the burden and
      risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: Only risks in
      participation are the risks with drawing blood. Subjects will not have any benefits. This
      pilot study will be used to generate information concerning both treatments useful for the
      decision to plan a future study in a larger series of patients.
