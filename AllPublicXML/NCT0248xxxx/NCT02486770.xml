    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety profile and pharmacokinetic behavior of a single
      administration of Aerucin in healthy adults at three different dosages.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial will be conducted as an open label trial in 15 healthy adults. All
      subjects will receive a specific intravenous dose of Aerucin. There are three study groups,
      each with a specific dose of Aerucin. Study Group 1 will receive 2.0 mg/ kg of Aerucin .
      Study Group 2 will receive 8.0 mg/kg of Aerucin . Study Group 3 will receive 20 mg/kg of
      Aerucin . The dose levels of Aerucin are selected for this study based on animal studies
      showing protection in an animal model and absence of adverse effects in toxicological
      studies. Groups will be enrolled sequentially.
