    <textblock>
      The investigators performed a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human
      trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of water extract from wheat Triticum aestivum L on
      cognitive and memory function. The investigators measured changes in cognitive function
      parameters, including CNT, WMT, K-MMSE, BCRS, PRMQ, PSS, SF-36 and BDNF

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on reports about the neuroprotective effects of water extract from wheat Triticum
      aestivum L. or its bran, the investigators hypothesize that extract of wheat bran (WBE) is
      beneficial to elderly people with age-associated cognitive impairment. The investigators
      investigated the efficacy and safety of WBE on improvement of cognitive function through
      measuring the neuropsychometric assessments in adult with subjective cognitive impairment by
      a randomized clinical trial.

      Seventy participants aged from 50 to 80 years old with subjective cognitive impairment were
      randomly assigned to receive either WBE (3,000 mg/day) in this 12-week, double-blind
      placebo-controlled and parallel trial. Neuropsychological assessments including Computerized
      Neurocognitive function test (CNT), Working Memory Test (WMT), Korean Mini-Mental State
      Examination (K-MMSE), Brief Cognitive Rating Scale (BCRS), Prospective and Retrospective
      Memory Questionnaire (PRMQ), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), 36-Item of Short-Form Health
      Survey (SF-36) and blood Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were used to assess the
      cognitive function before and after the intervention.
