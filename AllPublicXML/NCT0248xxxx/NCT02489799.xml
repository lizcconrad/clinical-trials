  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through close engagement with our patient and family member co-investigators, the
      investigators have developed a video-based advance care planning aid for cancer patients and
      their family members who are preparing for major surgery. In this study, patients are
      randomized to see either the intervention video (involving advance care planning-related
      content) or a control video (no advance care planning-related content) prior to surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that the video will lead to more and better preoperative
      discussions between the patient and surgeon that are related to advance care planning. The
      investigators also hypothesize that seeing the advance care planning-related video will
      decrease perioperative anxiety and depression scores.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients pursue aggressive surgery in the hope of cancer cure or life
      prolongation. However, in doing so, patients and families may avoid advance care planning;
      they do not discuss specific goals and wishes should disease progress despite surgery.
      Moreover, a subset of patients become critically ill following surgery, and family members
      must make life-and-death decisions without knowing patient wishes. Preoperative advance care
      planning—facilitating patient and family discussions concerning perioperative goals, hopes,
      and fears—could empower patients and families to better choose which therapies and procedures
      they want outside of the initial surgery and for the months following surgery. Advance care
      planning aids exist, but none were developed for or evaluated in a surgical patient
      population. Furthermore, video-based advance care planning tools are an innovative way to
      better empower patients and families. Previous research shows that, with the aid of an
      advance care planning video, patients and families are more knowledgeable about treatment
      options and more comfortable with making decisions. Moreover, when better educated, these
      patients and families frequently choose less aggressive therapies.

      However, video-based advance care planning tools have not been developed or tested in a
      surgical patient population. The investigators have developed and now will evaluate a
      video-based advance care planning aid for cancer patients and families pursing aggressive
      surgical cancer treatment. The investigators hypothesize that, in patients and family
      members, the video-based decision aid will facilitate better preoperative discussions about
      advance care planning between the patient and surgeon and decrease anxiety and depression
      after surgery.

    <description>The RIAS scoring system using an audio-recording of a conversation to evaluate the nature of the conversation between surgeon and patient. The patient-centeredness summary score is a ratio of statements that reflect the psychosocial and socio-emotional elements of exchange about the lived illness experience of patients relative to statements that reflect a more biomedical and disease focused perspective. This score reflects the encounter as a whole, rather than an individual's dialogue. A value greater than one indicates a more patient-centered encounter; whereas, a value less than one indicates a more biomedical encounter.</description>

    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores Across Study Arms Throughout the Study Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment, one week after enrollment, one week after surgery, one month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This validated metric consists of two sub scales: one for symptoms of anxiety, and the other for symptoms of depression. Each subscale, consisting of seven questions, results in a score ranging from 0, indicating no distress, to 21, indicating maximum distress; a score higher than 7 indicates clinically meaningful anxiety or depression. Overall HADS scores, encompassing both subscales, results in a total score of 0 (no mood symptoms ) to 42 (maximal mood symptoms).</description>

        <title>Measured Patient Centeredness in the Presurgical Consent Visit</title>
        <description>The RIAS scoring system using an audio-recording of a conversation to evaluate the nature of the conversation between surgeon and patient. The patient-centeredness summary score is a ratio of statements that reflect the psychosocial and socio-emotional elements of exchange about the lived illness experience of patients relative to statements that reflect a more biomedical and disease focused perspective. This score reflects the encounter as a whole, rather than an individual’s dialogue. A value greater than one indicates a more patient-centered encounter; whereas, a value less than one indicates a more biomedical encounter.</description>

        <title>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scores Across Study Arms Throughout the Study Period</title>
        <description>This validated metric consists of two sub scales: one for symptoms of anxiety, and the other for symptoms of depression. Each subscale, consisting of seven questions, results in a score ranging from 0, indicating no distress, to 21, indicating maximum distress; a score higher than 7 indicates clinically meaningful anxiety or depression. Overall HADS scores, encompassing both subscales, results in a total score of 0 (no mood symptoms ) to 42 (maximal mood symptoms).</description>
        <time_frame>Enrollment, one week after enrollment, one week after surgery, one month after surgery</time_frame>
        <population>At each milestone of data collection, a number of participants were unable to complete the HADS questionnaire due to one of a number of factors including complicated medical course, attrition, or loss of eligibility.</population>

Advance care planning video: This is a video involving interviews with patients, a family member, two surgeons, an anesthesiologist, and an ICU nurse; these interviewees describe the typical events during a hospitalization for a major surgery and encourage the viewer to do some planning before surgery - the planning includes: (i) naming a person to make decisions for the participant, (ii) having a conversation with that person about goals and values, and (iii) continuing that conversation with the participant's surgeon.</description>

          <description>Advance care planning video
Advance care planning video: This is a video involving interviews with patients, a family member, two surgeons, an anesthesiologist, and an ICU nurse; these interviewees describe the typical events during a hospitalization for a major surgery and encourage the viewer to do some planning before surgery - the planning includes: (i) naming a person to make decisions for the participant, (ii) having a conversation with that person about goals and values, and (iii) continuing that conversation with the participant's surgeon.</description>
