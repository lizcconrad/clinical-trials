  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG)/positron emission
      tomography (PET) directed treatment improves response in patients with stomach or
      gastroesophageal junction cancer that has not spread past the stomach and is not responding
      to the usual treatment. PET scans are a different way to take pictures of cancer and can be
      used to look at how much energy (such as glucose) is being used by the cancer. Using PET
      scans early to monitor the success of treatment may allow doctors to measure response and
      change treatment accordingly.

      Pre-registered patients receive standard pre-operative chemotherapy comprising epirubicin
      intravenously 50mg/m^2 (IV) on day 1; oxaliplatin 130 mg/m^2 IV or cisplatin 60 mg/m^2 IV on
      day 1; and capecitabine 625 mg/m^2 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or fluorouracil 200
      mg/m^2/day IV continuously on days 1-21; and undergo FDG-PET following course 1 (days 15-19).
      Patients defined as FDG-PET non-responders are registered and randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      Primary objective

      To assess and compare the overall survival (OS) of patients with locally advanced gastric
      cancer classified as FDG-PET non-responders after one cycle of pre-operative chemotherapy
      randomly assigned to receive either salvage chemotherapy before and after surgery or
      immediate surgery followed by fluorouracil sensitized radiotherapy.

      Secondary objectives

        1. To assess and compare progression-free survival (PFS) between the treatment arms (Arms A
           and B).

        2. To assess and compare R0 resection rate between the treatment arms (Arms A and B).

        3. To assess and compare pathologic complete response (pCR) rate between the treatment arms
           (Arms A and B).

        4. To assess the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of each treatment arm (Arms A and
           B), including post-operative mortality rate, 30-day post-operative targeted adverse
           events (i.e., dehiscence, significant infection, and re-operation rate).

        5. To examine the changes of FDG-PET SUV induced by pre-operative chemotherapy at different
           time points (from baseline to completion of one cycle of treatment before randomization,
           and 2 cycles of salvage treatment) in patients randomized to salvage treatment arm (Arm
           B).

        6. To collect measurement of fatigue and overall perception of QOL at registration of the
           study (Alliance registration QOL assessment study).

        Pre-Registration Eligibility Criteria

          1. Documentation of Disease

             1.1 Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastroesophageal
             junction (Siewert type II, III)

             1.2 Pre-treatment clinical stage of T3-4N any M0 or T any N positive M0 as determined
             by laparoscopy, CT scan (or PET/CT), or endoscopic ultrasound (histologic confirmation
             of lymph involvement is not required). Therefore, patients can have measurable or
             non-measurable disease.

             1.3 Patients with T1-2N0M0 tumors or patients with metastatic disease are NOT
             eligible.

          2. Patients must be eligible for curative intent surgical resection.

          3. FDG Avid malignancy - Patients must have an FDG avid tumor(s). FDG avid tumors are
             defined as a primary tumor with an increased uptake in the region of the tumor that
             has an SUV of &gt; 5.0 or a tumor:liver SUV ratio of &gt; 1.5.

          4. No prior history of congestive heart failure - NYHA class I to IV or known DPD
             deficiency

          5. No current grade 2, 3, or 4 of neuropathy.

          6. No known hypersensitivity to epirubicin, oxaliplatin and cisplatin, capecitabine and
             5-flurouracil, docetaxel or irinotecan.

          7. Not pregnant and not nursing, because this study involves an agent that has known
             genotoxic, mutagenic and teratogenic effects.

             7.1 Therefore, for women of childbearing potential only, a negative serum pregnancy
             test pregnancy test done ≤ 7 days prior to pre-registration is required.

             7.2 A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who: 1) has not
             undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in
             the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          8. Age ≥ 18 years

          9. ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1

         10. Required Initial Laboratory Values:

               -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm^3

        Registration Eligibility Criteria to Treatment Arms A or B

          1. Patient must continue to be eligible for curative intent surgical resection.

          2. Disease Progression: FDG avid malignancy that is classified as an FDG PET non-
             responder. PET non-responders are defined as having &lt; 35% reduction in the FDG uptake
             of the primary tumor when compared to baseline.

          3. Concomitant Medications -

             3.1 Chronic concomitant treatment with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 is not allowed on
             this trial. Patients on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors must discontinue the drug 14 days

               -  Epirubicin, Cisplatin, and Capecitabine

               -  Epirubicin, Cisplatin, and Fluorouracil

          5. Toxicity recovery should include the following:

               -  Grade ≤ 2 neuropathy

               -  Grade ≤ 2 diarrhea

               -  Grade ≤ 2 mucositis

          6. Pre-registration chemotherapy given within 42 days of treatment (treatment meaning
