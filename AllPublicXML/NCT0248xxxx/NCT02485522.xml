  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal Incontinence (FI) is a debilitating and common condition with a prevalence ranging from
      7-15% in community dwelling women. FI has an immense impact on quality of life and is
      associated with increased care giver burden, increased rates of institutionalization, and
      significant cost burden in older women. Traditionally believed to be primarily caused by
      child birth injury, recent studies show that the typical age of onset of FI is age 40 which
      is remote from child birth. Treatment options for FI are limited because the mechanism
      underlying FI in older women are poorly understood. The overriding goal of this project is to
      investigate the relationship between diet, stool metabolites and fecal incontinence.
