  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with dementia and their caregivers are often cared for in the community through home
      healthcare (HHC). While these patients and their caregivers need significant help and often
      have difficulty maintaining their quality of life, home healthcare clinicians are often
      unprepared to care for this population. This study will therefore examine the ability of an
      integrated, multi-pronged evidence-based practice intervention for home healthcare registered
      nurses, occupational therapists and physical therapists, the DSM-H, to improve the quality of
      care and quality of life for persons with dementia and their family caregiver. The
      investigators will enroll persons with dementia and their family caregiver upon admission to
      the HHC agency and examine their quality of life over 60 days following admission, comparing
      those who receive the intervention to those who serve as controls.

      The Dementia Symptom Management at Home (DSM-H) Program is an integrated bundled
      implementation science intervention to improve interprofessional care in home healthcare
      (HHC). It consists of training, assessment instruments, patient-caregiver centered care plans
      and workflow changes. The investigators will perform a cluster randomized controlled clinical
      trial at a single, urban, non-profit HHC agency, randomizing care teams to either be trained
      in performing the intervention or serve as controls. The aims of this program are to examine
      the efficacy of this program to:

      Aim 1: Measure the effects of DSM-H on pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and caregiver rated
      QOL in the person with dementia receiving HHC.

      Aim 2: Assess the effects of DSM-H on QOL, burden and depression for the informal caregiver
      of persons with dementia receiving HHC.

      Aim 3: Assess the effects of DSM-H on the number of emergency room visits and hospital
      admissions.
