    <description>Study subjects will have follow-up visits after the EMR procedure during which the occurrence of adverse events related to the Captivator EMR procedure or device will be assessed. These visits will occur at the following time points:
Immediately following the EMR procedure (Post procedure evaluation)
48 hour telephone call
30 day telephone call
Unscheduled clinic visits will be performed in-between protocol required follow-up, as necessary.
Once the 30 day phone call is complete, the subject will have completed the study.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 18-80 years.

          2. Barrett's esophagus with a visible abnormality confirmed upon prior endoscopy. A
             visible abnormality is described as meeting one or more of the following definitions:

               -  Lesion is detected as visible based on white light imaging with any macroscopic
                  appearance according to the Paris Classification and is also endoscopically
                  resectable.

               -  Lesion is detected by narrow band imaging (NBI), but without any other specific
                  characteristics for a visible lesion.

               -  Lesion is confirmed to contain high grade dysplasia and/or carcinoma upon prior
                  biopsy.

          3. Subject is scheduled for endoscopic resection of present neoplasia

          4. Subject is amenable to EMR with no suspicion of submucosal invasion, based on the
             macroscopic appearance and/or endosonography upon earlier endoscopy.

          5. Subject is taking PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) BID (Twice Daily) 40 mg (or equivalent
             dosage).

          6. Subject is willing to participate, fully understands the content of the informed
             consent form, and signs the informed consent form.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has previously undergone endoscopic therapy for esophageal neoplasia,
             including (but not limited to) cryospray therapy, laser treatment, photodynamic
             therapy, endoscopic mucosal resection, radiofrequency ablation, argon plasma
             coagulation or radiotherapy.

          2. Presence of esophageal stenosis preventing passage of a therapeutic gastroscope.

          3. Endoscopically visible scarring by any cause of the intended treatment zone.

          4. Esophageal varices.

          5. Subject has known or suspected esophageal perforation.

          6. Coagulation disorders or anti-coagulant therapy which cannot be discontinued (aspirin
             allowed).
