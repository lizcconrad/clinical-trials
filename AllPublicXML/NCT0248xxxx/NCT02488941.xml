      Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of chronic
      liver disease in the western world and an important cause of morbidity and mortality
      including risk of cardiovascular disease. A ruling dogma is that a fatty liver is
      well-functioning. Recent studies imply the contrary but quantitative measurements of
      metabolic liver function have not been systematically investigated in NAFLD.

      Objectives: To study and quantify specific metabolic liver functions in varying degrees of
      NAFLD. Furthermore to map the coagulation system of patients with NAFLD.

      Methods: A human clinical study. Metabolic liver functions are studied by a series of
      functional tests (Galactose elimination capacity (GEC), Aminopyrine breath test (ABT),
      Indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR), Functional hepatic nitrogen clearance
      (FHNC)). Regional liver function evaluated by 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-galactose (FDGal)
      PET/CT is compared to fat infiltration assessed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Primary
      and secondary hemostasis, natural anti-coagulants and fibrinolysis are evaluated.

      Perspectives: To challenge the dogma, that hepatic metabolic function is not affected in
      NAFLD, improving the understanding of the relationship between the clinical degree of NAFLD,
      histology, metabolic functions, and imaging. Furthermore to disclose a proposed procoagulant
      imbalance in NAFLD.
