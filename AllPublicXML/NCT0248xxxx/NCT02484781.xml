  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement surgery is a very successful operation with good long-term results. Hip
      resurfacing arthroplasty is offered as a treatment option for young and active patients with
      osteoarthritis of the hip. It has been proposed as a treatment option for younger patients
      because of claims that it preserves femoral bone stock and has better functional outcomes.
      The assessment of gait after hip replacement surgery may be able to determine functional
      differences between patients who have undergone total hip replacement / arthroplasty (THA)
      versus hip resurfacing.

  <detailed_description>

      A group of 58 patients, part of a ungoing randomized trial comparing resurfacing hip
      arthroplasty to metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty, will be invited to a single gait
      analysis on a trendmill. All patients have reached a follow up of five years. Patient 's gait
      will be assessed during two walking sessions, in both sessions spatio-temporal, kinetic and
      kinematic parameters will be recorded.

        -  At first when flat walking with increasing speeds to their top walking speed.

        -  Secondly: when walking at a fixed speed with an increasing incline to their top walking
           incline.
