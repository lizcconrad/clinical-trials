    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cytokine-induced killer
      cell (CIK) plus S-1 and Bevacizumab vs S-1 and Bevacizumab as Maintenance Treatment for
      patients with advanced colorectal cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1200 patients with stage Ⅳ colorectal cancer,who had received surgery and chemotherapy,will
      be randomly divided into group A（receive CIK plus S-1 and Bevacizumab ) or group B（just
      receive S-1 and Bevacizumab),and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will
      receive 3 cycles of CIK treatment (every 1 year) and Apatinib (continuous).Patients in group
      B will receive only S-1 and Bevacizumab (continuous) .

    <description>S-1 is an oral anticancer agent, is a derivative of fluorouracil. Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a recombinant human monoclonal IgG1 antibody, which plays a role in the biological activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor. Bevacizumab is mainly used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer.
