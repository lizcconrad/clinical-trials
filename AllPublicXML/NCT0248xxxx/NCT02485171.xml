  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the use
      of the robot &quot;SAFEWALKER&quot; complement classical rehabilitation in a group of elderly patients
      over 70 years during the rehabilitation of post-fall syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The post-fall syndrome is an acute functional complications of falls that affects nearly one
      in five elderly fallers. It combines phobia of the previous vacuum, axial and hypertension
      astasia abasia.

      Unrecognized and untreated, it progresses to a major regressive syndrome, severe physical,
      psychological and social implications. Only an early rehabilitation for an early resumption
      of walking, prevents such a development.

      The main element is to support and encourage the subject to walking. In practice, it was
      found that the physiotherapist can not be present daily and the duration of its intervention
      is often short-lived.

      This study will examine the contribution of a medical device of a walking aid (SAFEWALKER the
      robot) in the rehabilitation and empowerment of seniors with a post-fall syndrome. The
      SAFEWALKER, which is a walking aid device (http://www.safewalker.com), completes the support
      action exercised by a third person, by reducing support and securing travel. It allows the
      subject to move alone at will and is a continuity in relation to the management of the
      physiotherapist, a potential source of motivation.

      The hypothesis is that the SAFEWALKER device can be complementary to the walking
      rehabilitation in post-fall syndrome.
