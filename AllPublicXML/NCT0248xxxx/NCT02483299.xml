  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment with liraglutide and
      metformin is more effective than metformin as monotherapy in the treatment of obese women
      with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We anticipated greater changes in body weight in
      patients on combined treatment than in those on monotherapy.
