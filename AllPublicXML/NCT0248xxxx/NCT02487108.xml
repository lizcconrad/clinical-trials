          1. Men and women aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive.

          2. Patients who are scheduled to undergo a primary unilateral first metatarsal Austin
             bunionectomy with distal osteotomy and internal fixation without any collateral
             procedures (ie, uncomplicated procedure).

          3. Patients who according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status
             (PS) classification system are classified PS-1 (normal, healthy patient) or PS-2 (mild
             systemic disease).

          4. The patient is able to speak English and is willing to provide written informed
             consent, including a written opioid agreement, to participate in the study.

          5. The patient has a body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 33.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at the
             time of screening.

          6. The patient is in generally good health as determined by a medical history, medical
             examination, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, and serology.

          7. Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal)
             must use a medically acceptable method of contraception and must agree to continue use
             of this method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after discontinuation of
             the study drug, unless they have exclusively same-sex partners. Acceptable methods of
             contraception include intrauterine device (IUD) known to have a failure rate of less
             than 1% per year, hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected),
             and barrier method with spermicide, abstinence, and partner vasectomy.

             NOTE: A woman will be considered surgically sterile if she has had a tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

          8. The patient, if a man, is surgically sterile, or, if capable of producing offspring,
             is currently using a medically acceptable method of contraception and agrees to
             continue use of this method for the duration of the study (and for 90 days after
             taking the last dose of the study drug because of the possible effects on
             spermatogenesis), unless he has exclusively same-sex partners. Acceptable methods of
             contraception include abstinence, barrier method with spermicide, female partner's use
             of steroidal hormonal contraceptive (oral, implanted, transdermal, or injected) in
             conjunction with a barrier method, female partner's use of an IUD known to have a
             failure rate of less than 1% per year, or if his female partner is surgically sterile
             or 2 years postmenopausal. In addition, male patients may not donate sperm for the
             duration of the study and for 90 days after taking study drug.

          9. The patient must be willing and able to comply with study restrictions and to remain
             at the clinic for the required duration during the study, and willing to return to the
             clinic for the follow-up evaluation as specified in this protocol.

         10. The patient must not participate in any other study involving an investigational agent
             while enrolled in the present study.

         11. The patient must report a pain intensity score of ≥4 on an 11-point NPRS-11 within 9
             hours after stopping postsurgical analgesia and immediately before randomization.

         12. The patient should be free of any surgical or anesthetic complications after the
             surgery, which is to be performed using the intraoperative anesthetic regimen and the
             postoperative analgesic regimen that was followed appropriately without deviations
             that would confound analgesic assessments after receipt of the investigational
             product.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a chronic pain condition, excluding bunion pain that requires taking
             opioid analgesics within 30 days prior to surgery or use of non-opioid analgesics
             (acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) within 24
             hours prior to surgery. Stable therapy of &gt;30 days for acetylsalicylic acid (up to 81
             mg/day) is allowed as cardiovascular prophylaxis.

          2. Use of glucocorticoids (except nasal corticosteroid sprays and/or topical
             corticosteroids) for any condition within 6 months before study drug administration.

          3. The patient uses any nonpharmacologic pain management techniques (eg, physical
             techniques, physiotherapy, massage therapy, acupuncture, biofeedback, and/or
             psychological support) and is unable or unwilling to discontinue prior to
             randomization (or study start).

          4. The patient has any other medical or psychiatric condition or is receiving concomitant
             medication/therapy that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the
             patient's safety, compliance with the study protocol procedures, or collection of
             data.

          5. The patient has a clinically significant abnormality in the physical examination
             and/or clinical laboratory test values.

          6. The patient is a pregnant or lactating woman. (Any woman becoming pregnant during the
             study will be withdrawn from the study.)

             visit.

          8. The patient is participating any currently ongoing research study.

          9. The patient has any disorder that may interfere with gastrointestinal (GI) drug
             absorption (eg, gastric bypass surgery, lap band, malabsorption syndrome, and
             inflammatory bowel disease) or other condition that may have an effect on patient
             safety or efficacy aspects of participation in the opinion of the investigator.

         10. The patient is allergic to or has had a serious reaction to hydrocodone or other
             opioids, acetaminophen, ropivacaine, lidocaine, ketorolac, ibuprofen, propofol, or any
             of the drugs required by the study protocol.

         11. The patient has a recent history (within 5 years) or current evidence of alcohol or
             other substance abuse, with the exception of nicotine.

         12. The patient has a positive urine drug screen (UDS) for cocaine, marijuana, opioids,
             amphetamines, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and/or methadone,
             unless explained by the use of prescription medication.

         13. The patient has a history of suicidality as assessed by patient medical history and/or
             the C-SSRS.

         14. The patient is expected to have elective surgery during the study other than a
             bunionectomy.

         15. The patient has a history of malignancy within 5 years (except for treated basal cell
             carcinoma).

         16. The patient has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen or antibodies
             to hepatitis C, or known or tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus.

         17. The patient has received a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) within 14 days before
             the first dose of study drug.
