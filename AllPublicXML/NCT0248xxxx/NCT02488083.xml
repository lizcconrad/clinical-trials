      UltraShape Device for Thigh Fat and Circumference Reduction- Up to 60 healthy adult
      volunteers seeking for noninvasive thighs circumference reduction, male and females, 18 to 60
      years of age from up to four investigational sites.

      Eligible subjects will receive 3 bi-weekly treatments (2 weeks interval) on one randomized
      thigh with the UltraShape device according to the study protocol. The other thigh will not be
      treated during the main study phase (and serve as control).

      The subjects will return for 3 follow up visits: four weeks (4wk FU), eight weeks (8wk FU)
      and 16 weeks (16wk FU) after the last treatment.

      Total expected study duration: 20-22 weeks. Should the subject choose to receive additional
      optional treatments on the untreated side, up to three bi-weekly treatments will be performed
      upon study completion at no cost to the subject while changing total study duration to 24-26
      weeks.
