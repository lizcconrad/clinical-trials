      In order to confirm that Lucica 速 Glycated Albumin-L is useful for the intermediate term
      (preceding 2-3 weeks) monitoring of glycemic control in patients with diabetes, subjects with
      Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes will be enrolled whose HbA1c values range from 7.5% to 12% (or
      higher) in Group 1 and &lt;7.5% in Group 2 at Visit 1, and the comparison of glycated albumin
      (GA) and other glycemic control indices will be performed during 6 months in 8 clinical sites
      in US. Group 1 will consist of 90 evaluable subjects who have a change in diabetes management
      to improve glycemic control; this therapy can include oral agents, insulin, or noninsulin
      injectable anti-diabetic medications. Group 2 will consist of 40 evaluable subjects already
      on a stable diabetic management program, who have had no change in treatment in the last 3
      months and for whom there is no plan to make a change during the study period.

        The study will include a cross-section of subjects from the intended use population who are
        being monitored for glycemic control. Equal numbers of subjects with Type 1 or Type 2
        diabetes will be enrolled whose HbA1c values range from 7.5% to 12% (or higher) in Group 1
        and &lt;7.5% in Group 2 at Visit 1. Group 1 will consist of 90 evaluable subjects who have a
        change in diabetes management to improve glycemic control; this therapy can include oral
        agents, insulin, or noninsulin injectable anti-diabetic medications. Group 2 will consist
        of 40 evaluable subjects already on a stable diabetic management program, who have had no
        change in treatment in the last 3 months and for whom there is no plan to make a change
        during the study period.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects may be included in the study if they meet all the following criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 18 years of age and older

          2. Subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (enrolled in an approximate ratio of 1:1,
             respectively)

          3. Subjects with an HbA1c value within the range of 7.5% to 12% (or higher) for Group 1
             and &lt;7.5% for Group 2

             Note: The study investigator or primary physician must be planning to institute, or
             must be in the process of instituting, therapy to improve glycemic control for
             subjects in Group 1; this therapy can include oral agents, insulin, or non-insulin
             injectable anti-diabetic medications.

          4. Willingness to complete the protocol requirements, including the use of SMBG and
             attendance at all scheduled study visits; if selected for CGM monitoring, a
             willingness to follow the additional requirements and to use only the CGM device model
             provided for the study

          5. Satisfactory completion of home SMBG measurements during the screening period of the
             study prior to enrollment at Visit 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Any clinically significant disease, as determined by the investigator, that would
             interfere with study evaluations including but not limited to the following current or
             historical conditions/procedures (self-reported by the subject):

               1. End-stage renal disease

               2. Chronic kidney disease of Stage 3 or greater

               3. Liver cirrhosis

               4. Uncontrolled or untreated thyroid disease

               5. Any other acute or chronic conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  may significantly influence albumin or glucose metabolism (Note: routine iron
                  deficiencies and abnormal hemoglobin variants are not exclusions)

          2. History within the last 6 months of a blood transfusion

          3. Any other condition or factor that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             complicate or compromise the study or the well-being of the subject
