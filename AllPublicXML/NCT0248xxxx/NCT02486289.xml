        Inclusion criteria

          1. Male or female subjects, age between 18 and 65 years, inclusive.

          2. Urine-Hg ≥ 15 μg/L.

          3. Mercury intoxication medical score sum (Doering et al. 2014) ≥ 5 or medical score sum
             ≥ 3 in combination with at least two of the following symptoms; social
             nervousness/withdrawal, irritability, memory loss, metallic taste, mental- and
             physical fatigue.

          4. Has signed informed consent for participation.

          5. Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures, visit schedules, and other
             instructions regarding the study.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, may either put the subjects at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study.

          2. Known or a medical history of renal disorder, significant renal failure, or high risk
             of renal failure.

          3. Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry or haematology results
             at the time of screening as judged by the investigator.

          4. Known or suspected neurodegenerative disorder including but not limited to stroke,
             polio, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

          5. Known or suspected drug or alcohol abuse.

          6. Positive pregnancy test in women.

          7. Serious bacterial and chronic viral infection such as human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) or hepatitis virus.

          8. History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or on-going allergy/hypersensitivity, as
             judged by the investigator or history of hypersensitivity to drugs with a similar
             chemical structure or class to NBMI.

          9. History of allergy/hypersensitivity to bisulphites (e.g. red/white wine).

         10. Participation in any other clinical study that included drug treatment within three
             months of the first administration of investigational product.

         11. Use of other therapies for mercury intoxication including metal chelators within three
             months.

         12. Investigator considers subject unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions
             and requirements.
