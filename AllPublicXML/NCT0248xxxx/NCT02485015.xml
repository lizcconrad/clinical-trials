      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Apatinib combined with
      cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) vs Apatinib as the third line therapy for patients with
      advanced gastric cancer.

    <textblock>
      400 patients with stage Ⅳ Gastric Cancer,who had received surgery and chemotherapy,will be
      randomly divided into group A（receive Apatinib and CIK treatment ) or group B（just receive
      Apatinib),and the randomize ratio will be 1:1. Patients in group A will receive 3 cycles of
      CIK treatment (every 1 year) and Apatinib (continuous).Patients in group B will receive only
      Apatinib (continuous) .
