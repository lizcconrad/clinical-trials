      The objective of this Post Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF) is to collect data on the
      performance of the Ingenio 2 CRT-P devices and to document that device-related events, device
      malfunctions or device deficiencies (DDs) do not increase safety risks in Ingenio 2 CRT-P
      devices (CRT-Ps), both in general and specific to the new features and hardware of the
      devices.

      Prospective, non-randomized, multi-center, single group, post market clinical study The
      devices are fully commercially available and all subjects are planned to receive a CRT-P
      implant as part of their standard of care (SOC). The assignment of the specific Ingenio 2
      device is physician's choice and will consider leads currently in place from previous devices
      and planned new leads (e.g., Acuity X4 and/or other LV leads).

      Enrollment and Consenting Clinic Visit (≤ 30 days prior to implant procedure) (required)

        -  Implant Procedure (Day 0; all future follow ups based on this date) (required)

        -  Pre-Discharge Clinic Visit (after pocket closure and wound coverage 0-5 days
           post-implant procedure) (required)

        -  1 month post-implant Clinic Visit (30 ± 15 days) (required)

        -  3 month post-implant Clinic Visit (91 ± 21 days) (required)

        -  Latitude-based Close-out (91 - 120 days months post last enrollment) (reporting only
           required)

        -  Unscheduled clinic follow-up (any clinic visit between pre-discharge and 3 month follow
           up which is in addition to the 1 month follow up; per center SOC or subject needs; event
           reporting only)

        -  Re-implant/Revision (as needed)

        -  During the trial unanticipated serious adverse device effects (USADEs), serious adverse
           device effects (SADEs), adverse device effects (ADEs), DDs, all serious adverse events
           (SAEs), deaths, and changes in the device system must be reported (enrollment to
           Closeout).

      Study Duration Enrollment is expected to take 12 months. The study will be considered
      complete (primary endpoint completion) after all subjects have completed the Latitude based
      close-out 3-4 months after the last study enrollment. All study required visits will be
      completed as part of regularly scheduled clinic visits.

        Planned to be implanted or replaced with a VISIONIST Ingenio 2 CRT-P device

        The Ingenio 2 CRT-Ps are indicated for patients who have symptomatic congestive heart
        failure (CHF) including left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and wide QRS, and/or one or more
        of the following conditions:

        Symptomatic paroxysmal or permanent second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block
        Symptomatic bilateral bundle branch block Symptomatic paroxysmal or transient sinus node
        dysfunction with or without associated AV conduction disorders (i.e., sinus bradycardia,
        sinus arrest, sinoatrial [SA] block) Bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome, to prevent
        symptomatic bradycardia or some forms of symptomatic tachyarrhythmias Neurovascular
        (vaso-vagal) syndromes or hypersensitive carotid sinus syndromes.
