    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective randomized control clinical trial which is sponsored by the
      researchers. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of
      Gonadotropin-Releasing hormone agonist on ovarian function for premenopausal breast cancer
      patients during chemotherapy. The premenopausal breast cancer patients will be randomly (1:1)
      enrolled to receive standard chemotherapy with the GnRH agonist goserelin (goserelin group)
      or standard chemotherapy without goserelin (chemotherapy alone group). All patients are
      stratified according to age (&lt;35years vs.36-44years), hormone receptor status (HR+ or ER+
      vs.HR- and ER-), chemotherapy regimen(3-4 cycles vs.6-8 cycles, and cyclophosphamide-based
      vs.noncyclophosphamide).The follow-up time will be at least 2years. The ovarian failure,
      follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone, pregnancy outcomes and
      disease-free and overall survival will be compared between two groups to evaluate the
      effectiveness of protect against ovarian failure.
