      Purpose and rationale: To define the role of IL-17 as a mediator of structural bone lesions
      in psoriasis patients and patients with PsA. Primary Objective is the improvement of the
      PsAMRIS synovitis score baseline vs. week 24.

      Drug tested is Secukinumab 300 mg administered weekly for 4 weeks, then 4 weekly s.c. with a
      duration total of 24 weeks. Indication for this study is Psoriasis (Pso) and psoriatic
      arthritis (PsA).

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for inclusion in this study have to fulfill all of the following
             criteria:

               -  Subjects taking DMARDs (e.g. MTX) are allowed to continue their medication if the
                  dose is stable for at least 4 weeks before baseline and should remain on a stable
                  dose up to Week 24.

               -  Subjects who have previously been treated with TNFα inhibitors (investigational
                  or approved) will be allowed entry into study after appropriate wash-out period
                  prior to randomization

        PsA patients:

          -  Diagnosis of PsA classified by CASPAR criteria and with symptoms for at least 6 months

          -  Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies negative at screening

          -  Subjects with PsA should have taken NSAIDs for at least 4 weeks prior to randomization
             with inadequate control of symptoms or at least one dose if stopped due to intolerance
             to NSAIDs

          -  Subjects taking corticosteroids must be on a stable dose of ≤10 mg/day prednisone or
             equivalent for at least 2 weeks before baseline and should remain on a stable dose up
             to Week 24

        Psoriasis patients:

          -  no diagnosis of PsA

          -  inflammatory and/or structural lesions and/or erosions in the MRI/HR-qCT scan

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  • Chest X-ray or chest MRI with evidence of ongoing infectious or malignant process,
             obtained within 3 months prior to screening and evaluated by a qualified physician

               -  Subjects taking high potency opioid analgesics (e.g. methadone, hydromorphone,
                  morphine)

               -  Previous exposure to secukinumab or other biologic drug directly targeting IL-17
                  or IL-17 receptor

               -  Ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments / medications (e.g., topical
                  corticosteroids, UV therapy) at baseline. The following wash out periods need to
                  be observed:

                    -  Oral or topical retinoids 4 weeks

                    -  Photochemotherapy (e.g. PUVA) 4 weeks

                  targeting TNFα or IL-23p40, investigational or approved

               -  Previous treatment with any cell-depleting therapies including but not limited to
                  anti-CD20, investigational agents (e.g., CAMPATH, anti-CD4, anti-CD5, anti-CD3,
                  anti-CD19)

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
                  becoming pregnant, unwilling to use effective contraception during the study and
                  for a minimum of 20 weeks after stopping treatment. Effective contraception is
                  defined as either:

                    -  Barrier method: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps)
                       with spermicide (where available). Spermicides alone are not a barrier
                       method of contraception and should not be used alone

        The following methods are considered more effective than the barrier method and are also
        acceptable:

          -  Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject [Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
             methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception]

          -  Female sterilization: have had a surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment. In
             case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been
             confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

          -  Use of established oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception,
             intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). In case of use of oral
             contraception women should have been stabile on the same pill for a minimum of 12
             weeks before taking study treatment.

               -  Active ongoing inflammatory diseases other than PsA that might confound the
                  evaluation of the benefit of secukinumab therapy

               -  Underlying metabolic, hematologic, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, neurologic,
                  endocrine, cardiac, infectious or gastrointestinal conditions which in the
                  opinion of the investigator immunocompromises the subject and/or places the
                  subject at unacceptable risk for participation in an immunomodulatory therapy

               -  History of clinically significant liver disease or liver injury as indicated by
                  abnormal liver function tests such as SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), alkaline
                  phosphatase, or serum bilirubin. The investigator should be guided by the
                  following criteria:

          -  Any single parameter may not exceed 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN). A single
             parameter elevated up to and including 2 x ULN should be re-checked once more as soon
             as possible, and in all cases, at least prior to enrollment/randomization, to rule out
             lab error

          -  If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 2 x ULN, total bilirubin
             should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. In any case,
             serum bilirubin should not exceed the value of 1.6 mg/dL (27 µmol/L)

               -  Screening total WBC count &lt;3,000/µL, or platelets &lt;100,000/µL or neutrophils
                  &lt;1,500/µL or hemoglobin &lt;8.5 g/dL (85g/L)

               -  Active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception: common cold)
                  prior to randomization

               -  History of ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease or evidence of
                  tuberculosis infection as defined by either a positive PPD skin test (the size of
                  induration will be measured after 48-72 hours, and a positive result is defined
                  as an induration of ≥ 5mm or according to local practice/guidelines) or a
                  positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test as indicated in the assessment schedule Table
                  1: Assessment Schedule (Screening to week 24) . Subjects with a positive test may
                  participate in the study if further work up (according to local
                  practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the subject has no evidence of
                  active tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established then
                  treatment according to local country guidelines must have been initiated.

               -  Known infection with HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C at screening or
                  randomization

               -  History of lymphoproliferative disease or any known malignancy or history of
                  malignancy of any organ system within the past 5 years (except for basal cell
                  carcinoma or actinic keratoses that have been treated with no evidence of
                  recurrence in the past 3 months, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or non-invasive
                  malignant colon polyps that have been removed)

               -  History or evidence of ongoing alcohol or drug abuse, within the last six months
                  before randomization

               -  Plans for administration of live vaccines during the study period or within 6
                  weeks preceding randomization.
