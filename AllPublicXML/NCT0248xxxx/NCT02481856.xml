    <textblock>
      The trial is a phase II, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      multi-site trial conducted in Canada. Before the start of treatment, the subjects will
      undergo baseline birch and oak Environmental Exposure Chamber sessions. The treatment
      duration is 24 weeks. The subjects will undergo birch Environmental Exposure Chamber sessions
      after 8, 16 and 24 weeks of treatment and an oak Environmental Exposure Chamber session after
      24 weeks of treatment.
