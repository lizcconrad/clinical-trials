  <brief_summary>

      This is a 3-part study comparing CHS-1420 to Humira in patients with chronic plaque
      psoriasis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a 55-week, randomized, double-blind, active-control, parallel group, multicenter,
      global study in subjects with active, moderate to severe, chronic PsO.

      The study will consist of 24 weeks of administration of blinded study drug, divided into
      Treatment Period 1 and Treatment Period 2, then 23 weeks of administration of open-label
      CHS-1420 and a Follow-up visit 8 weeks after the last dose. Subjects who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be stratified by body mass index (BMI), and age and
      randomized 1:1 to receive CHS-1420 or Humira in Treatment Period 1. Subjects assigned to
      CHS-1420 will continue to receive CHS-1420 in Period 2. Subjects assigned to Humira in Period
      1 will be randomly assigned (1:1) to either continue with Humira in Treatment Period 2 or to
      switch to CHS-1420 in Treatment Period 2. All subjects will receive open label CHS-1420 in
      Treatment Period 3.
