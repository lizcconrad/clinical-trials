  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation mediated by macrophage infiltration plays a vital role in a diverse range of
      physiological conditions. In particular, recent evidence suggests this type of macrophage
      response is important for the disease pathology of pulmonary fibrosis. Because cysteine
      cathepsins are proteases that are highly expressed in antigen presenting cells such as
      macrophages, they serve as promising biomarkers. Employing non-invasive imaging agents
      68Ga-BMV101 that specifically recognize cysteine proteases in immune cells has the potential
      to not only aid early detection but also significantly aid efforts to monitor progression and
      patient response to therapy.

    <textblock>
      For interests in clinical translation of 68Ga-BMV101, an open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT
      study was designed to investigate safety and diagnostic performance of 68Ga-BMV101 in
      patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). A single dose of nearly 111 MBq
      68Ga-BMV101 will be intravenously injected into healthy volunteers and patients with
      suspected IPF. Visual and semiquantitative method will be used to assess the PET/CT images.
      Changes of blood pressure, pulse, respiration, temperature, routine blood and urine tests,
      serum alanine aminotransferase, albumin, and creatinine, and any adverse events will be
      collected from the volunteers. Adverse events will also be observed in the patients.
