      This open-label, one-center, noncomparative, two-stage phase 1B trial assessed the tyrosine
      kinase inhibitor donafenib tosilate tablets (400 mg/d,200mg bid) in patients with advanced,
      inoperable gastric cancer progressing after chemotherapy . The primary endpoint is the
      safety.The secondary endpoints are tumor response and progression-free survival time.
