      The study objective is to examine the recanalization efficacy of the EmboTrap device and its
      associated performance characteristics and to record associated clinical outcomes in a manner
      that facilitates relevant comparison of outputs with that of devices approved in the U.S. for
      clearing Large Vessel Occlusions.

             Informed Consent Form.

          2. Aged between 18 years and 85 years (inclusive).

          3. A new focal disabling neurologic deficit consistent with acute cerebral ischemia.

          4. NIHSS score ≥8 and ≤25.

          5. Pre-ictal mRS score of 0 or 1.

          6. The interventionalist estimates that at least one deployment of the EmboTrap device
             can be completed within 8 hours from the onset of symptoms.

          7. Patients for whom IV-tPA is indicated and who are available for treatment, are treated
             with IV-tPA.

          8. IV-tPA, if used, was initiated within 3 hrs of stroke onset (onset time is defined as
             the last time when the patient was witnessed to be at baseline), with investigator
             verification that the subject has received/is receiving the correct IV t-PA dose for
             the estimated weight.

          9. Angiographic confirmation of an occlusion of an ICA (including T or L occlusions), M1
             or M2 MCA, VA, or BA with mTICI flow of 0 - 1.

         10. For strokes in the anterior circulation the following imaging criteria should also be
             met:

               1. MRI criterion: volume of diffusion restriction visually assessed ≤50 mL. OR

               2. CT criterion: ASPECTS 6 to 10 on baseline CT or CTA-source images, or, volume of
                  significantly lowered CBV ≤50 mL.

         11. The patient is indicated for neurothrombectomy treatment by the interventionalist and

             DBP&gt;120mmHg). All patients, in whom intravenous therapy with blood pressure
