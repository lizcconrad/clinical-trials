  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study of BBI503 administered in combination
      with selected anti-cancer therapeutics in adult patients with advanced cancer. The goal of
      the study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and RP2D of BBI503 in combination with
      each of the selected anti-cancer agents.

          3. Any known, untreated, brain metastases. Patients with treated brain metastases must
             have no clinical symptoms from the metastases, and must be either off steroids or on a
             stable dose of steroids ≤ 10 mg prednisone or equivalent for at least 2 weeks prior to

             take oral medications).

          6. Unable or unwilling to swallow either BBI503 daily or an oral selected anti-cancer
             therapeutics; or, unwilling to receive intravenous injection of IV anti-cancer

             weeks, c) Has a transplanted organ, d) Has interstitial lung disease or active,
             non-infectious pneumonitis, e) Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to
