  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, cross-over design, pharmacokinetic study, to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of ALZT-OP1 (a combination drug therapy) designated as ALZT-OP1a and
      ALZT-OP1b, in both plasma and CSF, following co-administration of the active compounds, in
      healthy volunteers, aged 55-75, and in good general health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-labeled, cross-over design, pharmacokinetic study, where 24 subjects will be
      randomly assigned to receive treatment regimen A-B or B-A on two consecutive days of dosing.

      Two dosing groups are planned for the study :

        -  Group 1 (n=12)

        -  Group 2 (n=12)

      Each group will be admitted to the Phase I Unit the evening before dosing and will initiate
      dosing the next morning for 2-days of consecutive treatment (A-B, or B-A). Both groups will
      undergo identical study related procedures, except those subjects that consent to CSF
      collection on Day 1 of dosing.

      Dose regimen A consists of a single inhaled oral dose of ALZT-OP1a via dry powder inhaler + a
      single oral tablet dose of ALZT-OP1b.

      Dose regimen B consists of two oral inhaled doses of ALZT-OP1a, not more than 2 minutes
      apart, via dry powder inhaler + two oral tablet doses of ALZT-OP1b.

      Plasma Collection, All Subjects (n=24) 1 mL blood samples will be collected at T: 0, 5, 10,
      15, 30, 1 hr, 2 hr, 4 hr, and 6 hours, following ALZT-OP1 administration (Days 1 and 2).

      CSF Collection, Sub-group (n=12) A sub-group of 12 subjects will be consented for CSF
      collection.

      1 mL of CSF will be collected at T: 0, 5 min, 30 min, 2 hr, and 4 hours, following ALZT-OP1
      administration (Day 1 only).
