    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the amount of abemaciclib that reaches the blood
      stream and how long the body takes to get rid of it when given with and without food. In
      addition, the safety and tolerability of the study drug will be evaluated. Information about
      any side effects that may occur will also be collected. The study will last about 43 days for
      each participant, not including screening.
