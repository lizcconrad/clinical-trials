  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effect of a brief computer task
      (Approach Avoidance Task) on smoking cessation. The investigators will use a novel training
      protocol that works to target automatic thoughts and tendencies that occur outside of
      conscious control. Previous research suggests that these automatic tendencies may have a
      direct effect on certain health behaviors- like continuing to smoke despite having previous
      quit attempts.

      The investigators hypothesize that individuals in the AAT training condition will evidence a
      greater decrease in reaction times to avoid smoking-related stimuli &amp; approach positive
      stimuli relative to those in the control condition. The investigators also expect that
      individuals in the AAT condition will exhibit superior outcomes on several quit-related
      variables as evidenced by an increase in motivation to quit smoking, an increase in number of
      days abstinent following a self-guided quit attempt, an increase in self-efficacy, and a
      decrease in urge to smoke compared to those in the SHAM training condition.

    <description>The time between the start of the trial and the picture disappearing from the screen will be recorded. The investigators will look at the change in response times for each individual. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a greater decrease in reaction time for those in the AAT training group.</description>

    <description>Individuals in this condition will receive four sessions of AAT training in which they are instructed to approach (pull the joystick) images tilted to the right and avoid (push the joystick) images tilted to the left. They will be told that the training may weaken automatic cigarette-approach and strengthen automatic cigarette-avoidance. Furthermore, they will be told that the opposite effect will be true for the stimuli not related to cigarettes (i.e., the positive stimuli).</description>

    <description>Individuals in this condition will receive four sessions of SHAM training in which they are instructed to approach (pull the joystick) images tilted to the right and avoid (push the joystick) images tilted to the left. They will be told that the purpose of the training is to improve control over these automatic tendencies and that following the training sessions, they will easily be able to push or pull the stimuli regardless of content.</description>

    <description>The Approach Avoidance Task (AAT) used for this experiment is an implicit, computerized paradigm in which participants respond to visually presented pictures on a computer screen displaying either 1) smoking-related images or 2) positive images, by pulling a joystick either towards their body (approach movement) or pushing it away from their body (avoidance movement). By pulling the joystick towards their body, the picture grows in size; by pushing the joystick away, the picture shrinks and then disappears from the screen. Participants are instructed to pull upon seeing an image tilted to the right and to push upon seeing a left-tilt image, while ignoring the image content and responding as quickly and as accurately as possible.</description>
