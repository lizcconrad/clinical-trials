  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since there is an evidence that Manuka honey is an antibacterial agent, the present study
      aims to confirm this characteristic and assess its effect in improving healing and reducing
      postsurgical symptoms, if topically applied after the surgical removal of impacted mandibular
      third molars
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sufficient evidence exists recommending the use of honey in the management of acute wounds
      and burns. Studies revealed that the healing effect of honey could be classified by its
      antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of its components.
      Manuka honey has been shown to inhibit a wide range of microorganisms, including
      multiresistant strains. This unique honey is derived from flowers of manuka tree
      (Leptospermum scoparium) in New Zealand. Dihydroxyacetone and methylglyoxal are unique and
      naturally occurring constituents of manuka honey that correlate with its antibacterial
      activity.

      Since surgical extraction of impacted molars is one of the most common operations in the oral
      cavity and the postoperative symptoms disturbing the patient may reduce the quality of health
      service, this study aims to assess the healing potential of Manuka honey in reducing these
      symptoms by comparing the outcome of extraction of impacted lower molars with and without
      topical application of Manuka honey into the extraction socket.

    <measure>Levels of postoperative discomfort</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after the surgical removal of third molars</time_frame>
    <description>Postoperative Symptom Severity (PoSSe) Scale will be used for this variable. The patient will be asked to fill in a questionnaire on the 7th day following surgery. This questionnaire is used to assess postoperative discomfort in patients who have third molars extracted. PoSSe Scale consists of 7 sub-scales that investigate the patient's ability to enjoy food; speak properly; perceive altered sensations, appearance, pain, and sickness; and interference with daily activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of facial contours due to swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken before surgery, on the 3rd and on the 7th days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>In order to assess facial swelling, the distances between the labial commissure and the tragus, and between the lateral canthus and the gonion will be measured.
The change between 3 days and before surgery will give an idea about the amount of swelling that occurred following surgery.
Between 3 days and 7 days will give an idea about the change that occurred in this period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of the masticatory muscles status</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be taken before surgery, on the 3rd and on the 7th days after surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>Mouth opening range will be assessed by measuring the distance between the upper and lower incisors using a vernier caliper when the patient is asked to open his/her mouth as much as possible.
The presence of limited opening of the mouth is an indication of trismus.</description>

    <measure>The presence or absence of alveolar osteitis</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be assessed on the 3rd and 7th day following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of a dry socket condition will be checked out at two time points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time required to hemostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be recorded by the patient in the immediate postsurgical phase (i.e. between 10 minutes up to 72 hours following surgery)</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bone density and quality</measure>
    <time_frame>at six months following surgery</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed using Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Hounsfield Units will be used to quantify bone density and quality.</description>
