  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is little recent data on regional variations in treatment methods, neonatal
      units that provide retinopathy (ROP) treatment, facilities for treatment available at each
      unit including anaesthetic support for such preterm babies, facilities to transfer babies to
      units that offer treatment etc. While some parts of the UK have established neonatal networks
      and agreements among units for ROP treatment, in other parts, such arrangements are
      illdefined.

      The number of babies needing ROP treatment may be higher since the introduction of revised
      guidelines in 2008 as earlier treatment has been shown to be beneficial. Collecting
      epidemiological data through the British Ophthalmic Surveillance Unit (BOSU) on the incidence
      of treatable ROP, the treatment methods used and facilities for treatment will provide the
      foundation for effective planning of resources and manpower to deal with the additional
      demand.
