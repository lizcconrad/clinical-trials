  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sulfonylurea are known to be associated with a risk of hypoglycaemia. However, little is
      known about the real frequency of asymptomatic or unreported hypoglycemia and their impact on
      glycemic control and quality of life among patients using sulfonylureas (SUs). The frequency
      of hypoglycemia is probably underestimated since self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) fail
      to identify asymptomatic episodes, especially among patients with higher risk of hypoglycemia
      unawareness (longer diabetes duration, elderly, recurrent hypoglycemia, etc.). No previous
      studies have reported total hypoglycemia as measured by continuous glucose monitoring system
      (CGMS) in a large group of Canadians, therefore underestimating the true incidence of these
      events. As with age hypoglycemia perception is reduced and consequences can be increased due
      to frailty, elderly could be especially sensitive to the risk of hypoglycemia. Documentation
      of the total number of hypoglycemia is a relevant objective to really appreciate the
      potential impact of SUs in the Canadian context.

      The investigators propose a multicenter observational prospective study in order to study the
      incidence of hypoglycaemia measured by CGMS among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (T2DM) newly prescribed a SU. The investigators propose to perform a baseline testing
      (pre-initiation of the SU), at initiation (first week after the first dose of the SU) and
      after a 3 months follow-up of treatment, including medical history measures, quality of life
      and diabetes treatment satisfaction.

      In patients with T2DM not at goal (A1c &gt;7.0 mmol/L), and newly prescribed a SU, the
      objectives and hypotheses of the study are to estimate the incidence rate of hypoglycaemia as
      measured by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) over a total of 3 weeks period
      following the initiation of the SU.
