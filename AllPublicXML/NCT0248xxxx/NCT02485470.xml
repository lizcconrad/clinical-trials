  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to test, in a randomized controlled trial among head and neck
      cancer patients, the short and longer term effects of the MPACT (Maintaining Physical
      Activity during Cancer Treatment) program (infused with motivational interviewing and
      self-determination theory-based strategies) initiated at the time of concurrent chemotherapy
      with radiation (CCRT), on key outcomes such as functional mobility and quality of life, and
      ultimately physical activity. The central hypotheses is that in head and neck cancer patients
      undergoing CCRT, the MPACT program, as compared to usual care controls, will result in less
      acute decline, faster recovery, and better maintenance of these key outcomes.

    <description>A 7-week (7 weeks x 3 sessions per week), on site, functional resistance training (FRT) as well as a walking program concurrent with CCRT will be followed by a 7-week post-CCRT home program. The protocol follows American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) prescription guidelines for cancer patients.</description>
