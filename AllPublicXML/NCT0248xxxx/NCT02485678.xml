      Comparison of the number of ER plus hospital visits that occurred during chemotherapy between
      the telephone intervention and control arms.

    <textblock>
      Using a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial design, 20 Ontario cancer centres that provide
      care to patients with breast cancer will be randomly allocated to one of two arms: pro-active
      telephone toxicity management (intervention), or control (routine care). All patients with
      early stage (I-III) breast cancer who commence adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy at
      participating institutions during the 6 to 12-month intervention period (will vary between
      centres depending on the number of incident cases) will be evaluated using Ontario healthcare
      administrative data. A sub-set of at least 25 patients at each participating institution will
      participate in a PRO sub-study involving the completion of standardized questionnaires to
      measure: a) severity of chemotherapy treatment toxicities; b) self-care for management of
      chemotherapy toxicities; c) self-efficacy (confidence) for managing symptoms; d) quality of
      life; and e) coordination of care. Patients participating in the PRO sub-study will be asked
      to provide consent to link their PRO data to Ontario healthcare administrative data so that
      correlations between the symptom self-assessments and Quality of Life (QoL) measures can be
      made with the administrative data on ED+H visits and use of supportive care medications. the
      investigators will compare the use of supportive care medications (i.e. anti-emetics, growth
      factors) by patients in the intervention and control arms to assess their influence on
      severity of chemotherapy-related toxicities as part of an exploratory sub-group analysis in
      patients &gt;65 years of age as administrative data on supportive care medication use is only
      available for this age group.

    <description>Centres randomized to this arm will implement a pro-active telephone toxicity management program, for all eligible early stage breast cancer patients beginning neo-adjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy within the intervention period until the end of their systemic treatment. Patients will receive a phone call from a local nurse who has been trained on the toxicity management toolkit at 24-72 hours and at 8 to 10 days following each chemotherapy administration. The provider conducting the call will be provided with a script and will complete the Telephone Follow-Up Questionnaire which includes questions from the abbreviated NCI PRO-CTCAE tool. The nurse conducting the call will also be provided with the provider version of the symptom management booklet and provide toxicity management counseling. If any toxicity-related problems are identified during the call, a second call will take place 24 hours after the initial call to ensure the problem is resolving or to provide additional support.</description>
