    <textblock>
      LIPO-202-CL-23 is a follow-on study to evaluate the post-treatment safety and duration of
      clinical effect of LIPO-202 in subjects that completed either the LIPO-202-CL-18 or
      LIPO-202-CL-19 (parent studies). No risks related to treatment are anticipated as subjects
      will not receive additional treatment with LIPO-202 or Placebo for LIPO-202 in this follow-on
      study.
