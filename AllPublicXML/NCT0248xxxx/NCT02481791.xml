      What is the optimal maintenance dose of remifentanil to ensure apnoea, during breath hold
      episodes in children having cardiac MR imaging with general anaesthesia?

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The management of congenital heart disease depends upon accurate imaging of the heart to
      define anatomical abnormalities. The use of magnetic resonance imaging has grown in response
      to this need. Young children, however, are unable to cooperate sufficiently to allow the scan
      to occur; this necessitates the use of general anaesthesia.

      The optimal anaesthetic management of children in this situation is complex. Imaging of an
      acceptable quality depends on a low (normal) heart rate which is relatively constant during
      the scan and frequent breath holds to avoid respiratory artefacts. Children undergoing such
      scans commonly have significant cardiac and non-cardiac disease. A technique, currently used
      at Alder Hey Hospital, is to use intravenous agents to provide anaesthesia: commonly a
      mixture of the intravenous anaesthetic propofol and the potent opiate remifentanil. The
      patient's own ventilation is suppressed by the use of remifentanil which also reduces heart
      rate and heart rate variability. Controlled ventilation is provided via a ventilator and
      endotracheal tube. Adequate doses of remifentanil are required to ensure suppression of the
      patient's ventilation whilst excess doses are avoided to reduce the risk of adverse effects
      (primarily arterial hypotension) and ensure rapid recovery.

      Remifentanil dose has been studied during surgery(3-6), however this is a unique indication
      and optimal dosage has not been formally studied. In particular the absence of any
      stimulation from surgery is likely to mean that substantially lower doses of remifentanil
      will be required.

    <description>Induction Phase: A dose of remifentanil 1mcg/kg by slow bolus, will be given to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Further doses of either remifentanil (0.5 mcg/kg) or propofol (1-2mg/kg) may be given to ensure an anaesthetised patient.
Settling Period: An infusion of the test dose of remifentanil will be commenced from an infusion prepared prior to the patient being anaesthetised. 1mg of Remifentanil (one vial) will be diluted to a volume of 50mls in normal saline 0.9% in a 50ml syringe. Maintenance dose of propofol 130 mcg/Kg/min for the first 5 minutes reduced to 100 mcg/kg/min thereafter. 40mls of propofol 1% (10mg/ml) will be drawn undiluted into a 50ml syringe. During the settling period further doses of either remifentanil (0.5 mcg/kg) or propofol (1-2mg/kg) may be given.
Equilibrium Period: During this period propofol will be infused at a constant rate of 100mcg/kg/min.</description>
