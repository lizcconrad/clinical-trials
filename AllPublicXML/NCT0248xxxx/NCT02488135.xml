  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nosebleeds that persist even after adequate traditional nasal packing may require aggressive
      treatment strategies to stop bleeding. Currently these strategies include a surgical approach
      to cut off blood supply to the vessel that is bleeding. FloSeal Hemostatic matrix is a gel
      like medical therapy that is inserted into the nose and is engineered to stop bleeding in
      severe cases, possibly avoiding the need for surgery. In this study the investigators will
      randomize patients to either receive FloSeal Hemostatix matrix or traditional nasal packing
      as a treatment for severe nosebleeds. The main outcome will be whether the investigators are
      able to stop bleeding with FloSeal or traditional packing alone and whether additional
      measures are necessary to stop the bleeding. The investigators will also perform a patient
      comfort survey and cost analysis. Even if FloSeal has equal effectiveness in treating
      nosebleeds as traditional packing, if it is much more comfortable for patients then it may be
      the favourable treatment.

    <description>Patients will receive traditional nasal packing to try and abort bleeding. This includes either vaseline gauze or nasal merocels being inserted into the anterior nasal cavity using forceps. These expand upon contact with blood or liquid therefore creating a compression type hemostasis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients age 18+ presenting with epistaxis that requires an ENT consult that had a
             first attempt at treatment by an emergency physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be excluded based on the presence of a hypo-coagulable state. Including
             patients actively taking anti-coagulant medications or other patients with either
             acquired or hereditary bleeding disorders.
