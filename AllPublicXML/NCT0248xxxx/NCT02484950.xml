  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair with and without augmentation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).
      Mesenchymal stem cells promote tissue regeneration by differentiating into adult cell lines
      and by supplying growth factors to their implanted environment. They have been shown to be
      effective in improving both overall healing and tendon integrity in rotator cuff repair. This
      study will follow 100 patients in the United States and track their clinical outcomes for at
      least one year post-operatively.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff repair is one of the most commonly performed arthroscopic procedures in the
      United States, but re-tear remains a common long-term complication. This can lead to pain,
      decreased shoulder function, and the need for corrective surgery. Mesenchymal stem cells have
      been shown to improve healing rates in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair, primarily due to
      their retained ability to differentiate into several different adult cell lines, such as
      tenocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. MSCs further enhance the healing process by
      releasing growth factors into the local environment to promote tissue regeneration.

      While MSC augmentation of arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has led to higher rates of healing
      and improved tendon integrity, there remains a paucity of data surrounding clinical
      improvement after the procedure. Outcomes such as post-operative strength, range of motion,
      and shoulder function have yet to be compared with standard rotator cuff repair. The
      incidence of post-operative persistent structural defects in the tendon after MSC
      augmentation must also be further elucidated.

    <description>Using clinically accepted methods, subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration (from hip, proximal humerus or tibia) through a small incision prior to arthroscopy in the group undergoing MSC augmentation. They will then undergo arthroscopic full thickness rotator cuff repair using a double row, TOE anchor/suture technique with mesenchymal stem cell augmentation.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo arthroscopic full thickness rotator cuff repair using a double row, TOE anchor/suture technique, without augmentation of mesenchymal stem cells. To maintain patient blinding, all patients will receive a small incision around the site of expected bone marrow aspiration (hip, proximal humerus, or tibia), regardless of whether or not they receive bone marrow.</description>

Acromioplasty will be performed in all patients. Alternate procedures such as biceps tenotomy/tenodesis and distal clavicle excision will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon and recorded.</description>
