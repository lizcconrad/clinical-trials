    <textblock>
      Standard treatment for AL Amyloidosis is high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

      This study will compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment with high-dose
      melphalan and stem cell transplant, compared with investigational bortezomib when used in
      combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant for AL
      amyloidosis.

      This study seeks to enroll patients with AL amyloidosis who have been recommended for
      standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

      Standard treatment for this disease is high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment
      with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant, compared with investigational bortezomib
      when used in combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell
      transplant for AL amyloidosis.

      Patients enrolled in this study will receive either standard treatment with high-dose
      melphalan and stem cell transplant, or investigational bortezomib used in combination with
      standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological diagnosis of primary systemic (AL) amyloidosis based on:

               -  Deposition of amyloid material by Congo red stain showing characteristic apple
                  green birefringence,AND…

               -  evidence of a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with monoclonal protein in the serum
                  or urine by immunofixation electrophoresis studies AND/OR abnormal serum free
                  light chain assay AND/OR clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow exam demonstrated

                  senile, secondary, localized, dialysis-related or familial amyloidosis are not
                  eligible. Confirmation of tissue diagnosis at all sites of organ dysfunction is
                  encouraged, but not required.

          4. Patients must have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt; 45% by echocardiogram
             within 60 days of enrollment

          5. Pulmonary Function Tests must show diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide

          2. Prior chemotherapy with alkylating agent allowed only if no evidence of
             Myelodysplastic Dysplastic Syndrome (MDS) morphologically or cytogenetically. Total
             cumulative dose of oral melphalan must be &lt; 300 mg. Patients should not have received
             any cytotoxic therapy &lt; 4 weeks prior to registration and should have fully recovered
             from the effects of such therapy.

          3. Patients must not have overt multiple myeloma (&gt;30% bone marrow plasmacytosis and,
             extensive (&gt;2) lytic lesions and hypercalcemia).

          4. No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years.

          5. Patients must not be HIV positive.

          6. Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women and men of reproductive potential
