  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the double-blind, cross-over part of the study, ODM-109 capsules and placebo capsules for
      ODM-109 will be administered for 2 weeks separated by a 19-23 days wash-out period. During
      each treatment period of the double-blind cross-over part, there will be a baseline visit
      (day 1) and 2 visits (5 ± 2 and 14 ± 2 days) after the start of study treatment. After
      completing the 3rd treatment period, the subjects will continue in the open-label follow-up
      part for 6 months. During the open-label follow-up, visits will be at 1, 3 and 6 months. An
      end-of-study visit will take place 14-25 days after the last study treatment administration
      for each subject. The study duration will be about 13-14 weeks for the double-blind
      cross-over part, and about 9-10 months for the entire study including the 6 months open-label
      follow-up.

      The number of randomised study subjects is planned to be approximately 54 in cross-over
      comparison. The maximum number of subjects will not exceed 70.

      Primary objective is to investigate the efficacy of oral ODM-109 on respiratory function in
      patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

             muscle weakness).

          -  Age of at least 18 years.

          -  Male or female subjects with diagnosis of laboratory supported probable, probable or
             definite ALS according to El Escorial revised criteria (Brooks BR et al., 2000). Full
