  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective single center study is to investigate if a developed
      algorithm is more accurate than the pediatric emergency tape (Alpha 1 Werbedesign e.K.,
      Falkenberg, Germany). For this study 500 patients are required to collect anonymized data
      (length, weight, age, anaesthesia material used during anaesthesia) for achieving a power of
      80% during statistical analysis. The main hypothesis ist that the algorithm has a better
      accuracy than the pediatric emergency tape (53% are in a +/- 10% interval).

      This prospective single center study is performed at the university children's hospital
      zurich. Patients planned for surgery in general anaesthesia with intubation, aged 0 to 16
      years and with a body length suitable for the emergency tapes can be included in this study.
      Patient and parental information is performed during the pre-anaesthetic visit. After written
      consent the patient will be included. Patient´s length and weight will be measures earliest
      one day before data collection. Data collection during anaesthesia has no influence on the
      daily anaesthesia routine and has no impact on patient safety and anaesthesia. Patient's data
      is made anonymous for further inspection.

      Data is documented in Microsoft Excel and statistical analysis calculated with SPSS. 500
      patients are needed for a power of 80%. Primary outcome parameter is length-based weight
      estimation, secondary outcome parameters are length-based age estimation and the correctness
      of recommended anaesthesia material (endotracheal tube, laryngeal mask, oropharyngeal mask
      and face mask). Both tools (algorithm and pediatric emergency tape) will be compared with
      eachother regarding primary and secondary outcome parameters.
