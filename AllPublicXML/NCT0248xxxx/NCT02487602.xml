  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the gastrointestinal behaviour of a novel weight loss
      device in vivo to further understand the device's mechanism of action in aiding weight loss.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gelesis100 is a new, experimental medical device which has been developed by Gelesis, Inc. to
      aid weight loss in overweight/obese patients by reducing the amount of food required to make
      them feel full. The device is contained in a capsule which is swallowed with water before a
      meal. Once swallowed, the capsule dissolves and the capsule contents hydrate and mix with the
      food in the stomach, creating a feeling of fullness.

      Four different treatments of up to 5 capsules each will be given to participants during this
      study. These will be a mixture of the Gelesis100 capsules and capsules which do not contain
      the device i.e., they are placebo (will contain sucrose [sugar])

      The study is designed to look at:

        -  The time it takes for the stomach to empty once receiving each treatment

        -  The time it takes for food and Gelesis100 to travel through the intestine

        -  The effects of Gelesis100 on the feeling of satiety (how full participants feel)

      In order to monitor gastrointestinal behavior, either a small amount of radioactive material
      will be added to a component of a standard lunch or to the water given with the treatment.
      The radiation emitted will then be detected as it travels through the GI tract by taking
      images using a device known as a gamma camera. The procedure is relatively easy and non-
      invasive.

               2. Subject has taken over-the-counter (OTC) medication within 48 hr prior to the
                  assessment visits. This includes the use of vitamins and natural or herbal
