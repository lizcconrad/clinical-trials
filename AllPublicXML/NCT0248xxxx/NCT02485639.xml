  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective investigate the longevity of humoral immunity to influenza virus in
      humans. Our overarching hypothesis is that an understanding of how long-term humoral immunity
      to influenza virus is generated and maintained is essential for the development of a
      &quot;universal&quot; vaccine against influenza virus. The secondary objective is the longitudinal
      tracking of vaccine-induced B cells responses with special emphasis on broadly neutralizing
      HA stem reactive responses.

      This is a Phase IV open label and single arm study enrolling up to 55 healthy males and
      non-pregnant females in a single site, 18-49 years old, inclusive. The primary objective of
      this study is designed to assess the humoral response to influenza vaccination and the
      longevity of humoral immunity to influenza vaccination in healthy adults. Secondary
      objectives include longitudinal tracking of vaccine-induced B cell responses with special
      emphasis on broadly neutralizing HA stem-reactive responses. The laboratory technique will
      characterize persistence and clonotype of antigen specific B-cells and plasmablasts in blood
      and bone marrow. Enrolled subjects will receive licensed seasonal inactivated influenza
      vaccine (administered as a part of the study). The vaccine will be administered according to
      the package insert, and study participants will donate serial samples of blood and bone
      marrow aspirate for immunology monitoring. Safety will be assessed from the time of study
      enrollment through the last study visit, via monitoring of vital signs, change in health
      status, and targeted physical exam with safety labs prior to each bone marrow aspirate
      procedure. Repeated measurements of humoral immunity will be obtained at 7 days, 14 days, 28
      days, 90 days and at one year post vaccination to assess the magnitude, clonal diversity and
      persistence of B-cell responses to influenza vaccination. The study duration is 4 years and
      subjects will be offered the opportunity to participate in the study for up to 3 consecutive
      years provided eligibility criteria is met each year. Subjects who elect to continue in the
      study after first year of participation will be rescreened to verify continued eligibility
      and re-consented prior to subsequent participation. Re-enrolling subjects will receive new
      subject identifiers and will count towards the total enrollment number for subsequent years
      of participation. A separate subject record will be maintained each year a subject re-enrolls
      in the study. Enrollment for the next year will begin with the availability of the seasonal
      flu vaccine. For subjects who elect to re-enroll in the study, the Day 365 visit (+/- 3 month
      window) would also be the Day 0 visit for the subsequent year.
