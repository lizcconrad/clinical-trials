      The combination of optimal cytoreductive operation (according to Desktop II criteria), HIPEC
      with Carboplatin 800 mg/m² KOF (Körperoberfläche) and following platinum-based systemic
      chemotherapy should be executed In patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence of ovarian
      carcinoma. Condition for HIPEC is attainment of optimal cytoreduction (R0) and experts
      judgement of a complication-free prolongation of narcosis after finishing the surgery. HIPEC
      will be administered additionally to standard therapy. If HIPEC was executed the number of
      systemic given platinum-based chemotherapy decreases for one cycle.

      This regime should be investigated in terms of safety of performance, quality of life for the
      patients and consequences for the following systemic chemotherapy.

      In occurence with a platinum-sensitive recurrence of EOC survival can be prolonged by a
      recurrence-operation, if macroscopical tumor-free status (optimal cytoreductive operation)
      can be reached in combination with a platinum-based standard-chemotherapy.

      Several studies showed that the combination of optimal cytoreductive operation and HIPEC is a
      secure method of treatment. In comparison to operation and standard-chemotherapy it has a
      significant positive influence on survival rates. A hyperthermal intraperitoneal chemotherapy
      with Carboplatin is possible without severe side-effects.

      The combination of optimal cytoreductive operation (according to Desktop II criteria), HIPEC
      with Carboplatin and following platinum-based systemic chemotherapy should be carried out in
      patients with platinum-sensitive recurrence.

      Condition for applying HIPEC is reaching optimal cytoreduction (&lt;0.5 cm visible tumour rest
      at the end of operation) and according to expert opinion a complicatin-free prolongation of
      narcosis after finishing the operative intervention. HIPEC is carried out additionally to
      standard therapy. If it can be carried out, the amount of systemically administered
      patinum-based chemotherapy is reduced for one cycle.

      This regime should be tested on safety in performance, quality of life for patients, and
      consequences for the following systemic chemotherapy.
