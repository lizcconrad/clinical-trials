  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study (the first stage in testing a new treatment to see how safe and
      tolerable the treatment is) which will include patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
      that has either returned or has a more than a 70% chance of coming back and cannot have a
      bone marrow transplant.

      This study will see whether modifying a patient's AML cells to produce IL-12 and giving it
      back to the patient is safe and useful in patients with AML that cannot have bone marrow
      transplants.
