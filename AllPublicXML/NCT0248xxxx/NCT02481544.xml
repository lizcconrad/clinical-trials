  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosocial factors, including positive affect, finding meaning in the event, and managing
      emotional distress, influence prognosis following a heart attack or myocardial infarction
      (MI). Gratitude, typically defined as a feeling or attitude in acknowledgment of a benefit
      that one has received or will receive, is associated with higher levels of well-being, and
      people who are more grateful experience less stress, are less depressed, have higher levels
      of control over their environment, and more positive ways of coping. The present project will
      examine the potential benefits of a gratitude intervention (i.e., 8 weeks of gratitude
      journaling) to increase positive health behaviors, psychological health, and physical
      functioning in post-MI patients as compared to journaling about memorable events as well as
      care as usual alone. The investigators will study psychological and physical functioning at
      baseline, following 8 weeks of gratitude journaling or care as usual, and at 4-month
      follow-up.

    <description>There are three scales that have been developed to measure gratitude, the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6) (McCullough et al., 2002), Appreciation Scale (Adler &amp; Fagley, 2005), and Gratitude, Appreciation, and Resentment Test (GRAT). Each scale came from a different concept of gratitude, and in concert they provide a broad definition of gratitude. According to Wood, Maltby, Stewart and Joseph (2008) the three scales comprise 12 sub-scales which measure eight different components of gratitude: (1) grateful affect, (2) appreciation of other people, (3) a focus on what the person has, (4) feelings of awe when encountering beauty, (4) behaviors to express gratitude, (5) focusing on the positive in the present moment, (6) appreciation rising from understanding life is short, (7) a focus on the positive in the present moment, and (8) positive social comparisons.</description>

    <description>The most often used gratitude intervention consists of journaling, writing lists of things for which the individual is grateful. This technique was first employed and found to be effectual for enhancing wellbeing by Emmons and McCullough and has been suggested to be as effective as methods frequently used in clinical therapy. We are proposing an 8-week intervention in which the participant records 3-5 things for which they are grateful most days of the week. A longer intervention was chosen because Emmons and McCullough (2003) suggest that healthy behavior changes only occurred in a prolonged multi-week intervention. To ensure some conformity in the intervention, instructions that will be used will be similar to Emmons and McCullough (2003): &quot;There are many things in our lives, both large and small, that we might be grateful about. Think back over your day (week) and write down on the lines below up to five things in your life that you are grateful or thankful for.&quot;</description>

    <description>In the sham control condition, individuals will record &quot;memorable events&quot; with methods identical to the gratitude journaling condition: Patients will be asked to record 3-5 memorable events in a given day, on most days of the week. Patients will be contacted once per week to remind them to continue with the memorable events journal. Patients will be given 2 journals during their first testing session (one journal is for the first four weeks and the second is for the second four weeks of journaling). Patients will be contacted once per week to remind them to continue with gratitude journal writing. Patients will be instructed to record the date of each journal entry next to each new day of journaling Patients will be provided with materials to return their first journal by mail and will and return their second journal at the T2 laboratory testing session.</description>

    <description>SOC consists of medical care that is included in post-MI treatment, such as physician visits and medication adjustments and cardiac rehabilitation. These patients will not have any active intervention, but will undergo the same testing routine as the gratitude intervention group. These patients will be given the opportunity to participate in the gratitude journaling intervention after they have completed the study. Patient records will be evaluated at each timepoint for changes in medications and medical treatment.</description>
