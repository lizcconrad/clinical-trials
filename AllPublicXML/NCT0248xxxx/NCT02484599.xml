  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the therapeutic effects of a computerized attention
      training for patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The primary aim is to determine if a
      computerized attention training can modify attention towards food and ameliorate eating
      disorder symptoms and related difficulties, such as anxiety. The secondary aim is to explore
      underlying mechanisms that contribute to these improvements. The stability of potentially
      observed effects over a one-month period will also be determined.

    <textblock>
      Recently, attention bias modification (ABM) has successfully been applied in the field of
      anxiety disorders and emerging evidence suggests that attention bias modification can
      ameliorate attention bias for threatening stimuli. ABM is based on the premise that if biased
      attention maintains disorder symptoms, a modification of the bias should reduce symptoms. The
      advantage of ABM is that it operates implicitly, thereby offering a more indirect, less
      deliberate procedure. This requires less cognitive control compared to the effortful and
      explicit psychotherapeutic treatment of cognitive biases. As food-related fears and avoidance
      in AN patients have been recognized as important anxiety-related symptoms, ABM seems
      particularly suitable to treat food-related fears and avoidance, especially because AN
      patients might be unaware of their avoidance strategy. The aim of this study is to test if
      food-related fears and food avoidance can be changed by experimentally modifying attention
      towards food in Anorexia Nervosa patients using an innovative computerized training paradigm
      (computerized attention training - CAT) and to evaluate related change in symptoms.

      The investigators hypothesize that the active CAT will change attentional processing of food
      cues (research aim 1), transfer to changes in food-related fears and food avoidance, and to
      improvements in AN symptoms and weight in the short term (research aim 2) and longer term
      (research aim 3).
