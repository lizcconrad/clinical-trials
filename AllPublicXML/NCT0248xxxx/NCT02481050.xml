      This is a Phase 2, open-label, single arm, multicenter, 2-stage study of eribulin mesylate
      administered biweekly at 1.4 mg/m2 intravenously for the treatment of participants with
      HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with 2 to 5 chemotherapy regimens.
      The study will be conducted in 3 Phases: a Pretreatment Phase (screening visit), a Treatment
      Phase (starting with Cycle 1 Day 1), and a Posttreatment Phase (End of treatment visit and
      survival follow up). Participants may remain on study drug as long as they demonstrate
      clinical benefit or until intercurrent illness, unacceptable toxicity, or disease progression
      occurs, until the participant withdraws consent, or death.

             active treatment, including the use of oxygen

         15. History of concomitant medical condition(s) that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the participant's ability to safely complete the study
