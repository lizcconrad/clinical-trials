  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - One cancer therapy involves taking white blood cells from a person, changing them in a lab,
      and then giving the cells back to the person. These cells are called tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL). Researchers want to grow some of the TIL cells with the drug Akti to see
      if they live longer than those grown without it.

      Objectives:

      - To see if TIL cells grown with Akti live longer than those grown without it.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 70 with metastatic melanoma

      Design:

        -  Participants will:

        -  Be screened with tests including scans, x-rays, heart and lung tests, blood and urine
           tests, and a &lt;TAB&gt;possible colonoscopy.

        -  Have tumor surgery or biopsy.

        -  Have a large catheter inserted into a vein in the upper chest.

        -  Receive leukapheresis for 4 5 hours. Blood is removed through a needle in an arm. White
           blood cells &lt;TAB&gt;are removed. The rest of the blood is returned by needle in the other
           arm.

        -  The cells will be changed in a laboratory.

        -  Participants will check into the hospital and:

        -  For 5 days, get 1 2 chemotherapy drugs by catheter.

        -  For 1 3 days, get the changed cells by catheter.

        -  For several days, get 2 drugs to stimulate cells, one by injection, the other by
           catheter.

        -  For 7 12 days, recover in the hospital.

        -  After treatment, participants will:

        -  Take an antibiotic and antiviral for at least 6 months.

        -  Return to NIH for several 2-day visits for a few years. At each visit, participants will
           have lab tests, imaging studies, and a physical exam. At some visits, they may have
           leukapheresis or blood tests.

      Background:

        -  Adoptive cellular immunotherapy (ACT) using autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
           (TIL) can mediate regression of bulky metastatic melanoma when administered with
           high-dose aldesleukin (IL-2) following a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy
           preparative regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  Regression of tumor in mouse models and humans strongly correlates with anti-tumor T
           cells that exhibit features of immunologic memory and have a capacity to persist for
           long periods after adoptive-transfer into tumor-bearing hosts.

        -  In our preclinical work with TIL, we have identified a pharmacologic inhibitor of AKT
           that promotes features of immunologic memory in TIL (as evidenced by transcriptomic,
           proteomic, metabolomic, and functional assays described in the Background section).
           Consistently, AKT inhibition of human TIL significantly enhances persistence after
           adoptive-transfer into an immunodeficient mouse model.

        -  We therefore aim to evaluate whether pharmacologic inhibition of AKT in TIL may enhance
           persistence after adoptive-transfer into patients with advanced melanoma.

      Objectives:

        -  Primary objective:

             -  To determine whether ACT using TIL cultured in a pharmacologic inhibitor of AKT
                (during ex vivo expansion) results in enhanced in vivo persistence of TIL after
                adoptive transfer into autologous patients with advanced melanoma.

        -  Secondary objectives:

             -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

             -  Determine whether ACT using a combination of AKTi-treated and conventional TIL can
                mediate tumor regression by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)
                guidelines in patients with advanced melanoma.

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 and less than or equal to 70 years

        -  Evaluable metastatic melanoma

        -  Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable for surgical resection for the preparation of TIL

        -  No contraindications to high-dose aldesleukin administration

        -  No concurrent major medical illnesses or any form of immunodeficiency

      Design:

        -  Patients with metastatic melanoma will undergo ACT in conventional manner, with the
           exception that half of tumor fragments from which TIL are isolated will be cultured in
           the presence of a pharmacologic AKT inhibitor. Prior to infusion of TIL, the AKT
           inhibitor (hereafter AKTi) will be washed from the therapeutic TIL product and will not
           be systemically administered. Each patient will receive a 1:1 mixture of conventional
           TIL and AKTi-treated TIL. To evaluate persistence of AKTi-treated and conventional TIL
           after adoptive co-transfer, we will perform high-throughput deep sequencing of the TCR
           V-beta CDR3 region of TIL from the infusion-bag and from peripheral blood when
           sufficient lymphocyte reconstitution (&gt;200 lymphocytes/microliter) has occurred and
           approximately 4-6 weeks after infusion.

        -  Up to 20 patients may be enrolled over 20-24 months.

             NCI.

          -  Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are less than 1 cm in diameter and
             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

                  therapies that could affect an anti-cancer immune response, at the time the
                  patient receives the preparative regimen to allow antibody levels to decline.

               -  Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented GI
                  toxicity must have a normal colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies.

                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the

             patient receives the preparative regimen to allow antibody levels to decline.

               -  Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented GI
                  toxicity must have a colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA
