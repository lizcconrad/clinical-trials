    <textblock>
      Anatomic segmentectomy may be a less invasive type of surgery than lobectomy for cT1aN0M0
      peripheral NSCLC and may retain more pulmonary function. It is not yet known whether anatomic
      segmentectomy is non-inferior to lobectomy in treating stage IA non-small cell lung cancer.
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the outcome of anatomic segmentectomy is
      similar to lobectomy for peripheral stage IA (≤ 2cm)non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Objective: To compare the outcomes(including 5 year relapse free survival rate, 5 year
      overall survival rate, retaining pulmonary function and the rates of loco-regional and
      systemic recurrence ) of patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2 cm) non-small cell lung
      cancer undergoing anatomic segmentectomy vs lobectomy. And to evaluate whether the anatomic
      segmentectomy is an optimal type of surgery for the patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2cm)
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      Outline: This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized open phase III study of anatomic
      segmentectomy vs lobectomy for the patients with peripheral stage IA (≤ 2cm) non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC). According to completely random block design, the patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo anatomic segmentectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or
           thoracoscopy/VATS.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo lobectomy by minimal incision thoracotomy or thoracoscopy/VATS.

      Patients will be followed up every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months for
      the subsequent 2 years and annually for 5 years postoperatively.
