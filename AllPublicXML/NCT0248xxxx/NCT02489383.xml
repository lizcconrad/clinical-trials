  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of asthma is based in clinical control. However, previous studies have been
      shown that patients that participate of the programs of regular or aerobic continuous
      exercise training (CT) presented improvements in the physical conditioning, and quality life,
      as well as decreased the levels of anxiety and depression, reduced the oxide nitric exhaled
      and leukocyte migration at the airways and reduced the airway hyperresponsiveness. The
      regular exercise also is important part in the rehabilitation of other lung disease as well
      as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Additionally, others studies have been shown
      the effects of high intensity interval training (IT) in the pulmonary rehabilitation of COPD
      patients, that after performed IT presented reduction of dyspnea, and increase the physical
      capacity. In this sense, the impact of IT in the asthmatic patients at the present moment is
      poorly studied, and necessity of the more investigation to prove the efficiency of this
      training model for asthma patients.

      The present study will compare the impact of IT and CT in patients with moderate or severe
      asthma, and investigate what is the most efficient and increases the physical capacity, and
      quality of life and reduces the inflammatory mediators.

      Sixty asthmatic adults will be randomly assigned into two groups: CT (Continuous training) or
      IT (Interval training). CT will have treatment 2x week, 40 min./session, 60-75% of maximum
      heart rate intensity and IT also 2x week, 40 min./session, 80-140% of the maximum load
      intensity, both performed in ergometer cycle by 24 weeks.

The exercise sessions will be will be performed on a stationary bicycle, with the initial intensity of 70% of VO2max. If the subject sustain continuously training intensity for 2 consecutive sessions without symptoms breathing, exercise intensity will be increased by 5% of heart rate. The patient may stop the activity if he has any symptoms or respiratory distress, returning it as soon present improvement. Throughout the training, will be monitored heart rate and the level of perception subjective effort (modified Borg scale).</description>

    <description>The interval training (IT) will be held in two weekly sessions. The IT is individualized and will be performed on a stationary bicycle. Training sessions will be performed with total duration of 40 minutes consisting of 5 minutes extender, 30 minutes from the main part (IT), finishing with five minutes back to calm. In the main part (of 5 to 30 minutes), the patient will perform the exercise with high intensity in the first two weeks, the exercise will be conducted with an intensity 80% of maximum capacity obtained in cycle ergometer test and will cycle for 30 seconds followed by a 30 second recovery period.
