      Evaluation of efficacy, safety profile and tolerability of rituximab (MabThera) in
      combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).
      Participants, who were not treated previously for DLBCL, will receive MabThera in combination
      with Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, Prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP-like
      chemotherapy according to registered indication. Patients will be followed up for safety and
      efficacy evaluation in accordance with routine practice. The study will be non-interventional
      and by its design purely observational. All treatments prescribed during the observation
      period will be at the treating physician's discretion and will be prescribed according to
      package labeling, within approved indication and local approval status of respective drugs.
