  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop strategy is composed of three components: glucose sensor to read glucose levels,
      insulin pump to infuse insulin and a dosing mathematical algorithm to decide on the required
      insulin dosages based on the sensor's readings.

      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop
      strategy and sensor-augmented pump therapy to regulate glucose levels in outpatient settings
      for 5 consecutive days in adults with type 1 diabetes.

      The investigators hypothesized that single-hormone closed-loop strategy will increase the
      time spent in the target range compared to sensor-augmented pump therapy.

    <description>Participants will use sensor-augmented pump therapy with low-glucose suspend to regulate glucose levels. The low-glucose suspend feature available in the MiniMed® Paradigm® Veo™, Medtronic combined with the Enlite sensor® will be used. This feature allows for suspension of insulin delivery at a pre-set sensor glucose value for up to 2 hours.</description>

    <description>Variable subcutaneous insulin infusion will be used to regulate glucose levels. Participant's usual fast-acting insulin analog will be infused using a subcutaneous infusion pump (MiniMed® Paradigm® Veo™, Medtronic). Every 10 minutes, the glucose levels as measured by the sensor (Enlite sensor®, Medtronic) will be transferred automatically to a smartphone, that harbors the algorithm, that will calculate the recommended doses and will send it wirelessly to the infusion pump.</description>

    <description>A sensor will be inserted on the day prior to the first day of the intervention by the participants. On the first day of the intervention, participants will be admitted to the clinical research facility anytime between 8:00 am and 11:30 am. Training on connection and disconnection of the system, meal boluses, etc. will be given.
Competency on the use of study devices will be assessed by a team member. Only participants demonstrating competency on use of study devices will be allowed to continue to the home study phase. Participants will be advised to continue with study intervention at home for the next 5 days.</description>
