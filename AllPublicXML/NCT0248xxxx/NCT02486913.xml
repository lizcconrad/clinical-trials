  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will develop a &quot;risk report&quot; within the primary care electronic health
      record (EMIS) for patients attending for their National Health Service Health Check. The
      value of the report for reducing cardiovascular risk will be assessed qualitatively and also
      quantitatively in a non-randomised comparative trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will design a template within the primary care electronic health record
      (EMIS) that draws on Health Check data to provide a contemporary &quot;risk report&quot;. Included in
      the report will be clear description of life-time cardiovascular risks, the factors driving
      those risks and how risk might be reduced through life-style and risk factor modification.
      The investigators will evaluate the benefits of providing patients with a risk report
      qualitatively by patient and clinician interviews. Quantitative analysis of the benefit of
      the risk report will be provided by a non-randomised comparative trial. First, a group of
      patients undergoing a conventional Health Check will be recalled after three months for a
      second Health Check, allowing measurement of the change in &quot;Heart Age&quot; - a convenient index
      of life-time cardiovascular risk. Following introduction of the risk report the investigators
      will recall a further group of patients for a second Health Check, allowing measurement of
      the change in &quot;Heart Age&quot;. The effect of the risk report will be determined by comparing the
      change in Heart Age between the two groups of patients.
