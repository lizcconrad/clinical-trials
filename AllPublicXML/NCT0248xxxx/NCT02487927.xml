      To evaluate the distribution of different types of difficult weaning and the predictive value
      of weaning relative factors.

      108 patients who passed the spontaneous breathing test (SBT) were included in this
      study,every patient were performed 30-60 minutes SBT after enrollment.Patients were divided
      into succeed weaning and difficult weaning group according the results of SBT, the difficult
      weaning group were futher divided into A(Airway and Lung dysfunction),B（Brain
      dysfunction）,C（Cardic dysfunction）,D（Diaphragm dysfunction）,E（Endocrine and metabolic
      dysfunction）five different groups according to the causes of difficult weaning. The
      respiratory mechanical parameters,the diameter of inferior vena cava and the diaphgram
      excursion were recorded before SBT and 30 minutes after SBT.
