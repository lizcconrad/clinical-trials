  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the sensory and motor block duration and the incidence of nerve
      injury after sciatic nerve block between diabetic and non-diabetic patients, and screen for
      the factors that may affect the block recovery.

      This is an observational study. All participants who experienced unilateral lower limb
      surgery and received an ultrasound-guided (nerve stimulator assisted) subgluteal sciatic
      nerve block with 0.75% ropivacaine 20ml in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were
      selected. They were further assigned to either diabetic group or non-diabetic group according
      to their medical history (primary exposure). The primary end point was the sensory and motor
      block duration. These durations in terms of sensory and motor blocks of sciatic nerve(dorsal
      side, plantar side) were assessed at baseline, every 2 hours in 48 hours after the block
      (except for the second night). In addition, the associations between fasting blood glucose,
      glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c) and the degree of diabetic retinopathy and
      the durations of sensory and motor block were also examined. This is not a intervention
      study, because we will examine the outcomes between diabetic or non-diabetic patients.
