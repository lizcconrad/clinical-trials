      OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of 3 exercise interventions on sarcopenic indices among
      community-dwelling older adults with high osteoporotic fracture risks.

      MATERIAL AND METHOD The current study enrolled subjects who screened high risk of fall,
      osteoporosis/fracture by standardized questionnaires or FRAX. Subjects at the National Taiwan
      University Hospital Bei-Hu Branch (NTUHBB) were randomized into integrated care group (ICG,
      target n=50) and muscle training group (MTG, target n=50). Subjects from Lingko Chang Gung
      Memorial Hospital (LCGMH) were all assigned into X-box group (XBG, target n=30). All
      participants received a CD-ROM and a one education on osteoporosis, sarcopenia, frailty, fall
      prevention, nutrition, and coping strategy and another hour of professional led exercise
      program. ICG subjects received once weekly group exercise while MTG subjects received twice
      weekly machine-based resistence training on major muscle groups. XBG subjects rececived twice
      weekly exercise with X-box based programs. Major outcomes were muscle mass (measured by
      bio-impedance analysis), grip strength, walking speed, and lower leg extension power at
      baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention.

    <description>Core 2-hour education course including practice of study home exercise program. Weekly professional led exercise program for 90 mins at NTUHBB site with reinforcement on osteoporosis related educations and care managements from study educational booklet and CD-rom for 3-month.
The exercise program included 15 minutes warm up with 10 minute brisk walks followed by gentle stretching. Resistance training (20-30 minutes) was provided with rubber band and bottled water (0.6-1L) as weight for major muscles of upper and lower limbs. Balance training were also provided for 10 minutes with tandem gaits and one leg standing, step up and down stairs, toe walking and heel walking.
Subjects are encouraged to practice study home exercise program at least twice weekly.</description>
