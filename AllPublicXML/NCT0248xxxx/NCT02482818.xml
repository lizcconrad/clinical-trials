  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Pregabalin, a medication used for the treatment
      of seizures and chronic pain, can be used to effectively treat people who suffer from
      non-asthmatic chronic cough (cough lasting over 8 weeks).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A significant number of patients have an impaired quality of life due to chronic cough that
      fails to respond to therapeutic efforts.

      Research suggests that patients with chronic cough may have an oversensitive cough reflex.
      Reflexes are involuntary responses to nerve stimulation. Since standard cough medicines may
      not be helpful for treating the oversensitive cough reflex, treatment with neurologically
      acting agents has been investigated.

      Existing work in treatment of cough of unknown etiology has focused on the use of Gabapentin,
      a compound that acts neurologically that is used in the treatment of epilepsy and pain. A
      similar drug, Pregabalin, may be a superior medication for this indication. Pregabalin is
      rapidly absorbed with peak blood concentrations within 1 hour, has an approximate
      bioavailability of 90%, and is 3 to 10 times more potent than Gabapentin and has no known
      pharmacokinetic drug interactions.

    <description>Citric acid has been used extensively in the literature as an effective inhaled compound that can induce cough. The changes in the concentration of citric acid that can cause 2 or 5 consecutive coughs (C2 or C5) has been used to objectively determine the impact of various therapies on cough receptors.</description>

    <description>Administration of Placebo (Lactose instead of Pregabalin) pills in an increasing dose regimen followed by a decreasing dose regimen over 35 days during a 42 day trial.
Initially an increasing dosage of placebo (Lactose) will be administered. On Visit 1 an increasing dose (25 mg twice a day for 3 days, then 50 mg twice a day for 2 days and then 75 mg twice a day for 2 days).
Eight days after initial placebo administration, following an assessment by the Doctor of how well subjects are doing on their (drug or placebo), the study placebo will be increased to 100 mg twice a day.
Twenty eight days after initial placebo administration subjects will begin to receive the study placebo in a reducing dose regimen for 7 days then follow up at day 42.</description>
