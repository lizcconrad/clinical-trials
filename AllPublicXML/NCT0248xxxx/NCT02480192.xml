  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women going through the menopausal transition often experience adverse physical changes
      (e.g., hot flashes/night sweats, sleep difficulties, sexual concerns) in addition to
      emotional difficulties (e.g., depression, anxiety) that can significantly impact functioning
      and overall quality of life. To date, hormone therapy (HT) has been the most commonly used
      treatment to relieve symptoms of menopause. However, reports have questioned the safety of HT
      long-term (e.g., risk of heart attacks, strokes, cancer) in some women. Cognitive-behavioural
      therapy (CBT), has been proposed as a low-risk treatment for menopausal symptoms and received
      some initial support. The investigators developed a comprehensive non-pharmacological, CBT
      based treatment program for menopausal symptoms, published the treatment manual, and have
      initial evidence supporting its effectiveness with the investigators' published pilot data.
      The investigators' goal is to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of Cognitive
      Behavioural Group Therapy (CBGT) for the improvement of menopausal symptoms. The
      investigators hypothesize that participants will experience fewer and less intense/disruptive
      hot flashes/night sweats, reduced depression and anxiety and improvement in sleep
      difficulties, sexual concerns, and overall quality of life. The investigators also predict
      that these benefits will be maintained at follow up and there will be high satisfaction
      associated with the program by participants.

    <description>Vasomotor symptoms will be assessed objectively through ambulatory sternal skin-conductance monitoring which will be worn for 2 consecutive days prior to each assessment. The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly reduces vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes/night sweats) compared to pre-treatment and wait-list controls.</description>

    <measure>The Beck Depression Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a multiple choice questionnaire which measures depressive symptoms (Beck, Steer &amp; Brown, 1996). The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly reduces subjective depressive symptoms, compared to pre-treatment and wait-list controls.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale assesses the degree to which vasomotor functions interfere with daily life (Carpenter, 2001). The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly reduces vasomotor function daily interference, as captured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale, compared to pre-treatment and wait-list controls.</description>

    <measure>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (Montgomery &amp; Asberg, 1979) is a measure that requires an interview format assessing depressive symptoms in menopausal women and contains a global severity score. The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly reduces menopausal depressive symptoms, as captured by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, compared to pre-treatment and wait-list controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Greene Climacteric Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Greene Climacteric Scale is a self-report questionnaire which measures four menopause-related domains: Vasomotor symptoms, depression and anxiety, physical complaints, and sexual concerns (Greene, 1998). The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly improves typical menopausal symptoms, as captured by the Greene Climacteric Scale, compared to pre-treatment and wait list controls?</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Invetory is a self-report measure measuring subjective, somatic or panic-related symptoms of anxiety (Beck, 1993). The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly improves subjective anxiety symptoms, as captured subjectively by the Beck Anxiety Inventory, compared to pre-treatment and wait list controls.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale is an interview format rating scale developed to quantify the severity of anxiety symptomatology and contains a global score (Hamilton, 1956). The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly improves objective anxiety symptoms, as captured by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, compared to pre-treatment and wait list controls.</description>

    <measure>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory (Buysee et al, 1989) is a self-report inventory that contains seven component scores along with one global score indicating overall sleep quality. The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly improves sleep disruption, as captured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory, compared to pre-treatment and wait list controls.</description>

    <measure>The Utian Quality of Life Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed through The Utian Quality of Life Scale (Utian et al, 2002) is a self-report questionnaire which contains four domains namely, occupational, health, emotional, and sexual in addition to a total score representing quality of life. The current study aims to explore whether CBGT for menopausal symptoms significantly improves quality of life compared to pre-treatment and wait list controls.</description>

They will then be re-assessed after 12 weeks and this data will be used to compare this group to the experimental group to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. After this re-assessment they will be offered the same treatment as the experimental group: 12 weekly sessions (2 hours long) of Cognitive Behavioural Group Therapy.</description>
