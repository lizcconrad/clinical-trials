    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well sapanisertib works in treating patients with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not
      responded to previous treatment (refractory). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of cancer
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the complete hematologic response (CR)/complete response incomplete (CRi)
      rate when sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) is administered to adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the overall response rate (CR, CRi/partial response (PR)/morphologic leukemia
      free state [MLFS]).

      II. To determine the CR/CRi duration when MLN0128 (TAK-228) is administered to adult patients
      with relapsed/refractory ALL.

      III. To determine the frequency of proceeding to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT)
      for patients with relapsed/refractory ALL who achieve a response on MLN0128 (TAK-228).

      IV. To determine the overall survival for relapsed/refractory ALL patients on MLN0128
      (TAK-228).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in ALL patients. II. To assess
      whether phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate 4EBP1 decreases in leukemic blasts harvested
      from the bone marrow on day 8 compared to baseline.

      III. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether MLN0128 (TAK-228) enhances expression of the
      pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Puma in marrow ALL cells.

      IV. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether Mcl-1 levels decrease in blast cells during
      MLN0128 (TAK-228) treatment.

      V. To assess in an exploratory fashion whether a) the phospho-protein pattern at baseline or
      b) MLN0128 (TAK-228)-associated changes in the phospho-protein pattern differs between ALL
      samples that respond to therapy and those that do not.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who are non-responders
      and in PR at the end of course 4 may receive sapanisertib PO daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A complete response will be considered synonymous with &quot;success&quot;. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Ninety-five percent exact binomial confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall response rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>ORR will be estimated by the total number of complete or partial responses (complete hematologic response [CR], complete response incomplete [CRi], partial response [PR], or morphologic leukemia free state [MLFS]) divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated.</description>

    <measure>Duration of complete response (complete hematologic response [CR]/complete response incomplete [CRi])</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date at which the patient's objective status is first noted to be a CR to the earliest date progression is documented, assessed up to 4 years</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency is estimated by the number of patients who proceed to allogeneic SCT after achieving response divided by the total number of evaluable patients who achieved a response. All evaluable patients who achieved a response will be used for this analysis. Exact binomial 95% confidence intervals for the true overall response rate will be calculated.</description>
