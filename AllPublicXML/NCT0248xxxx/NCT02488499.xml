      behaviour and their parents.

      This project compares the short- and long-term effectiveness of a clinic-adapted manualized
      group treatment (i.e., Coping Power; CP) to individualized child and family treatment for
      children aged 9 - 12 with disruptive behaviour. Children and their parents who meet criteria
      and agree to participate in the project are randomly assigned to either the CP condition or
      the Individualized treatment condition. In the CP condition, children and caregivers are
      asked to participate in two separate but complimentary 15-session groups. Child groups target
      development of children's emotional and cognitive problem solving skills and caregiver groups
      facilitate cognitive and behavioural parenting skills. In the Individualized treatment
      condition children and caregivers are asked to participate in 15 one-hour individual and
      family treatment sessions tailored by the clinician to address the children and parent's
      presenting concerns. Measurement of behaviour and emotional functioning is done pre- post-
      and at 6-months following treatment.
