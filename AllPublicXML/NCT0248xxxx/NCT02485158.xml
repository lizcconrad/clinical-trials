  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether individual differences in acute responses to
      drugs co-vary across three drugs from different drug classes: alcohol, amphetamine and
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The investigators hypothesize that individuals who
      experience greater rewarding effects from one drug will also experience more rewarding
      effects from the other drugs.

      Here, the investigators aim to investigate whether individuals exhibit similar responses to
      three different drugs from different classes. This study used a within-subjects design (total
      N = 24). All subjects received alcohol, amphetamine and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in
      a double-blind, double-dummy fashion. Subjects completed six sessions wherein they received
      either alcohol, amphetamine, or THC, or corresponding placebos, on separate days. Subjects
      completed questionnaires about mood, general drug effects, and specific drug effects.

    <measure>Change in General Drug Effects (Drug Effects Questionnaire) at 30 Minutes After Capsule Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 15 minutes prior to capsule administration and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration</time_frame>
    <description>Drug effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (Fischman &amp; Foltin, 1991). The DEQ included 5 subscales; feeling, liking, and disliking the drug effect, feeling high, and wanting more of the drug. Each subscale ranged from 1(Not at all) to 100(Very much). The change in DFQ was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

    <measure>Change in Specific Drug Effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory) at 30 Minutes After Capsule Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured 15 minutes prior to capsule administration and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration</time_frame>
    <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects. The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

          <description>24 healthy adult volunteers completed a 6 session within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. At three of these sessions, they received one of three recreational drugs, d-amphetamine, THC and alochol (only one drug was administered per drug session). The other three sessions were matched placebo sessions. At each session, they received a capsule and a drink. At the amphetamine drug session, they received a capsule containing d-amphetamine and a placebo beverage. At the THC drug session, they received a capsule containing THC and a placebo beverage. At the alcohol drug session they received a placebo capsule and a beverage containing alcohol. At the three matched placebo sessions, both the capsule and the beverage were placebo.</description>

          <description>All healthy adult volunteers completed a 6 session within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. At three of these sessions, they received one of three recreational drugs, d-amphetamine, THC and alochol (only one drug was administered per drug session). The other three sessions were matched placebo sessions. At each session, they received a capsule and a drink. At the amphetamine drug session, they received a capsule containing d-amphetamine and a placebo beverage. At the THC drug session, they received a capsule containing THC and a placebo beverage. At the alcohol drug session they received a placebo capsule and a beverage containing alcohol. At the three matched placebo sessions, both the capsule and the beverage were placebo.</description>

        <title>Change in General Drug Effects (Drug Effects Questionnaire) at 30 Minutes After Capsule Administration</title>
        <description>Drug effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (Fischman &amp; Foltin, 1991). The DEQ included 5 subscales; feeling, liking, and disliking the drug effect, feeling high, and wanting more of the drug. Each subscale ranged from 1(Not at all) to 100(Very much). The change in DFQ was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in General Drug Effects (Drug Effects Questionnaire) at 90 Minutes After Drink Administration</title>
        <description>Drug effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (Fischman &amp; Foltin, 1991). The DEQ included 5 subscales; feeling, liking, and disliking the drug effect, feeling high, and wanting more of the drug. Each subscale ranged from 1(Not at all) to 100(Very much). The change in DFQ was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 90 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in General Drug Effects (Drug Effects Questionnaire) at 150 Minutes After Drink Administration</title>
        <description>Drug effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (Fischman &amp; Foltin, 1991). The DEQ included 5 subscales; feeling, liking, and disliking the drug effect, feeling high, and wanting more of the drug. Each subscale ranged from 1(Not at all) to 100(Very much). The change in DFQ was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 150 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in General Drug Effects (Drug Effects Questionnaire) at 210 Minutes After Drink Administration</title>
        <description>Drug effects will be measured using the Drug Effects Questionnaire (Fischman &amp; Foltin, 1991). The DEQ included 5 subscales; feeling, liking, and disliking the drug effect, feeling high, and wanting more of the drug. Each subscale ranged from 1(Not at all) to 100(Very much). The change in DFQ was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 210 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in Specific Drug Effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory) at 30 Minutes After Capsule Administration</title>
        <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects. The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 30 minutes after capsule administration and before drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in Specific Drug Effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory) at 30 Minutes After Drink Administration</title>
        <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects. The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 30 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects. The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 90 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects.The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 120 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects.The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 150 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects.The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 180 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

        <title>Change in Specific Drug Effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory) at 210 Minutes After Drink Administration</title>
        <description>Specific drug effects will be measured using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (Martin et al. 1971). The ARCI measures effects specific to drug classes, including the effects of AMP-like drugs (A scale, 0 to 11), morphine and benzedrine like drugs (MBG scale, 0 to 14), lysergic acid-like drugs (LSD scale, 0 to 14), benzedrine-like drugs (BG scale, 0 to 13), pentobarbital-chlorpromazine and ALC-like drugs (PCAG scale, 0 to 15), and cannabis-like drugs (M scale, 0 to 12). We used this questionnaire as a manipulation check to ensure that the drugs produced their typical drug-specific effects in this study. For example, zero value of A sacle would be minimum report of amphetamine-like drug effects, and 11 would be maximum report of amphetamine-like effects.The change in ARCI was assessed by the difference in measurements between baseline and 210 minutes after drink administration. Baseline was measure 15 minutes prior to capsule administration.</description>

At three of these sessions, they received one of three recreational drugs, d-amphetamine, THC and alochol (only one drug was administered per drug session). The other three sessions were matched placebo sessions. At each session, they received a capsule and a drink. At the amphetamine drug session, they received a capsule containing d-amphetamine and a placebo beverage. At the THC drug session, they received a capsule containing THC and a placebo beverage. At the alcohol drug session they received a placebo capsule and a beverage containing alcohol. At the three matched placebo sessions, both the capsule and the beverage were placebo.</description>
