  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to test the hypothesis that bezafibrate, a pan-PPAR agonist, may be effective and
      safe for bipolar depression with the following specific aims:

      Aim #1. Proof-of-Concept Safety and Tolerability Aim: To assess the safety and tolerability
      of bezafibrate added to anti-manic medication for bipolar depression, especially with regard
      to worsening manic symptoms and suicidal ideation.

      We will conduct a phase IIa, 8-week, open pilot trial of bezafibrate added to FDA-approved
      anti-manic medication in 30 participants with bipolar depression. We will monitor changes in
      manic symptoms (Young Mania Rating Scale), suicidal ideation, cognitive functioning
      specifically in attention and verbal memory, and treatment emergent adverse events (SAFTEE).
      We will also monitor changes in the Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score.

      Aim #2. Preliminary Assessment of Efficacy: To assess the antidepressant efficacy of
      bezafibrate added to anti-manic medication for acute bipolar I major depressive episodes.

      Hypothesis: The bezafibrate group will have a statistically significant decrease in the
      Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) Scores over 8 weeks. The results of this proof-of
      concept phase IIa study will help us to plan a placebo-controlled randomized trial. In
      summary, we propose an 8-week, proof-of-concept open pilot trial of an adjunctive pan-PPAR
      agonist, bezafibrate, for 30 patients with an acute bipolar I major depressive episode. The
      study may have a profound impact on the development of a novel treatment consistent with the
      mitochondrial dysregulation hypothesis of bipolar disorder and, to the best of our knowledge,
      will be the first proof-of-concept trial to assess a pan-PPAR agonist for bipolar disorder.
