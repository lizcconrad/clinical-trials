  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Asthma Action at Erie Trial compares the current best practice in asthma self-management
      education (certified asthma educator services) to an integrated community health worker (CHW)
      home intervention in which the real-life challenges of patients and the health care system
      are taken fully into account. This trial will provide clarity as to the expected effect size,
      cost savings, and resources needed to integrate asthma CHWs into clinical practice.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Asthma Action at Erie Trial will test the ability of a community health worker (CHW)
      intervention with three important modifications to achieve asthma control in high-risk
      children. These modifications are: 1) CHWs will be integrated into both the clinical and the
      home setting, 2) A system for directly addressing mental health and psychosocial barriers
      will be provided, and 3) Participants will be provided only materials and equipment for
      trigger remediation that are supported by the current medical reimbursement system. To test
      this intervention, a two-arm behavioral randomized controlled trial (N=220) will be conducted
      in partnership with a federally-qualified health center (FQHC) serving a low income, minority
      population that is at high-risk for significant asthma morbidity. The intervention arm will
      receive an integrated CHW home intervention for pediatric asthma education. The comparison
      arm will received clinic-based certified asthma educator (AE-C) services. Primary Aim 1 is to
      assess the efficacy of the integrated CHW home asthma intervention, relative to clinic-based
      AE-C education over 12-months, as demonstrated by asthma control. Specific Aim 2 is to assess
      maintenance of intervention efficacy, as demonstrated by asthma control at 18 and 24 months
      after randomization. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the cost-effectiveness at 12-months of
      CHW and AE-C intervention delivery, and additional costs or savings related to asthma
      exacerbations at 12- and 24-months. Specific Aim 4 is to assess the efficacy of the
      integrated CHW home asthma intervention relative to clinic-based AE-C education, as
      demonstrated by asthma control, among those experiencing depression, stress, and/or a
      post-traumatic stress disorder.
