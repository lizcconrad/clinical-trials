  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the impact of a comprehensive diabetes education and
      management program based on frequent communication with patients using teleconsultation, text
      messaging, and phone calls on diabetes related outcomes in Latino patients with type 2
      diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that the decline in hemoglobin A1c value between the
      baseline and the six-month visit will be at least 0.5 percent greater in the intervention
      group than in the control group.

      In this study participants will be followed for a period of 9 months. The control group will
      receive usual care during this period of time. While, the intervention group will be part of
      a diabetes education and management program lasting 6 months via a smartphone participants
      will receive. The 6 month intervention will be followed by a 3 month observation period.

    <description>Patients in this group will be part of a Virtual Diabetes Self-Care and Education Program. They will receive a phone to communicate with a diabetes educator for 6 months. They will connect with the diabetes educator for weekly video conferences of up to 30 minutes for twelve consecutive weeks, followed by 7 phone calls. Additionally, they will receive a weekly text message about diabetes for 6 months.</description>

    <description>Participants will be able to share physical activity and glucose data with the diabetes educator using the smartphone they will receive. Participants will be given a Fitbit physical activity tracker which they can use to record their activity and share the information with the diabetes educator using the device's smartphone application. In addition, participants will receive a Glooko MeterSync Blue cable which is able to connect to most glucose meters in order to download glucose data to the Glooko Population Management tool on their smartphones. Information downloaded to the Glooko Population Management tool can be shared with the diabetes educator.</description>
