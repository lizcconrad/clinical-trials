      Purpose: To evaluate the effects of replacing breakfast with a high protein, high fat, high
      fiber meal replacement in overweight individuals, on body composition.

      Participants: Healthy, overweight and obese individuals (ages 18-45 yrs) with no history of
      disease. Procedures (methods): In a randomized control intervention, subjects will complete 5
      different testing sessions (pre-screening, 2 baseline testing sessions, and 2 post testing
      sessions) as well as an 8 week intervention period. Pre-screening will include written
      informed consent, health history questionnaire, nutrition analysis, and baseline
      anthropometric measures. Baseline testing will be split into two sessions and include
      measurements of resting metabolic rate (RMR), body composition, blood and saliva hormones,
      mood, satiety, and health related quality of life questionnaires, and a cardiorespiratory
      fitness assessment.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment (8 week supplementation with meal replacement
      to be taken at breakfast) and control groups (continue normal eating habits) with 4
      electronic correspondences throughout the supplementation period. All measures will be
      repeated in two post-testing sessions.
