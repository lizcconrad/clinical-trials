  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Appreciation of the central role for arterial vasodilatation in the pathogenesis of
      hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) has led to routine use of vasoconstrictors in combination with
      albumin as a medical therapy for HRS. Terlipressin have been explored but the optimal
      approach for such therapies has not yet been established. As compared with albumin, treatment
      with terlipressin and albumin is effective in improving renal function in patients with
      cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. Our previous study showed that mean arterial pressure
      (MAP) is a predictor of hepatorenal syndrome occurrence in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
      The purpose of this study was to examine the role of targeting an early and substantial
      increase in mean arterial pressure in the prevention of type 2 HRS.

    <description>Patients in this group received terlipressin as an intravenous bolus of 0.5 mg every 6 h. If a significant reduction in serum creatinine level (≥1 mg/dL) was not observed during 3-day period, the dose of terlipressin was increased in a stepwise fashion every 3 days to a maximum of 2 mg every 6 hour.
albumin (Albumin 20 percent; Instituto Grífols, Barcelona, Spain) was given at a dose of 10 gram per day.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. cirrhosis as diagnosedby liver biopsy or clinical, biochemical, ultrasound,and/or
             endoscopic findings;

          2. type 2 HRS with a MAP decrees for at least 10mmHg compared to basal blood pressure ;

          3. age 18 to65 years;

          4. absence of severe bacterial infection associated with findings of systemic
             inflammatory response as diagnosedby the presence of at least 2 of the following
             criteria: body temperature &lt;36°C or &gt;38°C, heart rate &gt;90 beats/min, respiration
             rate&gt;20/min, and white-cell count &lt;4 or &gt;12 X106/L or &gt;6% of band forms; patients with
             bacterial infections, however, could be included in the study if renal failure
             persisted after infection resolution;

          5. the absence of cardiovascular diseases and any extra hepatic disease that could affect
             the short-term prognosis;

          6. the absence of findings suggestive of organic nephropathy;

          7. the absence of advanced hepatocellularcarcinoma.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with history of coronary artery disease

          2. Cardiomyopathy

          3. Ventricular arrhythmia

          4. Obstructive arterial disease of limbs -
