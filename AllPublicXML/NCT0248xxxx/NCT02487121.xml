      This project examines the effects of differing schedules of extended care contact following
      weight loss treatment in order to prevent weight regain following treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 21 years-old

          -  body mass index (BMI) = 28.0 - 45.0 kg/m2

          -  willing to provide informed consent and accept randomization

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  BMI &gt;45 kg/m2

          -  Illnesses requiring medical attention and/or conditions for which weight loss and
             moderate physical activity would be inadvisable: diabetes not under active treatment,
             myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident within the last six months; unstable
             angina within the past six months; congestive heart failure; cancer requiring
             treatment in past five years (exception: non-melanoma skin cancer); serious infectious
             diseases (e.g., self-reported HIV); chronic hepatitis; cirrhosis; chronic
             malabsorption syndrome; chronic pancreatitis; chronic lung diseases that limit
             physical activity; orthopedic injuries or conditions that significantly limit physical
             activity.

          -  Conditions or behaviors likely to affect the conduct of the trial: unwilling or unable
             to give informed consent; unable to read English at the 5th grade level; unwilling to
             accept random assignment; unwilling or unable to travel to attend intervention (due to
             distance from clinic, work schedule or other scheduling conflicts); likely to relocate
             out of the service area in next 18 months.
