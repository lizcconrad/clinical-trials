  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
      effectiveness of a mobile phone application (app) developed by the VA National Center for
      PTSD (VA NCPTSD) for use by family members of those with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD). The primary objective of the proposed study is to assess whether family members of
      veterans with PTSD find the PTSD Family Coach app to be satisfactory and feasible to use.
      Secondary objectives are to determine if use of the app increases family members'
      self-efficacy and their ability to manage their own life stress, which may in part be the
      result of living with someone who has PTSD.

    <textblock>
      PTSD Family Coach is a mobile phone app for family members of individuals with PTSD. This
      application provides:

        -  education about PTSD

        -  a self-assessment tool measuring life stress

        -  self-management skills to address acute distress and stress

        -  direct connection to support and

        -  information about VA and community resources for family members of individuals with PTSD

      From this research, the investigators wish to learn whether family members of someone with
      PTSD find the PTSD Family Coach to be satisfactory and feasible to use. The investigators
      would also like to know if use of the app increases family members' knowledge of PTSD, and
      its treatment, and their ability to manage their own life stress, which may in part be the
      result of living with a Veteran with PTSD.

      Currently, there are very few resources for family members of Veterans with PTSD. If this
      research demonstrates that PTSD Family Coach is a promising tool for family members, it has
      the potential to address a tremendous unmet need using a very cost-effective, scalable
      solution.
