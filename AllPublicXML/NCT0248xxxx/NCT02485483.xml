  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to validate standardized questionnaires on depression for RA and
      to investigate the frequency of depression with RA. The study will include 2 parts, VADERA I
      and VADERA II. In VADERA I, 300 participants will be surveyed twice at an interval of 3
      months regarding their current emotional condition using standardized questionnaires. On the
      basis of the results of VADERA I, in VADERA II, the selected questionnaire will be used to
      assess the prevalence of depression with RA in approximately 1000 participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VADERA I is regarded as interventional epidemiologic study. The study was considered as
      interventional because of the use of the questionnaires and interview for the diagnosis of
      depression. VADERA II is a cross-sectional epidemiologic study.

    <description>The PHQ-9 is a self-reported questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms.This is a nine item measure with a response score for each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 27; with 0-4 being minimum indicating no depressive symptoms, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, 20-27 severe depression.</description>

    <description>BDI-II Scale is a 21-item self-reported questionnaire which measures the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Each of the 21 items on BDI-II tool represents a depressive symptom. The symptoms are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3 (0=symptom is absent; 3=symptom is severe). Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items. Total score ranges from 0-63; of which 0-8 is considered no depression, 0-13 is minimal depression, 14-19 is mild depression, 20-28 is moderate depression and 29-63 is severe depression.</description>

    <description>WHO-5 questionnaire contains five items related to cheerfulness, calmness, feelings of vigor, feelings of being well rested after sleep, and personal interest. The respondent rated each question on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;at no time&quot;) to 5 (&quot;all of the time&quot;) according to the proportion of time over the preceding 2 weeks that applied to the attribute in question. Scores were summated, with raw score ranging from 0 to 25. Then the scores were transformed to 0-100 by multiplying by 4, whereas 0 indicated the worst possible emotional well-being and 100 the best.</description>

    <description>The MADRS, an interview addressing 10 characteristics of depressive symptomatology, was used as the gold standard. The symptom-related information provided by each participant was rated on item-specific scales ranging from 0 (best) to 6 (worst) in order to evaluate individual symptom severity. Total score was sum of 10 characteristics, ranging from 0 to 60; 0, no depression; 60, severely depressed. Sum scores exceeding 12 indicated clinical relevance suggested mild to severe symptomatology.</description>

        <title>WHO-5 Index at Baseline: VADERA I</title>
        <description>WHO-5 questionnaire contains five items related to cheerfulness, calmness, feelings of vigor, feelings of being well rested after sleep, and personal interest. The respondent rated each question on a 6-point scale ranging from 0 (&quot;at no time&quot;) to 5 (&quot;all of the time&quot;) according to the proportion of time over the preceding 2 weeks that applied to the attribute in question. Scores were summated, with raw score ranging from 0 to 25. Then the scores were transformed to 0-100 by multiplying by 4, whereas 0 indicated the worst possible emotional well-being and 100 the best.</description>

        <title>PHQ-9 Summary Score: VADERA II</title>
        <description>The PHQ-9 is a self-reported questionnaire measuring depressive symptoms. This is a nine item measure with a response score for each item on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 27; with 0-4 being minimum indicating no depressive symptoms, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, 20-27 severe depression.</description>

        <description>BDI-II Scale is a 21-item self-reported questionnaire which measures the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Each of the 21 items on BDI-II tool represent a depressive symptom. The symptoms are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3 (0=symptom is absent; 3=symptom is severe). Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items. Total score ranges from 0-63; of which 0-8 is considered no depression, 0-13 is minimal depression, 14-19 is mild depression, 20-28 is moderate depression and 29-63 is severe depression.</description>
