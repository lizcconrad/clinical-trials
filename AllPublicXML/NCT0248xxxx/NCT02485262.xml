    <textblock>
      Chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the leading cause of advanced liver disease
      worldwide. The virus successfully evades host immune detection and has highly restricted
      requirements for growth in vitro that for many years hampered efforts to find a safe,
      uncomplicated, and reliable oral antiviral therapy. Ten years after discovery, pegylated
      interferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR) treatment for 24-48 weeks became the standard of care
      (1-5). PR therapy offered limited performance and availability across the diverse spectrum of
      HCV disease and was fraught with excessive and often limiting side effects. The first direct
      acting agents (DAAs) were protease inhibitors (PIs) that were introduced in 2011 and could
      only be used only in combination with PR because of concerns for rapid PI viral resistance.
      Although the first generation PIs added increased efficacy to the PR regimen, they also added
      new side effects and untoward drug interactions (6-8). Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a potent
      nucleoside inhibitor (NI) that has recently been approved for treatment of HCV. The drug has
      low toxicity, high resistance barrier, and minimal drug interactions with other HCV DAAs such
      as PIs and anti-NS5A agents. SOF is safe and effective across different viral genotypes,
      disease stages, and special patient groups such as those co-infected with HIV. When used in
      combination with ribavirin or another DAA, SOF has revolutionized the HCV treatment spectrum
      and set the stage for nearly universal HCV antiviral therapy. Sustained virologic response
      (SVR12) for SOF plus ribavirin and pegylated interferon (PR) is 90% for genotype 1 and 85-94%
      for genotypes 2 and 3 (9-16). SOF plus simeprevir (protease inhibitor) showed a 94% SVR12 for
      genotype 1 (9-16). More so than any other anti-HCV drug developed to date, SOF offers the
      widest applicability for all infected patients yet can be given in a personalized regimen to
      maximize performance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SOF plus simeprevir or PR became the backbone of HCV treatment. The demographics and
      characteristics of HCV patients in the Inland Empire are different than the cohort enrolled
      in SOF trials. There is a need to determine if the community based outcomes at match the
      outcome reported in the clinical trials.

      Aim of the study

      To propectively evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the SOF treatment regimens
      prescribed at the ARMC and compare them to outcomes reported in the clinical trials that were
      the basis for FDA approval.

      Study Description

      This is a prospective registry study conducted at the ARMC. Targeted subjects are HCV
      patients are ARMC who received one of the SOF based treatment regimens from December 20, 2013
      to December 19, 2014.

      Primary end Point is sustained virological response at 12 weeks (SVR 12) and secondary end
      point is compliance and safety. Safety and compliance will be determined based on symptoms
      reported during clinic visits and number of refills and doses dispensed for every patient.
