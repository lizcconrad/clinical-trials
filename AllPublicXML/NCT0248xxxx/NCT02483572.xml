  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with an intellectual disability often display severe destructive behavior (e.g.,
      aggression, self-injury) that pose risks to themselves or others and represent barriers to
      community integration. Destructive behaviors are often treated with behavioral interventions
      derived from a functional analysis, which is used to identify the antecedents and
      consequences that occasion and reinforce the destructive behavior. One treatment is called
      functional communication training (FCT), which involves extinction of destructive behavior
      and reinforcement of an alternative communication response with the consequence that
      previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from epidemiological studies and
      meta-analyses indicate that treatments based on functional analysis, like FCT, typically
      reduce destructive behavior by 90% or more and are more effective than other treatments.
      However, many if not all of these studies have used within-subject experimental designs to
      demonstrate control of the treatment effects. Replication of the effects of FCT is typically
      shown on a subject-by-subject basis with relatively small numbers of patients (e.g., one to
      four patients). No study has demonstrated the effectiveness of FCT for treatment of
      destructive behavior across a large group of children.

      The goal of this study is to compare FCT (which is used clinically with the majority of the
      investigators' patients and is considered best practice for treating destructive behavior
      that occurs for social reasons [e.g., to access attention, preferred toys, or to escape from
      unpleasant activities]) to a waitlist control group across a large number of children with
      destructive behavior to evaluate the generality of FCT effectiveness. The investigators will
      evaluate rates of destructive behavior with each patient during a pretest baseline and again
      following FCT (approximately four months later) and/or the waitlist control duration (again,
      approximately four months later). All children assigned to the waitlist-control condition
      will be offered FCT services by the investigators' clinic at the end of the four-month
      waitlist period. These children will again be tested following four months of FCT (i.e.,
      posttest). Therefore, children assigned to the FCT condition will be tested twice (one
      pretest and one posttest), and children assigned to the waitlist-control condition will be
      tested thrice (one pretest, a second pretest following a four-month waitlist period, and one
      posttest).

      The purpose of the current investigation is to evaluate the generality of FCT as treatment
      for severe destructive behavior. Again, the effectiveness of FCT in treating destructive
      behavior has been demonstrated repeatedly both in the investigators' clinic and in other
      clinics. The investigators are specifically interested in examining the percentage of this
      population that might benefit from FCT, as well as identifying the subject characteristics of
      children for whom FCT is and is not effective.

      Children with an intellectual disability often display severe destructive behaviors (e.g.,
      aggression, self-injury) that pose significant risks to self or others and represent
      overwhelming barriers to community integration. These destructive behaviors are often treated
      with behavioral interventions derived from a functional analysis, which is used to identify
      the environmental antecedents and consequences that occasion and reinforce the destructive
      behavior. One such treatment is called functional communication training (FCT), which
      involves extinction of destructive behavior and reinforcement of an alternative communication
      response with the consequence that previously reinforced destructive behavior. Results from
      epidemiological studies and meta-analyses indicate that treatments based on functional
      analysis, like FCT, typically reduce destructive behavior by 90% or more and are much more
      effective than other treatments. Despite these impressive findings, there have been no
      randomized, controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of FCT. The goal of this study is
      to determine the robustness of FCT in reducing severe destructive behavior as compared to a
      waitlist control group.

    <description>The investigators will measure the rate of destructive behavior prior to treatment and following successful treatment when implemented by participants' caregivers.

    <description>After measuring the control group participant's rate of functional communication responses after approximately 4 months, the investigators will implement FCT treatment and assess the rate of functional communication responses following the control group participant's successful treatment (approximately 32 weeks following initial baseline).

    <description>Participants assigned to the waitlist-control condition will not immediately receive services. These participants will be paired with an FCT-condition participant such that the no-treatment duration for these participants is yoked to the amount of time their respective FCT-condition participants receive services (e.g., most treatment last approximately 4 months, or 16 weeks); if Participant A finishes treatment in 16 weeks, Participant B will not receive treatment for at least 16 weeks for comparative measures). After the wait period, these participants will then receive the same services as those assigned to the immediate treatment (FCT Condition).</description>

    <intervention_name>Functional Communication Training</intervention_name>
    <description>Functional communication training (FCT) is the most widely used treatment for severe destructive behavior that is maintained by social reinforcement, such as access to attention, tangible items, or escape from nonpreferred activities. Once clinicians determine the functional reinforcer for destructive behavior, the clinician can then teach the child an appropriate, functionally-equivalent response (e.g., exchanging a card to access parental attention) and the clinician would no longer provide the functional reinforcer for destructive behavior.</description>
