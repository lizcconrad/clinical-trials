    <textblock>
      100 patients with postmenopausal bleeding were assessed with 2D vaginal ultrasound and 3D
      power Doppler ultrasound using the international endometrial tumor analysis group and office
      hysteroscopy with taking samples for histopathological analysis.

      The aim was to compare the efficiency of the upper mentioned interventions in diagnosing the
      cause of postmenopausal bleeding.

    <description>100 women with postmenopausal bleeding undergoing 2D greyscale vaginal ultrasound and 3D Endometrial power Doppler and the features were classified using six different vascular patterns described by IETA group including the following patterns; single dominant vessel without branching, with branching, multiple vessels with focal origin, with multifocal origin at the myometrium-endometrium junction, scattered vessels or circular flow (Kucur et al., 2013 ).
All patients then had Office hysteroscopy carried out in the outpatient clinic using vaginoscopic approach (Cooper et al., 2010). With endometrial samples from lesions or from the cavity for histopathological analysis.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  100 patients complaining of postmenopausal bleeding. Postmenopausal bleeding was
             defined as vaginal bleeding that occurred after at least 12 months of amenorrhea.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria included any history of hormone administration in the last 6
             months, any medical condition that might cause abnormal uterine bleeding like
             coagulation disorders, hypertension, cardiac disease, thyroid disorders or hepatic
             condition.
