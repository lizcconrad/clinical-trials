  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic activity of 3 different dosages of RO5186582 compared with placebo. A total
      of approximately 46 participants will be enrolled, in order to have at least 32 evaluable,
      and will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, with 9 children per
      treatment arm. The target ratio between 6-8 years and 9-11 years age groups is approximately
      1:1 in each treatment arm, with a minimum of 3 children per age group in each treatment arm.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Study was terminated due to data from another study showing no efficacy. There were no safety
    issues of concern.
