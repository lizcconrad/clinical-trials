  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational and sample collection study involving patients (alive or deceased)
      from several clinical trials who had received the investigational drug, olaparib in other
      research studies. There is no intervention given for this study.

      This research is being done to understand of the mechanisms involved in patients whose cancer
      responds well and whose cancer does not respond well to investigational drug, olaparib, to
      help better understand how olaparib works and to better identify patients who may benefit
      from this therapy.

      This is study will compare biomarker research with response in patients who have received
      olaparib.

      Patients who have had a durable response to olaparib for at least 2 years will be approached
      for the study.

      Patients who agree to this study will then have their medical history collected and will be
      asked to complete a questionnaire. Archival tumor tissue will also be collected for biomarker
      research.

      A waiver of consent is requested to access the medical records and archival tumor tissue of
      patients who are deceased.

      If participants are still taking olaparib, they will be asked to provide blood samples for
      pharmacokinetics and circulating tumor DNA, and the results of CT scans taken as part of
      their standard of care or as a part of another research study. If participants' disease
      worsens while still on olaparib, they will then be asked to provide a blood sample for
      pharmacogenomics and BRCA testing (if not known). An optional tumor biopsy will also be
      requested.

      Participants will continue to be followed by telephone for survival and any new treatments
      they are receiving.

               -  single agent olaparib given for relapsed disease or

          -  Had a durable response to Olaparib defined as patients who have benefited from

        Exclusion Criteria:
