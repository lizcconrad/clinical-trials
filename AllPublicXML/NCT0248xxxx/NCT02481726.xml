    <description>In patients in suspicion of lung cancer or lung tuberculosis; in patients with differential diagnosis difficulties; without treatment or surgery. They underwent a standard routine 18F-FDG PET/CT first, and were injected 10~20MBq 68Ga-Alfatide II in the next day, followed by whole body PET/CT acquisitions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must be able to provide a written informed consent

          -  Males and females, ≥18 years old.

          -  The definite diagnosis of lung cancer was established by pre-operational bronchoscopic
             or puncture biopsy or the definite diagnosis of lung tuberculomas was established on
             the basis of positive sputum culture examinations and confirmed by follow-up.

          -  Without any treatment or resection surgury.

          -  All the biopsies are done at least 10 days before PET/CT scans.

          -  Evaluation of cardiac function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females planning to bear a child recently or with childbearing potential；

          -  Known severe allergy or hypersensitivity to IV radiographic contrast；

          -  Inability to lie still for the entire imaging time because of cough, pain, etc.

          -  Inability to complete the needed examinations due to severe claustrophobia, radiation
             phobia, etc.

          -  Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable other medical disease that, in
             the opinion of the investigator, may significantly interfere with study compliance.
