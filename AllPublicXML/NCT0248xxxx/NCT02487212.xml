  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using ablative
      fractional laser- assisted topical corticosteroid delivery for the treatment of hypertrophic
      scar.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic scars are common conditions that cause persistent symptom and can lead to severe
      psychosocial impairment. Intralesional corticosteroid have been a mainstay in the treatment
      of hypertrophic scars. However, there are many disadvantages of corticosteroid injection such
      as severe pain, skin atrophy, skin thinning, steroid acne, telangiectasia and
      hypopigmentation.

      Recent reports propose new treatment methods for hypertrophic scars with the use of
      fractional ablative lasers to create zones of ablation of the skin that may assisted the
      penetration of drugs to the skin.
