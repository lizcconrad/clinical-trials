    <textblock>
      To assess the feasibility of conducting a larger cluster randomized controlled trial to
      facilitate the effectiveness of a complex Knowledge Translation (KT) intervention, i.e.
      implementation of multimodal care, into chiropractic clinical practice, designed to improve
      the management of patients with Non-Specific Neck Pain (NSNP) disorders.

      To evaluate feasibility, the investigators will ascertain how well participating
      chiropractors and patients adhere to the study protocol and will solicit feedback from them
      about the overall usefulness of the content and format of the KT intervention. This study
      will determine planning for the main study and also the outcomes to be used as a primary
      outcome.

      The aim of this pilot study project is to determine the feasibility of implementing a
      multifaceted KT intervention to promote the use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing
      patients with NSNP.

      Design: Cluster randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial. Chiropractors in private
      practice in Canada will be randomized to receive either a theory-based tailored KT
      intervention in the experimental group or simply a printed copy of the guideline in the
      control group.

      Study population and sample size: 30 chiropractors will be recruited from a random,
      nationally representative sample of 200 chiropractors. Each chiropractor will recruit five
      neck pain patients for a total of 150 patients.

      The design of the KT intervention was informed by the results of a related qualitative study
      (Theoretical Domains Framework interviews) and consists of a series of three webinars, two
      online case scenarios, a self-management video on Brief Action Planning (BAP) and a printed
      copy of the practice guideline (Bussières et al., 2015).

      Primary feasibility outcomes for both chiropractors and patients include rates of: 1)
      recruitment, 2) study retention, and 3) adherence to the intervention (Tickle-Degnen, 2013).
      A checklist of proxy measures embedded within patient encounter forms will be used to assess
      chiropractors' compliance with guideline recommendations e.g., exercise and self-care
      prescriptions, at study onset and at three months follow-up.

      Secondary outcomes include whether or not the chiropractor's recommended multimodal care,
      scores on measures of behavioural constructs e.g., self-efficacy, knowledge.

      Primary clinical outcomes for patients includes measures of pain intensity and neck
      pain-specific disability.

      Analyses from this pilot study will focus on generating point estimates and corresponding 95%
      confidence intervals for parameters of a priori interest (e.g., recruitment, retention,
      adherence, pain intensity, neck disability index).

      Discussion: The main strength of this study includes its use of a representative sample and
      randomized controlled design. The results of this study will inform the design of a larger
      cluster randomized controlled trial aimed at confirming the effectiveness and increasing the
      use of multimodal care by chiropractors managing patients with NSNP.

    <description>The main outcome of interest is feasibility that includes recruitment, retention, adherence to the study protocol and effectiveness potential.
Recruitment rate include: 1) eligibility rate (number of eligible chiropractors and patients divided by invited chiropractors or patients) and 2) participation rate (number agreeing to participate divided by eligible chiropractors or patients).
Retention rate: Number of chiropractors and patients who completed all outcome measures at baseline and at 3 month follow-up plus rate of completion of questionnaires by chiropractors (measures of behavioural constructs) and patients (clinical outcomes).
For chiropractors, rate of adherence includes attendance of all 3 webinars, associated quizzes, 2 clinical vignettes and the self-management learning module; For patients, rate of adherence includes follow-up visits, prescribed home exercise and physical activity.</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of three webinars followed by the quiz, two online case scenario and a video on BAP model plus a printed copy of Clinical Practice Guideline (CPGs) on NSNP.
After completing these modules and learning the key strategies, each chiropractor will recruit five neck pain patients and implement the strategies on their patients to measure the clinical outcomes for a follow-up of three months.
The control group will receive only a printed copy of CPGs. A checklist of proxy measures embedded within patient encounter forms will be used to assess chiropractors' compliance with guideline recommendations at study onset and at three months.</description>

             information sheet, complete the consent form, and respond to the
             telephone-administered questionnaire. This will be assessed by the staff member of
             each chiropractor's team at the time of screening; and
