  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) have a number of known class effects including
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis suppression. Although the safety of inhaled
      Fluticasone Furoate (FF) on the HPA axis of adults and adolescent asthmatic patients has been
      established, it is important to assess the risk of suppression in children so as to establish
      whether this medicine can be safely used in this young population. This study aims to
      evaluate the effect of inhaled FF on the HPA axis of children 5-11 years of age (inclusive)
      with persistent asthma compared with placebo. Approximately 143 subjects will be enrolled.
      Subjects will enter a 7 to 14 day run-in period on oral montelukast 4 milligrams (mg) (5 year
      old subjects) or 5 mg (6-11 year old subjects) once daily. Eligible subjects will be
      randomized to receive once-daily FF inhalation powder 50 micrograms (mcg) or once-daily
      placebo inhalation powder in the morning via the ELLIPTA™ inhaler for 42 days. Subjects will
      continue to receive open label montelukast during the treatment period. All subjects will be
      provided albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol, to use as needed to treat acute asthma
      symptoms throughout the study.

    <measure>Change From Baseline (Expressed as a Ratio) in 0-24 Hour Weighted Mean Serum Cortisol at the End of the Six Week Treatment Period (D 42) in Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, D 0 (Pre-dose, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 12hr, 16hr and 24hr) and Day 42 (0hr, 2hr, 4hr, 8hr, 16hr and 24hr)</time_frame>
    <description>The blood samples for statistical analysis of serum cortisol (SC) endpoints were collected on D 0 and D 42 at the indicated time points. The weighted mean was calculated by dividing the area under the curve (AUC) over the 24-hour (hr) time period by the time period. Change from Baseline in 0-24 hr weighted mean SC was calculated as a ratio from Baseline defined as the SC weighted mean (0-24 hours) at Week 6 divided by the Baseline SC weighted mean (0-24 hours).The ratio from Baseline was loge transformed prior to analysis. The loge transformed ratios were compared between treatment groups as treatment ratios, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, allowing for the effects of Baseline (loge transformed), age, sex and region. Treatment ratios for comparison was calculated by back-transforming the difference between the Least square (LS) means. Using the pooled estimate of variance, 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was calculated for the difference.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Eligible participants (par.) aged between 5 to 11 years with asthma were enrolled to either receive fluticasone furoate (FF) or placebo by inhalation through ELLIPTA for 6 weeks (wks) (42 days (D)). A total of 156 par. were screened, of which 111 par. were randomized in the study.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Par. receiving non-corticosteroid controller and/or short-acting beta 2-agonist (SABA) therapy were screened for the study. Par. went through a Run-in Period of 7 to 14 D before the 6 Wk Treatment Period.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline (Expressed as a Ratio) in 0-24 Hour Weighted Mean Serum Cortisol at the End of the Six Week Treatment Period (D 42) in Intention-to-treat (ITT) Population</title>
        <description>The blood samples for statistical analysis of serum cortisol (SC) endpoints were collected on D 0 and D 42 at the indicated time points. The weighted mean was calculated by dividing the area under the curve (AUC) over the 24-hour (hr) time period by the time period. Change from Baseline in 0-24 hr weighted mean SC was calculated as a ratio from Baseline defined as the SC weighted mean (0-24 hours) at Week 6 divided by the Baseline SC weighted mean (0-24 hours).The ratio from Baseline was loge transformed prior to analysis. The loge transformed ratios were compared between treatment groups as treatment ratios, using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, allowing for the effects of Baseline (loge transformed), age, sex and region. Treatment ratios for comparison was calculated by back-transforming the difference between the Least square (LS) means. Using the pooled estimate of variance, 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was calculated for the difference.</description>

          <description>The blood samples for statistical analysis of serum cortisol (SC) endpoints were collected on D 0 and D 42 at the indicated time points. The weighted mean was calculated by dividing the area under the curve (AUC) over the 24-hour (hr) time period by the time period.

        <title>Change From Baseline (Expressed as a Ratio) in 24-hour 6-beta Hydroxycortisol Excretion at the End of the Six Week Treatment Period (Day 42).</title>
        <description>The 24 hr urinary 6-beta hydroxycortisol excretion was collected over a 24 hour period on Day 0 and Day 42. Change from baseline in 24- hr urinary 6-beta hydroxycortisol excretion was calculated as a ratio from baseline defined as 24-hr urinary 6-beta hydroxycortisol excretion at Week 6 divided by the baseline 24-hr urinary 6-beta hydroxycortisol excretion. The ratio from baseline was loge transformed prior to analysis. The loge transformed ratio was compared between treatment groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, allowing for the effects of baseline (loge transformed), age, sex and region. Treatment ratios for comparison was calculated by back-transforming the difference between the Least square (LS) means. Using the pooled estimate of variance, 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) was calculated for the difference. Participants with 24-hr urinary cortisol excretion at baseline and Week 6 were analyzed.</description>
