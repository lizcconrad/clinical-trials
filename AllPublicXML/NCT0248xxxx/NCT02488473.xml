      Brief Summary: The aim of this trial is to investigate if dexmedetomidine prolongs the
      duration of an adductor canal block. By using healthy volunteers the investigators can
      perform a bilateral adductor canal block and thereby control for a systemic effect to clarify
      if the effect is actually peripheral or systemic. The investigators hypothesis is that
      dexmedetomidine as an adjunct to a local anaesthetic prolongs the duration of a peripheral
      nerve block by a peripheral mechanism.

      Background:

      Efficient pain management promoting mobilization and convalescence is essential in an ideal
      perioperative course. Regional nerve blocks are a central element in postoperative regimes
      for many patients and it is therefore important that these nerve blocks are both long lasting
      and efficient. This trial will investigate whether it is possible to optimize the
      postoperative pain management when adding dexmedetomidine to the local anaesthetic
      ropivacaine in peripheral nerve blocks.

      The prolonging effect of using dexmedetomidine as adjunct in peripheral nerve blocks have
      been investigated in several studies. However, it remains uncertain whether the effect is
      mediated by a systemic-, a peripheral- or a combined systemic/peripheral mechanism. In this
      trial the adjuvating effect of dexmedetomidine will be investigated using the adductor canal
      block. This is a nerve block that besides being efficient as pain treatment after knee
      surgery, is primarily sensory, and therefore augments mobilization after total knee
      arthroplasty.

      Method:

      On the trial day the volunteers will receive bilateral adductor canal blocks. In one thigh
      they will receive the local anaesthetic ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml and placebo (saline) and in
      the other thigh ropivacaine 20ml 5mg/ml and dexmedetomidine 100μg. The allocation is blinded
      to volunteer and investigator.

      The duration of the nerve block will be measured by five different tests: Temperature test,
      Pinprick, Pain during tonic heat stimulation, Warmth detection threshold and pain detection
      threshold. All tests are validated within pain research.
