      This study aims to compare the efficacy of afatinib maintenance with pemetrexed maintenance
      following induction therapy with platinum/ pemetrexed in patients with metastatic epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progressing after
      first-line treatment with afatinib with respect to progression-free survival.

      This is a randomized, open-label, phase II study of maintaining pan-ERBB blockade following
      platinum-based induction chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutated, metastatic NSCLC
      progressing after first-line treatment with afatinib.

      Patients who have progressed after first-line treatment with afatinib will be screened while
      receiving an induction phase which consists of at least three but not more than four cycles
      of cisplatin/carboplatin plus pemetrexed given in 21-day cycles. Patients who do not progress
      (i.e. complete or partial response, or stable disease - CR, PR or SD) after completion of
      three or four cycles induction chemotherapy will then be randomized (1:1 ratio) to receive
      maintenance therapy with either afatinib (40 mg/d, or last dose if reduced during first-line
      treatment) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m² every 21 days, or 375 mg/m² if dose was reduced during
      induction therapy) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or patient consent
      withdrawal.

         12. Any history of or concomitant condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the patient's ability to comply with the study or interfere with the

             significant pleural effusions or ascites if clinically indicated. However, per SmPC of
