      insulin of a replicate single dose of Afrezza inhaled Technosphere Insulin (TI) in T1DM
      patients in a euglycemic clamp setting.

      To characterize the within-subject variability in the metabolic activity (pharmacodynamic
      [PD]) of a replicate single dose of Afrezza inhaled TI in T1DM patients in a euglycemic clamp
      setting.

          -  Body weight between 50 and 95 kg, inclusive, body mass index between 18.5 and 29
             kg/m², inclusive.

          -  Fasting serum C-peptide &lt;0.3 nmol/L.

          -  Glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤75 mmol/mol (≤9%).

          -  Stable insulin regimen for at least 2 months prior to study (with respect to safety of
             the patient and scientific integrity of the study).

          -  Certified as otherwise healthy for T1DM patient by assessment of medical history and
             physical examination (cardiovascular system, chest and lungs, thyroid, abdomen,
             nervous system, skin and mucosae, and musculoskeletal system), unless the Investigator
             considers any abnormality to be clinically irrelevant and not interfering with the
             conduct of the study (with respect to safety of the subject and scientific integrity
             of the study).

          -  Normal vital signs after at least 10 minutes resting in supine position:

               -  95 mmHg &lt;systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt;150 mmHg.

               -  45 mmHg &lt;diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;95 mmHg.

               -  50 bpm &lt;heart rate (HR) &lt;90 bpm.

          -  Normal standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) after at least 10 minutes resting in

             female.

          -  Laboratory parameters within the normal range (or defined screening threshold for the
             Investigator site), unless the Investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically
             irrelevant for diabetes patients; however serum creatinine should be strictly below
             the upper laboratory norm; alkaline phosphatase, hepatic enzymes (aspartate
             aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and total bilirubin (unless the patient
             has documented Gilbert syndrome) should not be above 1.5 x upper limit of normal
             (ULN).

          -  Women of childbearing potential (less than 2 years postmenopausal or not surgically
             sterile for more than 3 months), must have a negative serum beta-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (β-HCG) pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine β-HCG pregnancy
             test at Day 1 in all treatment periods (TPs) and must use a highly effective method of
             birth control, which is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (ie, less
             than 1% per year) according to the Note for guidance on nonclinical safety studies for
             the conduct of human clinical trials for pharmaceuticals (CPMP/ICH/286/95,

             use 2 independent methods of contraception, eg, diaphragm and spermicide-coated
             condom. The use of a condom and spermicidal creams is not sufficiently reliable. For
             postmenopausal women with presence of less than 2 years post menopausal, and not
             surgically sterile for more than 3 months, the hormonal status will be determined
             (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt;30 IU/L).
