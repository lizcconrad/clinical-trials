      Rationale:

      Radiation induced cardiac toxicity after treatment for intrathoracic tumours is a clinically
      relevant problem. So far, no clinical prediction models exist for cardiac toxicity. In
      particular, the relationship between radiation dose parameters and the risk of cardiac
      toxicity remains to be determined.

      Clinical prediction models for cardiac toxicity are difficult to obtain, e.g. due to long
      latency time. Therefore, objective surrogate markers, for cardiac toxicity such as NT pro BNP
      and hs-TNT, as obtained during and after treatment may be of great value.

      Objective:

      The main objective to find a correlation between the rise in NT pro BNP level and the
      radiation dose given to the heart.

    <description>A new diagnosis of: heart failure, myocardial infarction or a newly diagnosed rhythm disorder will be scored as a cardiac event. Myocardial ischaemia requiring intervention and changes in cardiac medication in case of deterioration of known heart failure will be analysed by a cardiologist to decide whether or not to score this as an event. Events will be scored according the CTCAE 4.2 criteria.</description>
