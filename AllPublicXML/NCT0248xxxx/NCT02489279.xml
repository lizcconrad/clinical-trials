  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of different types of cognitive training
      on attention in adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using mobile
      software on personal mobile devices.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different types of software-based cognitive training are thought to impact attention via
      different mechanisms. This study examines the nature of the effects on sustained attention of
      two different types of mobile software based training. Because the nature of the training
      method is behavioral, the investigators can not divulge the differences in the training
      methods and their hypothesized differences in their impact on attention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet established DSM-5 criteria for ADHD predominately inattentive or combined subtype
             with clinically significant levels of impairment, diagnosed by structured clinical
             interview, the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and corroborating
             information

          2. Clinical Global Impression—Severity (CGI-S) score ≥ 4 for ADHD

          3. No lifetime history of DSM-5 bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder, pervasive
             developmental disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance abuse, or substance
             dependence (except nicotine) as assessed wit the MINI

          4. Able in the opinion of the investigator to complete all required study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of diagnosis of childhood disorder other than ADHD (e.g. autism, dyslexia)

          2. History of any general medical condition likely to require chronic use of medication
             with identified CNS effects suspected to alter cognitive performance

          3. History of seizure disorder, brain tumor, other major neurological disorder or head
             injury resulting in loss of consciousness

          4. Serious oxygen deprivation

          5. Current psychopathology requiring ongoing treatment with antipsychotic medications,
             mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, or anticonvulsants

          6. Current untreated psychopathology which is rated to be primary in terms of severity
             (greater than ADHD severity)

          7. Current treatment with guanfacine.
