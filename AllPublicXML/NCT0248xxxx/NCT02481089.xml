  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warburg effect is an important feature of tumors,and genetic variation is one of the main
      factors of individual differences to radiotherapy treatment response for nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma(NPC). Through the previous work investigators found that the p53 codon72 (Pro/Arg)
      was related to the prognosis of NPC; Using the method of proteomics, investigators discovered
      glycolysis related gene such as PGK1, ALDOA，was associated with radiosensitivity.Thus,with
      all the previous work,investigators hypothesize that the key gene polymorphisms in glycolytic
      pathway, such as p53 , influence the glycolytic pathway,which leads to differences in
      radiosensitivity of NPC. This projects will include 600 cases of patients with NPC to detect
      common glycolytic key genes polymorphisms. Besides,investigators correlate these factors with
      their radiosensitivity and prognosis.Then, prediction model will be established, and
      validation of the prediction model will be done. Using enzyme-labeling instrument ，comet
      assay and clonogenic assay，cytological experiments will further investigate the influence of
      key gene polymorphisms on the glycolysis efficiency and mechanism of radiation
      sensitivity.Thus,investigators could provide theoretical basis of individualized treatment
      for NPC.
