  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data suggest, that not only sugar-based, but also artificially sweetened soft
      drinks may play a role in the development of diabetes.

      Recent studies in animals and humans have shown, that artificial sweeteners (AS) influence
      metabolic responses after glucose ingestion, possibly alter the intestinal microbiome and
      even modulate incretin release.

      Data on human subjects are sparse and controversial, especially in a long-term manner. We
      therefore conduct a cross-over study to assess metabolic response to sweetened vs.
      non-sweetened soft drinks, which are consumed over a period of 4 weeks.
