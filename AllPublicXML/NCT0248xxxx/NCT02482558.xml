    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a one week high versus low glycaemic
      index dietary intervention on hepatic glycogen and lipid levels and blood hormone levels in a
      two way cross overs study and to see if there is any correlation between this and satiety or
      appetite.

      8 Healthy subject will be scanned the start and end of a 7 day high versus low glycaemic in
      diet with a 4 week washout between arms. During scan days the hepatic glycogen response to a
      corresponding high versus low glycaemic index test meal will be measured using 13C Magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to explore any acute changes in metabolic response. Baseline
      liver lipid levels will be measured using 1H MRS to explore any long term changes in liver
      lipid levels.

      Blood samples will also be obtained throughout the test day to measure for blood glucose,
      insulin and blood hormone response. Satiety surveys will also be taken throughout the test
      day and during the diet week.

      The main hypothesis is that a one week calorie matched Glycaemic index varied diet will
      result in an altered response of liver glycogen levels acutely following a meal and also
      longer term hepatic liver lipid levels. A secondary hypothesis is that there will also be
      associated changes in blood sugar and hormone levels and that all these changes will have an
      effect on satiety levels in subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver glycogen</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Liver glycogen content was determined by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using the distinct 13C signals from the glycogen polymer. The glycogen signal resonates at 101.4 ppm, and was calibrated using an external reference peak situated in the centre of the coil (175ppm) and quantified with reference to an ex vivo glycogen acquisition.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Liver lipids</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Liver lipid content was determined by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using the distinct 1H signals from the fatty acid. The peak area of the main chain CH2 peak at 1.3ppm was calibrated using the water peak at 4.7ppm as an internal reference, corrected for T2 relaxation, and quantified using biological parameters.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood glucose</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were cannulated at the start of the test day by research nurses and samples taken regularly for blood glucose. Blood glucose levels were measured approximately every 20 minutes for the first 3 hours of the feeding trial, and then hourly after up to 5 hours. 0.1 ml samples were drawn into plastic fluoride/oxalate glucose preservation tubes and were assessed at the University of Nottingham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety ratings</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>During the experiment subjects filled out satiety questionnaires using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) by answering each of five mixed appetite questions - &quot;1. How hungry do you feel&quot;, &quot;2. How satisfied do you feel&quot;, &quot;3. How full do you feel?&quot;, &quot;4. How strong is your desire to eat&quot; and &quot;5. How much do you think you can eat?&quot;. Subjects indicated their response by making a vertical mark on a horizontal scale between 1 and 10 every 20 minutes throughout the test day, and also before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner on days 1, 4 and 7 of the diet week.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood hormones</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were cannulated at the start of the test day by research nurses and samples taken regularly for blood hormones. Blood hormone levels were measured every 20 minutes for the first 3 hours, and then hourly after up to 5 hours. 0.5 ml samples for analysis of hormone levels were drawn into Becton-Dickinson P800 tubes and were analyzed at Unilever R&amp;D Colworth using multiplex assay kits from Millipore. The hormones assayed were Amylin, CCK, Ghrelin, Glucagon, GLP-1, GIP, Insulin, Leptin, PP and PYY.</description>
