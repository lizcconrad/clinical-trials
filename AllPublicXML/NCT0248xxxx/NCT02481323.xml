      Phase II pilot randomised, factorial, short term dose escalation, open label, blinded
      intermediary endpoint trial, in two hospital centres in the UK, of tolerability and safety of
      cilostazol, isosorbide mononitrate, both or neither in patients with small vessel disease
      manifest as symptomatic small subcortical stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A quarter of all ischaemic strokes are lacunar (small vessel) in type, about 35000 per annum
      in the United Kingdom, and due to an intrinsic, non-atheromatous, non-cardioembolic
      perforating cerebral arteriolar disease. 'Small vessel disease' also affects the brain
      diffusely, causing up to 40% of dementias, alone or mixed with Alzheimer's disease, 350,000+
      patients estimated currently in the United Kingdom. There is no proven treatment:
      conventional antiplatelet drugs may be ineffective or even hazardous, antihypertensive
      treatment and statins have been disappointing. The disease mechanism is poorly understood but
      endothelial dysfunction, blood-brain barrier failure and vessel stiffness appear to
      contribute to the pathogenesis. Promising data available for licensed drugs with relevant
      modes of action, cilostazol (&gt;6000 stroke patients in the Asia Pacific region) and isosorbide
      mononitrate (ISMN, widely used in cardiac disease) support their testing in small vessel
      disease. This trial will be a phase 2, randomised, dose-escalation, factorial trial to test
      short-term administration of cilostazol, Isosorbide Mononitrate, both, or neither, to provide
      data on patient tolerability of dose (including headache, dizziness), safety (including blood
      pressure, platelet function), provide mechanistic evidence of efficacy (cerebrovascular
      reactivity, arterial compliance), and to inform the design of a larger phase 2-3 trial. The
      trial will recruit 60 patients with small vessel disease, in two expert stroke centres
      (Edinburgh and Nottingham) where there are suitable patients, expert stroke centres,
      established trials infrastructures and neuroimaging and platelet testing expertise. The trial
      will also advance methods to stratify patients by small vessel disease burden in routine
      practise and data on intermediary mechanistic outcomes to assist in planning future trials
      testing novel agents for either stroke or dementia.
