  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study will be to evaluate the impact of this individualized practical training
      on efficacy (evaluated by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Body Surface Area
      (BSA) score performed by a physician blinded to the study groups) and adherence (calculated
      as days wherein gel was applied and as BSA/weight of gel applied rate) to a 4 week long
      treatment with dovobet gel. On the other hand, the investigators will evaluate in both groups
      as demographic (as sex, age, job,..) or disease (as severity, duration, impact of quality of
      life,..) characteristics influence the adherence to the treatment.
