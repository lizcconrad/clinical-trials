  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine the effect of almond consumption (0.9g/kg dose) compared to an
      energy and weight matched comparator food or no food on measures of appetite control
      including appetite sensations, energy intake and food hedonics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some individuals exhibit a weak satiety response to food and may be susceptible to
      overconsumption. Snack foods can be substantial contributors to daily energy intake, with
      different types of snacks exerting potentially different effects on satiety per calorie
      consumed. The current study will compare the effect of consuming different snack foods on
      measures of appetite control including appetite sensations, energy intake and food hedonics
      in women with a weak satiety response.

      In a crossover design, female participants will consume three different mid-morning snacks:
      raw almonds, savoury crackers or water. Appetite sensations, energy intake, food reward and
      craving will be assessed under controlled laboratory conditions. Satiety responsiveness will
      be determined using the satiety quotient (SQ).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Test Meal Energy Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured reductions in ad-libitum energy intake following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator. Food will be weighed pre- and post-consumption to the nearest 0.1g to determine energy intake. Test meal energy intake will be measured on three occasions, on average a week apart.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Food Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured changes in wanting for high fat food food following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator.
Food preference will be measured once during each intervention condition using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ: Finlayson, King &amp; Blundell, 2008).
8 high fat foods and 8 low fat foods are presented on a computer and participants rate the extent to which they want each food (How much do you want this food now?). The food images are presented individually, in a randomised order and participants make their ratings using a 100-mm VAS. Low fat scores are subtracted from high fat scores to provide a relative preference score.
Scale range: -100 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater wanting for high fat foods which is interpreted as a worse outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Appetite Sensations (Hunger)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured differences in hunger following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator.
Appetite sensations will be measured during the three intervention conditions at regular time intervals from the morning to the evening (21 in total) using 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS).
Scale range = 0-100 mm, with higher values indicating greater hunger. Total Area Under the Curve will be calculated from the VAS profiles using the trapeziodal method.
Time points at which data were collected to calculate AUC - -5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 135, 180, 230, 240, 270, 280, 300, 360, 420, 480, 510, 540, 600; -5 to 8 hours post intervention.
Higher AUC scores on hunger are interpreted as a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>24 Hour Energy Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>3 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured reductions in total within-day energy intake following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator. Food will be weighed pre- and post-consumption to the nearest 0.1g, at every test meal, to determine energy intake. Total energy intake will then be calculated. 24 hour energy intake will be measured on three occasions, on average a week apart.</description>

        <title>Food Preference</title>
        <description>Measured changes in wanting for high fat food food following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator.
Food preference will be measured once during each intervention condition using the Leeds Food Preference Questionnaire (LFPQ: Finlayson, King &amp; Blundell, 2008).
8 high fat foods and 8 low fat foods are presented on a computer and participants rate the extent to which they want each food (How much do you want this food now?). The food images are presented individually, in a randomised order and participants make their ratings using a 100-mm VAS. Low fat scores are subtracted from high fat scores to provide a relative preference score.
Scale range: -100 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater wanting for high fat foods which is interpreted as a worse outcome.</description>

        <description>Measured differences in hunger following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator.
Appetite sensations will be measured during the three intervention conditions at regular time intervals from the morning to the evening (21 in total) using 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS).
Scale range = 0-100 mm, with higher values indicating greater hunger. Total Area Under the Curve will be calculated from the VAS profiles using the trapeziodal method.
Time points at which data were collected to calculate AUC - -5, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 135, 180, 230, 240, 270, 280, 300, 360, 420, 480, 510, 540, 600; -5 to 8 hours post intervention.
Higher AUC scores on hunger are interpreted as a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>24 Hour Energy Intake</title>
        <description>Measured reductions in total within-day energy intake following consumption of almonds as a mid-morning snack compared to control and comparator. Food will be weighed pre- and post-consumption to the nearest 0.1g, at every test meal, to determine energy intake. Total energy intake will then be calculated. 24 hour energy intake will be measured on three occasions, on average a week apart.</description>
