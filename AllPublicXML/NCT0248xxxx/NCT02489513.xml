  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to characterize the absorption, metabolism, and excretion of AG-120
      using radiolabeled drug in healthy adult male subjects to support its further development and
      registration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, open-label, study in healthy adult males. Each subject will
      participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up
      period. Subjects who have met all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria at
      screening will return to the clinical site on Day -1 for baseline assessments. Following a 10
      hour overnight fast, subjects will receive a single 500mg dose of AG-120 suspension
      containing a microtracer of [14C] AG-120 (~ 200 μCi) under fasted conditions. The study drug
      will be administered as an oral suspension with approximately 240 mL of room temperature,
      non-carbonated water.

      Blood, urine, and fecal samples (and vomitus, if applicable) will be collected throughout the
      study for pharmacokinetic (PK), mass balance, and/or clinical laboratory assessments. Safety
      will be monitored throughout the study. Subjects will be discharged from the clinical site
      from Day 22 to Day 29, depending on the recovery of eliminated radioactivity.

      Urine and fecal samples will be collected each day until Day 29 (or the point of discharge if
      earlier) for measurement of total [14C] radioactivity. Blood samples for radioanalysis and PK
      assessment, inclusive of metabolite profiling/characterization, will be collected at pre-dose
      and at specified intervals through Day 29. Total [14C]-radioactivity in whole blood, plasma,
      urine, and feces (and vomitus, if applicable ) will be determined.

      Up to 8 subjects will enroll in the study. One to two additional subjects who have been
      confirmed as having poor metabolizer (PM) CYP2D6 genotype may be enrolled.

             assessments/procedures are conducted

          3. Is willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements

          4. Is willing to provide a blood sample for genotyping of CYP2D6 status at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric
             illness that would prevent the subject from participating in the study

          2. Any condition, including the presence of clinically significant laboratory
             abnormalities, which places the subject at unacceptable risk if he were to participate
             in the study
