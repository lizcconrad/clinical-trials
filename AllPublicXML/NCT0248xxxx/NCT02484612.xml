    <textblock>
      Acute exercise has been shown to affect subsequent energy intake in obese adolescents.
      Indeed, it has been shown several times that an intensive bout of exercise (above 70% of the
      individual maximal capacities) can reduce energy intake at the following meal in obese
      adolescents, with no modification of his appetite feelings.

      Although this results has been replicated several times, it remains unknown if those
      nutritional adaptations are due to post-exercise modifications of some gastro-peptides
      implicated in appetite control, as detailed in adults.

      The aim of this work is to question whether or not post-exercise energy intake is explained
      by appetite-regulating hormones that are affected by the exercise bout in both lean and obese
      youth.

      After an first medical visit to ensure that the adolescents have the ability to complete the
      whole study, the participants will have to complete several clinical examinations:

        -  anthropometric measurements

        -  Body composition assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry

        -  Maximal aerobic test

      They will then randomly complete the following conditions:

        -  CON: a control day without exercise;

        -  HIE: an exercise day with an exercise set at 75% of the capacities

        -  LIE: an exercise day with an exercise set at 40% of the capacities

      The exercises or the rest condition will be done by the end of the morning and a buffet meal
      will be proposed during which the participants will be asked to eat as much as wanted.

      Blood samples will be drawn before, after, 15 after and 30 minutes after the exercise to
      assess the main appetite regulating hormones involved in appetite regulation (PYY,
      Cholecystokinin ...) appetite feelings will be assessed throughout the day at regular
      interval using visual analogue scales.
