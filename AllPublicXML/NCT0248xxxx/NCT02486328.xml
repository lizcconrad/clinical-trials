  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different sedation regimes for lower GIS endoscopy which can be administered by
      anesthesiologists and non-anesthesiologists. This study aims to compare the effects of
      propofol/remifentanil combination and midazolam/meperidine combination on early cognitive
      function following lower GIS endoscopies.

      Sedation for lower GIS endoscopies can be administered by anesthesiologists or endoscopists
      and cognitive dysfunction after this procedure has not been fully investigated. The aim of
      this study was to investigate the effect of different sedation regimes applied by
      anesthesiologists or endoscopists on early cognitive dysfunction. Following ethics committee
      approval and written informed consent, 100 patients were randomly divided into two groups. In
      Group MM where drug regime was solely determined by endoscopists, 2 mg midazolam and 20mg
      meperidine was given intravenously and additional 1-2mg midazolam and 20mg meperidine (wtih a
      maximum total of 5 mg midazolam and 50 mg meperidine) was given when FPS was greater than 3.
      In Group RP where drug regime was solely determined by anesthesiologists, 100 mcg/kg/min
      propofol infusion and 1 mcg/kg remifentanil bolus was administered and additional 0,5 mcg/kg
      remifentanil bolus was given when FPS was greater than 3. BIS and hemodynamic monitorization
      was carried out throughout the procedure and BIS 60-80 with FPS&lt;3 was targeted. The time to
      OAAS score to reach 3 was measured after the procedure and TNT and DSST was repeated at 5th,
      15th and 30th minutes.
