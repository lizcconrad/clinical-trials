      The proposed pilot community-based research project will examine the feasibility,
      acceptability, and potential efficacy of the Storytelling intervention compared with usual
      care in hypertension control among rural residents in 4 communities in Vietnam. This is a
      major clinical and public health problem in this developing country.
