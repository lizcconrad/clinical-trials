      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intrathecal
      administration of allogeneic umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells to patients with
      spinal cord injury.

      Spinal cord injury(SCI) is a common severe traumatic central nervous system damage. And now
      the treatment of SCI is still a worldwide problem in clinic. How to improve the curative
      effect of SCI and restore the limb nerve function as far as possible are becoming the key
      problems in the clinical treatment of SCI. The current treatments for spinal cord injury
      mainly include surgical treatment, medical therapy, physical therapy, preventing the
      complications after injury, but these treatments can only make some clinical improvement in
      patients, most patients will also face severe nerve dysfunction. Animal experiments and
      clinical researches in recent years have reported using umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells
      (UC-MSCs) transplantation to treat spinal cord injury, this provides a new approach of SCI
      treatment, but its efficacy remains controversial, and lacking of high credible prospective
      cohort clinical trial evidence to support.

      In this study, completely or incompletely cervical, thoracic spinal cord injury participants
      were recruited to join in a prospective, cohort clinical trials. Intervention is subarachnoid
      injection of human allogeneic UC-MSCs and the main evaluation index is American spinal injury
      association (ASIA) score, secondary evaluation indicator is electromyogram and
      electroneurophysiologic test.

      A monocenter prospective cohort study will be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of
      UC-MSCs, for the treatment of completely or incompletely spinal cord injury. The primary
      outcome is American spinal injury association (ASIA) score at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months, 12 and 24 months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes of the study include the number
      of participants with adverse events at 1 month post-treatment, electromyogram and
      electroneurophysiologic test at baseline, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12 and 24 months
      post-treatment.

      On the basis of the results of this trial investigators will, for the first time, have
      scientific evidence as to the relative safety and efficacy of UC-MSCs transplantation for the
      treatment of spinal cord injury.
