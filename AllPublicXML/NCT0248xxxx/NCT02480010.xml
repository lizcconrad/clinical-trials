  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) pertuzumab in
      participants with hormone-refractory prostate cancer who have had no previous chemotherapy.
      Participants will be enrolled in two stages, the first (Cohort A) at a lower 420-mg dose and
      the second (Cohort B) at a higher 1050-mg dose based upon observations in Cohort A. Up to 50
      participants may enter either cohort, for a total enrollment between 46 and 73 participants
      across 9 study centers.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed, Objective Response, Non-Response or Progressive Disease by PSA Levels Within the First 24 Weeks of Treatment With Pertuzumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Every 3 weeks up to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Objective PSA response rate was determined according to Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) guidelines. All participants achieving a drop in PSA of greater than or equal to (≥) 50 percent (%) from baseline (confirmed with a second value at least 4 weeks later) fulfilled the criteria of a PSA response. The confirmatory second value had to be at least 50% lower than baseline, but could be higher than the first drop in PSA. Confirmatory value could not be 50% higher compared to first drop in PSA. The date of response was the date the first 50% (or greater) decline was observed. Progressive disease (PD) was defined by a minimum of three consecutive serum PSA measurements obtained at least 7 days apart within the previous 3 months of start of trial, which documented progressively increasing values. Non-response was defined as neither PD nor Response.</description>

    <description>Overall objective response by RECIST criteria (CR or PR) was to be defined for participants who had measurable disease at baseline or developed new lesions post-baseline. The longest diameter only for all target lesions was measured and the following responses recorded: CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter as compared to the baseline sum longest diameter.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Without Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, Weeks 3, 6, 9 and 12</time_frame>

    <measure>Time to Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 3 weeks up to a maximum of 18 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Time to Treatment Failure was time to the first documentation of progressive disease, day of death while on study (or 30 days after withdrawing from the trial) or day of early discontinuation due to toxicity (adverse events or abnormal laboratory value), refusal of treatment/refusing to cooperate/withdrawing consent, insufficient therapeutic response, or failure to return, whichever is earliest, after the start of treatment. Participants who did not experience any of the above events while on study were censored on the day of their last PSA or tumor measurement, whichever was later.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed, Objective Response, Non-Response or Progressive Disease by PSA Levels Within the First 24 Weeks of Treatment With Pertuzumab</title>
        <description>Objective PSA response rate was determined according to Prostate Specific Antigen Working Group (PSAWG) guidelines. All participants achieving a drop in PSA of greater than or equal to (≥) 50 percent (%) from baseline (confirmed with a second value at least 4 weeks later) fulfilled the criteria of a PSA response. The confirmatory second value had to be at least 50% lower than baseline, but could be higher than the first drop in PSA. Confirmatory value could not be 50% higher compared to first drop in PSA. The date of response was the date the first 50% (or greater) decline was observed. Progressive disease (PD) was defined by a minimum of three consecutive serum PSA measurements obtained at least 7 days apart within the previous 3 months of start of trial, which documented progressively increasing values. Non-response was defined as neither PD nor Response.</description>

The AUC0-infinity is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to infinity (the time of complete elimination of the drug).

          <title>Area Under the Concentration Curve Extrapolated to Infinity (AUC0-Inf) of Pertuzumab</title>
          <description>The area under the plot of plasma concentration of drug against time after drug administration is defined as the area under the curve (AUC). The AUC0-infinity is calculated from time 0 (prior to administration of medication) to infinity (the time of complete elimination of the drug). The AUC is of particular use in estimating the bioavailability of drugs, by measuring the extent of absorption. AUC is measured as micrograms times days per milliliter (µg*day/mL)</description>
