  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to understand how the gaze behavior of infants and children with or at
      high risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be manipulated in the contexts of dynamic
      social and non-social scenes. The study explores not only the methods which may be most
      effective in aligning and teaching normative patterns of scene exploration, but also seeks to
      establish what behavioral characteristics may be most predictive of atypical scanning and
      atypical learning.

    <textblock>
      This study initiates a highly novel line of research which uses adaptive, gaze-contingent,
      eye-tracking technology to help infants and children with or at high risk for ASD learn to
      direct their attention to people and their actions in a more typical fashion. This study will
      begin with a Normative Collection phase, and will conclude with a Gaze-Shaping phase. In the
      Normative Collection phase, the investigators will examine the gaze behavior of a group of
      typically developing infants and children with typical development (TD), in order to
      establish a normative gaze pattern. In the Gaze-Shaping phase, within the same videos shown
      in the Normative Collection phase, the investigators will highlight selectively targeted
      people, objects, and activities, in an attempt to shape participants' viewing patterns to
      match the normative gaze pattern.

      Manual coding of live-action interaction probes will provide an additional evaluative
      measure, allowing the investigators to track real-world (live-action) correlates alongside
      video-eye-tracking behaviors. In addition, live-action probes may allow the investigators to
      check for generalization to live interaction with another person (as opposed to gaze behavior
      when watching videos). In live-action probes, one or two clinical research staff member(s)
      will interact with each participant (or with each other in front of the participant), in a
      manner analogous to the actions performed in the training videos.

    <description>Outcome measures for eye-tracking will include the Percentage of Time Spent Looking at Face, Body, and Background regions for stimuli involving people, and Percentage of Time Spent Looking at Activity, People, and Background regions. Percentage of time spent looking at the video (i.e. overall attention less motion, blinks, and inattention) will be calculated. Additional variables specific to the training sessions' adaptive cue condition will include the number of times the stimuli is adapted to redirect attention to locations consistent with the typical viewing pattern) and the amount of time spent in redirection. These will all be assessed by standard eye-tracking analysis protocols.</description>
