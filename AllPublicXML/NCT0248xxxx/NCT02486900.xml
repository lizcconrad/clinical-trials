  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to examine whether the neurofeedback method (based on functional magnetic
      resonance imaging [fMRI]) can help patients with alcohol dependence to control their urges to
      drink alcohol and thus to remain abstinent. Potential effects of neurofeedback on abstinence
      and drinking behaviour will be evaluated based on the comparison between a group of patients
      receiving multiple sessions of neurofeedback training and a group of patients receiving
      treatment as usual over the same period of time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neurofeedback is a non-invasive neuroscientific tool in which participants receive real-time
      feedback about their brain activity while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
      Previous research has shown that participants can successfully use the feedback to
      self-regulate their brain responses. In this study patients who have successfully completed a
      detoxification programme will be trained to down-regulate/upregulate responses of
      motivational brain regions that are activated during exposure to alcohol/life goal-related
      stimuli (pictures of alcoholic drinks/life goals related). The investigators hypothesise that
      learning to self-regulate these neural responses will enable patients to better control
      craving responses to environmental alcohol cues after detoxification treatment. Patients in
      the intervention group will undergo 6 neurofeedback training sessions, spread across 4
      months. Outcomes of the training will be compared with a group of patients who will not do
      the neurofeedback training but receive standard treatment (e.g. support groups and
      medication).

    <description>The neurofeedback group will perform 6 training sessions over a period of 4 months: 4 fortnightly sessions in the first two months will be followed by 2 monthly 'booster' sessions. Each session will include several behavioural assessments and fMRI-based neurofeedback training in an MRI scanner (1 h). The neurofeedback training phase will be be followed-up by two behavioural assessments 8 and 12 months after the first training.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive treatment as usual (e.g. medication, counselling) but no neurofeedback training during the study period. Patients in the control group will be invited for four behavioural assessment sessions (baseline assessment, follow-up assessments 4/8/12 months after baseline).</description>

    <description>During scanning patients will be exposed to picture stimuli (showing alcoholic drinks and life goals) projected on a screen behind the scanner and viewed through a mirror attached on the MRI head coil. In each session patients will be trained to down-regulate/up-regulate activation levels in brain areas that show reliable responses to the alcohol/life goals pictures in a 'localiser' scan. Self-regulation of these brain responses will then be guided by real-time feedback of alcohol/life goals-cue elicited activation, consisting of changes in the visible alcohol/life goals picture (decreasing size = successful down-regulation; increasing size = successful upregulation). Functional MRI data will be acquired in short blocks having a duration of 5-8 minutes.</description>
