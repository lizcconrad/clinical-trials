  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests biopsy and tissue from patients who have been treated for primary rectal
      cancer at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2011 and 2013, who have an mrTRG score at
      post-chemoradiotherapy MRI. It is a retrospective pilot study to determine the apoptotic and
      proliferative index count pre and post chemoradiotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to validate the apoptotic and proliferative index as a predictive
      response marker and lend support to mrTRG as a putative prognostic tool in the treatment
      pathway for rectal cancer patients. Even though this is a retrospective study, the
      investigators hope that pre-treatment apoptotic and proliferative scores will correlate to
      post treatment response and mrTRG scores. In doing so, the investigators can predict how
      patients will respond to treatment from initial diagnostic biopsies and foresee a patients
      individual treatment plan.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients over 18 years of age.

          -  Patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the rectum (diagnosed on tissue biopsy and
             disease spread assessed on CT and MRI).

          -  Tumours must be considered sufficiently high-risk to require pre-operative
             chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery.

          -  Patients must have had a pre- and post-treatment MRI scan of the rectum and pelvis.

          -  We must have access to stored tissue for each patient

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  No pre-operative radiotherapy

          -  Patients with synchronous tumours

          -  Patients under the age of 18 years
