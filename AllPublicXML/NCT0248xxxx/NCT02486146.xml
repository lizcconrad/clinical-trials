  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the working protocols for a general biorepository
      with the specific aim of procuring tissues and bodily fluids from the human gastrointestinal
      tract from a diverse range of clinical patients at the UC Davis Medical Center. The
      establishment of a GI-specific biorepository will support future translational endeavors
      within the UC Davis campus by providing laboratories with readily available GI tissue and
      bodily fluid samples to test newly developed hypotheses with relative ease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UC Davis is currently lacking a general use biorepository for GI tissues and bodily fluids.
      As with any translational research study, the procurement of human tissue samples can be a
      difficult and time- consuming process. The establishment of this biorepository will help
      streamline GI biospecimen collection and centralize these samples in a conveniently located
      space to facilitate the implementation of future unspecified translational studies.

        Individuals to be included will be all consenting adults aged 18 years or older with an
        appointment with a healthcare professional in the Division of Gastroenterology or the
        Department of Surgery. During their routinely scheduled appointment or procedure, eligible
        individuals will be informed of the program by the attending physician and encouraged to
        participate in order to establish a diverse collection of samples of GI-related pathologies
        and matched controls. The investigators' exclusion criteria will include minors, pregnant
        women, prisoners, and all other vulnerable populations who are unable to consent.
