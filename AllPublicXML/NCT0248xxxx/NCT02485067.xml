    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of
      THVD-201(Combination of tolterodine and pilocarpine) in patients with Overactive bladder
      during the period of treatment, 12 weeks.

      This study also includes an open label extension period of an additional 12 weeks following
      the treatment to assess long-term efficacy and safety of THVD-201 in patients with Overactive
      bladder.

             pregnancy test prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Predominate stress incontinence, insensate incontinence (those incapable of
             distinguishing discrete incontinence episodes) and overflow incontinence, as major
             reason for urine loss or urinary frequency as determined by the investigator.

          -  History of neurogenic bladder.

          -  PVR &gt; 200mL
