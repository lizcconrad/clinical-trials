  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop a new and very rapid diagnostic test for identifying
      a certain type of bacteria called Enterobacteriaceae in blood. Rapid identification of
      bacteria will assist in decreasing the use of antibiotics and help more patients survive
      bacterial infections of the blood.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is our overall goal to develop a new diagnostic technology that will facilitate
      antibacterial stewardship to reduce selective pressure and improve patient outcomes. The
      Institute of Medicine has identified antibiotic resistance as one of the key microbial
      threats to health in the United States and has prioritized decreasing inappropriate use of
      antimicrobials as the primary solution to address this threat. The emergence of carbapenem
      resistance among Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in the United States represents a recent and severe
      byproduct of excessive antimicrobial use with a high mortality rate in bacteremia. A major
      barrier toward decreasing use of antimicrobials is lack of sensitive and accurate rapid
      diagnostic tests for identifying bacterial etiologies of infection.
