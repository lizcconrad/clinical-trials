  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the telemedicine use in primary health care
      is effective in the accompaniment of stable coronary artery disease patients who were
      discharged from the tertiary health care clinics.

      This study is a randomized non-inferiority trial for patients with chronic coronary artery
      disease from a tertiary hospital with outpatient discharge criteria. The purpose is to
      compare the use of telemedicine in the quality of care transition between tertiary care and
      primary care patients (intervention group), with patients who remain in the outpatient clinic
      of a tertiary hospital (control group).
