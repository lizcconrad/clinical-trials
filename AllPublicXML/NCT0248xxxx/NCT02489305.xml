  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify if there are self-reported or objective measures
      related to mood parameters that can predict near-term relapse (within 1 month or at another
      identified time point before meeting the criteria for relapse) or early symptomatic changes
      indicative of relapse prodrome in major depressive disorder (MDD).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal, single-cohort, observational study in
      participants with MDD who have responded to, and are continuing to respond to and receive, an
      oral antidepressant treatment regimen. The study will consist of 2 parts: a screening phase
      of up to 2 weeks, and an observational phase of variable duration.

    <description>Relapse will be defined as any of the following: a) MADRS total score greater than or equal to 22 on at least two consecutive visits, with an interval of 1-2 weeks; b) Hospitalization for worsening of depression; c) Suicidal ideation with intent, or suicidal behavior and d) Other (investigator will be asked to describe). MADRS total score ranges from 0 to 60, Higher scores represents a more severe condition.</description>

             (that is, the start of the current major depressive episode (MDE) must be less than or

             Treatment Response Questionnaire), within the past 3 months. A change in the oral
             antidepressant treatment regimen since the time of achieving response in the current
             episode will be allowed

          -  Participants must have a Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score less
             than or equal to 14

          -  Participant must be willing and able to complete self-reported assessments via a
             study-specific smartphone, and must be willing to wear an wrist actigraphy device for

          -  Participant has a history of drug or alcohol use, with a severity of at least moderate
             or severe, according to DSM-5 criteria, within 6 months before screening

          -  Participant is currently receiving or has received vagal nerve stimulation (VNS),
             electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or deep
             brain stimulation (DBS) for the current MDE

          -  Participant is currently receiving stimulants, anticonvulsants, or mood stabilizers
             for treatment of his or her MDD
