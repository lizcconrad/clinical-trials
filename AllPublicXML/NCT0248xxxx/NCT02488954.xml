  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an immune mediated chronic inflammatory bowel disease that results
      at least in part of an abnormal immune response to environmental factors including the
      intestinal microbiota. Thus, use of probiotics (microorganisms that are believed to provide
      health benefits when consume) may restore the gastrointestinal microbiota and reduce
      intestinal inflammation.

      Propionibacterium freudenreichii is used for the production of fermented food products
      (cheese). Some selected strains have strong anti-inflammatory properties. Use of cheese based
      on a monoxenic culture of anti-inflammatory strain of Propionibacterium freudenreichii may
      decrease disease activity during ulcerative colitis.
