  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, threatened preterm labour concerns 6.5% of pregnancies and is associated with a
      premature birth in 25.4% of cases.

      After 48 hours effective tocolysis, patients do not receive any further treatment while their
      risk of premature birth has risen from 6.5% to 25%.

      A pessary is a silicone ring encircling the cervix. It was initially used as medical
      treatment of genital prolapse but studies were also conducted for pregnant women in 2
      high-risk premature birth situations: cervical incompetence and twin pregnancies.

      The multicenter PECEP trial conducted by Goya and al. in asymptomatic short cervix patients
      between 18 and 22 weeks of gestation showed a significant reduction of premature birth before
      34 and 37 weeks of gestation. Thereby, the investigator assume that use of pessaries in
      patients presenting a resolutive threatened preterm labor will also be effective.

      To evaluate this hypothesis, the investigator designed a randomized prospective single-center
      open clinical trial comparing pessary associated with standard care (1st group) versus
      standard care only (2nd group) in patients experiencing an episode of resolutive threatened
      preterm labor.
