  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates a family-focused mobile phone-delivered intervention, called FAMS
      (Family-focused Add-on for Motivating Self-care), in supporting adults with type 2 diabetes
      in their self-management relative to a control group. The goal of this study is to ascertain
      if family-focused content delivered to the patient can improve the patients' family support
      for diabetes self-care, self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Family members perform diabetes-specific behaviors that are harmful and/or helpful to the
      adult managing type 2 diabetes. Family behaviors are strongly associated with patients'
      adherence to diet and exercise: supportive family behaviors with more adherence and harmful
      family behaviors with less adherence. This six-month intervention seeks to increase
      supportive and reduce harmful family behaviors, and to improve diabetes-related
      self-efficacy, and adherence to diet and exercise recommendations among adult patients with
      content that can be delivered via basic mobile phones (i.e., phone calls and text messages).

      FAMS components include:

        -  Six 20-30 minute coaching sessions with patient participants by phone focusing on
           helpful/unhelpful/desired family behaviors relevant to the patients' self-identified
           daily diet or exercise goal (occurs after enrollment and monthly for six months)

        -  Text messages to the patient to support him/her in meeting the identified daily goal (4
           per week)

        -  The option to invite an adult support person to receive text messages (3 per week)
           encouraging the support person to discuss the patient's self-care goal to provide
           opportunities for the patient to practice skills discussed during phone coaching

      This intervention evaluation is nested within a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT; see
      NCT02409329) which evaluates REACH, a text messaging intervention to improve participants'
      adherence to self-care and glycemic control. We will evaluate these interventions with a
      three arm trial. Participants will be randomized to receive REACH only, REACH+FAMS, or an
      active control. Participants assigned to REACH+FAMS will receive the above described
      components for the first six months of the trial, and then REACH only until the end of the
      trial. Analyses will examine outcomes of FAMS at 3 and 6 months.
