    <textblock>
      The IRISâ„¢ Registry (Intelligent Research in Sight) is the nation's first comprehensive eye
      disease clinical registry. The American Academy of Ophthalmology is developing it as part of
      the profession's shared goal of continual improvement in the delivery of eye care.The IRIS
      Registry will be a centralized system for ophthalmology practices to promote practice
      innovations and achieve clinical excellence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The IRIS Registry is primarily a clinical self-improvement tool. It will allow
      ophthalmologists to compare their patient outcomes, professional performance and care
      processes against other ophthalmologists across the country. The IRIS Registry will be able
      to measure the continuum of care from initial patient contact, through intervention and
      follow up.

      Improve Patient Care - Monitor patient interactions, track interventions, identify and
      address gaps in quality of care, and measure quality outcomes.

      Manage Patient Populations - Proactively manage clinical conditions for entire patient
      populations by running reports on specific care criteria.

      Benchmark Your Practice - Identify practice strengths and weaknesses using the IRIS
      Registry's ophthalmology-specific clinical data from other practices to compare to the
      performance and outcomes data of your practice.

      Run quality reports on demand - Providing clinician- and practice-level results, plus
      national results and patient-level detail for all IRIS Registry measures.

      Enhance Quality and Practice Efficiency - Use the IRIS Registry data to analyze practice
      processes and procedures and as a source for fact-based decision-making. Because the IRIS
      Registry will capture data over time at the individual and practice level, it will help
      practices efficiently manage patient care and optimize practice resources.

      Join a Community of Quality - Become a member of a like-minded community of quality-driven
      professionals striving to continuously improve patient care. Interact with your peers to
      create opportunities for sharing quality improvement strategies and broaden your professional
      network.
