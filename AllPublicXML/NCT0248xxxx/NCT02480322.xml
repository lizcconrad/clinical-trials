  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Obesity is associated with multiple diseases. Bariatric surgery is the most
      effective therapy for severe obesity that cannot only reduce body weight but also
      obesity-associated morbidity.

      Objective: The metabolic alterations associated with obesity and respective changes after
      bariatric surgery are incompletely understood.

      Design: In the longitudinal observational study, the investigator applied a 1H-NMR-based
      global, untargeted metabolomics strategy on human serum samples that were collected before
      and repeatedly up to one year after distinct bariatric procedures (sleeve gastrectomy,
      proximal and distal Roux-en Y gastric bypass; RYGB). For comparison, the investigator also
      analyzed serum samples from normal-weight and less obesity obese subjects that were matched
      for 1-year postoperative BMI values of the surgical groups.
