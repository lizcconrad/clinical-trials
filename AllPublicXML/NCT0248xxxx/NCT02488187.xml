      Comparison of Preoperative Automated Breast Ultrasound (ABUS) and magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) in Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot study investigating the use of Automated Breast Ultrasound in the
      preoperative evaluation of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. The Investigator intends
      to demonstrate that preoperative automated breast ultrasound (ABUS) will provide a relatively
      inexpensive and well-tolerated alternative to MRI for detection of occult breast cancer
      missed by mammography and hand-held ultrasound in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.
      The research will take place at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC). The research
      study will be open to newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who present to KUMC with a
      recommendation for preoperative MRI and who fit all inclusion criteria and have none of the
      exclusion criteria.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women (age 18-100) undergoing preoperative evaluation at the University of Kansas
             Cancer Center (KUCC) for a new diagnosis of breast cancer

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer by either core needle biopsy or excisional
             biopsy.

          -  Bilateral mammography and hand-held ultrasound (if clinically indicated) performed
             prior to the MRI and ABUS.

          -  If a breast MRI is advised and there is no contraindication to MRI, a breast MRI and
             ABUS will performed at KUCC (Study Arm 1).

          -  If a breast MRI is not performed, an ABUS exam without MRI will be performed (Study
             Arm 2).

          -  The MRI and ABUS exam must be obtained within 2 weeks of each other.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Males

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Lactating women

          -  Patients &lt; 18 and &gt; 100 years of age

          -  Patients with breast implants
