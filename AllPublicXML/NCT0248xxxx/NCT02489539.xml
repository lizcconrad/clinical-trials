    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the GORE® EXCLUDER®
      Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis to treat an infrarenal aneurysm located in the abdominal
      aorta. Performance of the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis will be judged by
      separate performance goals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a prospective, nonrandomized, international, multicenter study comprised
      of two parallel substudies. The total subject population will be 190 subjects with 80
      subjects assigned to the Short Neck Substudy and 110 subjects to the High Neck Angulation
      Substudy.

      This clinical study will include fifty-six sites in the US. Each enrolled subject will
      undergo periodic follow-up evaluations involving physical exams and contrast-enhanced
      computed tomography (CT) scans at specific, protocol-defined intervals for a period of five
      years following the GORE® EXCLUDER® Conformable AAA Endoprosthesis implant. Each Substudy
      will be evaluated and reported independently from each other according to the Safety and
      Effectiveness Endpoints. No comparative analyses between these substudies are planned.

    <description>Endovascular Aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a minimally invasive procedure designed to exclude an aneurysmal segment of the aorta from blood circulation. The EVAR procedure involves delivery of a stent- graft compressed onto a catheter to an aneurysmal segment of the aorta from a remote access site, generally the femoral artery. Arterial access may be done by either percutaneous or cut-down technique.</description>
