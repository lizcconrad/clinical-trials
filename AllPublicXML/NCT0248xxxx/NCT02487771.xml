  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a continuation study to KUDOS (NCT00266825). The purpose of this study is to
      follow-up with participants on the original study to determine if the effects of increasing
      DHA intake during pregnancy increase cognitive development in 2 to 6 year-old children.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous trials show benefits of postnatal DHA supplementation for visual acuity. There are
      also numerous observational(not intervention)studies that link higher maternal DHA status
      during pregnancy to higher cognitive function. Intervention studies that increase DHA
      exposure during fetal life and that measure cognitive development of infants are lacking; and
      no study to date has systematically followed children whose mothers were randomly assigned to
      DHA supplementation to school age with regular 6 month assessments of age-appropriate
      assessments of cognitive development. The absence of such studies is a serious limitation
      because there is evidence that differences in cognitive function due to such interventions do
      not become robust until around age 4 years. Women in the US consume low amounts of DHA
      compared to other world populations, and this likely means less DHA transfer to the fetus
      than in many other populations. Prenatal DHA exposure may be more important than postnatal
      exposure, because animal studies show critical windows for brain DHA accumulation in relation
      to effects on neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and GABA.

    <measure>Adaptive Regulation Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Rating Scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2nd Edition measures different aspects of a child's behaviors as reported by a parent. Externalizing Problems is a measure of Aggression and Hyperactivity. Internalizing Problems is a measure of Anxiety, Depression, and Somatization. The Behavioral Symptoms Index is a more global measure of behavior problems and combines Externalizing Problems with the measure of Depression from Internalizing Problems, and additional measures of Atypicality, Withdrawal, and Attention Problems. Adaptive Skills is a measure of Adaptability, Social Skills, Activities of Daily Living, Functional Communication, and at age 6 years Leadership. All scores are derived from the general, combined sex normative tables of T-Scores. For Adaptive Skills higher T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. For all other measures lower T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. All T-Scores were standardized with a Mean = 50, St Dev = 10.</description>

    <measure>Dietary Intake</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Biannually a registered dietitian assessed child diet by a standardized 24 hour dietary recall with three-pass approach. When necessary both the parent and child participated in the recall process to increase overall reliability. Recalls were entered into Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R versions 2006-2016, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and were checked for accuracy by a second dietitian. Reliability and caloric intake data are presented here. Reliability is defined as the dietitian's subjective assessment of the family's ability to recall the majority of food items consumed during the 24 hour period and within reasonable serving sizes. Caloric intake is the mean kcal per day from reliable recalls only.</description>

Recalls were entered into Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R versions 2006-2016, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and were checked for accuracy by a second dietitian. Reliability and caloric intake data are presented here. Reliability is defined as the dietitian's subjective assessment of the family's ability to recall the majority of food items consumed during the 24 hour period and within reasonable serving sizes. Caloric intake is the mean kcal per day from reliable recalls only.</description>

        <title>Adaptive Regulation Assessment</title>
        <description>The Parent Rating Scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2nd Edition measures different aspects of a child’s behaviors as reported by a parent. Externalizing Problems is a measure of Aggression and Hyperactivity. Internalizing Problems is a measure of Anxiety, Depression, and Somatization. The Behavioral Symptoms Index is a more global measure of behavior problems and combines Externalizing Problems with the measure of Depression from Internalizing Problems, and additional measures of Atypicality, Withdrawal, and Attention Problems. Adaptive Skills is a measure of Adaptability, Social Skills, Activities of Daily Living, Functional Communication, and at age 6 years Leadership. All scores are derived from the general, combined sex normative tables of T-Scores. For Adaptive Skills higher T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. For all other measures lower T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. All T-Scores were standardized with a Mean = 50, St Dev = 10.</description>

        <title>Adaptive Regulation Assessment</title>
        <description>The Parent Rating Scales of the Behavior Assessment System for Children 2nd Edition measures different aspects of a child’s behaviors as reported by a parent. Externalizing Problems is a measure of Aggression and Hyperactivity. Internalizing Problems is a measure of Anxiety, Depression, and Somatization. The Behavioral Symptoms Index is a more global measure of behavior problems and combines Externalizing Problems with the measure of Depression from Internalizing Problems, and additional measures of Atypicality, Withdrawal, and Attention Problems. Adaptive Skills is a measure of Adaptability, Social Skills, Activities of Daily Living, Functional Communication, and at age 6 years Leadership. All scores are derived from the general, combined sex normative tables of T-Scores. For Adaptive Skills higher T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. For all other measures lower T-Scores reflect a more optimal outcome. All T-Scores were standardized with a Mean = 50, St Dev = 10.</description>

        <description>Biannually a registered dietitian assessed child diet by a standardized 24 hour dietary recall with three-pass approach. When necessary both the parent and child participated in the recall process to increase overall reliability. Recalls were entered into Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R versions 2006-2016, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and were checked for accuracy by a second dietitian. Reliability and caloric intake data are presented here. Reliability is defined as the dietitian’s subjective assessment of the family’s ability to recall the majority of food items consumed during the 24 hour period and within reasonable serving sizes. Caloric intake is the mean kcal per day from reliable recalls only.</description>

        <description>Biannually a registered dietitian assessed child diet by a standardized 24 hour dietary recall with three-pass approach. When necessary both the parent and child participated in the recall process to increase overall reliability. Recalls were entered into Nutrition Data System for Research (NDS-R versions 2006-2016, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and were checked for accuracy by a second dietitian. Reliability and caloric intake data are presented here. Reliability is defined as the dietitian’s subjective assessment of the family’s ability to recall the majority of food items consumed during the 24 hour period and within reasonable serving sizes. Caloric intake is the mean kcal per day from reliable recalls only.</description>
