    <textblock>
      Cirrhotic patients are patients with high morbidity and mortality, it is very important for
      determining the prognosis of these patients. The importance increases when these patients
      waiting for a liver transplant. The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a reliable
      measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. It is used as a disease
      severity index to help prioritize allocation of organs for transplant. MELD uses the patient
      values for serum bilirubin, serum creatinine, and the international normalized ratio for
      prothrombin time (INR) to predict survival.

      Blood tests that we use today in daily practice to evaluate the coagulation system (PT, PTT)
      do not check actually the functioning of the system, but examine the level of clotting
      factors and therefore only verify that the side of Anticoagulant of the equation and not the
      side of the procoagulant .

      To examine the coagulation system function tests have been developed, One of them is the
      thrombin generation. The purpose of the trial is to determine whether thrombin generation
      test can be a prognostic indicator in patients cirrhosis.
