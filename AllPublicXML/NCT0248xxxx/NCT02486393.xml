      The investigators conducted a prospective study of 132 patients undergoing benign parotid
      surgery at our department. Their primary objective was to analyze the incidence of and
      contributing factors associated with temporary and permanent postoperative facial palsy with
      strictly standardized methods in facial nerve function evaluation. Also other complications
      occurring within 12 months of operation were recorded.

      Patients who underwent parotid surgery at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and
      Neck Surgery, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland, between September 2011 and
      November 2012 were prospectively enrolled. Exclusion criteria were age under 18, suspicion of
      malignancy or facial schwannoma, a tumor extending into the parapharyngeal space, and
      previous parotid surgery exposing facial nerve.
