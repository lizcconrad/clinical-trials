  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal pain represents the leading cause of disability worldwide. It has been
      traditionally attributed to peripheral mechanisms, but peripheral damage, inflammation, and
      psychological factors have failed to significantly account for the presence, absence, or
      severity of chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP). Recent studies show that individuals with CMP
      exhibit dysfunctional pain modulation supporting a significant central nervous system (CNS)
      contribution. However, the CNS mechanisms underlying these changes in pain modulation are not
      currently known, nor is their relation to clinical pain progression. The proposed pilot
      examines brain circuits recently described in predicting the transition from acute to chronic
      pain, in predicting clinical and experimental pain changes as well as physical performance
      and mobility changes in older persons with musculoskeletal pain over a one year period. The
      findings will provide novel and important information regarding the mechanisms underlying
      aberrant pain processing and its functional consequences in older adults with musculoskeletal
      pain. The information learned can be subsequently used to target treatment and prevention
      strategies in future studies of older adults. The central hypothesis is that increased
      functional and structural connectivity of cortico-striatal regions will be significantly
      associated with baseline clinical and experimental pain and decreased physical function in
      persons with CMP and will account for more rapid clinical pain and disability progression
      over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP) is the most common, non-malignant disabling condition that
      affects at least one in four older people. The most common painful musculoskeletal conditions
      among older adults are osteoarthritis, low back pain, fibromyalgia, chronic shoulder pain,
      knee pain, myofascial pain syndrome and previous fracture sites. Recent studies demonstrate
      generalized alterations of pain processing among older individuals with CMP. An improved
      understanding of the mechanisms underlying CMP-related changes in pain modulation will
      provide a basis for the development of targeted preventive and rehabilitative strategies. In
      light of evidence emphasizing plasticity of white matter connections, and the potential pain
      relieving effects of non-invasive brain stimulation interventions, it seems reasonable to
      identify these connections as potential targets for future treatment approaches. Given the
      expected growth of the older population, such strategies could have a monumental impact in
      reducing healthcare expenditures and improving the quality of life of older adults.

    <description>The &quot;TSA Thermal Sensory and Vibratory Sensory Analyzer (Model TSA II, VSA 3000) (Medoc. LTD)&quot; will be used in this study to quantify nerve fiber dysfunction with measurements of vibratory thresholds. Vibratory threshold is tested with a vibratory pin, which presses the measured area with a consistent pressure of 50g. The vibratory sense analysis will be performed with upward-moving stimuli, which increases in intensity until a sensation is perceived. Several vibrations will be given sequentially and the mean end variance will be determined to verify the consistency of the test.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), Thermal Detection Thresholds, Pain Thresholds, and Temporal Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the QST visit (2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>The &quot;TSA Thermal Sensory and Vibratory Sensory Analyzer (Model TSA II, VSA 3000) (Medoc. LTD)&quot; will also be used in this study to quantify nerve fiber dysfunction with measurements of thermal sensory thresholds (warm, cold, heat-induced pain, and cold-induced pain). Several trials will be performed for the sensory modality and a mean threshold will be calculated. For threshold determination, the investigators will use a &quot;reaction time-inclusive&quot; method, the method of limits, consisting of continuously changing intensities of stimuli halted automatically by the subject at the moment that the requested sensation is perceived. The following thresholds will be evaluated using the TSA II: (1) cool sensation; (2) warm sensation; (3) cold pain; and (4) heat pain. Subjects will also be asked to qualify the sensation after it has been quantified. Temporal summation of heat pain will be assessed by administering brief repetitive suprathreshold heat stimuli to test sites.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), Allodynia and Temporal Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the QST visit (2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>Dynamic mechanical allodynia will be investigated using a soft brush and lightly brushing the skin of the hands and feet as well as any reported painful areas. If pain is evoked in the test area, the participant will be asked to rate the intensity of the pain. If an allodynic area is detected, temporal summation will be evoked by repetitively tapping the skin of the allodynic area with von Frey hairs (100g) at 1 Hz for 10 seconds. If temporal summation is evoked in the allodynic test area the participant will be asked to rate the intensity of the pain.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST), Punctate Pain Testing and Temporal Summation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the QST visit (2 hrs)</time_frame>
    <description>We will apply punctate mechanical stimuli to the test sites with a series of weighted probes. Probes of different weights will be applied to participants' skin to determine the level that produces slight discomfort or pain. Two measures are obtained: 1) Pain threshold is determined by applying probes of different weights in ascending and descending sequences and participants are asked to tell the examiner which probes produce pain; 2) A weighted probe is applied either once or several times in a row and participants are asked to rate the pain they experience from the probe. In addition, a standardized plastic MediPin ® commonly used in neurological examinations will be applied to testing areas and participants will be asked to rate the intensity of any pain that is experienced.</description>
