  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the investigator's study is to evaluate the causes of and treatment
      for feeding difficulty in infants with Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). New
      treatments can be possible only if the cause is known. Many infants have GERD and feeding
      difficulties, such as sucking and swallowing problems, vomiting, or delayed emptying of the
      stomach. Some of these infants have difficulty in protecting their airway during feeding or
      during reflux, and as a result can breathe fluid into their lungs or hold their breath. Most
      GERD treatments are done based on experience, but there is no scientific proof that these
      methods work for infants. GERD and feeding difficulties can lead to longer hospitalization
      and more stress for the family.

      In this clinical trial, the investigators are developing new methods to help with diagnosis
      as well as defining better treatment strategies in relieving GERD and GERD complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and its troublesome complications constitute serious
      diagnostic and management challenges to the development of safe feeding and airway protection
      strategies among infants convalescing in the neonatal intensive care units; thus contributing
      to prolonged lengths of stay, recurrent hospitalizations, and death. GERD is frequently
      diagnosed by inadequate criteria, and the relative risks, benefits and indications of GERD
      therapies are unclear. Significant gaps in knowledge exist in understanding the complex
      causal or adaptive aerodigestive protective reflex mechanisms implicated in GERD in infants.
      The long-term goal is to improve digestive health, nutrition, and infant development through
      the design of simplified personalized treatment paradigms by better understanding the
      pathophysiology of aerodigestive reflexes.

      The current objective is to conduct a prospective single center randomized blinded controlled
      trial comparing the short term effects of the investigators innovative feeding strategy
      bundle (study approach) versus standard feeding approach (conventional approach).
