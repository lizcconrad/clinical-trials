      A randomized clinical trial comparing the effect on weight reduction and cardiometabolic risk
      factors of intermittent energy restriction and a isocaloric continuous energy restriction in
      obese subjects.

      Background: The optimal diet for treating obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is
      still not clarified. Could a five plus two diet, a form of intermittent energy restriction
      lead to good adherence, similar weight loss and reduction in CVD risk factors as a isocaloric
      continuous energy restrictions in obese subjects.

      Methods: The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial in 120 men and women between 21
      to 70 years with BMI (BMI 30-45 kg/m2), stable weight within ±3 kg last 3 months and 1
      additional metabolic syndrome risk component.

      Dietary intervention: Randomization will be to one of two diet groups. Participants in the
      intervention group will follow av 5:2 diet and participants in the control group will follow
      an isocaloric continuous energy restriction.

      Primary research question: Compare the effect on weight reduction of intermittent energy
      restriction and a isocaloric continuous energy restriction in obese subjects? Secondary
      research questions Compare the effect of intermittent energy restriction and an isocaloric
      continuous energy restriction on cardiometabolic risk factors and tolerability and safety in
      obese subjects. The project consist of to randomized controlled clinical trials.
