  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Timolol is a nonselective β-blocker commonly used in the treatment of glaucoma. Recently it
      has been used topically for the treatment of superficial hemangiomas. Because of its
      potential mechanism of action, it is possible that timolol could also be useful for the
      treatment of epistaxis in Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT). Moreover a case was
      reported in 2012 showing an improvement of nosebleeds with the use of topical nasal timolol.
      The aim of the study is to evaluate timolol nasal spray efficacy in HHT.

      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate, 3 months after the end of the treatment, the
      efficacy on the duration of nosebleeds of a 4 weeks timolol intranasal treatment in HHT
      patients with nosebleeds (&gt;20 min/month). Secondary objectives are to evaluate the tolerance,
      the efficacy at 6 months after the end of the treatment, and the efficacy on anemia and on
      clinical parameters (nosebleeds, quality of life and blood transfusions).

      This is a prospective double blind phase II study, randomized versus placebo using an
      allocation ratio of 1:1. A total of 58 patients will be included. The product (solution with
      timolol at 0.5% or placebo) is self-administered by the patient with a posology of one spray
      (50 µL) in each nostril twice a day for 28 consecutive days.
