    <textblock>
      This study evaluate the effect of 3 doses of Chloroprocaine HCl 1% (30, 40 and 50 mg) for
      spinal anaesthesia in adult patients undergoing short duration elective surgery of the lower
      limb. Patients undergoing elective short-duration lower limb surgery will be randomised into
      3 treatment groups (15 patients per group) to receive one of the 3 single doses of
      Chloroprocaine HCl 1%, i.e. either D1, D2 or D3, via intrathecal injection.
