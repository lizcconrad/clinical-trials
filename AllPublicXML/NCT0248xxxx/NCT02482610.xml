  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Short-term
      increases in blood sugar, or postprandial hyperglycemia (PPH), affect blood vessel function
      and increase the risk of CVD. Greater intakes of dairy foods have been associated with a
      lower risk of CVD, but whether these effects occur directly or indirectly by displacing foods
      in the diet that might increase CVD risk is unclear. Further controversial is the extent to
      which dietary fat derived from dairy foods regulate the risk of CVD. The health benefits of
      dairy on CVD risk are at least partly attributed to its ability to limit PPH and resulting
      PPH-mediated responses leading to vascular dysfunction. This provides rationale to
      investigate full-fat containing dairy as a dietary strategy to reduce PPH and risk for heart
      disease. The objective of this project is to define the extent to which full-fat dairy milk
      compared to non-fat dairy milk protects against PPH-induced vascular dysfunction by reducing
      oxidative stress responses that limit nitric oxide bioavailability to the vascular
      endothelium in adults with prediabetes.

      This study consists of three, 3-hour postprandial trials in response to consuming the
      following dietary treatments: 1. oral glucose challenge, 2. oral glucose challenge in
      combination with non-fat milk, and 3. oral glucose challenge in combination with whole milk.
      For three days preceding each trial, participants will be provided all meals to standardize
      physiologic responses to test meals. On each trial day, vascular function will be assessed
      and blood samples collected prior to and at 30 minute intervals for 3 hours following test
      meal ingestion.
