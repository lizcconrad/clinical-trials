        of treatment on this study.

        Prior therapy with a Poly-(ADP-ribose)-Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor.

        Subject has a clinically significant uncontrolled condition(s), including but not limited
        to:

          -  Uncontrolled seizure disorder, or focal or generalized seizure within the last 12
             months;

             cardiac arrhythmia (i.e., ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation) or
             serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication (this does not include asymptomatic
             atrial fibrillation with controlled ventricular rate); or myocardial infarction within
             the last 6 months;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (sustained systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic
             pressure &gt; 100 mmHg despite optimal medical management);

          -  Bowel obstruction or gastric outlet obstruction;

          -  Psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements;

          -  Any medical condition which in the opinion of the Investigator places the subject at
             an unacceptably high risk for toxicities.
