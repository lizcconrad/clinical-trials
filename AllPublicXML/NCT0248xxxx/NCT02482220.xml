  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exercise of high intensity has been shown to induced nutritional adaptations in obese
      adolescents. Indeed, several studies have shown that about 30 minutes of intensive exercise
      (above 70% of the adolescents maximal aerobic capacities) can favor reduced-energy
      consumption at the following meal with no modification of their appetite feelings. Although
      it is suggested that chronic physical activity programs can induce energy intake
      modifications, this has never been clearly studied. The aim of this work is to compare
      different physical activity programs (low vs. high intensity programs) in terms of energy
      intake, appetite feelings and appetite-regulating hormones, in obese adolescents.

    <textblock>
      After an first medical visit to ensure that the adolescents have the ability to complete the
      whole study, the participants will have to complete several clinical examinations:

        -  anthropometric measurements

        -  Body composition assessed by DXA

        -  Maximal aerobic test

        -  Blood samples (appetite-regulating hormones)

        -  daily energy intake assessment during a 24h intake exploration.

      The adolescents recruited will then be randomly assigned to one of the two intervention
      groups:

      - High Intensity program or moderate intensity program. Those two physical activity programs
      will last 4-months and will be composed of 3 to 4 exercise sessions per week. The High
      intensity program will consists in High intensity interval exercises starting at 70% of the
      adolescents' capacities at the beginning to end around 95%. The moderate intensity program
      will propose continuous exercises set between 50-65% VO2max.

      No energy intake intervention will be performed.

      By the end of the 4-months intervention, all the clinical examinations performed before the
      intervention will be repeated.
