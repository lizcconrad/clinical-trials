      This extension study will provide continued onartuzumab and/or parent trial (P-trial)
      designated control treatments to participants with cancer who were previously enrolled in a
      company-sponsored onartuzumab P-trial and who derived benefit, as assessed by the responsible
      investigator, from the therapy administered in the P-trial. The study will also collect
      safety data with regard to administration of continued onartuzumab therapy.

    <description>Participants will receive treatment with either the control treatment (erlotinib, bevacizumab) and/or onartuzumab-based study treatment (as during their P-trial) until progression of disease, unacceptable treatment related toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death (whichever occurs first). All participants will continue on the same dose and schedule of control treatment as specified in their respective P-trial. The dose of onartuzumab will be calculated based on the participant's weight at the screening visit for the E-trial.</description>
