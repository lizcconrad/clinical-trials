    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well gabapentin plus standard of care work
      compares to standard of care without Gabapentin in preventing inflammation of the mucous
      membranes (mucositis) in patients with stage III-IV head and neck cancer that are undergoing
      primary or subsequent (adjuvant) chemoradiation therapy. Radiation therapy to the head and
      neck may cause a burn involving the inside of the mouth, throat, and nasal passages,
      resulting in pain. Gabapentin may help prevent (or minimize) pain associated with
      radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether gabapentin used as a preventive measure during chemoradiation can
      reduce radiation-induced mucositis associated pain in head and neck cancer patients as
      measured by: 1) pain scores on the Vanderbilt Head and Neck Symptom Survey (VHNSS version
      2.), and 2) analgesic use.

      II. To determine whether pain control is associated with weight loss (in pounds) and duration
      of use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy utilization (in days).

      III. To assess the safety (grade 3 or 4 adverse events) and tolerability of using gabapentin
      (discontinuation of drug due to side effects - yes or no).

      IV. To correlate pain severity with frequency and severity of general systemic symptoms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Standard of Care (usual care) - Patients receive consisting of oral health measures,
      oral rinsing, miracle mouthwash, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, and opioid analgesics.
      Patients also undergo an education session at the beginning of chemoradiation treatment to
      review foundations of oral care and pain management.

      ARM II: Standard of Care plus Gabapentin - Patients receive standard of care and undergo an
      education session as in Arm I. Patients also receive gabapentin orally (PO) three times a day
      throughout chemoradiation treatment (approximately 5-7 weeks) and until mucositis resolves
      and pain subsides.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months.

    <description>Whether pain control is associated with duration of use of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy utilization will be determined. Graphical and descriptive statistical summaries will be generated. Mixed-level general linear modeling will be used. All tests of statistical significance will maintain maximum Type I error of 0.05 (p &lt; 0.05). Baseline pain scores will be included as a covariate in the analyses of the outcome.</description>

    <description>Pain severity will be correlated with frequency and severity of general systemic symptoms. Graphical and descriptive statistical summaries will be generated.

    <description>Graphical and descriptive statistical summaries will be generated. Evaluation of the key outcome variable data distributions (VHNSS mouth pain scores, opioid dose) will inform the required test distribution (e.g., normal, log-normal). Mixed-level general linear modeling will be used. All tests of statistical significance will maintain maximum Type I error of 0.05 (p &lt; 0.05). Baseline pain scores will be included as a covariate in the analyses of the outcome.</description>
