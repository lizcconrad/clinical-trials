  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized pauci-centre, open-label phase II study. The treatment will consist
      in a chemotherapy by FOLFOX and nab-paclitaxel following modalities determined in the Brown
      University Phase I study.

      In neoadjuvant setting : 3 months of treatment

      Main criteria of Withdraw of the treatment: in case of tumor progression, non acceptable
      toxicity, or patient decision.

      Post-operative treatment (for 6 additional cycles) is recommended, but will depend on the
      result of the neo-adjuvant treatment and the ability of patients to receive adjuvant
      chemotherapy based on tolerance of neo-adjuvant treatment and general post-operative
      condition (i.e. adjuvant treatment if no progression during neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, less
      than 80% of residual viable tumor compared to initial tumor volume, acceptable tolerance and
      post-operative PS 0 - 2). Adjuvant treatment must be initiated within 8 weeks
      post-operatively.
