  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate the comparative effectiveness between polyp removal with or
      without electrical current. The investigators want to include 800 polyps in the trial.

      It is known that polyps have the potential to develop to cancer if left in situ, but the
      investigators do not know the best way to remove them completely.

      In this study the investigators want to compare to widely used methods for polyp removal; hot
      and cold snare polypectomy. There has not been performed any big studies on this subject
      earlier, but current knowledge indicates that hot polypectomy (i.e. with use of electrical
      current) is somewhat better with regard to complete resection of polyps compared to cold
      polypectomy (without electrical current).

      In this project the patients will be randomized to either hot or cold polypectomy. The
      investigators will distribute videos of how the polypectomies should be performed, and a
      gastroenterologist in the project group will instruct the doctors examining the patients to
      make sure that everyone performs polypectomy according to current guidelines.

      The study is designed as a non-inferiority trial.

    <description>Patients in this arm will have their polyps removed by cold polypectomy, i.e. a metal sling that is closed around the basis of the polyp, and the polyp is cut off.
After removal there will be taken biopsies from the resection margins, and both the polyp and the biopsies will be examined by a histopathologist to see if the polyp is removed completely.</description>
