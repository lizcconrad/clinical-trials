    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a group of medical conditions derived from progressive bone
      marrow failure that result in ineffective production of blood cells. Depending on the
      severity, MDS reduces the quality of life to the point of being life-threatening. There is a
      probability of death at all stages of the disease, due to complications and co-morbidities,
      with progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) being the worst evolution. Azacytidine is a
      nucleosidic analog with original epigenetic mechanism of action that is widely used for
      treating a variety of myelodysplasic syndromes. Although generally well tolerated, severe and
      sometimes life-threatening toxicities were unexpectedly observed in some patients. Genetic
      polymorphism affecting cytidine deaminase (CDA), the liver enzyme responsible for azacytidine
      detoxification step, could be responsible for poor clinical outcome due to on the one hand to
      severe toxicities in deficient patients, and on the other hand on treatment failure in
      ultrametabolizer patients.This clinical study aims at correlating the values in CDA levels
      with the risk of drug-related toxicities and to the clinical response to azacytidine
      treatment.
