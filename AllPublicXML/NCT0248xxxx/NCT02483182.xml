      This is a phase II, prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel group,
      acyclovir-controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary
      therapeutic efficacy of ZEP-3 ointment 1.0% for the treatment of cold sores (Herpes
      labialis), following five consecutive treatment days with five times daily topical
      administration.

      The primary endpoint of this study are:

        -  &quot;Time to healing&quot; - Clinician-assessed duration in days of herpes labialis episode.

        -  Patient-assessed duration and intensity of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

        -  Safety and tolerability following five consecutive treatment days with five times daily
           topical administration.

      The secondary endpoints of this study are:

        -  Proportion of subjects with non - ulcerative herpes lesion.

        -  Time for herpes labialis recurrences

      Subject safety will be assessed following treatment by ZEP-3 ointment 1.0% or acyclovir cream
      5% treatment, using measurements of the following variables:

        -  Physical examination,

        -  Vital Signs (HR, BP, Body temperature),

        -  Adverse events recording and

        -  Concomitant medications
