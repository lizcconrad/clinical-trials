        3. Known adverse drug reaction profile

        4. Non-serious adverse drug reaction profile

        5. Other information related to the product safety

        6. Efficacy evaluation

        7. Study of extended follow-up Surveillance of the safety and efficacy of the subjects who

Description of adverse event(s) including type of adverse event(s), onset/end date, severity, action taken, causal relationship to the drug and investigator's view on the adverse event(s) will be captured, whether it is related to the drug or not and until follow up visit more than 1 time during the surveillance period.
Lab abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.</description>
