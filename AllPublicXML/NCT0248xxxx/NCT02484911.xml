  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to mainly evaluate the efficacy and safety of aprepitant in
      combination with olanzapine ,palonosetron and dexamethasone for the prevention of
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients receiving highly or moderately
      emetogenic chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive different antiemetic regimens . In the
      experimental group,patients will receive aprepitant,olanzapine ,palonosetron and
      dexamethasone .In the other group,patients will accept the same dose of aprepitant
      ,palonosetron and dexamethasone .During the treatment, any grade of nausea and vomiting
      should be recorded in order to evaluate the complete response rate of CINV,nausea patients
      will be measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) ,other adverse events should be recorded as
      well.
