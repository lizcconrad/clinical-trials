      iConquerMS™ is a research initiative developed by and for people with multiple sclerosis (MS)
      to contribute their health data and ideas to advance and accelerate research into MS.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to create a Multiple Sclerosis Patient-Powered Research Network
      (MS-PPRN) that includes at least 20,000 people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who contribute
      data on their health and other topics. Survey data will be made available to research
      scientists who are studying MS and similar diseases. Our goal is to use this data to answer
      questions that researchers and people with MS have regarding the disease, including its
      causes, treatments, and other topics.

      The MS-PPRN will be part of a national network for conducting research called PCORnet, the
      National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network. PCORnet is supported by the
      Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). As the MS-PPRN is part of PCORnet, the
      data collected in surveys you complete may also be shared with researchers studying other
      diseases within the PCORnet network.

      While the MS-PPRN is focused on enrolling people with MS, people without MS are also welcome
      to participate in this research study.

      This study will be conducted online via the iConquerMS.org website. This is an ongoing study
      and will last for an indefinite period of time.
