      Purpose : Test the feasibility (acceptability, adherence) of a home-based interval exercise
      training (IET) and nutrition program, as well as its preliminary effects on resting heart
      rate, blood pressure, fasting glucose, HDL, cholesterol, weight and percent body fat, among
      primary care patients who have at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

      Participants : 30 patients who receive care from the University of North Carolina (UNC)
      Family Medicine Center (FMC) and meet the inclusion criteria defined below (i.e. general FMC
      patients, not diagnosed with severe illness), will be enrolled to test the feasibility of the
      home-based interval exercise and nutrition program.

      Procedures (methods): A home-based IET and nutrition program will be piloted in 2 phases. In
      Phase I, 15 patients will be enrolled into the program, which will take approximately 3
      months. At baseline, data will be collected on age, height, weight, resting heart rate, blood
      pressure, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, fasting lipids, cholesterol, insulin, percent body
      fat, cardiovascular fitness, and use a series of questionnaires to evaluate mood, sleep,
      hunger, and quality of life. At closeout, the investigators will measure patients' adherence
      to each component of the intervention. In Phase II, an additional 15 new patients will be
      enrolled in either the identical protocol, or a slightly modified intervention (if necessary
      based upon our results from Phase I). All patients will have the same variables measured at
      baseline during their study visit at 3, 6 and 12 months after enrollment into the study.
