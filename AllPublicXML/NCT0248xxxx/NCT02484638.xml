  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PK), efficacy, and safety
      of rVIIa-FP (CSL689). The study will enroll approximately 54 male subjects, 12 to 65 years of
      age, with hemophilia types A or B who have developed inhibitors to FVIII or FIX. The study
      consists of 3 sequential parts (Parts 1, 2, 3): The purpose of Part 1 (PK part) is to
      evaluate the PK of a single treatment of CSL689 (low dose or high dose) and compare with the
      PK of a single treatment of Eptacog alfa (low dose or high dose). In Part 1, CSL689 and
      Eptacog alfa will be given by the doctor at the study center. The purpose of Part 2
      (Dose-evaluation part) is to identify which of the 2 tested dose levels of CSL689 shows the
      best efficacy and safety in stopping acute bleeding events (this dose will be called the
      &quot;population best dose&quot;). The purpose of the final Part 3 (Repeated-dose part) is to confirm
      the efficacy and safety of the &quot;population best dose&quot; identified in Part 2. In Parts 2 and 3,
      subjects will self-administer a specified number of CSL689 infusions at home on-demand (ie,
      when a bleeding event occurs), will keep an electronic diary, and will visit the center at
      monthly intervals. This study is expected to last for up to 16 months for the subjects
      participating in all 3 parts, and up to 9 months for the subjects participating in Part 3
      only.
