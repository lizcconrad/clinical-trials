    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a disease that affects different areas of individual functioning, including
      the area of sexual life. Women with endometriosis have an impairment of desire and sexual
      arousal, orgasmic capacity reducted because of the pain and deep dyspareunia. The aim of the
      study is to evaluate the effectiveness of surgery on dyspareunia in women with endometriosis,
      taking into account other variables involved in determining dyspareunia: the quality of the
      couple relationship, anxiety and depression, body image, coping strategies and resilience.
