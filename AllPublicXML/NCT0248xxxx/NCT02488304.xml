  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to detect BOS in an early stage by using the outcome
      parameters generated by Functional Respiratory Imaging (FRI). Robust and automated
      segmentation algorithms will be developed for these parameters, focusing on quantitative
      computed tomography (CT) image analyses to provide the physician a more sensitive diagnostics
      tool. The evolution of rejection over time will be monitored using non-rigid image
      registration methods.
