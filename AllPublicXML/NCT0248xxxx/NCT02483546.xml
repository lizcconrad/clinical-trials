  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High fidelity Simulation has spread from anesthesiology to other disciplines such as internal
      medicine, pediatrics, and emergency medicine . Over the past decade, the use of simulation in
      medical education has increased exponentially. The term ''simulation'' spans a wide variety
      of formats, from the low-tech actor portraying a standardized patient to high-fidelity
      mannequin-based human patient simulation (HPS). HPS is able of both simulating realistic
      patient encounters and giving real-time, physiologically accurate feedback. Studies thus far
      show that use of simulation in training medical students and residents is helpful in
      strengthening students' knowledge and in evaluating their performance. Students appreciate
      simulation-based education as ''an opportunity to learn new skills in a safe environment .

      This was a randomized, controlled trial of a simulation- based educational intervention
      designed to increase medicine student's clinical skills in cardiac arrest procedures .The
      investigators included 181 fifth-year medical students rotating in the emergency department
      of Fattouma Bourguiba University hospital of Monastir (Tunisia) during the period from
      January 2013 to January 2014.Students were randomized into two groups using a random number
      generator to an intervention group (simulatortrained, n = 99) or a control group
      (traditionally teaching, n =82).

      The investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, non-blinded study to determine whether
      simulation based training is superior to traditional teaching in the assessment and
      management of simulated patients presenting with myocardial infarction (MI) complicated by
      ventricular fibrillation.

    <description>Pretest using 20 multiple choice questions after randomization. A second round of the same testing was then conducted for both groups just after the course (posttest). The test score range from 0 to 20 (maximum). The difference between the rating of the post-test and pre-test identifies the delta score of the student.</description>

    <description>Students rated their satisfaction level with a 5 point likert scale framed as attitude toward simulation compared with control group: dissatisfied (1 point), fairly satisfied (2 points), neither satisfied (3points), satisfied (4 points), and very satisfied (5 points).</description>

    <description>Students randomized to receive simulation training .The mannequin Siman 3G laerdal® displays multiple physiologic and pharmacologic responses. Three volunteers were involved in the scenario while the others were observers through an audiovisual projection. Students participating in the scenario were given 15 minutes to evaluate and manage a 60-year-old man with a known history of coronary artery disease and diabetes who presented to the emergency department with chest pain revealing an acute ST elevation myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation. Students were required to recognize and manage ventricular fibrillation when the patient became pulseless and unresponsive. After performing the simulation, the entire group was convened for debriefing of the case.</description>

    <description>students received a traditional course using slides during 60 minutes about the management of cardio pulmonary resuscitation according to the latest recommendations of the AHA. This course is offered by the same trainer who participated in the simulation session. Students were free to ask questions as the progress of education. The same educational objectives were treated with the two groups.</description>
