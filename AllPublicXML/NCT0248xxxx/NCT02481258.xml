    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the current study is to determine whether Ataciguat (HMR1766) slows
      progression of valve calcification in patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis.
      Secondary and tertiary objectives are to determine whether Ataciguat slows progression of
      aortic valve function, reduces systemic inflammation, and prevents left ventricular
      dysfunction in patients with moderate calcific aortic valve stenosis.

      Patients with Moderate Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis may be eligible for enrollment in this
      study. Participation lasts 12 months, which includes a total of 3 study visits
      (baseline/screening visit, 6 month follow up visit and 12 month follow up visit). During each
      visit, a blood sample will be taken along with other research related tests (Orthostatic
      Tolerance Standing Test, CT Scan, Echocardiogram, DEXA Scan). Qualifying Participants will be
      supplied with 6 months worth of study medication or placebo during visits 1
      (baseline/screening visit) and 2 (6 month follow up visit) in which they will take at home
      daily with food. On visit 3 (12 month follow up visit), any remaining study medication or
      placebo will be returned to study staff.

    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether long-term treatment with HMR1766 will result in sustained increases in systemic sGC signaling and halt accumulation of aortic valve calcium in patients with mild to moderate CAVS. This will be done using computed tomography (CT) scanning. Key comparision will be differences in the rate of change of calcium between patients receiving HMR1766 or placebo capsules.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in levels of plasma interleukin-6 and plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha following 6 and 12 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether long-term treatment with HMR1766 will result in sustained increases in systemic sGC signaling and reduce levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines in patients with mild to moderate CAVS. This will be done using ELISA-based measurements of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in venous blood samples. Key comparisons will be between HMR1766-treated and placebo-treated groups, where we will examine the change in inflammatory cytokine levels from baseline in subjects receiving HMR1766 or placebo capsules.</description>

    <measure>Change in aortic valve function following 6 and 12 months of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Determine whether long-term treatment with HMR1766 will result in sustained increases in systemic sGC signaling slow progression of aortic valve dysfunction in patients with mild to moderate CAVS. This will be done using echocardiography-based measurements of aortic valve function. Key comparisons will be between HMR1766-treated and placebo-treated groups, where we will examine the change in:
aortic valve area over time (calculated from the continuity equation) in subjects receiving HMR1766 or placebo capsules, AVA will be evaluated by both the absolute value and following normalization for body surface area, and
mean transvalvular pressure gradient over time (calculated from the blood velocity trace using the Bernoulli equation) in subjects receiving HMR1766 or placebo capsules.</description>

    <measure>Change in left ventricular function following 6 and 12 months of treatment</measure>

    <description>Determine whether long-term treatment with HMR1766 will result in sustained increases in systemic sGC signaling slow progression of aortic valve dysfunction in patients with mild to moderate CAVS. This will be done using echocardiography-based measurements of aortic valve function. Key comparisons will be between HMR1766-treated and placebo-treated groups, where we will examine the change in: 1. Left ventricular systolic function (measured by echocardiographic measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction) and 2. Left ventricular diastolic function (measured using the E/A ratio derived from Doppler measurements).</description>
