      A randomized single dose, drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers for VM - 1500
      given alone or in combination with Raltegravir or Darunavir in a 3 arm approach. The parallel
      design is used due to the long half life for VM-1500.

    <textblock>
      This drug-drug interaction study will not be done as a cross-over study due to the extreme
      long half life of the drug. The 24 healthy subjects participating will be randomized to
      VM-1500 alone or VM-1500 in combination with Raltegravir or Darunavir in parallel arms.

      For the cohort taking VM-1500 40 mg only just 4 subject will be enrolled as 6 subjects have
      been already on the same regimen in the trial before. Based on the parallel design it seems
      appropriate not to expose more healthy subjects than necessary. This means the available data
      of 6 subjects dosed with 40 mg VM-1500 alone will be matched.

      Three groups of healthy subjects will be randomized to VM-1500 alone or VM-1500 in
      combination with Raltegravir or Darunavir (4:10:10). The healthy subjects will stay at the
      unit and receive 40 mg VM-1500 alone or VM1500 in combination with Raltegravir or Darunavir
      one time and PK blood samples at several time points will be collected. PK (trough level)
      blood samples will also be collected at visits on Days 2, 4,7, 14, 21, and on Day 36.
