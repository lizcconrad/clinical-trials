  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a human papilloma virus (HPV)
      therapeutic vaccine called PepCan (HPV 16 E6 peptides combined with Candida skin testing
      reagent called Candin®) in adult females over a 12 month time period. As the results from the
      Phase I trial demonstrated some efficacy against non-16 HPV types, Candin alone will also be
      tested. Therefore, there will be two treatment arms: (1) PepCan and (2) Candin. Subjects
      found to be eligible for vaccination will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion at a 1:1
      ratio. Each participant will be receiving injections four times with three weeks between
      injections. Clinical and virological responses will be assessed at 6 and 12 months. Safety
      will be assessed from the time of enrollment to 12 Month Visit. Immunological assessments
      will be made at 4 time points (prevaccination, after 2 injections, 6 month after 4 injections
      and 12 months after 4 vaccinations).

    <description>clinical response will be assessed by obtaining colposcopy-guided quadrant biopsies at the 12 Months Visit. If, upon the 12 Months Visit biopsy, a subject does not have any evidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3, she would be considered a &quot;responder&quot;. Some would have regressed to CIN 1, and others may have no dysplasia. If there is still CIN 2 and/or 3 present at the 12 Months Visit, the subject will be considered a &quot;non-responder&quot;.</description>
