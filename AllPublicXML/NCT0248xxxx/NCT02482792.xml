  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to examine the effect of Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy (NPMP) in employees
      with long-lasting musculoskeletal pain compared to employees receiving Cognitive Patient
      Education in combination with active individual physiotherapy (COPE-PT) on pain, function,
      quality of life and sick-leave
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The NPMP is based on the assumption that patients with long-lasting problems, physical and/or
      psychological, may react with general aberrations related to posture, respiration, and
      movements, as well as with muscular tension and skin changes.

      Employees With Long lasting musculoskeletal pain problems, working in the Municipality of
      Bergen, will be invited to participate in an Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT), and randomized
      to either receive Norwegian Psychomotor Physiotherapy (NPMP) or a series of Cognitive Patient
      Education in combination with active individual physiotherapy (COPE-PT). The aim is to
      examine the effect of NPMP compared to those receiving COPE-PT on pain, function, quality of
      life and sick-leave.

    <description>NPMP is a body-mind awareness approach, often given in a combination of massage, exercises and conversations. The NPMP is individualized, with duration of 45-60 minutes in each session. As the NPMP is a longitudinal and normally slow process to obtain change, treatment can last up till one year, in the beginning once a week, and after some time once a month.</description>
