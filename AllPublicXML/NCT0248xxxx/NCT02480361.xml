  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI) is a common problem after major abdominal surgery. Acupuncture is
      being accepted in the West as a treatment option for managing POI and various functional
      gastrointestinal disorders. Therefore, we conducted a prospective randomized pilot study to
      evaluate the effect of electro-acupuncture on POI and other surgical outcomes in patients who
      underwent gastric surgery for a later large-scale study.

    <textblock>
      Before surgery, patients were randomized (using simple randomization) to either acupuncture
      (A) group or non-acupuncture (NA) group. In both groups, sitz markers were inserted in
      duodenum or jejunum during surgery for detection of postoperative remnant sitz markers by
      Xray. In the A group, acupuncture treatment was given once daily for up to 5 consecutive days
      starting on postoperative day 1. The acupuncture points which were used were based on
      traditional Korean medicine. No acupuncture treatment was performed in the NA group.
