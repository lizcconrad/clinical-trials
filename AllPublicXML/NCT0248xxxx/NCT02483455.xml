      This is a single-center, randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled phase-2 study of
      subjects 8 years of age and older with Common Warts (Verruca vulgaris) who desire treatment.
      A total of four visits are planned including one baseline and three follow-ups. Screening
      will be done at Visit 1 (Baseline) and all safety and efficacy measurements will be made at
      all subsequent visits (Visits 2-4).

      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of twice daily-applied ALC-919 vs. vehicle
      in male and female subjects 8 years of age and older with Common Warts (Verruca vulgaris).
      The primary outcome measure is complete resolution of lesions at the 12 week visit. Secondary
      outcome measures will include the change in lesion count at the 12 week visit, improvement in
      the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale score at the 12 week visit and the safety and
      tolerability profile of the treatment arm compared to the vehicle arm at each study visit.
      The safety will be assessed using clinical cutaneous safety exams that will report scaling,
      dryness and erythema on a scale of 0-3 (0= absent, 1=mild. 2=moderate, 3=severe).
      Tolerability will be assessed by having subjects answer the treatment tolerability questions
      at each visit during the treatment period. The tolerability question will be assessed using a
      0-3 scale for itching, burning, and stinging.
