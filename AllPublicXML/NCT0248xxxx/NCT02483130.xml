  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover study to determine whether a single dose of
      N-acetylcysteine (a nutritional supplement) can reduce brain glutamate levels in patients
      with a psychotic disorder. Secondary outcomes are to determine the pattern of alteration in
      brain perfusion and activity following a single dose of N-acetylcysteine.

    <textblock>
      This is a physiological, proof-of-concept study designed to investigate whether a single
      administration of N-acetylcysteine can reduce brain glutamate levels in people with psychotic
      disorders.

      Previous research suggests that poor response to antipsychotics may be linked to increased
      levels of glutamate in the brain (Egerton et al., 2012Í¾ Demjaha, Egerton et al., 2013).
      Reducing brain glutamate levels may therefore be therapeutic. This study tests whether it is
      possible to reduce brain glutamate levels in psychotic disorders.

      This is a small pilot study to determine whether a single administration of NAC can reduce
      brain glutamate levels in psychosis. At the same time, we will also examine the effects of
      NAC on brain resting perfusion and activity, to gain more information about how NAC may be
      acting.

      This study will recruit participants with a previous diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. There
      will be three study visits, 1-2 weeks apart. The first visit will involve a physical health
      check, blood sample and an interview to assess current symptoms and confirm medical history.
      On the second and third visits participants will have an MRI scan, lasting one hour, after
      taking capsules containing either 2400mg NAC or placebo.

      Samples are collected for two purposes.

        1. Participants are invited to donate samples to the BRC Bioresource. These samples may be
           used in the future for genetic, epigenetic, metabolomic or proteomic analysis.

        2. Participants will also be asked for a blood sample after completion of each MRI scan.
           These will be used to measure blood glutathione levels, which may be altered by
           N-acetylcysteine and therefore provide indication of pharmacological effect.

        Patients will be identified:

          1. Via South London and Maudsley (SLaM) clinical teams.

          2. If they have previously indicated to local research teams that they would like to be
             contacted about future research.

        2. Through the SLaM NIHR Bioresource, including patients in CRIS, the research informatics
        database, who have given consent to be contacted about research projects.
