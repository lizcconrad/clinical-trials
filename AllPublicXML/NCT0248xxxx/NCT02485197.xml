  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot aerobic training trial designed to examine differences between
      normal-high and low vitamin D levels and 7-days of aerobic training on local VO2 measured by
      non-invasive Hybrid Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy.

    <description>For 7 consecutive days, subjects will perform up to 45 minutes of exercise consisting of treadmill walking at a progressive intensity of about 60-65% of their maximum heart rate. This heart rate range is estimated to be below 60% VO2 max.</description>
