  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized, multi-center safety and feasibility trial of Aneufix ACP-T5 to
      treat patients with Isolated type II endoleak in the presence of a non-shrinking AAA sac
      following an EVAR procedure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational device is called Aneufix, more specifically the model ACP-T5, which is a
      product treating the endoleak by blockage of backflowing blood vessels, i.e. by filling the
      'endoleak void and nidus of feeding artery and exit of existing draining arteries'.

             procedure); AND

          2. Volume of the 'endoleak void' can be determined upfront; AND

          3. An EVAR without circulatory complications; AND

          4. An endoleak confirmed by CT scan in preceding 6 weeks demonstrating the high
             likelihood of the isolated nature of the endoleak; AND

          5. An aneurysm sac growing in contours after EVAR (per European Guidelines) as documented
             in the preceding 6 weeks by means of echo (or alternative visualization technique);
