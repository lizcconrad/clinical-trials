  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For many years, the treatment of jaundice due to head pancreatic adenocarcinoma is based on
      the endoscopic biliary stent. This technique has been shown to be preferable to a surgical
      shunt.

      Recently, adjuvant chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX regimen (clinical trial) has revolutionized
      the treatment of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma increasing overall survival in a major
      way. This design will also be developed in patients with neoadjuvant tumor called
      &quot;borderline&quot; (the limit of the resectability).

      However, several conditions (protocol) are required to consider the implementation of this
      design : age ≤ 75 years, PS 0 or 1, good hematological parameters and bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times
      the ULN.

      In addition, a randomized study showed that preoperative biliary stent treatment, despite a
      success rate of 94%, is associated with more complications than surgery fast (related gesture
      bladder).

      It would be interesting to analyze, prospectively, the fate of a series of patients with
      cancer of the pancreatic head with compression of the lower part of the bile duct, PS 0 or 1
      and for which the only limit to FOLFIRINOX design is jaundice or high risk of jaundice.
