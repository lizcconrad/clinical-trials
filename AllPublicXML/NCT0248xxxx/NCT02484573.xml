  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to investigate whether non-selective beta blocker treatment decreases
      intestinal permeability in cirrhotic patients by altering the expression of genes encoding
      intercellular junction proteins.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that the non-selective beta-blocker (NSBB) propranolol reduces intestinal
      permeability and decreases bacterial translocation in cirrhotic patients, independent of
      hemodynamic effects on portal pressure. The mechanism by which this decrease in intestinal
      permeability and bacterial translocation occurs has not been established. Among the proposed
      mechanisms are: modification of splanchnic hemodynamics, increased gastrointestinal motility,
      and immunological properties of nonselective beta blockade. It is not known, however, if
      beta-blocker treatment decreases intestinal permeability by altering the expression of genes
      encoding intercellular junction proteins. This study seeks to investigate this question to
      improve understanding of the mechanism by which beta-blockers work in primary and secondary
      prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.

    <description>Patients will take the non-selective beta blocker propranolol for approximately 4 weeks starting immediately after endoscopy for esophageal variceal ligation. Patients will be initiated on a dose of 20mg by mouth every 12 hrs before titration to maximum tolerated dose.
