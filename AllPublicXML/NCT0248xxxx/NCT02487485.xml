  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to provide insight into the impact of the immunosuppressant drug
      sirolimus, on the antidepressant effects of the prototypal rapid-acting antidepressant
      medication, ketamine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, randomized controlled trial
      investigating the impact of sirolimus on ketamine's antidepressant effects in participants
      with antidepressant-resistant depressive symptoms.

      Prior to this, there was a phase 1 which included monitoring 3 subjects over the course of 7
      days after a single dose of sirolimus and ketamine in order to inquire about side effects or
      interaction effects.
