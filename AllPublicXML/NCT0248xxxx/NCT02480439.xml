      The purpose of this study is to assess the relative bioavailability of a TAK-648 tablet
      compared with a TAK-648 oral solution, and to assess the effect of food on the
      bioavailability of a TAK-648 tablet in healthy participants.

    <textblock>
      This study will assess the relative Bioavailability (BA) of TAK-648 tablet compared with that
      of TAK-648 solution and the effect of food on the BA of the TAK-648 tablet.

      The study will enroll approximately 24 healthy participants. Participants will be randomly
      assigned to one of the three treatment sequences:

        -  TAK-648 tablet in fed state, followed by TAK-648 tablet in fasted state, followed by
           TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state

        -  TAK-648 tablet in fasted state, followed by TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state,
           followed by TAK-648 tablet in fed state

        -  TAK-648 oral solution in fasted state, TAK-648 tablet in fed state, TAK-648 tablet in
           fasted state The dosing in a period and the subsequent period will be separated by a
           minimum 7-day washout interval. Participants will be asked to take single dose of
           TAK-648 tablet or oral solution on Day 1 of each period.

      This single-center trial will be conducted in the United States. Participants will make 4
      visits to the clinic including three 4-day periods of confinement to the clinic, and will be
      contacted by telephone 30 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
