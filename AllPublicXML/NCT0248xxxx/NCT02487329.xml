  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical study was to evaluate the efficiency of Er,Cr:YSGG
      laser irradiation combined with a resin based tricalcium silicate material and calcium
      hydroxide (CH) in direct pulp capping for 3 months follow-up period.Sixty permanent vital
      teeth without symptoms and radiographic changes were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=15): Gr
      1: The exposed area was sealed with CH paste, Gr 2: The treated area was sealed with CH paste
      following Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiation at an energy level of 0,5 W without water and 45% air,
      Gr 3: Resin based tricalcium silicate material (TheraCal LC) was applied directly to the
      exposed pulp, Gr 4: TheraCal LC was applied following irradiation with Er,Cr:YSGG laser.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CH is used as gold standard in pulp capping procedures due to its beneficial properties such
      as induction of mineralization and inhibition of bacterial growth; however tunnel defects and
      cell inclusions in dentin bridges formed by CH may lead to leakage and bacteria penetration
      resulting in loss of vitality.

      TheraCal LC is a new light-cured, resin-modified, tricalcium silicate based material designed
      to use for direct and indirect pulp-capping aiming to achieve a bond to composite resins thus
      reducing micro-leakage.The formulation of TheraCal LC containing tricalcium silicate
      particles in a hydrophilic monomer provides significant calcium release that stimulates
      hydroxyapatite and secondary dentin bridge formation The use of laser for direct pulp capping
      has been suggested for the considerable advantages of lasers including decontamination
      effect, biostimulation effect, hemostatic and coagulant effect.The erbium,
      chromium-doped:yttrium, scandium, gallium and garnet (Er,Cr:YSGG) laser which is a relatively
      new device has been reported to ablate dental hard tissues thanks to its high absorption in
      water and also strong absorption by the hydroxyl radicals present in the hydroxyapatite
      structure
