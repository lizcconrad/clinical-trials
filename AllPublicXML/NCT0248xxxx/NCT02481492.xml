      This is a prospect, randomized control trial to evaluate merits between flip and no flip
      technique in Shang Ring children circumcision.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The boys between 7 and 12 years old seeking for circumcision in The Affiliated Hospital of
      Medicine School of Ningbo University will be evaluated. Those who match the inclusion
      criteria and without exclusion criteria will be recruited.

      The investigators will perform randomization preoperatively. participants were distributed
      into No Flip Group and Flip Group correspondingly according to a table of random number.

      All of the procedures will be performed by a specific study surgeon in the hospital operation
      room. An assistant will take the pictures and recorder the parameters needed. In both groups,
      participants will be measured twice by a scale plate of holes, the diameter of penis with the
      foreskin noneverted and the diameter of exposed glans. Local anesthesia will be administered
      to the dorsal penile nerve using 2% lidocaine. The operation will not begin until the
      anesthesia is satisfied. The proper ring will be chosen according to different strategies of
      two groups. Participants will stay in hospital for 24 hours after operation. Pain during
      operation, half a hour post-operation and 24 hours will be evaluated, adverse events at
      hospital will be recorded carefully as well.

      Participants will be advised to return usually at 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th and 90th
      post-operative days. However, if the wound does not heal completely 28 days post-operatively,
      the participant will be asked come to visit weekly until complete healing. All of the
      assessments will be performed and recorded by the lead investigator.

    <description>One group of boys will undergo a circumcision with no flip technique of Shang Ring Circumcision and receive regular follow-up to evaluate pain, operation associated adverse events, wound healing time. The Shang Ring will detach spontaneously without intervention, and the participants are asked to have a visit soon after ring detached. The last scheduled follow-up visit is at 90 days.</description>
