    <textblock>
      Ten patients who had had maxillectomy will be assigned to two groups employing two types of
      'temporary obturators. The obturators in the first group will be made from heat cure acrylic
      resin, whereas those in the second group from flexible resin.

      A comparison will be made between the two materials in terms of oral-nasal seal using the
      drinking water test as well as the mirror test.

      Oral rehabilitation following partial maxillectomy presents numerous clinical and technical
      issues. Using soft-tissue undercuts in the palatal side of the upper jaw is so useful for
      prostheses' retention over and above the abutment teeth. The use of flexible materials can
      serve this aim. The current study aims to compare the efficacy of nasal-oral seal using
      flexible materials against the traditional method of using heat activated acrylic materials.

    <description>Each patient is asked to drink an amount of water and keep a specific amount of water in the mouth for two to three minutes. He/she is asked to rotate his/her head 20-30 degrees downward and forward. During this period the amount of leaking water drops from the nose is collected and weighted.</description>

    <description>Each patient is asked to utter the following letters: K, T, D. A cold small mirror is placed in front of the nose during the utterance of these consonants. If a fogginess is observed on the mirror, this means that there is an oral-nasal leakage of air.</description>
