  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comprising two experiments, the investigators assessed the metabolic, endocrine and
      appetite-related responses to acute (1-d, part 1) and daily mid-morning milk consumption
      (28-d, part 2) in adolescent males (15-18 y).

      The aims of the present study were twofold. Firstly, this study sought to examine the acute
      (1-d) effects of mid-morning milk consumption on subsequent metabolic, endocrine and
      appetite-related responses relative to an isoenergetic and isovolumetric serving of
      fruit-juice (part 1). Considering the putative mechanisms of milk consumption on appetite,
      feeding behavior and metabolism no studies are available that have explored the impact of
      daily milk or dairy food consumption on the above mentioned constructs in children and
      adolescents. This study therefore also aimed to compare the effect of daily (28-d)
      mid-morning milk or fruit-juice consumption on the above mentioned constructs (part 2).

      Eleven adolescents participated in part 1 of this study and completed two trials (milk or
      fruit-juice mid-morning snack) in a randomized crossover design. For part 2, a parallel
      design with two intervention groups was employed. Participants were randomly allocated to
      groups, and received either a milk (n = 10) or an isocaloric and isovolumetric fruit-juice (n
      = 9) mid-morning snack for 28-d. On laboratory visits (for both part 1 and 2) participants
      remained at rest for 180 min. During this time, circulating concentrations of GLP-17-36,
      glucagon, insulin, leptin and blood glucose were determined. Measures of energy expenditure,
      substrate metabolism and subjective appetite were also collected. At 180 min, a homogenous ad
      libitum pasta meal was provided. For the remainder of the study day, subsequent energy intake
      was recorded utilizing a combined weighed self-reported food record and 24-h dietary recall
      technique.
