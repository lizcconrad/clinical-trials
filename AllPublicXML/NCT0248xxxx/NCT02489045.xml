  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized trial that will be conducted at two clinical sites,
      Thomas Jefferson University (TJU) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP).
      Enrolled patients undergoing trans-jugular liver biopsy with hepatic vein pressure gradient
      (HVPG) measurements will receive a continuous infusion of Sonazoid® (GE Healthcare, Oslo,
      Norway) co-infused with 0.9% NaCl solution over a 5-10 minute time period. Ultrasound imaging
      will be performed using a Logiq 9 scanner with a 4C transducer (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI)
      and the novel SHAPE (subharmonic aided pressure estimation) algorithm will be used to measure
      pressure values in the hepatic and portal veins. Data will be stored on a PC and compared to
      pressure-catheter measurements, Subjects identified in the initial examination as having
      portal hypertension (by HVPG results) will be monitored by SHAPE for up to 18 months. These
      subjects typically have surveillance Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) scans every 6 months to screen for liver cancer, and at those times a repeat SHAPE
      examination will be performed (ideally within 1 month of their clinically indicated imaging
      follow up appointment). In patients who undergo more frequent screening (generally 3 month
      intervals), SHAPE exams will be performed at 6 month intervals. Any repeat trans-jugular
      liver biopsies performed in this population will also trigger a repeat SHAPE study. Results
      of blood test evaluations (performed every 3 months in this population), medication,
      concomitant imaging study or procedure (including endoscopies) will be noted (all blood tests
      and imaging are clinically indicated only and are not required by this protocol). The end
      point for this part of the study will be any one new complication (e.g., liver cancer) or a
      marked worsening in any complication, liver transplantation, death, or the end of this
      clinical trial (after 3 years). The investigators expect these patients will be monitored
      three times during the course of this clinical trial. The time to reach the end point will be
      noted if a new complication or a marked worsening in any complication occurs.
