      The PediFETCh study is a pilot trial designed to assess the feasibility of fecal microbial
      transplants for the therapy of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) and pediatric inflammatory
      bowel disease-unclassified (IBD-U). Investigators will test the hypothesis that a protocol of
      twice-weekly retention enemas delivered over six weeks, using fecal transplant material from
      a healthy donor, will improve clinical and biological disease markers in patients with
      pediatric UC or IBD-U.

      BACKGROUND:

      Approximately 104,000 Canadians are affected by ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory
      bowel disease characterized by immune dysregulation. Ontario, Canada has some of the highest
      rates of childhood-onset UC in the world and this disease can be particularly debilitating in
      childhood. Effects on growth and development are profound in pediatric onset disease, and
      existing treatments, which include long-term immunosuppression, carry short and long-term
      risks of infection, malignancy, and toxicity.

      The intestinal bacteria has a critical role in the regulation of the immune system. Fecal
      microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of intestinal bacteria from a healthy donor to
      a recipient, has been shown to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile intestinal infections.
      The therapeutic potential of FMT for UC has been demonstrated in a recent adult UC trial at
      our institution (primary investigator: Dr. Paul Moayyedi; collaborator on the PediFETCh
      trial). Randomized, placebo-controlled trials of FMT in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease
      are nonexistent. FMT may present a valuable, safer therapeutic option for pediatric UC and a
      randomized-controlled trial is needed.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Our objective is to determine whether FMT can improve clinical, biological, and mucosal
      disease status in pediatric UC and IBD-U. This pilot study will provide access to FMT
      treatment and demonstrate the feasibility of our study design in order to establish a
      framework for future studies for assessing the effectiveness of FMT intervention.

      HYPOTHESES:

      Based on previously published case series in pediatrics, and a recent randomized controlled
      trial in adults, we hypothesize that participants receiving fecal microbial enemas containing
      healthy donor bacteria will experience clinical remission, improvement in inflammatory
      markers, and a longer duration of remission compared to participants receiving the placebo.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      The proposed study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, single-blind trial. Pediatric
      patients with a diagnosis of UC, or IBD-U will be enrolled and randomized to receive 6 weeks
      of bi-weekly fecal microbial enemas or normal saline enemas (placebo). Fecal enemas will
      contain healthy donor stool that has been extensively safety-screened and provided by
      Rebiotix(R) (RBX-2660). Participants may continue existing UC medical treatments (probiotics,
      5-ASAs, immunomodulators, anti-TNF), but no changes in dosing or new therapies will be
      permitted over the study period. All fecal enemas will be delivered in the study site by
      investigators to ensure consistency in technique and viability of fecal transplant material.
      Participants will have clinical disease activity scores measured at each enema administration
      (6 weeks), and at weeks 18 and 30. Stool samples will be collected at time points throughout
      the trial for microbiome analyses, and fecal calprotectin measurements, with support from the
      Farncombe Family Digestive Health Research Institute. Bloodwork will be collected throughout
      the trial to further measure change in biological disease activity.

      SAMPLE SIZE:

      50 patients will be recruited for the trial. Participants will be single-blinded, and
      randomized to placebo or treatment arms.

      SAFETY MONITORING:

      Study risks include complications of fecal microbial transplants (infection, fever). Based on
      results of previous studies, and existing safety data of the fecal enema preparation
      (RBX2660) from previously conducted trials, the risks of infection, adverse gastrointestinal
      symptoms, or other adverse events are extremely low. The fecal enema preparation used in this
      trial (RBX2660) by Rebiotix(R) has received FDA IND and Health Canada approvals for clinical
      trials in recurrent C. difficile. Donors are initially prescreened, and donor blood and stool
      are extensively screened at two discrete time points prior to administration. We will be
      providing close follow-up of participants throughout the trial at our center, and in
      partnership with the referring physician up to bi-weekly throughout the trial.

      OUTCOMES:

        1. Primary outcomes for this pilot trial are measures of feasibility.

        2. Secondary outcomes are measures of clinical response. These include: clinical response
           (Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index [PUCAI] scores), biological response (serum
           bloodwork measures), mucosal healing (fecal calprotectin levels), and change in fecal
           microbiome (change in 16s rRNA, inferred metagenome, metabolome). We will not be
           assessing other indices of mucosal healing in this trial.
