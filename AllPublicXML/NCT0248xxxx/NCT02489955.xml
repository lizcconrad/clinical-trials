  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are treated with high dose antibiotics to reduce the
      long term damage to their lungs from infection. This would typically be with a two week
      course of intravenous antibiotics each time they have a chest infection (typically three to
      four times a year).

      The most effective and commonly used antibiotic in most cases is tobramycin. If this cannot
      be used because of previous side effects, allergy or a resistant infection then colomycin or
      amikacin are usually used. Each of these antibiotics are known to be toxic to both the
      kidneys and ear. As patients are living longer (into their forties), the total amount of
      these antibiotics they are receiving over their lifetime is increasing. This is now leading
      to increased complications such as kidney damage and hearing loss. Because of this, the
      investigators need to look at methods to accurately quantify damage and reduce potential
      kidney and hearing damage.

      The investigators intend to quantify kidney damage by measuring new protein markers within
      the urine and blood that signify kidney damage before more conventional and currently
      available methods are able to.In those patients treated with intravenous tobramycin the
      investigators will also look at an alternative method used to calculate the most appropriate
      dose of antibiotic for each participant. This dosing method is called 'area under the curve
      or AUC' dose monitoring. This method currently in clinical use in other countries is thought
      to more accurately reflect the most appropriate dose for each participant and thus reduce the
      chance of kidney and hearing problems. This 'AUC' method requires two rather than one dose
      level to be checked each time a dose calculation is made. Participants receiving tobramycin
      will be randomised to receive dosing by this method or the investigators' currently used
      method of 'trough' monitoring.
