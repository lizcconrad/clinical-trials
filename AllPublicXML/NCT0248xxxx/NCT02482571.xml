  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this research is to measure changes in neurochemical concentrations
      during stimulation of the primary visual cortex, in both conditions of normoxia (normal
      oxygen availability) and induced mild hypoxia (reduced oxygen availability).

      The goal is to determine the effect of mild hypoxia on human brain energy metabolism of
      healthy young adult subjects. For this purpose, the Investigator will utilize non-invasive
      imaging modalities based on functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) to estimate
      metabolic changes during a visual stimulus, while subjects are exposed to well-controlled gas
      mixtures that resembles conditions of either normoxia or mild hypoxia. Identifying the impact
      of mild hypoxia on functional brain energy metabolism in the healthy human brain is a crucial
      step for generating hypotheses in multiple patient populations that experience mild hypoxia
      as consequence of their pathological condition, such as in sleep apnea and traumatic brain
      injury. The Investigator hypothesize that the energetic demands of neuronal activation as
      revealed by fMRS will not be affected by mild hypoxia.

    <description>Subjects are exposed to an intervention that controls the composition of breathed air by using a gas blender (RespirAct).

    <description>During normoxia, the computer-controlled gas blender provides a gas mixture that generates pressures of expired O2 and CO2 similar to the resting values measured for each subject (32-35mmHg and 100-110 mmHg, respectively). During mild hypoxia, we will target the same expired CO2 of normoxia and a 60 mmHg reduction of expired O2 from the resting value (to a minimum limit of 50 mmHg), which is expected to reduce arterial oxygen saturation to 82-85%. In mild hypoxia, the fraction of inspired oxygen is reduced from ~21% (room air) to ~12% (equivalent to an altitude of 4000 meters). During both conditions of normoxia and mild hypoxia, the brain activity of subjects is monitored with functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) while they are presented with visual stimuli.</description>

            <title>Mild Hypoxia</title>
            <description>Mild Hypoxia: During normoxia, the computer-controlled gas blender provides a gas mixture that generates pressures of expired O2 and CO2 similar to the resting values measured for each subject (32-35mmHg and 100-110 mmHg, respectively). During mild hypoxia, we will target the same expired CO2 of normoxia and a 60 mmHg reduction of expired O2 from the resting value (to a minimum limit of 50 mmHg), which is expected to reduce arterial oxygen saturation to 82-85%. In mild hypoxia, the fraction of inspired oxygen is reduced from ~21% (room air) to ~12%. During both conditions of normoxia and mild hypoxia, the brain activity of subjects is monitored with functional MRI (fMRI) and functional MRS (fMRS) during visual stimuli.</description>
