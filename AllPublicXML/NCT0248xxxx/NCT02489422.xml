    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies how well two supportive programs work for improving
      fatigue and depressive symptoms in patients with stage II-IV colorectal cancer undergoing
      chemotherapy. Possible mediators such as psychological stress, circadian disruption, and
      inflammation, will also be explored.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the yoga skills training (YST) versus a
      caring attention control (AC) group among 60 adults with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving
      chemotherapy to determine preliminary efficacy for the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary
      outcome of depressive symptoms, and possible mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian
      disruption, inflammation) as assessed by standard measures.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily assessments of fatigue, depressive
      symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore relationships among daily and
      standard assessments.

      II. To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the YST and AC and acceptability of new
      methodology through semi-structured interviews in a subset of 20-40 participants.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (YST): Patients participate in YST consisting of four 30 minute in-person yoga
      sessions at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 that instructs skills to enhance mindfulness and promote
      relaxation, through instruction of awareness, movement, breathing practices, and meditation.

      GROUP II (AC): Patients participate in four 30 minute in-person sessions of supportive
      conversation at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>At 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be assessed with the 7-item measure of Fatigue from the PROMIS-cancer specifically designed for use in cancer patients. Key statistical tests will involve between group differences in mean values and group differences in the patterns (i.e., slopes) of individual changes from respective baseline values of the PROMIS fatigue scores. These tests will be evaluated using mixed-effects (or multilevel) generalized linear modeling procedures with robust variance estimation. Bootstrapping methods will be used to generate 95% confidence intervals for all sample descriptive statistics.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circadian disruption (daily)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circadian disruption will be assessed with actigraphy. Circadian disruption is defined as a ratio of nighttime activity to daytime activity with higher scores indicating greater circadian disruptions. Summaries of the proportion and frequency of missing daily assessments will inform the feasibility of collecting this type of data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Circadian disruption (recalled)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Circadian disruption will be assessed with measures of activity and rest. Activity will be measured using the 3-item Godin's leisure score index (LSI), previously used with colorectal cancer patients during chemotherapy. Rest will be assessed with the 8-item PROMIS sleep disturbance short-form.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depressive symptoms assessed by PROMIS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed with the standardized10-item PROMIS-cancer depressive symptoms short-form. Key statistical tests will involve between group differences in mean values and group differences in the patterns (i.e., slopes) of individual changes from respective baseline values of the PROMIS fatigue scores. These tests will be evaluated using mixed-effects (or multilevel) generalized linear modeling procedures with robust variance estimation. Bootstrapping methods will be used to generate 95% confidence intervals for all sample descriptive statistics and effect estimates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Fatigue (daily)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 weeks</time_frame>
