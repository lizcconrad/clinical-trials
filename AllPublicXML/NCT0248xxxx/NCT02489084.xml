  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background of the study:

      Swallowing dysfunction and xerostomia are the most frequently reported radiation-induced side
      effects (RISE) after (chemo) radiation ((CH) RT) in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and
      have a major impact on the general dimensions of quality of life (QoL). In
      radiation0oncology, normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models based on dose-volume
      parameters being used to determine the risk of acute and late RISE. NTCP models containing
      genetic determinants of radiosensitivity, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), may
      improve model performance and thus enable more individualized radiotherapy. Information of
      the predictive value of SNPs or SNP signatures among patients with HNC is currently not
      available.

      Objective of the study:

      The main objective of this project will be to test the hypothesis that SNP profiles can
      improve the performance of predictive models for the most frequently reported late RISE, i.e.
      dysphagia, in HNC patients after curative (CH) RT. Secondary objectives will be improvement
      of NTCP models for HNC patients by adding SNP profiles predictive of (1) acute mucositis; (2)
      acute dysphagia; (3) salivary dysfunction; (4) acute xerostomia; (5) late xerostomia; (6)
      osteoradionecrosis; (7) hypothyroidism; (8) patient-rated HNC symptoms and ; (9) quality of
      life.
