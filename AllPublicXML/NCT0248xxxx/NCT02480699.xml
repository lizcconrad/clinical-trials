  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by a irreversible decrease of kidney functions.
      It is characterized by accumulation of solutes called uremic toxins. Uremic toxins levels are
      implicated in cardiovascular complications associated with CKD. Several protein-bound toxins
      have been implicated in the increased cardiovascular risk such as indoxyl sulfate (IS), p
      cresol sulfate (pCS) and more recently the indole acetic acid (IAA). All clinical studies are
      performed with a single measurement at baseline assuming that the toxin levels are stable
      over time. The variability of uremic toxins level is not known. Furthermore, little is known
      concerning determinants of serum toxins level.

      Colonic absorption play a major role in IS (indoxyl sulfate) and pCS level. IS and pCS level
      are significantly reduced in patient with colectomy. To validate the measurement of uremic
      toxins level in serum as biomarkers for cardiovascular risk, we need to know about
      intra-individual variability over time and the impact of diet or digestive disorders on
      uremic toxin serum level. We propose a prospective study evaluating the intra-individual
      variability in 3 uremic toxins serum levels the SI, the pCS and IAA.

      The main objective is to study the kinetics of three serum uremic toxins: the indoxyl
      sulfate, p cresyl sulfate and indole acetic acid (and thus determine the intra-individual
      variability) in a population of chronic hemodialysis patients during 1 year.

    <description>A dietary survey will be performed in all patients and every 3 months (4 surveys about 1 year). This survey will be given to the patient filled for 7 consecutive days. He must record during these 7 days, all of his food intake in quality and quantity. During a dialysis session this questionnaire will be taken with the patient by a dietician to better define the food intake. This surveys requires good patient compliance as well as his involvement that his collection is well within its food intake.</description>
