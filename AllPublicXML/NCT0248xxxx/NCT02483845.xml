  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle biopsies of patients with Inclusion Body Myositis (IBM) have demonstrated a T-cell
      predominant inflammatory infiltrate, therefore, new agents targeting T -cell mediated cell
      death may be a novel treatment for IBM. Such an agent capable of preventing T-cell movement
      out of the vasculature, such as natalizumab, may be beneficial in IBM patients. Six patients
      will be recruited to participate in this phase I trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I open label, non-placebo controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy
      of natalizumab in patients with IBM. Pre and post treatment muscle biopsies including
      measurements of the degree of inflammation as well as the types of inflammatory cells will be
      measured. The investigators will also assess quality of life, the inclusion body myositis
      functional rating score (IBM-FRS), and patient and physician global impression of change.
      Manual muscle testing and quantitative dynamometry will also be evaluated to see if patient's
      strength improves.

      Patients who are eligible to participate and have signed a consent form will have a muscle
      biopsy performed at baseline and at the end of the study. Physical and neurological exams, as
      well as IBM-FRS, safety labs will be conducted and collected at monthly visits. Patients will
      start natalizumab therapy at 300mg intravenously every 4 weeks for 24 weeks. All study
      related procedures will be conducted at Phoenix Neurological Associates, as well as all
      infusions and muscle biopsies
