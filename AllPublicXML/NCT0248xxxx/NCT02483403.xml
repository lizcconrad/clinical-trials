    <textblock>
      Healthy elderly subjects male and female aged 65-85 will undergo MRI, lung function and
      exercise testing for the development of tools to quantify and validate longitudinal in vivo
      magnetic resonance imaging phenotypes of the aging lung.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Briefly, during a single four hour visit, subjects will perform: 1) physical exam, 2) full
      pulmonary function tests, 3) cycle ergometry, 4) dyspnea and exertions scores using Borg
      scales, 5) BOLD Questionnaire and 6) 3He MRI before and after bronchodilation by deep
      inspiration, and potentially 25 minutes after inhalation of 2 puffs (200 µg) of the
      short-acting bronchodilator salbutamol in subjects who do not respond with 3He MRI
      ventilation improvements to deep inhalation. Hand-held spirometry will be performed post deep
      inspiration, and post salbutamol in those who receive salbutamol.

      Subjects will first provide written informed consent and then be screened for MRI
      compatibility and will complete dyspnea and exertion scales, and full pulmonary function
      tests. A physical exam including vital signs and medical and smoking history will be
      performed. Subjects will complete the Bold Occupational Questionnaire and rest for
      approximately 15 minutes before cycle ergometry, including pre-and-post Borg scale
      evaluations. After completion of cycle ergometry, subjects will rest upright for 15 minutes
      and prepare for MRI which will be performed on 3 occasions within 1 hour: 1) before deep
      inspiration, 2) 3 minutes later after deep inspiration and, 3) 25 minutes later after
      inhalation of 2 puffs of salbutamol in subjects who do not respond to deep inhalation. Images
      obtained post deep inhalation will be assessed on the spot to determine if administration of
      salbutamol is required to resolve ventilation defects. Hand-held spirometry will also be
      performed post deep inspiration and post salbutamol in those who receive salbutamol.

    <intervention_name>Hyperpolarized Helium-3</intervention_name>
    <description>Hyperpolarized noble gas imaging using Helium-3 has been used to explore structural and functional relationships in the lung in patients with lung disease and healthy controls. In contrast to proton-based MRI imaging, Helium-3 gas is used as a contrast agent to directly visualize the airways, and thus ventilation. Whereas the normal density of gas is too low to produce an easily detectable signal, this is overcome by artificially increasing the amount of polarization per unit volume using optical pumping.</description>
