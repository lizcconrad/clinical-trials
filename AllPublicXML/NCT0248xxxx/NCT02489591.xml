  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is characterized by collapse of one or more pharyngeal
      structures during sleep (velum, tongue base, lateral walls, epiglottis). Structure-specific
      therapies for OSA have emerged as alternatives to positive airway pressure (PAP). Oral
      appliance (OA) therapy is increasingly being indicated for OSA treatment, although a complete
      response occurs in approximately 50% of patients. In general, OA devices are designed to
      maintain the mandible and/or tongue in a protruded posture during sleep, preventing upper
      airway obstruction. Limited studies in awake or sedated patients have demonstrated the
      effects of mandibular advancement on aspects of pharyngeal structure and function. The
      objective of the proposed research is to fully characterize upper airway collapse in OSA
      patients during natural sleep and use this information to understand why some patients appear
      to exhibit a large improvement in pharyngeal collapsibility whereas others do not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OSA patients will undergo a baseline sleep endoscopy study to identify the site of pharyngeal
      collapse. Subsequently, they will undergo two clinical polysomnographies (PSGs) to measure
      the effect of an oral appliance (a site specific therapy) on upper airway collapsibility and
      sleep apnea severity. During the first hour of each clinical PSG, the passive pharyngeal
      collapsibility will be determined using the standard 5-breath continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) drop method. During the remainder of the night, patients will be monitored to
      determine sleep apnea severity (apnea-hypopnea index). These measurements will allow the
      investigators to determine which pharyngeal collapsing site responds best (both in terms of
      collapsibility and AHI) to mandibular advancement with an oral appliance. Patients who have
      their own oral appliance will be recruited. In addition, patients without an oral appliance
      will be provided with a temporary oral appliance for the study.

    <description>The passive pressure-flow relationship is characterized by the critical closing pressure (Pcrit) , and the ventilatory flow at atmospheric pressure ( V passive). Pcrit and V passive will be determined using the standard 5-breath CPAP drop method.
The change in collapsibility will be compared across subgroups defined by the site of collapse measured using sleep-endoscopy. Patients will sleep supine for this measurement.</description>

    <description>The change in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI, 3% desaturation or arousal criteria; OA therapy minus control) will be compared across subgroups defined by the site of collapse measured using sleep-endoscopy. Baseline collapsibility will be incorporated as a predictor of the change in AHI.</description>
