      Randomized clinical trial with outpatient patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated in
      Endocrinology Division, Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre. The study aims to carry out a
      nutritional counseling directed to offer benefits in metabolic control in diabetic patients.
      The initial step will be performed analysis of composition and diet quality, and
      anthropometric and laboratory evaluation. After initial assessment and meeting the criteria
      eligibility, patients will be randomized to receive nutritional counseling from diet quality
      (intervention group) or usual diet in according to current nutritional recommendations
      (control group). Both the groups will receive adjust caloric intake as the nutritional needs
      of each patient. Patients will be followed over six months, on a monthly basis from hospital
      visits or telephone monitoring. The outcomes evaluated will be: the achievement of
      therapeutic targets (fasting blood glucose levels between 70-130 mg / dL, HbA1c&lt;7%, LDL
      cholesterol &lt;100 mg/dL and triglycerides &lt;150 mg/dL); use of antidiabetic drugs,
      lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drugs, and adherence to necessary dietary changes.
