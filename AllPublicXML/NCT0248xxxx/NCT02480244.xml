  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized trial (CRT) to assess the effectiveness of a culturally
      appropriate behavioral intervention to reduce obesity levels and ultimately the risk of
      developing diabetes type II in immigrant Latino farm workers. Randomization is at the farm
      ranch level. Individuals at intervention ranches will receive a multi-week curriculum at the
      work-site on diabetes, diet and physical activity and optional supplemental sessions in the
      evening and weekends. The investigators will adopt the intent-to-treat principle for the
      primary analysis. Individuals on control ranches will receive no health educational
      instruction. The primary outcome is BMI. The investigators hypothesize that intervention
      ranches will achieve significant improvement in obesity and diabetes risk factors as compared
      to control ranches.
