  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is the most empirically supported and researched
      treatment for eating disorders. A central component of CBT for eating disorders is
      self-monitoring which involves patients keeping a paper food record of their meals and
      associated thoughts, feelings, and behaviours and receiving feedback from a clinician to help
      target dysfunctional cognitions and behaviours. Given the issues associated with paper
      journals such as non-compliance, feelings of shame when used in public, and delayed feedback,
      researchers have developed an evidence-based smartphone application (Recovery Record) for
      eating disorder self-monitoring that links patients with their clinicians and offers
      additional features designed to enhance treatment.

      The current pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) seeks to evaluate this smartphone
      application in a clinical setting alongside standard eating disorder outpatient treatment.
      Patients will be recruited from the Nova Scotia Health Authority Eating Disorder Outpatient
      Program and randomised to receive either standard treatment or standard treatment with the
      app (instead of the paper food record). The efficacy and acceptability of both treatments
      will be assessed and compared. Coping skill use and self-efficacy among patients will also be
      examined given the skill building focus of treatment and in-app capabilities to deliver
      real-time coping skill suggestions to patients.

      This pilot study will be the first to examine the efficacy and acceptability of a smartphone
      application in eating disorder clinical treatment and if successful, should provide
      preliminary support for the use of smartphone applications over traditional paper food
      journals as a self-monitoring tool for augmenting specialty eating disorder clinical
      treatment.

    <description>Standard treatment offered by the Nova Scotia Health Authority Eating Disorder Outpatient Program varies in intensity but involves therapy groups (e.g., goal setting and skill building groups), individual contact, and meal experiences. Minimal participation in the program consists of a weekly nutritional counselling group (Nutri-Logical) and one supervised meal a week. In the nutritional counselling group, patients keep a food journal (self-monitor), set eating goals, receive feedback from a psychologist and dietitian, and share experiences with the group.</description>
