      Primary Objective:

      To compare the radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) of chemotherapy (cabazitaxel
      plus prednisone, Arm A) versus AR-targeted therapy (enzalutamide or abiraterone acetate plus
      prednisone, Arm B) in mCRPC patients who have been treated with docetaxel and who had disease
      progression while receiving AR-targeted therapy within 12 months of AR treatment initiation
      (≤12 months, either before or after docetaxel).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare efficacy for:

        -  Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate and time to PSA progression (TTPP).

        -  Progression-free survival (PFS).

        -  Overall survival (OS).

        -  Tumor response rate and duration of tumor response.

        -  Pain response and time to pain progression.

        -  Symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) rate and time to occurrence of any SSE.

        -  Health status and Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL).

        -  To evaluate the correlation of a signature of resistance to AR-targeted agents with
           clinical outcome via the analysis of circulating tumor cell (CTC) phenotypes as well as
           expression and localization of proteins including AR isoforms in CTCs.

        -  To evaluate safety in the 2 treatment arms.

      The duration of the study per patient will be approximately 2 years. Each patient will be
      treated until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient's refusal
      of further study treatment, and each patient will be followed after completion of study
      treatment until death, study cutoff date, or withdrawal of patient consent.
