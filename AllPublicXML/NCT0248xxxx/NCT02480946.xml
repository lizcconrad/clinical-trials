  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) affects 1 percent of the population worldwide and up to 40 percent
      of patients don't respond to current treatments. MBS2320, the drug being tested in this
      trial, represents a new approach to treating RA, with the potential not only to reduce levels
      of inflammation but to also directly inhibit bone damage.The aim of this study is to test the
      safety of MBS2320 in healthy volunteers, to find out how MBS2320 levels change in the blood
      with dose, and to test the safety and compatibility of giving MBS2320 to patients with RA in
      combination with an existing treatment, methotrexate.

      The study will be conducted in 4 parts (parts A to D). The principal aim of this study is to
      obtain safety and tolerability data when MBS2320 is administered orally as single and
      multiple doses to healthy subjects (parts A to C). The effect of MBS2320 on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of the first-line rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapy, methotrexate
      (MTX), and the effect of MTX on the PK of MBS2320, will also be evaluated in a cohort
      consisting of subjects with RA (Part D).
