      This is a prospective, single arm,single centre open-label, phase II study in relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL and MCL non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), not suitable to other therapies,
      included HDCT, or patients relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT) with autologous
      stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), treated with peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with
      90Y-Dotatoc.

      Each patient will receive a maximum cumulative 90Y-DOTATOC activity of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi),
      divided into 4 cycles (1.8 - 2.8 gigabequerel (GBq) for each cycle) with an interval of 6 - 8
      weeks between cycles. The 90Y-DOTATOC will be slowly infused intravenously.

      35 patients will be enrolled in 36 months in two stages (18 patients in the first stage, if 2
      or fewer patients will show an objective response, the study will be closed).

      PEPTIDE RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY (PRRT) WITH 90Y-DOTATOC IN RELAPSED/REFRACTORY DIFFUSE
      LARGE B CELL AND MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMAS.

      This is a prospective, single arm, open-label, phase II study. It is estimated that a maximum
      of 35 patients will be enrolled in 36 months; the treatment efficacy will be tested in 18
      patients in the first stage, if 2 or fewer patients will show an objective response, the
      study will be closed; if &gt; 2 objective responses will be observed, a total of 35 patients
      will be enrolled.

      Follow up period is 48 months.

      Single-center

      The primary objective is the evaluation of objective response rate (ORR). of Y-PRRT in
      relapsed or refractory DLBCl and MCL NHL, not suitable to other therapies, included HDCT, or
      patients relapsed after HDCT with ASCT.

      The secondary objectives are toxicity (acute and late), progression free survival, overall
      survival and Quality of life.

      35 patients will be enrolled in 36 months in two stages (18 patients in the first stage, if 2
      or fewer patients will show an objective response, the study will be closed).

      Each patient will receive a maximum cumulative 90Y-DOTATOC activity of 11.1 GBq (300 mCi),
      divided into 4 cycles (1.8 - 2.8 GBq for each cycle) with an interval of 6 - 8 weeks between
      cycles. The 90Y-DOTATOC will be slowly infused intravenously.

      The study will be conducted following the Optimal Two Stage Design assuming the true response
      probability:

        -  under H0 (p0) &lt;=10%

        -  under H1 (p1) &gt;=30% and considering alpha=0.05 and power=0.90.
