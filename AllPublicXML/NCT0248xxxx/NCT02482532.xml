      The researchers will investigate if modified T-cells from a patients own system can be
      utilized to find and destroy metastatic melanoma tumor and thus improve patient outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of progression free survival at one (1) year is &lt; 20% for patients with stage IV
      metastatic melanoma, despite aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens and newly approved
      immunomodulatory and targeted therapy. Immunotherapy seems to hold the most promise for
      achieving prolonged survival or even cure, therefore,efforts have focused on several
      different approaches. Such approaches have used tumor vaccination, adoptive transfer of tumor
      infiltrating lymphocytes, and even monoclonal antibodies, unconjugated or conjugated to
      cytokines, toxins, or radionucleotides.

      The tumor-associated antigen GD2 has been noted on the surface of several tumors, most
      notably neuroblastoma, but is expressed on melanoma as well. Clinical studies have shown
      activity of a GD2-specific chimeric T-cell receptor expressed on activated, autologous,
      T-cells in patients with neuroblastoma. It is the investigators intention to enrich
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma with
      vaccine-specific T-cells through pre-harvest/ phlebotomy vaccination with common, well
      understood vaccines. The investigators will then modify the T-cells to attack the GD2
      antigen. These tumor redirected, vaccine specific, activated T-cells will then be infused
      into the patient following revaccination with the common vaccines. The Investigators will
      monitor expansion of the modified T-cells through serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      assays following vaccination.

      The Investigators then intend to re-vaccinate with the selected vaccines one month following
      infusion and monitor for expansion of the modified T-cells.
