  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common heart rhythm disorder which can significantly affect a
      patient's quality of life.

      Abnormal electrical activity from the 4 veins that drain into the left atrium (top left
      chamber of the heart), is the main cause of this condition. Catheter ablation and this
      involves making tiny burns within the left atrium that electrically disconnects these veins
      form the rest of the left atrium (pulmonary vein isolation). Abnormal electrical activity can
      be as a result of the nerves supplying the heart and destroying the collection of these nerve
      endings (ganglionic plexi ablation) can be helpful in eliminating the abnormal electrical
      activity. Catheter ablation for AF and study the affect of ganglionic plexi ablation on the
      success of this treatment option. All patients will be grouped by low or high preexisting
      scar. The investigators plan to recruit patients undergoing ablation with proportionate
      numbers in both existing scar groups. Patients will be randomly assigned into the two
      treatment groups each with different treatment strategies

        1. Pulmonary vein isolation alone

        2. Ganglionic plexi ablation alone There will be pre and post procedure tests as per
           optimal clinical practice. Some patients may require a repeat procedure if they have
           documented recurrence. This will be done after a minimum of 6 months. The redo-procedure
           will be pulmonary vein isolation for both groups with the ganglionic plexi arm receiving
           a lesions encircling the pulmonary veins. This will enable the study to report outcomes
           from 3 groups.

      Any patients referred for symptomatically and clinically indicated AF ablation studies will
      be recruited. 180 patients undergoing first time ablation for documented paroxysmal AF
      ablation.

        1. Catheter ablation within the left atrium that electrically disconnects these veins form
           the rest of the left atrium (pulmonary vein isolation)90 patients

        2. Catheter ablation around the nerve supplying the heart and destroying the collection of
           these nerve endings (ganglionic plexi ablation)90 patients

      Follow Up Period: 1 year

      The Time Frame of the study is 1 year. At this point the outcome will be assessed and the
      data will be presented at 18 months.

      Patients will undergo routine pre and post op checks for assessment as per optimal clinical
      follow up. Pre procedure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be used for registering
      anatomy onto 3D location systems. However In addition we will assess pre-existing atrial scar
      which has been associated with clinical outcomes on previous studies. We will ensure equal
      numbers of patients in both low and high scarring groups. All patients will have an MRI scan
      of the heart pre procedure to assess for pre-existing scar and at 3 months following the
      procedure to detect areas where the burns have been made.

      In addition to the usual clinical outcomes burden, we will look at clinical outcome rates of
      atrial burden. The patients will have a 48 hour monitor at 3,6,9 and 12 months to assess the
      response to the treatment. All patients will be reviewed at 3 months post procedure for
      symptoms and again at 6 months with both a heart monitor and symptom questionnaire to
      determine if a redo procedure is required. In addition, all patients will undergo a repeat
      MRI scan at 3 months to look for scaring of the heart.

      Some patients may require a repeat procedure if they have documented recurrence. There is a 3
      month blanking period which is ignored as part of the healing process, however the following
      3 months will be assessed for recurrence hence a minimum of 6 months prior to consideration
      of a redo procedure. If the patient gets symptomatic documented AF lasting &gt;30 seconds than a
      redo AF ablation procedure will be offered to the patient as per standard clinical practice.
      The procedure will be pulmonary vein isolation for both groups with the ganglionic plexi arm
      receiving a lesions encircling the pulmonary veins. This will enable the study to report
      outcomes from 3 groups.

      End points will be compared by Primary- Documented recurrent atrial arrhythmia lasting
      &gt;30secs. (after a blanking period of 8 weeks) on 48 hour holter.

      Secondary- Mortality,Redo-AF ablation procedure, Major complications (stroke,
      pericardiocentesis, bleed requiring transfusion)

      Statistical methodology The primary endpoints will be analysed in the two groups by the
      Fisher's test.
