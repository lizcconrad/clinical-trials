  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to conduct a head-to-head, randomized clinical trial to compare the
      effectiveness of Minoxidil with Spironolactone and Finasteride in treating postmenopausal
      females with Androgenetic Alopecia (AGA).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants diagnosed with AGA will be randomized into one of the two treatment arms
      outlined below, and will take the assigned treatment for a total duration of 12 months.
      Medications will be dispensed by a nurse who is blinded to the participants within each
      treatment group. Global photograph assessment and participant questionnaires at 0, 4, 8 and
      12 months will be the primary means to determine improvement in hair loss.

      Compare the following interventions in treating postmenopausal female AGA:

      A) Combination 5% Minoxidil and 200mg Spironolactone (Combination Group) B) 5mg Finasteride
      with placebo topical preparation (Single Group)

    <description>The value will be one of 7 numbers, ranging from -3 to +3. The values will stand for the following:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  female

          -  postmenopausal (&gt;60 years old or with total hysterectomy)

          -  diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia

          -  no chemical processing or changes in hair products throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  men

          -  premenopausal women (&lt;60 or without hysterectomy)

          -  participants allergic to any of the study medications (minoxidil, finasteride,
             spironolactone)

          -  participants with other co-existing forms of alopecia (traction, alopecia areata, or
             scarring alopecias)

          -  participants with obstructive uropathy or advanced liver disease

          -  prior hair loss treatment within the last 6 months

          -  hair loss from the chemotherapy or other medication-induced alopecia

          -  Hair loss for greater than 5 years, as medical therapy is unlikely to have much effect
             at restoring hair follicles inactive for that long of a period.
