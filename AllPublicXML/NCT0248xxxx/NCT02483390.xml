  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increasing awareness of the importance of palliative care has led, in Israel, to the 2005
      Law for the Rights of Persons with Terminal Illness. Still, problems of accessibility to
      palliative care remain unresolved. The use of e-health services is likely to expand the
      ability of the medical, psychosocial and nursing staff to reach patients who are either
      living in the periphery, are unable to make clinic visits or whose family members are
      housebound in order to be caregivers. This exploratory research is designed to explore the
      issues, barriers and advantages of e-health care through the perspective of the palliative
      care staff members, the patients themselves and their caregiving family members.

      This study is designed to test the applicability and suitability of e-health services (e.g.
      by use of SKYPE) to the psychosocial needs of patients and their families who are getting
      services through home hospice care. In addition, the attitudes of the hospice staff will be
      investigated to the use of e-health methods. The study will clarify selection criteria,
      referral pathways and barriers and/or supporting elements that will allow e-health services
      to be provided in a highly professional fashion. Up to 20 dyads of a patient and their
      primary caregiver will be recruited from those who are receiving services from the home
      hospice unit of the Kupat Holim Clalit (General Sick Fund) in the South of Israel.
