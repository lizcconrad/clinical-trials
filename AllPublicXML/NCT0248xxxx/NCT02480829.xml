      Two Phase Multicenter Study to Evaluate Safety and Efficacy of the Amphora OAB system for
      treatment of urgency and frequency with or without urge incontinence caused by an overactive
      bladder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll subjects with symptomatic idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB). Subjects
      who are found to be unresponsive to or intolerant of medical therapy will be screened and
      evaluated for suitability for study participation. A 3 day Bladder Diary must be completed to
      verify enrollment eligibility.

             by two consecutive PVR measurements of ≤100 ml may be included in the study.

          6. Ability and willingness to self-catheterize in case this is necessary
