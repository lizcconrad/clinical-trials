    <textblock>
      The Participation and Environment Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY) is the first
      instrument that combines parental assessment of children's participation in home, school, and
      community activities with qualities of each environment that are perceived to support or
      hinder participation. This combined format may help to clarify the relative impact of
      environmental factors (including the natural and built environment), compared to personal
      factors, on children's participation in specific settings. The aim of this study was to
      examine reliability and validity of Turkish version of the Participation and Environment
      Measure for Children and Youth (PEM-CY).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health-Child and Youth
      Version (ICF-CY; WHO 2007) is designed to guide assessment and intervention efforts to
      minimize disparities in children's participation. Participation is defined in the ICF-CY as
      ''involvement in life situations'' and is further conceptualized as a multidimensional
      construct with both objective (e.g., frequency) and subjective (e.g., satisfaction)
      dimensions. Participation is linked to contextual factors, including: 1) personal factors
      (child personal factors such as child's age, gender, and functional abilities; family
      demographic factors); and 2) features of environments (physical (natural and built), social,
      attitudinal, and institutional factors, and availability and adequacy of resources). Since
      its adoption in the ICF-CY, an increasing number of participation measures have been
      developed. Among these measures, the Participation and Environment Measure for Children and
      Youth (PEM-CY) is the first instrument that combines parental assessment of children's
      participation in home, school, and community activities with qualities of each environment
      that are perceived to support or hinder participation. This combined format may help to
      clarify the relative impact of environmental factors (including the natural and built
      environment), compared to personal factors, on children's participation in specific settings.
