      Safety Evaluation of freeze-dried Group ACYW135 Meningococcal conjugate vaccine in healthy
      people above 2-months-old

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are five different age groups(18~55 years/7~17 years/1~6 years/7~10 months/2
      months),each group has 40 people and divided into two subgroups. Each subgroup will inject
      different vaccine(MCV4 4μg,MCV4 8μg).For 7~10 months&amp;2 months age groups,there are 2&amp;3
      injection seperately. Each injection interval is 1 months.

      After 7 days observation of 1 dose immunization in Group 18-55 years old adults, if there are
      no serious adverse events associated with vaccines, or severe adverse reactions rate is less
      than 10%, 7 to 17 years old and 1 to 6 years old age groups will continue to inoculate in
      order. After the first dose of 7~10 months group and evaluating safety, 2 months group
      immunized the first dose. All participants completed the immune procedure, then observed the
      safety to 30 days after whole immunization.

      Data collection: Subjects completed diary card, the researchers collected original data and
      fill out the case report form for data entry and statistical analysis.
