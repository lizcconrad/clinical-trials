      The purpose of this study is to discuss the relationship between the result of fentanyl test
      and required dosage of morphine for children with OSAS after adenotonsillectomy；and to
      evaluate the ability of predicting requested dosage of morphine postoperatively.

      All the patients were intubated. Sevoflurane was used for maintenance without any opioids.
      Before the end of the procedure, spontaneous respiratory was recovered. All the patients were
      given 1 mcg/kg fentanyl i.v. after the end of the procedure. The positive result was defined
      as spontaneous respiratory rate decreased more than 50%, the others were defined as negative
      result. All the patients were given morphine for pain relief according to our protocol after
      extubation.
