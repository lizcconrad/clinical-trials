  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2b/3, multi-center, two part study, designed to evaluate the efficacy,
      safety, and tolerability of PRO 140 in conjunction with existing ART (failing regimen) for
      one week and Optimized Background Therapy (OBT) for 24 weeks respectively. Study population
      includes treatment-experienced HIV-infected patients with CCR5-tropic virus who demonstrates
      evidence of HIV-1 replication despite ongoing antiretroviral therapy with documented
      genotypic or phenotypic resistance to ART drugs within three drug classes (or within two or
      more drug classes with limited treatment options).The options may be limited as a result of
      drug antiviral class cross-resistance or documented treatment intolerance.
