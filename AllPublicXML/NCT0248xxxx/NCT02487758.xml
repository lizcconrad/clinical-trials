      Ridge Preservation Comparing the Clinical and Histologic Healing of Flap vs. Flapless
      Approach to Grafting

    <textblock>
      Thirty patients will be treated using the principles of guided bone regeneration and ridge
      preservation. Fifteen test patients will receive the flapless technique with an intrasocket
      cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial overlay graft using a bovine
      xenograft plus Alloderm GBR. The positive control group of fifteen patients will receive the
      flap technique with an intrasocket cancellous cortical particulate allograft plus a facial
      overlay graft using a bovine xenograft plus Alloderm GBR. Approximately, four months
      post-surgery, a trephine core will be taken from the grafted site immediately prior to
      implant placement and submitted for histologic processing.

             significant effect on the periodontium.

          2. Presence or history of osteonecrosis of jaws.

          3. Patients who are currently taking IV bisphosphonates or who had IV treatment with
             bisphosphonates irrespective of duration.
