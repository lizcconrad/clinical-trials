  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single-blinded randomized clinical trial (RCT) designed to compare Single-Site
      robot-assisted with single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The study directly compares
      both surgical approaches in a cohort of 60 patients (30 patients in each arm) with benign
      gallbladder disease from the Department of Surgery at the Cantonal Hospital of Winterthur
      (Kantonsspital Winterthur) in Switzerland. The primary endpoint of the study is the surgeon's
      physical and mental stress load at the time of surgery and is assessed by validated Local
      Experienced Discomfort (LED) and Subjective Mental Effort Questionnaire (SMEQ) visual
      analogue scales. The secondary endpoints include costs of the procedure, intra-operative
      blood loss, operating time, intra-operative conversion rate and additional trocar placement,
      complications, length of hospital stay, Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and cosmesis.
      HRQoL and cosmesis will be assessed using the validated Gastrointestinal Quality of Life
      Index (GIQLI) and the Body Image Questionnaires (BIQ), respectively. The inclusion criteria
      cover most notably symptomatic cholecystolithiasis, chronic cholecystitis, benign gallbladder
      polyps and age ≥18 years. The exclusion criteria are, among others, acute cholecystitis,
      emergency cholecystectomy, previous extensive upper abdominal surgery and suspicion of
      malignant disease. Non-stratified block randomization (random block sizes 2 and 4) will be
      used to achieve balance in the allocation of participants to both treatments arms and prevent
      a premature decoding of the randomization scheme. Hereby, the patient will not be informed
      about the group assignment until the last outpatient follow-up and only after he/she has
      completed and returned all required questionnaires (GIQLI and BIQ). The operation will be
      performed according to the group assignment by senior surgeons only who have a wide
      experience in both robotic Single-Site and conventional single-incision laparoscopy. All data
      are recorded safely using the SecuTrialTM program. Sample-size calculations are based on the
      results of the previously mentioned experimental setup by Schatte et al, utilizing an
      estimated effect size of 0.8, at a power of 0.8 and an alpha-error level of 0.05, as well as
      considering a potential additional error margin of 10-15% of the calculations (G-Power 3.1
      software, Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf/Germany). The estimated total duration of the
      study is 1.5 years, including the scheduled 1-month and 1-year postoperative follow-up
      visits. The study will be carried out in accordance with principles enunciated in the current
      version of the Declaration of Helsinki, the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) issued
      by International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), and Swiss regulatory authority's
      requirements.
