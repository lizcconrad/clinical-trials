      Primary Objective:

      To assess the long-term safety of GZ/SAR402671 in adult male patients with Fabry disease who
      previously completed study ACT13739.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess the long-term effect of GZ/SAR402671 on pharmacodynamic and exploratory efficacy
      endpoints in adult male patients with Fabry disease who previously completed study ACT13739.
