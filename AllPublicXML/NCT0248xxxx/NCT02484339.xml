      Phase II open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Radium-223 dichloride in
      combination with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) vs. external beam radiotherapy alone in
      the treatment of advanced castration resistant prostate carcinoma with limited bone
      metastases.

      To evaluate if time to radiological progression according to the &quot;Recommendations of the
      Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group&quot; published by Scher et al. (JCO 2008) (based on
      new lesions in bone scan and CT /MRI or death) of Radium-223 dichloride combined with EBRT is
      superior compared to EBRT alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an international, multi-center, open-label, prospective, phase II study designed to
      assess the efficacy of radiation therapy in combination with Radium-223 dichloride in
      patients diagnosed with CRPC and oligo metastases bone disease. All patients enrolled in this
      study will have signed an informed consent form (ICF) and will adhere to all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria.

      During the treatment period, patients will be followed on an ongoing basis for safety and
      quality of life (QoL). Safety assessments will include the collection of all AEs of any
      grade, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse event (AEs) corresponding to symptoms arising
      from bone metastases, laboratory values, (WHO/ECOG) performance status (PS). Documentation of
      the date of disease progression will be performed at intervals and imaging methods (bone
      scans and CR/MRI) described in the study protocol. Quality of life will be measured by
      patient assessment using a validated questionnaire, the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form
      (BPI-SF), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) quality of
      life questionnaire (QLQ)-C15-PAL and the EORTC QLQ- Bone Metastases (BM) 22. Follow-up
      assessments for safety AEs and SAEs, and the occurrence of secondary malignancies will be
      conducted every 3-12 months until the patient dies or until the study is terminated by the
      sponsor. If the patient can no longer travel to the clinical site, he will be followed up for
      survival only, i.e., the long term follow-up phase of the study.
