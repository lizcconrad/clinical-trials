  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Landmarks used to make a vascular puncture has long been based on the only knowledge of
      anatomy. This method assumes that the target vessel is in its expected position, permeable
      (non-thrombosed), and heavy enough to be catheterized. Any variations from these assumptions
      is likely to cause failures of puncture and complications. The development of ultrasound
      allowed to &quot;see&quot; the structures to achieve, whether before a puncture or in live for guiding
      the procedure. Visualization of vessels and adjacent structures has logically resulted in
      larger cases to a greater security of catheterization, improving the success rate, and
      decreasing complications. Several positions of the probe can be used to guide a puncture
      under ultrasound: the transversal approach in short axis, the long axis longitudinal approach
      and the oblique view approach.The aim of the study was to compare these three different
      ultrasound-guided approaches to peripheral vascular access in children. All children weighing
      less than 30 kg that should benefit from the introduction of an arterial catheter or central
      venous catheter introduced through a peripheral vein are eligible. Patients will be included
      after parent's and children's information and consent. The choice of the technique used
      (transverse, longitudinal or oblique approach) is determined by a randomization table.The
      puncture procedure is performed according to the usual protocols of the paediatric anesthesia
      unit of the investigators, under ultrasound guidance in a sterile manner. No time limit is
      required for the identification and implementation of the catheter. The position of the probe
      is dictated by the result of randomization and the Seldinger technique is used for the
      establishment of the catheter. Beyond two unsuccessful attempts, the procedure is considered
      as a failure. The anesthetist then uses the alternative technique of his choice. All
      anesthetists participating in this study exercised their main activity in the Montpellier
      University Hospital pediatric anesthesia unit. The laying of ultrasound-guided peripherally
      inserted central catheter and arterial catheter is part of the current activity of the unit.
