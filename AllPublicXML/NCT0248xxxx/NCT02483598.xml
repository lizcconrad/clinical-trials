      This study is to compare intestinal Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) activity in 9-18 month post
      weight loss surgery Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) versus control subjects who have not had
      a weight loss surgery and are of similar age, gender, body mass index as the gastric bypass
      group. For this purpose, we will compare post-bariatric surgery patients with control
      subjects on alterations in systemic exposure of buspirone, a CYP3A4 substrate, when
      administered with grapefruit juice, a selective intestinal CYP3A4 inhibitor.
