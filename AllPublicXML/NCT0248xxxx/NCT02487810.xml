  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are systematic differences between
      the decisions patients make intuitively versus deliberatively about life-sustaining medical
      therapies.

      The targeted population is inpatients at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania with
      serious medical problems. The study will involve facilitated interviews with patients using a
      survey instrument developed in Qualtrics.

    <description>Patients will be asked to answer a variety of questions about how they value different health conditions and what their priorities are for end of life treatment.
