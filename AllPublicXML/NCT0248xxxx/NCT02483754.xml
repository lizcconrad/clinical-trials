      The study was designed to employ MOCA to screen mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in military
      retirees and to analyze the associated risk factors. As such, MOCA was revised to be
      validated for the Chinese context.

      Three hundred and four retired military cadres were investigated using a random cluster
      sampling technique including personal information, prevalence, MOCA scale, and related
      neuropsychiatry scale. Thirty retirees were random chosen and tested again with the revised
      MOCA scale one month later.
