    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and cryosurgery
      work with short term androgen ablation to treat patients with prostate cancer that has
      traveled from the original tumor, through the body, and formed a small number of new tumors
      in other parts of the body (oligo-metastatic). Cryosurgery, also known as cryoablation or
      cryotherapy, kills tumor cells by freezing them. The process also incites an immune response
      within the ablated tumor. Giving monoclonal antibodies such as pembrolizumab which enhance a
      systemic anti-cancer immune response, may augment the effects of cryosurgery and increase
      tumor killing at distant (metastatic) sites.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess feasibility via the proportion of men reaching a low prostate-specific antigen
      (PSA) nadir (&lt; 0.6 ng/ml) at 1 year.

      II. Evaluate the safety of cryotherapy to the prostate combined with pembrolizumab.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of combination cryotherapy / pembrolizumab on programmed cell
      death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in the prostate as
      assessed by biopsy performed 6 months post treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive standard of care androgen ablation with degarelix subcutaneously (SC) once a
      month for 8 months. Within 1 month of receiving degarelix, patients receive pembrolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 3 days of
      receiving the first dose of pembrolizumab, patients undergo whole gland cryoablation of the
      prostate.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12
      weeks for up to 1 year.
