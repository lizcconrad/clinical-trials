      Using Oligonucleotide Chip Analysis, investigators compared gene expression levels in
      allergic rhinitis patients before and after a series of acupoint herbal plaster and
      Acupuncture treatment.

      In the first year, Twenty-three participants with persistent allergic rhinitis each received
      four acupoint herbal plaster treatments, applied using the moxibustion technique, and
      clinical outcomes were evaluated using the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ).
      Peripheral blood samples were analyzed using an ImmunoCAP Phadiatop test, and patients were
      classified as phadiatop (Ph)-positive or -negative. Microarray results were examined for
      genes that were differentially expressed between (1) Ph-positive and -negative patients
      treated with herbal paste; and (2) before and after herbal paste treatment in the Ph-positive
      patient group.

      In the second year, Twenty-seven participants with persistent allergic rhinitis each received
      four acupoint herbal plaster treatments and 8 courses of acupuncture treatment over 4 weeks
      in the same time.

      This project「The oligonucleotide chip analysis for allergic rhinitis treatment in herbal
      plaster and acupuncture」 will be performed at Genomic Medicine Research Core Laboratory-
      GMRCL in Chung Gang Memorial Hospital. Allergic rhinitis patient will receive herbal plaster
      treatment in the first year, blood sample was attained before and after therapy. Then
      investigators use oligonucleotide chip to analyze the immunomodulatory effects of TCM in the
      treatment of allergic rhinitis. In the second year, the patient received herbal plaster and
      Acupuncture treatment in the same time.

      Many allergic rhinitis patients accept TCM treatment here in Taiwan. According to recent
      journal reports, Traditional Chinese medicine performed in accordance with the principles of
      TCM would show significant immune-modulating effects, herbal plaster is an effective, safe
      and convenient treatment for allergic rhinitis. The mechanism of its efficacy needs further
      study. This project plan to combine the experience of clinical doctor and GMRCL Microarray
      for the mechanism of herbal plaster on allergic rhinitis.

      Investigators study the effects of herbal plaster treatment for allergic rhinitis in the
      first year. And study the combine effect of herbal plaster and Acupuncture treatment in the
      second year. All patients during 18-45 years old were treated over a time period of 4 weeks.
      Patients' general well-being and several peripheral blood parameters were determined before
      and after the herbal plaster treatment. RNA was extracted from the blood and pooled into
      patient pool. Oligonucleotide chips were used to analysis the pooled RNA each year. The
      microarray analysis for the genomic change before and after the herbal plaster treatment or
      herbal plaster with Acupuncture treatment was studied .

    <description>ImmunoCAP Phadiatop is a blood test widely used by ENT specialists in Taiwan to detect serum allergen-specific IgE antibodies. When patient provided written consent to enter the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved human trial, Patient diagnoses were confirmed by otolaryngologists. And the ImmunoCAP Phadiatop (InVitroSight, Phadia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was performed.</description>

    <description>The Acupoint herbal plaster consisted of mustard seed, fumarate, asarum, angelica, cinnamon, and ginger at a ratio of 3:3:2:2:0.5:4, respectively. The treatment was prepared by dissolving the ginger in water and adding the powder to form a plaster. Mixtures were formed into cakes of approximately 1.5 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm3 and were held in position using plastic sheets.</description>

    <description>Eight (8) acupuncture treatment sessions over 4 weeks were performed for each volunteer. The standard protocol for acupuncture treatment covered the most commonly treated acupoints for allergic rhinitis: LI4, ST36, LI20 in both sides, and EX-HN3. After insertion of needles at each acupoint, manual stimulation of needles on LI20 and EX-HN3 was repeated 3 times at 5-minute intervals. Electrostimulation was applied to the needles inserted in ST36 and LI4 with a frequency of 3-5 Hz, and the intensity was adjusted according to each volunteer's tolerance. All needles were removed 20 minutes later in each treatment session.</description>
