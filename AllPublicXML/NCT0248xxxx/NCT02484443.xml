    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dinutuximab works when given with sargramostim in
      treating patients with osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment (recurrent).
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as dinutuximab, may find tumor cells and help kill them.
      Sargramostim may help the body increase the amount of white blood cells it produces, which
      help the body fight off infections. Giving dinutuximab with sargramostim may work better and
      kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the disease control rate in patients with completely resected recurrent
      osteosarcoma treated with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination with sargramostim
      (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) as compared to historical
      Children's Oncology Group (COG) experience.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in patients with recurrent
      osteosarcoma.

      II. To determine the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity (UT) in patients with recurrent
      osteosarcoma treated with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) in combination with sargramostim.

      III. To assess the relationship between probability of disease control and tumor ganglioside
      GD2 (GD2) expression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between probability of disease control and tumor GD2
      expression.

      II. To assess KIR and Fcgamma receptor (FcgammaR) genotypes, NKp30 isoforms and its
      circulating ligand, B7-H6, and their relationships to the probability of disease control.

      III. To attempt banking of tumor samples for future research studies from patients enrolled
      on study who undergo biopsy or resection of suspected metastatic disease recurrence while on
      protocol therapy or during the evaluation period.

      IV. To determine a descriptive profile of human anti-chimeric antibody (HACA) during
      immunotherapy.

      V. To bank serial plasma samples for future studies of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic
      acid (ctDNA) detection as a marker of disease progression and response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and
      dinutuximab intravenously (IV) over 10 hours on days 4-7 (dinutuximab infusion may be
      extended up to a total of 20 hours per day for anticipated toxicities). Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 and 12 months.

    <time_frame>During the first 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The probability of remaining event-free as a function of time since enrollment will be estimated by the method of Kaplan and Meier. The complementary log-log transformation of the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 12 month disease control probability will be used to construct confidence intervals of that probability. Only patients who can be confirmed to be free of detectable disease 12 months after enrollment, without intervening disease progression, will be considered to have experienced 12 month disease control.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 4 years</time_frame>
    <description>A Bayesian rule will be used to monitor for excessive toxicity. Descriptive analyses of this safety information will be performed and will include the incidence of adverse events, severe adverse events, serious adverse events, and fatal adverse events. Type, frequency, and severity of laboratory abnormalities will also be analyzed.</description>

    <measure>Tumor GD2 expression</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 4 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The relationship between probability of disease control (DC) and tumor GD2 expression will be assessed. The outcome measure will be DC success (yes versus no). Logistic regression using the categorical immunohistochemistry (IHC) result will be fitted to the data. The fitted coefficients from the logistic regression, and the p-value for the test of the hypothesis of no relationship between IHC result and probability of DC success will be used to characterize this exploratory analysis. Trend will also be assessed using the actual IHC numerical value.</description>

The fitted coefficients from the logistic regression, and the p-value for the test of the hypothesis of no relationship between FcgammaR result and probability of DC success will be used to characterize this exploratory analysis.

    <description>At each time point, the optical density of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) bridging assay will be calculated. The number of patients who are HACA positive divided by the number of patients with a successful HACA assay at each time point will be used to quantify the fraction of patients displaying HACA activity.
