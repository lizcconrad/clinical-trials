    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 (the first phase in testing a new drug, to see how safe a new drug or new
      indication/population ) and phase 2 (the second phase in testing a new drug or new
      indication/population to see how effective the drug is) study of neoadjuvant (treatment
      before the main treatment) with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (abraxane) and gemcitabine and
      radiation therapy before surgery and then gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel after surgery in
      patients with pancreatic cancer that has grown to involve one of the major artery branches.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel are chemotherapy drugs that are currently approved by Health
      Canada for use in combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. However, the
      combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as a neoadjuvant treatment prior to gemcitabine
      and radiation is experimental. Surgery to remove or reconstruct the major artery is also
      experimental.
