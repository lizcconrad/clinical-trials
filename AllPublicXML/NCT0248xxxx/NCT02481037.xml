  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least half of children with asthma have poor disease control, which can result in
      complications requiring emergency treatment and hospitalization. As asthma is one of the most
      common reasons for children to visit emergency departments (ED) and be hospitalized, this
      disease places a heavy burden on the health care system and families. While there is strong
      evidence that timely treatment with preventative therapies can substantially improve asthma
      control, reduce sudden worsening of symptoms, and lower rates of ED visits and
      hospitalizations, a significant proportion of children do not receive these therapies.

      The purpose of this study is to improve the prescription and use of evidenced-based
      preventative therapies for children with asthma with the goal to significantly improve their
      disease control and quality of life, while reducing unnecessary ED visits and
      hospitalizations. The investigators will achieve this by: i) installing a primary care
      clinical pathway for managing childhood asthma into clinicians' electronic medical record
      (EMR) to facilitate the use of best-evidence by practitioners, and ii) training chronic
      disease management (CDM) health professionals to provide targeted and timely asthma education
      to parents and children with asthma. The investigators will test this pathway and education
      project in a representative sample of 22 Alberta primary care practices, using a pragmatic
      cluster controlled trial methodology.

    <description>The proportion of symptomatic children with asthma in the baseline and follow-up periods (separate calculations) who are appropriately treated with a preventer will be the primary outcome. The denominator will be the number of children who meet the case definition of asthma and receive at least one prescription for an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist (e.g. salbutamol) during the applicable time period. The numerator will be, of these children, the number who receive a prescription for inhaled corticosteroid, montelukast, a combined inhaled long-acting beta agonist and corticosteroid, or some combination of these three drugs in the same time period.</description>

    <description>The proportion of applicable children in baseline and follow-up periods who are appropriately dispensed a preventer by a pharmacy will highlight if there is a significant gap between prescriptions given and filled. The denominator will be the same as for the primary outcome but the numerator will be the number of these children who are dispensed one or more preventer medications from newly available Pharmaceutical Information Network (PIN) data.</description>

    <description>The research team has worked with TELUS to develop and validate a case definition and case finding algorithm for identifying children with asthma in practices. The TELUS EMR data will provide, for all eligible children, individual categorical and continuous patient level data such as patient demographics, ICD9 codes and medication prescriptions, and for children evaluated in practices randomized to the pathway group, asthma phenotype and provision of asthma action plans.</description>
