  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a single center prospective study that will assess two different
      strategies for measuring Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) in patients undergoing
      clinically-indicated coronary angiography in whom FFR measurement is indicated. FFR will be
      measured with a non-side hole guide catheter (with the guide catheter both engaged and
      disengaged from the coronary ostium) and with a side-hole guide catheter (with the guide
      catheter both engaged and disengaged from the coronary ostium) to determine, whether
      measurements obtained with an engaged side-hole guide catheter are more accurate as compared
      with those obtained with the engaged non-side hole catheter.
