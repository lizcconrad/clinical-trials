      Clinical Study to Evaluate the Performance of the ePrime System for the Treatment of
      Cellulite.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 60 healthy adult volunteers seeking cellulite treatment, females of 25 to 60 years of
      age, from multiple investigational sites.

      This is an open-label, multi-center study. Subjects in this study will receive a single
      subcutaneous treatment with the ePrime device in one treatment session according to the study
      protocol.

      Prior to treatments, tissue to be treated will be injected with tumescence or local dermal
      infiltration solution according to the protocol. Subjects will return for follow‐up (FU)
      visits at: 1 week, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months following the treatment.

      Methodology described in protocol to evaluate efficacy of treatments will be carried out at
      each visit.
