  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with disabilities are frequently ignored by the general population, hence the
      development of movement evaluation and training devices for use in special education settings
      are relatively overlooked. Usually the performance of these children is not stable and
      contains variations. Hence in order to get a complete picture of their sport performance,
      simply measuring movement time and distance is definitely not representative. With the rising
      attention from government regarding fitness and social participation of the disabled in
      recent years, developing a special-designed individual evaluation &amp; training plan is of great
      importance. To achieve this goal, a device which is able to record the complete process of
      movement, and contains algorithm that can pick up the movement characteristics of children
      with disabilities is needed. The purpose of this study is to design and develop a smart
      soccer ball system for use in children with intellectual disabilities(ID), and to compare the
      performance between children with ID and the typically developed.
