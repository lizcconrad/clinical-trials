      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method which enables noninvasive
      electrical stimulation of the cortex via electrodes placed on the subject's skull. High
      definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) allows for precise generation of electrical fields over selected
      cortical areas using multiple electrodes. The purpose of this pilot trial is to study
      feasibility, tolerability, and safety of HD-tDCS administered daily for a total of 20
      sessions in healthy adults and adults with Down syndrome.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I: To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up
      to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in healthy adult subjects; Part II: After
      review of the safety data for Part I is completed and reviewed by the Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee and IRB, Part II will be initiated. To assess feasibility and tolerability of
      HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in adult subjects with
      Down Syndrome.

      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a method which enables noninvasive
      electrical stimulation of the cortex via electrodes placed on the subject's skull. tDCS has
      been shown to improve motor learning, visuomotor coordination, probabilistic classification,
      boost memory in humans and was found to be well tolerated in children with early onset
      schizophrenia, continuous spike-wave in sleep (CSWS), refractory epilepsy and dystonia. The
      method has been approved for investigational purposes by the FDA. High definition tDCS
      (HD-tDCS) allows for precise generation of electrical fields over selected cortical areas
      using multiple electrodes. Positioning of the stimulating electrodes is determined with the
      help of MR brain images and appropriate modeling. The purpose of this pilot trial is to study
      feasibility, tolerability, and safety of HD-tDCS administered daily for a total of 20
      sessions.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES Part I: To assess feasibility and tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up
      to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in healthy adult subjects; Part I will be
      defined to be positive if 5 healthy adults are accrued within the study period (12 months)
      and at least 4 of 5 participants have successful completion. Tolerability will be measured as
      the proportion of subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6
      weeks.

      Part II: After review of the safety data for Part I is completed and reviewed by the Data
      Safety Monitoring Committee and IRB, Part II will be initiated. To assess feasibility and
      tolerability of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions in
      adult subjects with Down Syndrome; Part II will be defined to be positive if 5 adults with
      Down Syndrome are accrued within the study period (12 months) and at least 4 of 5
      participants have successful completion. Tolerability will be measured as the proportion of
      subjects able to complete 20 sessions on the assigned treatment within 6 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Part I: - Collect pilot data on safety of HD-tDCS in healthy adults,
      where safety is defined by incidents of adverse events. Safety outcomes will include vital
      signs, physical/neurologic exam findings, weight, electrocardiograms and
      electroencephalograms.

      - Collect pilot data on feasibility of efficacy endpoints. These will include assessment of
      impact of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions, on EEG
      amplitudes and coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and higher (&gt;9Hz) frequency ranges and
      coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges in healthy adults.

      Part II: - Collect pilot data on safety of HD-tDCS in adults with Down Syndrome, where safety
      is defined by incidents of adverse events. Safety outcomes will include vital signs,
      physical/neurologic exam findings, weight, electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms.

      - Collect pilot data on feasibility of efficacy endpoints. These will include assessment of
      impact of HD-tDCS, administered up to 5 days per week for a total of 20 sessions, on EEG
      amplitudes and coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and higher (&gt;9Hz) frequency ranges and
      coherences in the lower (&lt;8Hz) and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency ranges in adults with Down
      Syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous or current medical history of epilepsy, neurologic, heart, endocrinologic,
             renal, chronic infectious, metabolic, psychiatric disease or cancer

          -  Healthy adult subjects will be excluded from the study if the subject is not suitable

             chemotherapy for a hematologic/oncologic condition, is carrying a pacemaker or has
             been diagnosed with a cardiac anomaly which causes cardiac insufficiency not

             These include anxiety, obsessive compulsive behaviors, attention problems, agitation,
             oppositional behavior. These behavioral problems will be assessed during the first
             visit and the PI will make decision to exclude subjects which she considers will not
             be able to complete the study.

          -  The subject is legally blind (vision acuity &lt;20/200 not correctable with lenses, as
             determined be a certified optometrist or an ophthalmologist).

          -  The subject is severely hearing impaired (Hearing level &gt;71 dB, as measured with a
             standard audiometer at frequencies between 8 and 20 kHz).

          -  The subject is not suitable for study participation due to other reasons, at the
             discretion of the PI.
