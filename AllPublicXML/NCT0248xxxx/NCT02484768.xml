      The purpose of this study is to to establish proof-of-concept for efficacy of iron
      isomaltoside 1000 in subjects with Restless Legs Syndrome.

      The study is a randomised, comparative, double-blind study with a 3 months extension.
      Subjects with restless leg syndrome (RLS) will be randomised 2:1 to one of the following
      treat-ment groups:

        -  Group A (42 subjects): 1000 mg iron isomaltoside 1000

        -  Group B (21 subjects): Placebo infusion

      Furthermore, non-responders, who continue to meet entry requirements, will receive 1000 mg
      iron isomaltoside 1000 at week 6.

      RLS is a disorder of sensation with a prevalence of around 2-5 % of the population. RLS is
      extremely responsive to dopaminergic agents, but a second issue is that iron deficiency
      states may precipitate RLS in as much as 25-30 % of subjects with iron deficiency. RLS
      appears to be related to deficits in brain iron content and metabolism. Magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) images demonstrate a decrease in substantia nigra and red nucleus iron content.
      The severity of this decrease in brain iron content is correlated with the severity of
      symptoms. A number of patients are quite resistant to dietary iron repletion but do resolve
      symptoms with high doses of intravenous (IV) iron.

      For the individual subject, there will be 4 phases to the study which includes
      teleconferences (TCs) and 2 visits.

      The treatment and treatment evaluation is the main study.
