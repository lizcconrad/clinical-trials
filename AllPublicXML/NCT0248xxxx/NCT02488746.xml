  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective observational trial. A full thickness resection of gastric subepithelial tumors
      is performed after application of full thickness sutures underneath the tumor with the
      GERDX(TM) device. Hypothesis: This endoscopic method is feasible, effective and safe.

  <why_stopped>
    According to study protocol the trial was terminated because the recruitment of trial
    participants was insufficient.
