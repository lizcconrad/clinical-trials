      The aim of this study is to get a clear view on current practice of surgical third molar
      removal in Belgium and the association with morbidity and complications.

      For this prospective cohort study, patients who visit the outpatient department of Oral and
      Maxillofacial Surgery of the University Hospitals Leuven or hospitals affiliated with the
      Flemish Hospital Network will be participating. All included patients are referred from
      primary dental providers for the surgical removal of one or more third molars. Before
      participating, written informed consent will be recorded from all eligible subjects.

      Patients consult one of the oral and maxillofacial surgeons or residents working on the
      department of the University Hospitals Leuven for the removal of third molars. In the
      standard procedure, patients are not routinely clinically monitored after one week at the
      department.

      Pre-operative, operative and postoperative data will be collected through a questionnaire,
      extracted data from the patient's medical file and panoramic radiography. The surgeon's
      individual operation technique will be registered through a one-off questionnaire. The
      questionnaires are taken at the same time of consultation and includes a maximum of 8
      questions per time and are considered as non-invasive and a minimal burden for the patient.
      Postoperatively, patients record their recovery status and ability to resume daily- and work
      activities at day 3 and 7 by using a dairy system and, if necessary, revisit the outpatient
      department of oral and maxillofacial surgery.
