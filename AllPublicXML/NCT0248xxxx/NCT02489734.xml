      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the incidence of emergence delirium will be
      reduced when end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane decreases.

      Sevoflurane induction and maintenance were selected. Intubation was performed after lidocaine
      spray on vocal cord. After that, an effective caudal or brachial plexus block was performed.
      End-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was maintained at 2.5%. Spontaneous respiratory was
      maintained. Sevoflurane was stopped after the end of surgery. Patients were randomly assigned
      to 2 groups: high concentration group (Group HC, end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane when
      extubating &gt;=0.5%) and low concentration group (Group LC, end-tidal concentration of
      sevoflurane when extubating &lt;0.5%). Patients in Group LC were extubated when they coughed or
      purposeful movement appeared. The patients whose end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane &gt;=
      0.5% were excluded. Patients in Group HC were extubated when any of the criteria was met:
      1.the patient coughed or purposeful movement appeared 2.end-tidal concentration of
      sevoflurane decreased to 0.5%. A trained nurse (blind to groups) recorded PAEDs scores in
      PACU.
