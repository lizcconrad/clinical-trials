    <textblock>
      Although the use of bortezomib has reported efficacy in amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis,
      the role of bortezomib with dexamethasone (BD) in the first-line treatment of patients with
      AL amyloidosis should be determined. In this study, the investigators evaluated the efficacy
      and safety of BD as the first-line treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis.

      This study included patients with newly diagnosed AL amyloidosis who were treated with a BD
      regimen in Jinling hospital. The AL amyloidosis diagnosis was confirmed by renal biopsy, and
      the assessment of organ involvement were based on consensus criteria. The clinical and
      laboratory data were collected at the beginning of each cycle and every 3 months thereafter.
      The initial BD regimen included bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 i.v.) and dexamethasone (40 mg i.v.)
      twice weekly for 2 weeks (days 1, 4, 8, and 11), which was followed by a 10-day rest period
      (days 12-21). The investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of BD as the first-line
      treatment of patients with AL amyloidosis.
