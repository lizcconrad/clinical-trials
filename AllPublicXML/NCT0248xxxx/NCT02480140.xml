      Emerging research suggests the use of self-regulation (SR) strategies at improving functional
      regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added effect to the
      effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to examine the
      efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with
      subacute stroke. It was hypothesized that participants receiving the combined treatment (SR
      and CIMT) would have a better functional regain.

      Background - Emerging research suggests the use of self-regulation (SR) strategies at
      improving functional regain in patients with brain injury. SR is proposed to produce an added
      effect to the effective constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT).

      Objective - This study aimed to examine the efficacy of a self-regulated CIMT program
      (SR-CIMT) for function regain of patients with sub-acute stroke.

      Methods - Seventy-six patients were randomly assigned to the self-regulated
      constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT; n=25), constraint-induced movement therapy
      (CIMT; n=27) or conventional functional rehabilitation (control; n=24) groups, and completed
      the trial.

      The SR-CIMT intervention was two-week therapist-guided training using the SR strategy to
      reflect on the relearning of functional tasks with CIMT. Outcome measurements were for upper
      limb function (Action Research Arm Test, ARAT, Fugl-Meyer Assessment, FMA), daily task
      performance (Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, Lawton IADL) and
      self-perceived functional ability (Motor Activity Log, MAL) at pre and post intervention
      intervals, and at one month follow up.

    <description>Self-regulated constraint-induced movement therapy (SR-CIMT) - participants' non-hemiplegic arm was restrained in a mitt for 4 hours every day, 2 weeks, 5 days a week (therapy days) (CIMT) (the same CIMT protocol as in the CIMT group described under 'comparator/control treatment'); participants were taught using the self-regulation (SR) strategy to relearn the tasks; SR strategy involved participants self reflecting on their abilities and deficits in performing the tasks, identifying problems and solutions in achieving the most independence in the tasks, and then actually carrying out the tasks.</description>

    <description>In the constraint-induced movement therapy group (CIMT), participants' non-hemiplegic arm was restrained in a mitt for 4 hours every day, 2 weeks, 5 days a week (therapy days); therapist provided demonstration on the adapted task performance with one arm (the side of participants' hemiplegic arm), and participants to practice the tasks with the unrestrained hemiplegic arm under supervision.</description>

    <description>There were 10 tasks to practice in total, they included fold laundry, put clothes on hanger, brush teeth, dress upper garment, dress lower garment in week one; and use telephone, prepare a cup of tea, sweep floor, wash towel, wash dishes in week two. In the 4 hours when the participants had their non-hemiplegic arm in the restrain, they received one hour therapist-guided training using SR strategy on task relearning as described above. Therefore, all participants received 10 one-hour therapist-guided training sessions (daily on weekdays, total two weeks). The intervention was delivered by occupational therapist. For the rest of the 3 hours in the restrain, the participants' wearing of the restrain was monitored by the nursing staff in the ward.</description>

    <description>They practised the same 10 tasks as in the SR-CIMT and control groups. The same as the experimental intervention group (SR-CIMT), in the 4 hours when the participants had their non-hemiplegic arm in the restrain, they received one hour therapist-guided training using the strategy on task relearning as described above. Therefore, all participants received 10 one-hour therapist-guided training sessions (daily on weekdays, total two weeks). The intervention was delivered by occupational therapist.
