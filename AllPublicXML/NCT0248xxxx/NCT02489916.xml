      The investigators do the clinical trial (patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated
      with donafenib after failure of standard therapy) to assess safety and efficacy of donafenib
      in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, progressing after all approved standard
      therapies.

      The study is a multicentre, phase 1B study recruiting 47 patients in 6 sites. Patients were
      eligible to participate when they have histological or cytological documentation of
      adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum. They must have received locally and currently approved
      standard therapies and to have disease progression during or within 3 months after the last
      administration of the last standard therapy or to have stopped standard therapy because of
      unacceptable toxic effects. The available standard therapies have to include as many of the
      following as were licensed: a fluoropyrimidine,oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and bevacizumab;and
      cetuximab or panitumumab for patients who had KRAS wild-type tumours.

      Patients have to be aged 18 years or older and have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
      (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1; life expectancy of at least 3 months;and adequate
      bone-marrow, liver, and renal function at the start of the trial. Patients could not
      participate if they had previously received sorafenib or had uncontrolled medical disorders.

      All patients receive best supportive care, excluding other investigational antitumour agents
      or antineoplastic chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or immunotherapy. Patients receive oral
      donafenib 300mg (CM4307) of each 4 week cycle until disease progression,death, unacceptable
      toxic effects, withdrawal of consent by the patient, or decision by the treating physician
      that discontinuation would be in the patient's best interest.The primary endpoint is
      safety.The second endpoint is progression-free survival.
