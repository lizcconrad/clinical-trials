      Filler in the single arthrodesis procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, prospective clinical investigation in subjects in need of a single
      arthrodesis procedure of the ankle (ankle joint or subtalar joint) to relieve persistent pain
      due to primary or secondary osteoarthritis.

      The objectives of the study are to assess safety and performance of ARTEBONE as Bone Void
      Filler in the single arthrodesis procedure of the ankle (ankle joint or subtalar joint).

      The study will be monitored regularly by Clinical Research Associates (CRAs). Monitoring
      procedures include one or more visits designed to clarify all prerequisites before the study
      commences. Interim monitoring visits will take place on a regular basis according to a
      schedule fixed by mutual agreement. During these visits, the CRA will check for completion of
      the entries on the Case Report Forms (CRFs), their compliance with the Clinical Investigation
      Plan (CIP), the standard operating procedures (SOP), Good Clinical Practice and International
      Organization for Standardization 14155 (ISO 14155), and will compare the CRF entries with the
      source data, as well as update the Investigator´s File (IF).

      Source data verification will be performed in an unassisted way (direct access to source
      documents), unless otherwise required by the local ethics committee.

      The sample size of 30 subjects was considered adequate for the safety and performance
      evaluation in this indication based on earlier discussions with the authorities.

      An interim analyses will be performed for 6 months data. There will be descriptive analysis
      only and comparison to literature. Literature search has been done according to European
      Union (EU) guidelines.

             specific to this investigation prior to enrollment.

          2. The patient is diagnosed with primary or secondary osteoarthritis requiring fusion of
             the ankle joint (tibiotalar) or the subtalar joint.

          3. The fusion site should be able to be rigidly stabilized with two or three screws
             across the fusion site.

          4. The patient is independent, ambulatory, and could comply with all post-operative
             evaluations and visits.

          5. The patient is at least 18 years of age and considered to be skeletally mature.

          3. There is radiographic evidence of bone cysts, segmental defects or growth plate
             fracture around the fusion site that may negatively impact bony fusion.

          9. The patient has systemic or severe local inflammation or infections.

         10. The patient has a pre-fracture neuromuscular or musculoskeletal deficiency which might

         11. The patient is physically or mentally compromised (e.g., currently being treated for a
             psychiatric disorder, senile dementia, Alzheimer's disease, etc.) to the extent that
             the investigator judges the patient to be unable or unlikely to remain compliant.

         12. The patient has an allergy to reindeer protein.

         13. The patient has received an investigational therapy or approved therapy for
             investigational use within 30 days of surgery.

         14. The patient is a prisoner, known or suspected to be transient, or has a history of
             drug/alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to screening for study entry.
