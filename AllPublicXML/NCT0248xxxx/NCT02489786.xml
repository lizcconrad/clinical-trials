  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digoxin is the primary cardiac glycoside in clinical use. Because of the narrow therapeutic
      index and risk of toxicity, therapeutic drug monitoring is highly recommended. In Egypt, most
      cardiologists give digoxin holiday for both atrial fibrillation and heart failure, it is not
      clear if the interrupted digoxin regimens are effective since serum digoxin concentrations
      might fall below the therapeutic range.

      Objective: To evaluate and compare the digoxin serum concentration and patient's quality of
      life in the continuous versus interrupted digoxin dosing regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside prescribed in heart failure and certain supraventricular
      tachyarrhythmias. It exerts a positive inotropic, neurohormonal, and electro physiologic
      actions on the heart . For heart failure patients, the targeted steady state serum digoxin
      level is between 0.5 and 0.8 ng/ml . Ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation patients
      will usually require higher digoxin steady state serum concentrations . However, serum
      digoxin level higher than 2 ng/ml is associated with increased incidence of adverse drug
      reactions and should be avoided . Because of inter and intra-patient variability, narrow
      therapeutic index, and risk of toxicity, digoxin doses are calculated based on the patient
      weight, renal status, indications and drug interactions. Due to substantial overlap between
      therapeutic and toxic levels of digoxin, therapeutic drug monitoring is a must especially in
      patients with deteriorating renal function and electrolyte disturbance. In Egypt, most
      cardiologists give a digoxin holiday for patients with atrial fibrillation and /or heart
      failure where patients skip the drug doses on Thursday and Friday or Friday only every week
      to avoid possible drug accumulation and toxicity. It is not clear if these interrupted
      digoxin regimens really offer safer alternative over the continuous dosing regimens without
      compromising the effectiveness. It is anticipated that plasma digoxin levels may fall below
      the therapeutic range during the holiday which may affect patient clinical status and quality
      of life.
