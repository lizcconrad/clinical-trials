      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of HM61713
      in patients with T790M-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after treatment with an
      epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study to assess the anti-tumor efficacy of oral
      single agent HM61713 administered to patients with T790M-positive NSCLC after treatment with
      an EGFR-TKI as measured by objective response rate (ORR).
