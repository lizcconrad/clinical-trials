  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infants comprise a potentially vulnerable research population that received special
      consideration and protections under the US Code of Federal Regulations - Subpart D. Of the
      four categories of research involving children, 45 CFR 46.406 is of particular interest to
      researchers, ethicists, parents, and clinical staff members since it concerns the conduct of
      research with &quot;more than minimal risk&quot; without the prospect of direct benefit. Parents are
      the surrogate decision makers for infants. When asked about this type of research in studies
      pertaining to older infants and children, parent themes include: concerns of medical research
      and research-related risk, desire to advance generalizable medical knowledge and knowledge
      specific to their own child's disease. There are no data on parents' perceptions regarding
      this category of research that target the premature, late-preterm and term newborn
      populations.

      This study involves a questionnaire for both staff (nurses and physicians) and parents. The
      questionnaire represented 4 different infant scenarios in a random order. Respondents are
      asked to answer questions related to enrollment in a research study for each of the 4
      scenarios.
