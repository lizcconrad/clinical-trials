      Thirty patients will be treated: 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique plus
      intramucosal verticals with AlloDerm® (test treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned
      tunnel technique alone with AlloDerm® (control treatment). The surgical procedure for the
      control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel preparation that is a
      modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b).
      This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of the soft tissue over an
      allograft (E.P Allen). The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally
      positioned tunnel preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal
      verticals, a modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA)
      approach (Zadeh H, 2011). Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class I or II facial
      recession defect, ≥ 3 mm. Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to receive either
      the test or control treatment. Three exams for measurements will be performed per patient on
      total: preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4 months) postoperatively. The primary aim is to
      compare the percent root coverage obtained with acellular dermal matrix using the coronally
      positioned tunnel technique alone or with intramucosal verticals.

      Thirty patients will be treated: 15 with a coronally positioned tunnel technique plus
      intramucosal verticals with AlloDerm® (test treatment) and 15 with a coronally positioned
      tunnel technique alone with AlloDerm® (control treatment). The surgical procedure for the
      control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel preparation that is a
      modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b).
      This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of the soft tissue over an
      allograft (E.P Allen). The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally
      positioned tunnel preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal
      verticals, a modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA)
      approach (Zadeh H, 2011). In both the test and control group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured
      using a continuous sling suture technique with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the
      tissue will be coronally positioned and sutured separately using a continuous sling suture
      technique (line angle to line angle) with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. In the test
      group, the intramucosal vertical incisions will be sutured using simple interrupted sutures
      with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. Each patient will provide at least one Miller Class
      I or II facial recession defect, ≥ 3 mm. Each patient will initially receive a full
      diagnostic work-up to include the periapical and bite-wing radiographs of the selected site
      and adjacent teeth, study casts, intra-oral photographs, and full mouth clinical examination.
      Pre-surgical preparation will include detailed oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root
      planing under local anesthesia, and occlusal adjustment if indicated. Baseline data on test
      and adjacent teeth will be recorded on the day of surgical treatment to include: Miller's
      classification of recession defects, Plaque Index, Gingival Index, Bleeding on Probing Index,
      Gingival Margin Levels (Recession), Keratinized Tissue, Clinical Attachment Level, Clinical
      Tooth Mobility, Creeping Attachment, Tooth Vitality, Radiographic Examination, Patient
      Models, and Clinical photos. Patients will be randomly selected by a coin toss to receive
      either the test or control treatment. Mentor will toss the coin immediately prior to
      beginning surgical procedure. Patients will be evaluated postoperatively for a period of 4
      months. The examiner will be blinded and will not be aware of the patient treatment at any
      time during the term of the study. Three exams for measurements will be performed per patient
      on total: preoperative, at week eight and 16 (4 months) postoperatively. The primary aim is
      to compare the percent root coverage obtained with acellular dermal matrix using the
      coronally positioned tunnel technique alone or with intramucosal verticals. Means and
      standard deviations will be calculated for all parameters. Statistical significance of the
      mean residual recession data for each parameter will be analyzed using a paired t-test to
      detect within group statistical differences and an unpaired t-test to detect between group
      statistical differences. The sample size of 15 per group will afford 80% statistical power to
      detect a difference of 1.0 mm coverage between groups. Sample size and power calculations are
      based on data from previous studies.

      All surgical procedures will be completed by one operator under the direction of one mentor.
      First, presurgical measurements will be taken. Defect width will be measured horizontally at
      the interproximal osseous crest level and 1.0 mm coronal to the defect base. Probing depths,
      width of keratinized tissue, and gingival margin levels will also be measured. Next,
      treatment modality will be determined and assigned to the defect. Local anesthesia will be
      administered, tissue elevated, and measurements of the level of the alveolar crest will be
      made directly in reference to the CEJ. The alveolar crest will be measured vertically from
      the mid-buccal, or greatest point of the defect, and proximal osseous crest levels. The soft
      tissue recession defect will be measured horizontally and vertically for the osseous
      measurements. Root surfaces will be meticulously root planed using hand instruments to obtain
      a smooth, hard root surface, then the incisions will be made. No osseous recontouring will be
      performed.

      The surgical procedure for the control sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel
      preparation that is a modification of a previous tunnel technique described by Allen AL
      (Allen AL, 1994a/1994b). This tunnel technique was modified to include coronal positioning of
      the soft tissue over an allograft (E.P Allen). Split-thickness dissection beyond the
      mucogingival junction will be made to elevate the tissue and allow adequate coronal
      positioning. The tunnel is dissected using a specialized microsurgical kit. The tunnel and
      ADM will extend at least one tooth mesial and distal to the recession site. Papillae are
      completely elevated off the osseous crest so that the whole tissue complex is mobile and can
      be coronally positioned. In cases where access is difficult, an incision will be made to
      release the papilla to prevent tearing the tissue.

      The surgical procedure for the test sites will consist of a coronally positioned tunnel
      preparation (E.P. Allen) plus the use of mesial and/or distal intramucosal verticals, a
      modification of the vestibular incision subperiosteal tunnel access (VISTA) approach (Zadeh
      H, 2011). The procedure will begin with one or multiple (mesial and distal) intramucosal
      vertical incisions, with the location of access depending on the sites being treated. The
      intramucosal incision is made through the periosteum to elevate a subperiosteal tunnel,
      exposing the facial osseous plate as well as root dehiscences. The tunnel and ADM will extend
      at least one tooth mesial and distal to the recession site. The tunnel is dissected using a
      specialized microsurgical kit. It is crucial to extend the tunnel elevation sufficiently
      beyond the mucogingival margin as well as through the gingival sulci of the teeth being
      augmented to allow for low-tension coronal repositioning of the gingiva. The tunnel is
      extended interproximally under each papilla as far as the embrasure space permits, without
      making any surface incisions through the papillae.

      For both control and test groups, the Alloderm® is hydrated in two baths: first with sterile
      saline for a minimum of five minutes or until the backing separates from the Alloderm®, the
      second with sterile saline plus tetracycline at a ratio of 5 mg tetracycline / 1 mL saline
      until the tissue is fully hydrated. Next, the AlloDerm® will be adjusted to completely cover
      the defect, positioned against the root surface, at the CEJ, and the inferior and lateral
      borders of the grafts will extend at least 3.0 mm beyond the osseous defect margins. In the
      control group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured using a continuous sling suture technique with a
      Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the tissue will be coronally positioned and sutured
      separately using a continuous sling suture technique (line angle to line angle) with PTFE
      4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. In the test group, the AlloDerm® will be sutured using a
      continuous sling suture technique with a Maxon 5-0, 3/8 circle 13 mm needle and the tissue
      will be coronally positioned and sutured separately using a continuous sling suture technique
      (line angle to line angle) with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle 13.1 mm needle. The intramucosal
      vertical incisions will be sutured using simple interrupted sutures with PTFE 4-0, 3/8 circle
      13.1 mm needle.

      Post-operative instructions will be given to the patients along with prescriptions, in
      appropriate cases, for systemic doxycycline hyclate 100 mg once a day for 14 days; an
      anti-inflammatory agent (naproxen 375 mg q12h for 7 days); an analgesic (Vicodin ES q6-8h prn
      pain); a steroid, Medrol dose pack, 21 tablets of 4 mg methylprednisolone; 6 tablets on day
      1, 5 on day 2, decrease by 1/day until last tablet dose on day 6, or dexamethazone 1mg, 18
      tablets, 3 tablets/day for 1st 3 days, 2/day for the next 3 days, 1/day for the last 3 days
      (always taken in the morning). The surgical procedures will be documented with clinical
      photographs.
