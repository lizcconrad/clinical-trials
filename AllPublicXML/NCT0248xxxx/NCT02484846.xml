    <textblock>
      Fifty healthy, young participants (10 male, 40 female) completed two 3-hour study sessions
      that were at least five days apart. The first session was a baseline. The sleep intervention
      took place on the night prior to Session 2, where the amount of time in bed was manipulated
      to be 60-130% of the individual's habitual sleep time. Within both sessions, subjective
      (Stanford Sleepiness Scale, SSS) and objective (Psychomotor Vigilance Test, PVT) alertness
      were measured. During the middle of each session, a 40-minute ad libitum meal opportunity
      allowed participants to eat from eight different food items. Food healthfulness, caloric
      density, distribution and number of calories were measured and compared to alertness levels.
