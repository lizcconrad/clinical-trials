  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the Phase I study 15404 are to evaluate the safety, tolerability
      and pharmacokinetics of BAY94-9343 given once every 3 weeks in Japanese subjects with
      advanced, refractory solid tumors.

      The secondary objectives are to investigate the efficacy, biomarkers and immunogenicity.

    <description>Cohort 1: Safety, tolerability and PK of 4.5 mg/kg dose given Q3W. Proceeding to Cohort 2 or not will be decided based on both safety variables during Cycle 1 (21 days) of 3 to 6 subjects in Cohort 1 and PK obtained from Cycle 1 (at least Day 1 to Day 5).
Cohort 2: Safety, tolerability and PK of 6.5 mg/kg dose given Q3W. Whether recruitment will be continued up to 9 subjects for Cohort 2 or not will be decided based on safety variables during Cycle 1 (21 days) of the first 3 subjects in Cohort 2. The safety and tolerability of 6.5 mg/kg will be assessed based on the data of 9 subjects during Cycle 1 in Cohort 2, and considering long term toxicity, the safety and tolerability of BAY94-9343 will be assessed all safety data by the end of 3 cycles in Cohort 2.</description>
