  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Propofol has been used in adult populations to treat migraines as an abortive agent.
      Investigators plan to investigate its efficacy as an abortive agent in the pediatric
      population when administered as a safe low-dose infusion. Goals of the study are to:

        1. Evaluate efficacy of low-dose propofol infusion as an abortive agent in pediatric
           migraine headaches

        2. Evaluate effective and safe dosing limits in pediatric populations

        3. Evaluate duration of effect reached from a low-dose propofol infusion as an abortive
           agent

      Endpoints for the study will be:

        1. Number of enrolled patients

        2. Safety endpoints reached, including: cardiopulmonary depression, excessive somnolence
           Risks of the study are minimal due to the use of sub-anesthetic dosing of propofol under
           the guidance and supervision of a board certified pediatric anesthesiologist with the
           appropriate monitoring equipment and readily available emergency equipment.
           Investigators hope to demonstrate more rapid improvement and decreased side-effect as
           compared to standard care.
