  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of a larger clinical trial assessing an
      exercise program during the &quot;teachable moment&quot; in patients with prostate cancer and measuring
      its effect on tumor apoptosis signaling, lipogenesis and steroidogenesis. Participants will
      be randomized between a 4-12 week exercise program or to standard of care only. Participants
      will be assessed at screening, baseline (day 0), throughout the trial intervention (days
      1-84), post-intervention visit (prior to radical prostatectomy) and final study visit
      6-months post-radical prostatectomy. At each assessment, physical, biological samples and
      psychosocial assessments will take place.

    <description>The exercise program is a 4-12 weeks progressive combined resistance and aerobic exercise for participants from time of diagnosis to RP.
Participants will undergo twice weekly group-training (four-six participants/group) combined aerobic-resistance sessions (1hr per session), supervised by trained exercise therapists. In addition, participants will undergo home-based aerobic exercise independently three times a week with the goal to meet the current physical activity guidelines for cancer survivors (150min/week of moderate intensity aerobic activity and two resistance training sessions per week). Participants will also be supplied with the Canadian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behavior Guidelines Handbook and accompanying Log Sheets.</description>
