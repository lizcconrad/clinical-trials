  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Empowering Patients On Choices for Renal Replacement Therapy (EPOCH-RRT) study seeks to
      identify factors that matter the most to patients with kidney disease and study how they are
      impacted by different types of dialysis. The inclusion of patients, caregivers, and patient
      advocacy organizations as research partners will assure that the study addresses questions of
      greatest relevance to patients facing the need for dialysis.

      For Aim 3, the investigators are going to compare measures related to the decision-making
      process between patients receiving and not receiving a decision aid focusing on Peritoneal
      Dialysis and Hemodialysis.

    <measure>Preference for Shared Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the scale from Degner, L. F., Sloan, J. A., &amp; Venkatesh, P. (1996). The Control Preferences Scale. The Canadian journal of nursing research= Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres, 29(3), 21-43. The CPS is a clinically relevant, easily administered, valid, and reliable measure of preferred roles in health-care decision-making. A pick-one approach was used to identify patient preference for an active, passive or collaborative role in dialysis treatment decision making.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decisional Conflict</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the scale from O'Connor, Annette M. &quot;Validation of a Decisional Conflict Scale.&quot; Medical Decision Making 15, no. 1 (February 1, 1995): 25-30. 16 item scale, responses to each statement are scored from 1 (strongly agree) to 5 (strongly disagree), with negative statements having reverse scoring; thus high scores indicate higher decisional conflict. Mean score per participant is calculated across all items, subtract by 1 and multiplied by 25. Score range= 0-100. Mean scores across all participants in each arm are reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through the scale found in Decision Self-Efficacy Ottawa: Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Â© 1995 Available from: http://decisionaid.ohri.ca/docs/develop/User_Manuals/UM_Decision_SelfEfficacy.pdf O'Connor 1995 Items are scored 0(not at all confident) to 4 (very confident). Scores are summed across 10 items, divided by 10 and multiplied by 25. Scores range from 0-100. A score of 0 means &quot;extremely low self efficacy&quot; and a score of 100 means &quot;extremely high self efficacy&quot;.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Knowledge</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using scale from Cavanaugh K&quot;Patient Dialysis Knowledge Is Associated with Permanent Arteriovenous Access Use in Chronic Hemodialysis.&quot; Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology 4, no. 5: 950-56) Multiple choice questions with one correct answer per questions. Number of correct questions reported as a percentage of total number of questions (23).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Preparation for Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using Bennett, Carol, &quot;Validation of a Preparation for Decision Making Scale.&quot; Patient Education and Counseling 78, no. 1: 130-33 10 item scale, each item scored from 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal). items are summed and scored, converted to a 0-100 scale by subtracting 1 from the summed score and multiplying by 25. Higher scores indicate higher perceived level of preparation for decision making.</description>

          <description>Measured using the scale from Degner, L. F., Sloan, J. A., &amp; Venkatesh, P. (1996). The Control Preferences Scale. The Canadian journal of nursing research= Revue canadienne de recherche en sciences infirmieres, 29(3), 21-43. The CPS is a clinically relevant, easily administered, valid, and reliable measure of preferred roles in health-care decision-making. A pick-one approach was used to identify patient preference for an active, passive or collaborative role in dialysis treatment decision making.</description>

          <description>These patients will receive the decision aid tool. Decision-making outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy) will be compared between patients who received and did not receive a decision aid. These arms were chosen because the current standard of care is for health care providers to discuss options with patients without using a decision aid.
