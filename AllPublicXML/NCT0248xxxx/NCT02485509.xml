      The study will be split into two parts:

      Part I: A randomized, placebo-controlled, single dose, double-blind study in healthy
      volunteers with 20 mg followed by 40 mg after DSMB approval.

      Healthy group: one dose with 1 PK day 12 health volunteers (total): 6 subjects will
      randomized (4:2) to VM-1500 20 mg or placebo. After DSMB approval, 6 subjects will be
      randomized (4:2) to VM-1500 40 mg or placebo Part II: A randomized, placebo-controlled,
      multiple dose, double-blind study for 7 days in patients with HIV infection who are
      antiretroviral therapy-naïve. After positive DMSB review the dose will be escalated from 20
      mg to 40 mg once daily.

      Patient group: 2 PK days (in-house) at day 1 and day 7 16 patients (total): 8 subjects will
      be randomized (7:1) to VM-1500 20 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days. After DSMB approval, 8
      subjects will be randomized (7:1) to VM-1500 40 mg or placebo once daily for 7 days.
