  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cough is a life saving reflex, therefore it is important, especially in pediatrics, to calm
      cough spells without sedating the reflex. The intent of this study is to use a protective
      syrup with does not act as a sedative or as a potent mucolytic and measure its efficacy and
      safety versus placebo in children with moderate to severe night and daily cough. Cough is
      assessed with a validated parent questionnaire. The degree of disturbance of cough is
      followed immediately after one night administration of the study products and daily for 4
      nights, 3 days.

    <textblock>
      Cough is a life saving reflex, therefore it is important, especially in pediatrics, to calm
      cough spells without sedating the reflex. Looking into mechanisms for cough management
      different from mucolytics, or sedatives, such as protection of irritated pharynx mucosa from
      post nasal drip or other irritating substances is theoretically sound and shows practical
      interesting results.

      A parallel comparison of efficacy and tolerability between such protective mechanism (acting
      through a barrier and radical scavenging action) due to natural substances (honey, plantago
      lanceolata and thymus vulgaris) and placebo has not been done so far, in very young children,
      especially in a time frame of 4 days. The intent of this study is to use the protective syrup
      versus placebo in children with moderate to severe night and daily cough, measured with a
      validated parent questionnaire. The degree of disturbance of cough is followed immediately
      after one night administration of the study products and daily for 4 nights, 3 days.

      Assessment of effectiveness of the protective cough syrup as compared to placebo is
      considered very interesting due to the mechanism of the remedy.
