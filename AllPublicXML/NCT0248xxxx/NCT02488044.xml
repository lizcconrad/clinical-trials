      A Phase 1/2 Open-label Study in Patients with Arginase I Deficiency to Investigate the
      Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Pharmacodynamics of Intravenous AEB1102. This study is designed
      to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV administration of AEB1102 for the treatment of
      pediatric and adult patients with Arginase I deficiency and hyperargininemia. This study will
      be conducted in 2 parts: Part 1 (Single Ascending Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Repeated
      Dosing). Each part will be preceded by a baseline assessment of arginine levels. All patients
      who participate in Part 1 may continue AEB1102 dosing in Part 2 if they qualify for continued
      dosing. A data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will provide independent review of study safety
      data and recommend whether the sponsor should continue the study as planned, modify the study
      protocol, or discontinue the study.
