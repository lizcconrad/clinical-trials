  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50 residents in surgical specialities (OB&amp;G, General surgery and Urology) from a
      single university in Italy will be randomized into two groups, after a stratification based
      on residency year and laparoscopic/simulator experience. The first one will train to FLS
      (fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery) following pre-recorded instruction from course
      materials; the second one will be mentored by a proctor in single training section. The aim
      is to evaluate the best way to train residents applying for the very first time in an
      extensive way the &quot;fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery&quot; program in an Italian Institution.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A complete 5-skills based FLS (fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery) curriculum is proposed
      to each resident enrolled in the trial. The first group trains with videos and written
      instructions, without any kind of support from a tutor. The second group is aided by a tutor,
      receiving tailored teaching and mentoring.

      The primary goal was to asses the impact of tutoring in Passing the FLS examination at the
      end of a 3-months training: the outcome is the dichotomous PASS/DON'T PASS THE EXAM. At the
      same time the investigators assess the performance to record and evaluate any differences in
      groups and subgroups (year of residency, gender, specialty, etc.).

      The evaluation was based on FLS program standards, recording time and penalties.

      The training and evaluation setting was created to exactly reproduce the FLS one, mostly
      using the FLS material itself, or using FLS admitted/compatible instrumentation.
