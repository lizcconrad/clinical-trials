      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside sodium
      injection can relieve the neurotoxicity caused by oxaliplatin in GI cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxaliplatin is widely used in GI cancer. Neutropenia and neurotoxicity are the most common
      adverse effects of oxaliplatin which even result in discontinue of chemotherapy, especially
      for patients suffered from heavily acute neurotoxicity.The continuous sense and/or motor
      abnormal reduce the quality of life. To date, there is no a drug to treat oxaliplatin induced
      neurotoxicity. Monosialotetrahexosylganglioside(GM) is a component of membrane of nerve
      cells. Previous phase II clinical trial showed, it can reduce oxaliplatin-induced
      neurotoxicity (OIN). But it did not investigated for curing OIN in randomized control trial.
      A phase III trial is needed to investigate the effect and safety of
      monosialotetrahexosylganglioside Sodium Injection for treatment OIN at GI cancer.
      Investigators design this randomized phase III placebo-controlled trail to identify the
      effect of monosialotetrahexosylganglioside sodium injection as a treatment agent for OIN.
      Investigators found 2.5% patients of grade 2 or more serious OIN would relieve with 3
      months(data not published). Investigators assume monosialotetrahexosylganglioside can reduce
      neurotoxicity by 30%. At the level of power 0.8, the sample size is 160 with 10% dropout. If
      there is no dropout, the trial will be terminated at 144 events occur.The board of Tianjin
      cancer hospital has permitted the trial and will monitor the whole process of this study. All
      data will be submitted to the department of clinic trials at Tianjin cancer hospital.The
      statistics specialist is participating this design and will afford help for data analysis.
