      This pilot phase II trial studies how well CPI-613 (6,8-bis[benzylthio]octanoic acid),
      cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride work in treating patients with acute myeloid
      leukemia or granulocytic sarcoma (a malignant, green-colored tumor of myeloid cells [a type
      of immature white blood cell]) that has returned (relapsed) or that does not respond to
      treatment (refractory). 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid is thought to kill cancer cells by
      turning off their mitochondria. Mitochondria are used by cancer cells to produce energy and
      are the building blocks needed to make more cancer cells. By shutting off these mitochondria,
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid deprives the cancer cells of energy and other supplies that
      they need to survive and grow in the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cytarabine and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either
      by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.
      Giving 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid together with cytarabine and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride may kill more cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of CPI-613 when administered with high dose cytarabine, and
      mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone hydrochloride) in all three phases of salvage therapy (induction,
      consolidation and maintenance).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe the response rate (complete remission [CR], and CR with incomplete recovery
      [CRi]) of CPI-613 in combination with high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone.

      II. To observe the overall survival of patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with high
      dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance.

      III. To monitor toxicities experienced by patients treated with CPI-613 in combination with
      high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in induction, consolidation and maintenance.

      OUTLINE:

      SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 1: Patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid intravenously
      (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 3
      for 5 doses, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first, third, and
      fifth doses of cytarabine.

      SALVAGE INDUCTION COURSE 2 (OPTIONAL, AT DISCRETION OF TREATING PHYSICIAN): Patients receive
      6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride as in course 1
      or an abbreviated second course at the discretion of the treating physician. In the
      abbreviated course, patients receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV over 2 hours on days
      1-3, cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours starting on day 2 for 3 doses, and
      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes after the first and third cytarabine doses.

      SALVAGE CONSOLIDATION: Patients achieving response receive up to 2 courses of the abbreviated
      course of 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid, high dose cytarabine, and mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride. Patients achieving response may undergo stem cell transplant at the discretion
      of the treating physician. Patients may proceed to maintenance after 1, 2 or no courses of
      consolidation at the discretion of the treating physician.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients achieving response receive 6,8-bis(benzylthio)octanoic acid IV
      over 2 hours on days 1-5. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
