    <textblock>
      The GlucoMe device, in its original packaging, along with the user manual and QuickStart
      guide will be provided to the patient in a simulated home use environment. The patient
      labeling will be in the format intended for distribution.

      Ten (10) subjects identified as potential end users of the GlucoMe device will receive the
      user manual. An additional ten (10) subjects also identified as potential end users of the
      GlucoMe device will NOT receive the user manual. All subjects will be provided with a
      pre-test and post-test questionnaire and a list of tasks to complete, including applying and
      operating the device.

      The observer and user post-test questionnaire will collect information regarding device use.
      The device's use will be compared with identified risks to determine if the percentage of
      failures is within the study protocol success criteria. Additionally, measurable usability
      criteria for specific, critical steps will be evaluated.

      Twenty (20) subjects identified as potential end users of the device will be recruited to the
      study and screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be
      asked to sign informed consent. The GlucoMe device, in its original packaging, along with the
      user manual and QuickStart guide will be provided to the patient in a simulated home-use
      environment. The patient labeling will be in the format intended for distribution.

      Ten (10) subjects identified as potential end users of the GlucoMe device will receive the
      user manual and QuickStart guide. An additional ten (10) subjects also identified as
      potential end users of the GlucoMe device will not receive the user manual, but will receive
      the QuickStart guide. All subjects will be provided with a pre-test and post-test
      questionnaire and a list of tasks to complete, including applying and operating the device.

      The observer examination and user post-test questionnaire will collect information regarding
      device use. The device's use will be compared with identified risks to determine if the
      percentage of failures is within the study protocol success criteria. Additionally,
      measurable usability criteria for specific, critical steps will be evaluated.

    <measure>Operating the GlucoMe device: obtaining a glucose reading and recording the results</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Hour</time_frame>
    <description>Using the device, with or without the user manual, all 20 subjects tested were able to complete device related tasks, including starting the application, operating the GlucoMe device and obtaining a glucose reading and recording the results, in a timeframe of up to 1 hour and with minimal attempts to ask for assistance; and Using the device and the user manual. Considering that the GlucoMe is a low risk device, and the probability of an occurrence and the severity of a failure are low, a success rate of 100% potential end user subjects passing may be considered acceptable for the over the counter use of the device. Any failures to complete the device related tasks and/or self-exclude from use of the device must be explained.</description>
