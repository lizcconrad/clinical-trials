  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an Open-label, Non-Randomized, 3-way Crossover Bioequivalence Study to compare
      fentanyl release after heating of a brand name (Duragesic) and generic (Apotex and Mylan)
      fentanyl skin patches in healthy adults.

    <textblock>
      This research study is intended to determine the effect of heat on FDA-approved fentanyl
      transdermal patches and whether the heat applied will result in more fentanyl being absorbed
      through the skin than without applying heat. This is important given that little is known
      about how the release of fentanyl is affected by heat, particularly for generic products that
      are also available over the counter. This study will use fentanyl patches (brand name and
      generic patches) that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are
      already sold over the counter to customers in the United States, and will not include any
      placebos.
