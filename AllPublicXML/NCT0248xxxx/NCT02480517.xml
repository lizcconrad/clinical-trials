    <textblock>
      The Wave VI study is a, multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham controlled
      feasibility study of the safety of renal denervation in patients with stage I and II
      hypertension who have an average office systolic blood pressure between 150 and 180 mmHg and
      have not been on any antihypertensive medications for at least six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this feasibility study is to assess the safety of renal denervation
      using externally focused therapeutic ultrasound with non-invasive targeting for patients with
      stage I and II hypertension who are not on any antihypertensive medications. The key
      secondary objective is to assess the effect of the therapy on changes from baseline in
      ambulatory systolic BP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is at least 18 years of age and no more than 80 years of age and can be safely
             removed from present antihypertensive therapy.

          2. Subject has not been taking any anti-hypertensive medications for at least 6 months
             prior to study enrollment.

          3. Subjects must have an average office seated systolic BP (SBP) between 150 mmHg and 180
             mmHg inclusive in the untreated state for a minimum of 2 weeks.

          4. Mean daytime ambulatory SBP &gt; 135 mmHg and no more than 170 mmHg in addition to mean
             daytime ambulatory DBP &gt; 85 mmHg.

          5. Subject has two functioning kidneys.

          6. Subject has an eGFR value of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m² (MDRD formula).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        a.Any known secondary causes of hypertension.

        b.Evidence of current or past history of any clinically significant renal artery stenosis
        on duplex ultrasound as defined by a finding of at least one of the following:

          1. Peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the main renal artery of 150 cm/s or greater;

          2. Renal/aortic ratio (RAR) of greater than 3.5; or

          3. Complete lack of Doppler signal in any portion of the main renal artery (signifying
             complete occlusion).

        c.Previously documented finding of a 30% or greater renal artery stenosis in any renal
        arterial vessels as determined by angiographic examination, MRA or CTA.

        d.Kidney stones that are 1 cm or greater in size, or that are symptomatic. e.History of
        intra-abdominal surgery within the past six months or surgery through retroperitoneal path
        at any time .

        f.Previous renal denervation g.Previous renal transplant. h.Heterogeneities in kidney
        morphology, such as large cysts or tumors (&gt; 2 cm), which are determined at discretion of
        the investigator to potentially interfere with treatment.

        i.Hemodynamically unstable valvular heart disease for which BP reduction would be hazardous
        in the judgment of the site investigator-physician.

        j.Documented history of severe orthostatic hypotension that requires treatment or has
        necessitated hospitalization.

        k.Primary pulmonary hypertension l.History of myocardial infarction, unstable angina
        pectoris, or cerebrovascular accident within the last six months.

        m.BMI over 35 kg/m² and/or mid-arm circumference &gt; 45 cm (creates difficulty with ABPM
        measurements) n.Anatomy that precludes treatment as determined by the Surround Sound
        System. This may include any of the following:

          1. Target treatment depth as measured by the Surround Sound System of greater than 13 cm
             (Skin to target);

          2. Lack of visualization of the renal artery and or renal artery Doppler signal with the
             Surround Sound System;

          3. Lack of visualization of the renal parenchyma due to obscuration by bowel or other
             abdominal or retroperitoneal structures; or

          4. Narrow window between the superior margin of the iliac crest and the inferior margin
             of the lowest rib that prevents adequate positioning of both the Surround Sound
             imaging probe and the treatment unit.

        o.Subject is pregnant , nursing, or intends to become pregnant during the study period.

        p.Enrollment in another interventional research protocol. q.Any condition that, at the
        discretion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study.

        r.Subject is unable, or unwilling, to comply with the protocol-required follow-up schedule.
