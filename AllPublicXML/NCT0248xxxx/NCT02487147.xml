      This study will compare the efficacy of the Free Air Portable Air Powered Respirator (PAPR)
      system versus a N95 mask in preventing nasal detection of influenza following an exposure.
      The investigators hypothesize the use of the Free Air PAPR system will be superior to a N95
      respirator at interrupting the exposure of the study participants to aerosolized influenza
      virus particles.

    <textblock>
      Airborne transmission represents one of the most rapidly spreading and least understood
      dissemination mechanisms for pathogens. Public health strategies to prevent and control the
      often explosive outbreaks associated with such pathogens are: 1) vaccination and treatment,
      if available, 2) decontamination of the exposed areas and surfaces, and 3) isolation and
      barrier precautions such as face masks. Unfortunately, evidence of the efficacy of currently
      recommended barrier precautions is currently lacking.

      Attempts to validate the effectiveness of personal protective equipment are limited to in
      vitro experiments with mannequin heads. This human exposure study will provide a much more
      accurate life-like exposure scenario. The use of live attenuated influenza virus vaccine has
      been proven to be safe.

      Objectives: Evaluate the Free Air Portable Air Powered Respirator (PAPR) versus an N95 face
      mask for preventing the airborne cross-transmission of aerosolized influenza in human
      participants.

      Methods: Participants will be randomized to one of two arms: a) N95 respirator, or b) Free
      Air PAPR System. The primary outcome will be the rate of the transmission for the 2 study
      groups, so a nasal and nasopharyngeal swab will be performed immediately following the
      exposure.

             University

        Exclusion Criteria:
