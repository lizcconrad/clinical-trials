      This study aimed to compare 2 activated clotting time analysers (Hemochron Jr vs. ACT Plus).

      Measurement of activated clotting time (ACT) is a standard method for anticoagulation
      monitoring. Especially in cardiac surgery, heparin is usually used as anticoagulant and
      protamine is used to reverse anticoagulation effect at the end of surgery. ACT method defines
      the time until a clot is formed in a test tube after triggering of internal pathway
      coagulation using blood activating agents (eg. kaolin).

      Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) consists of withdrawing patient's blood volume early in
      the operative period and concurrent infusion of crystalloid or colloid to maintain
      intravascular volume, and is used in cardiac surgery. ANH is known to affect hemostasis in
      some studies.

      Assuming that accurate monitoring of coagulation therapy is important to prevent both
      thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications, we compared ACT results from 2 analysers (Hemochron
      Jr and ACT Plus) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery using ANH.
