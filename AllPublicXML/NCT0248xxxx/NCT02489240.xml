  <brief_summary>

      The investigators planned to research the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the
      incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D is primarily generated in the skin, in response to direct absorption of ultraviolet
      B radiation. Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral supplements.
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a generally reversible form of acute kidney injury that
      occurs mostly within 2-3 days of exposure to contrast medium (CM). The estimated incidence of
      CIN ranges from 2%-50%, and coronary angiography (CAG) or percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI), or both, are associated with CIN in about half of cases. Recently low vitamin D status
      has been shown to be associated with increased risk of CIN. However, its effects on CIN
      patients remain unclear. The investigators planned to determine the efficacy of vitamin D on
      the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography.
      This study may shed light as to whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct
      therapy in CIN patients.
