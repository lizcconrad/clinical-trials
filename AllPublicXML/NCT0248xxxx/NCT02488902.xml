  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the efficacy of a
      range four weekly doses of tafenoquine, and weekly mefloquine, with placebo as
      chemosuppression of P. falciparum malaria. Medications and placebo were matched and a
      double-dummy technique enabled blinding of tafenoquine versus mefloquine.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any cardiovascular, liver, neurologic, or renal function abnormality

                  disorder.

               -  Females who had not ceased menstruation; a urine β-human chorionic gonadotrophin
                  (β-HCG) test was to be performed at screening females who had ceased menstruation
                  to exclude pregnancy as a cause.

               -  Females who were lactating.

               -  Subjects given antimalarial drugs for treatment within two weeks of study drug
                  initiation.

               -  Subjects with clinically significant abnormalities (to include but not limited to
                  abnormal hepatic or renal function) as determined by history, physical and
                  routine blood chemistry and haematology values.

               -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs.

               -  Subjects unwilling to remain in the area, report for drug administration or blood
                  drawing during the 3-4 month duration of the study.

               -  Subjects with G6PD deficiency (as determined by two separate qualitative tests
                  per subject administered using distinct methods; methods used were visual dye and
                  filter paper methods).

               -  Subjects with any of the following laboratory values: haemoglobin (Hb) &lt;8g/dL,
                  platelets &lt;80,000/mm3, white blood cell count (WBC) &lt;3000/mm3, creatinine
                  &gt;1.5mg/dL, alanine transaminase (ALT) &gt;60IU or 1+ haematuria as detected by urine
                  dipstick.
