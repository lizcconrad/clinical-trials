      Prospective, multicentre, cohort study assessing a diagnostic management strategy for
      suspected Pulmonary Embolism with independent central adjudication of outcomes

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-centre, cohort study that will assess a new diagnostic
      management strategy for suspected Pulmonary Embolism (inpatients and outpatients). The new
      diagnostic strategy is designed to reduce the use of imaging tests for Pulmonary Embolism,
      particularly Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram, by excluding Pulmonary Embolism with
      combinations of Clinical Pretest Probability and D-dimer results in a higher proportion of
      patients. The safety of this management strategy will be established by demonstrating a very
      low rate of proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism during 90 days of follow-up
      in patients who had anticoagulant therapy withheld in response to negative diagnostic
      testing. Diagnostic test utilization will be assessed. All clinical outcomes will be
      adjudicated by a central independent adjudication committee that will be blind to initial
      D-dimer measurements and patient management.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients (either outpatients or inpatients) with clinically suspected Pulmonary
             Embolism.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Age less than 18 years.

          2. Treated with full-dose anticoagulation for â‰¥ 24 hours before D-dimer was measured.

          3. Major surgery (general or spinal anesthesia) in the past 21 days.

          4. Result of the D-dimer assay that will be used to manage the patient in the study is
             known before Clinical Pretest Probability was done.

          5. Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram or Ventilation Perfusion Scan was performed:

               1. before Clinical Pretest Probability was documented, or

               2. in a patient with Low Clinical Pretest Probability and a D-dimer level &lt;1,000
                  ug/L (or equivalent), or

               3. in a patient with Moderate Clinical Pretest Probability and a D-dimer level &lt;500
                  ug/L (or equivalent).

          6. Computed Tomography of the chest with contrast will be performed for another reason
             (e.g. to assess for malignant disease or aortic dissection), and would be performed
             even if Pulmonary Embolism is excluded by Clinical Pretest Probability and D-dimer
             testing.

          7. Ongoing need for anticoagulant therapy.

          8. Life expectancy less than 3 months.

          9. Geographic inaccessibility which precludes follow-up.

         10. Known pregnancy.

         11. Inability to provide informed consent.
