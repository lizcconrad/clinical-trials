      Two Intensive Life Style Intervention Programs in Related Caregivers of Preschool Children

      Substantial strides have been made in the treatment of acute cardiovascular conditions, such
      as myocardial infarction and stroke, however, the global burden of cardiovascular disease
      (CVD) continues to rise at an alarming rate. Furthermore, despite the abundant data
      demonstrating a greater burden of CVD in racial/ethnic minorities, and many specific
      interventions aimed at changing risk factor patterns or behaviors in racial/ethnic
      minorities, health disparities persist. In the present study, the investigators seek to
      evaluate the impact of a multifaceted and comprehensive lifestyle intervention coupled with
      atherosclerosis imaging on reducing cardiovascular risk among minority adults living in
      Harlem, New York. The investigators believe that holistic, multi-dimensional individual and
      peer-to-peer intensive lifestyle interventions involving parents/caregivers of preschool
      children will be effective in producing favorable change in their behaviors, which will be
      sustained over time. The primary hypothesis of the study is that aggressive lifestyle
      interventions will be more effective in improving healthy behaviors and biological correlates
      in at-risk adult parents and/or caregivers of preschool children in Harlem, NY. In aim 1, as
      an initial pilot study, the investigators will identify the contextual factors, facilitators
      and barriers that may impact the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for
      adults in Harlem, using qualitative research methods. In aim 2, the investigators will
      determine the impact of two intensive lifestyle interventions on promoting and improving
      healthy behaviors and biological parameters to lower cardiovascular risk, the impact of the
      knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors and the impact of these
      lifestyle interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately 600 asymptomatic at-risk
      adults. Finally, in aim 3, the investigators will evaluate the sustainability of the impact
      of the two intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters
      12 months after the intervention program ends.

      Aim 1 - Pilot, 1st Year: To identify the contextual factors, facilitators and barriers that
      may impact the implementation of a lifestyle intervention program for adults in Harlem, using
      qualitative research methods: 1) focus group discussions among a representative cohort of
      adults; 2) focus group discussions among community leaders; and 3) Pilot studies of
      feasibility of interventions in the representative cohort of adults.

      Subsidiary Aim 1.1: To use identified facilitators and barriers to develop a contextually and
      culturally appropriate model for an adult lifestyle intervention program.

      Subsidiary Aim 1.2: To implement a pilot intervention of the contextually and culturally
      adapted program among a sample of parents/caregivers of children in preschools in Harlem.

      The investigators will assess for acceptability and feasibility, and make any necessary
      modifications prior to the implementation of the cluster-randomized trial. This aim will be
      carried out at 2 preschools in Harlem, NY by including the parents and caregivers of
      pre-school children. The final intervention program that results from this
      intervention-mapping program will be piloted in parent groups of 10.

      Aim 2 - Randomization, 2nd and 3rd Year: To determine (i) the impact of two intensive
      lifestyle interventions on promoting and improving healthy behaviors (increased physical
      activity, smoking cessation etc.) and biological parameters (lipids, sugar) to lower
      cardiovascular risk, (ii) the impact of the presence of atherosclerosis on health behaviors
      and (iii) the impact of the lifestyle interventions on atherosclerosis among approximately
      600 asymptomatic at-risk adults.

      Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a greater
      improvement in healthy behaviors and biological parameters compared to controls whose
      intervention has only been received through the Children program.

      Hypothesis: Knowledge of presence of atherosclerosis as defined by 3D US will lead to greater
      improvement in healthy behaviors.

      Hypothesis: Adults receiving the lifestyle intervention programs will demonstrate a lesser
      progression or regression of 3-D ultrasound quantified atherosclerosis compared to controls.

      For this aim, the investigators will recruit parents and caregivers of pre-school children
      from up to twenty schools in Harlem, NY and perform a 2:1 (2 intervention, 1 control) cluster
      randomization of the schools. Those in the &quot;intensive intervention&quot; group will be randomly
      assigned to one of two interventions- an Intensive Individual Intervention Program&quot; (IIIP)
      developed through the intervention mapping program described in aim 1 or 'Peer-To-Peer
      Program - Intervention&quot; (PPPI), refined during that same pilot phase. The intervention
      program will continue for 24 months. Assessments will be performed at 6 months
      (early-effect), 12 months (interim-effect) at the end of the intervention (peak-effect). The
      outcome will be a composite score consisting of a 0-3 scale for behaviors/outcomes related to
      Blood pressure, Exercise, Weight, Alimentation (diet) and Tobacco (smoking) [Fuster-BEWAT
      score]. Participants will also undergo point of care testing for a lipid panel and blood
      sugar assessment, and a 3-D ultrasound (US) imaging (carotid, ileo-femoral) to assess for
      presence of atherosclerosis. The results of the 3-D ultrasound will be shared with
      participants to evaluate its impact on behavior change.

      Aim 3 - Sustainability, 4th Year: To evaluate the sustainability of the impact of the two
      intensive lifestyle interventions on healthy behaviors and biological parameters 12 months
      after the intervention program ends.

      Hypothesis: Adult caregivers receiving the intensive lifestyle approaches program for two
      years, will maintain sustainability with an advantage of the two &quot;Intensive Interventional
      groups&quot; over the control &quot;Traditional Health Education&quot; group. All participants will be
      followed for 12 months after the end of the intervention period and reassess their
      Fuster-BEWAT Score.
