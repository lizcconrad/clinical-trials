  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall incidents are the third cause of chronic disablement in elderly according to the World
      Health Organization (WHO). Recent meta-analyses shows that a multifactorial falls risk
      assessment and management programs are effective in all older population studied. However,
      the application of these programs may not be the same in all National health care setting
      and, consequently, needs to be evacuated by cost-effectiveness studies before to plan this
      intervention in regular care. In Italy structured collaboration between hospital staff and
      primary care is generally lacking and the role of Information and Communication Technologies
      (ICT) in a fall prevention program at home has never been explored.

      This is a two-group randomized controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effect of a home-based
      intervention program, delivered by a multidisciplinary health team, in preventing falls in
      elderly. The home tele-management program, previously adopted in our Institute for chronic
      patients, will be proposed to elderly people affected by chronic diseases at high risk of
      falling at time of hospital discharge. The program will involve the hospital staff and will
      be managed thanks to the collaboration between hospital and primary care setting. Patients
      will be followed at home for 6 months after hospital discharge. A nurse-tutor will be the
      case manager and telephone support, telemonitoring and tele-exercise will characterize the
      intervention program. People in the control group will receive the usual care. The main
      outcome measure of the study will be the percentage of patients sustaining a fall during the
      6-months follow-up period. An economic evaluation will be performed from a societal
      perspective and will involve calculating cost-effectiveness and cost utility ratios.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the effects of a home-based intervention
      program delivered by a multidisciplinary team through available ICT on recurrent falls in
      elderly discharged from hospital. This objective results in the following research questions:

      Is the program more effective than usual care in preventing new falls after hospital
      discharge?

      Is the program cost-effective compared to usual care when assessed from a community
      perspective?

      Besides the effect and economic evaluations, a process evaluation will be carried out to
      assess the feasibility and the applicability of the program for those receiving and
      implementing the intervention.

      The investigators expect that an intervention program can be effective to reduce falls in
      elderly patients discharged from hospital. The feasibility of the program for the
      participants and the cost-effectiveness analysis will confirm whether or a larger national
      trial is warranted.

    <description>In Italy, medical risks and patients risk behaviour are not systematically registered and addressed by hospital physicians, specialists and general practitioners (GPs).
Patients allocated in control group will receive by the hospital staff tailored recommendations based on their own risk profile. The same information will be sent to their GPs. No restrictions on co-interventions will be placed.</description>

    <description>The care model will provide 24/24 h assistance for six months and include:
Telephone Support: a nurse-tutor (NT) will follow-up the enrolled patients weekly mainly through scheduled appointments. NTs duties will be: 1 education (patients and family ' s health education on how to prevent falls, verification of the adherence to the pharmacological therapy, teaching on how to recognize problems that can conduct to falls) and 2. management. Occasional appointments will be required by patients on duty and managed by a nurse .
Telemonitoring: all patients will send proper biological traces and data will be registered on a personal health record.
Tele-exercise: Home exercises sessions will be provided by a DVD and monitored through a videoconference by a physiotherapist.</description>
