  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed research is to complete the development of a web-based program to
      train Employee Assistance Program (EAP) and EAP-affiliated managed behavioral health
      organization (MBHO) practitioners to conduct screening, brief intervention, and referral to
      treatment (SBIRT) for problem alcohol use among working adults.

    <textblock>
      In Phase 2, the investigators propose to develop the SBIRT Training &amp; Support Tool with two
      components: (1) online SBIRT Training for call-center and face-to-face practitioners
      conducting alcohol SBIRT and (2) SBIRT Support Tool with mobile/web interactive alcohol
      screening tools and brief intervention protocols to facilitate use of SBIRT by practitioners.
      The SBIRT Training component will provide practitioners with the skills, knowledge,
      motivation, and self-efficacy to: (a) screen their clients for unhealthy alcohol use with
      validated screening tools; (b) provide brief, motivational interviewing-informed
      intervention; and (c) make appropriate referrals. The training program will incorporate the
      Phase 1 content and expand the curriculum to include the use of additional validated alcohol
      screening tools. Content for alcohol SBIRT will be derived from NIAAA evidence-based
      materials.

      The SBIRT Support Tool will provide a mobile/web interface for practitioners to use
      interactive screening and brief intervention forms with (a) prompts for validated questions
      in the screening or brief intervention; (b) motivational interviewing-informed dialogue
      suggestions; (c) online resources (i.e., standard drink list; importance, confidence rulers);
      and (d) alcohol education and referral information. The practitioner will use the SBIRT
      Support Tool to (a) screen clients for alcohol use with interactive validated screening
      tools; (b) provide brief intervention for individuals based on their screening score; and (c)
      provide referral to treatment for individuals based on their screening score.

    <description>Situation judgment tests (SJT) will assess trainee's responses to real-life situations and behaviors. The SJT will consist of 9 brief (20-30 seconds) audio-based vignettes of motivational interviewing and alcohol SBIRT in typical clinical and counseling situations. For each of the 9 SJTs, trainees will identify MI/SBIRT-compliant responses.</description>
