      The objective of the research is to assess the effectiveness of adding a Household WASH
      component to the standard outpatient treatment of severe acute malnutrition.

      Study design: cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing two interventions:

        1. Control group: outpatient management of children diagnosed for severe acute malnutrition
           only

        2. Intervention group: outpatient management of children diagnosed for severe acute
           malnutrition + &quot;household WASH package&quot;

      2000 children, aged between 6 and 59 months, admitted to 20 OTP (Outpatient Therapeutic
      Program) centers for SAM will be included into the study and followed for 8 months (2 months
      of treatment, and 6 months after successful discharge).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Action Contre la Faim (ACF) nutrition project in Kanem started in 2008, and now is set up
      in 35 health facilities divided across 2 health districts: Mao and Mondo. The management of
      severe acute malnutrition is done in both OTP (Outpatient Therapeutic Programme) and in TFC
      (Therapeutic Feeding Center). Between the treatment of SAM in OTPs and TFCs, and the number
      of curative consultations, the total number of beneficiaries is expected to be 45,065 in 2014
      (without double counting).

      Clear evidence exists that some Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) interventions can
      successfully prevent diarrhea. For instance, interventions aiming at improving water quality
      at household level or at promoting hand washing with soap do reduce significantly diarrhea
      incidence. Estimations showed that WASH interventions have a small but measurable benefit on
      length growth, but not on weight or weight/height. Yet, to our knowledge, no impact of WASH
      interventions has been assessed, neither during nutritional rehabilitation where children are
      particularly vulnerable to infections, nor after discharge where immune recovery is still
      incomplete.

      In the context of nutritional rehabilitation of SAM (Severe Acute Malnutrition), the
      investigators hypothesize that improving water quality and hygiene-related care practices at
      household level would decrease incidence of WASH-related infections, such as diarrhea,
      nematode and environmental enteropathy. As such, it would improve weight gain, decrease
      relapses after successful discharge, and overall, could decrease over time the incidence of
      acute malnutrition in the community.

      The proposed WASH intervention will be added to already existing nutritional activities and
      it will include: i/ Household water treatment and hygiene kit (water container, water
      disinfection consumables, soap, cup, hygiene promotion leaflet) provided at beginning of SAM
      treatment; ii/ sessions of Hygiene promotion provided weekly at health center level iii/
      Household visits and hygiene sessions made during the treatment; // group discussion on
      hygiene and care practices made with mother at community level after successful discharge.

    <measure>Difference in the proportion of post-recovery relapse cases</measure>
    <time_frame>2 months and 6 months after successful OTP discharge</time_frame>
    <description>This is a dichotomous variable based on whether a child discharged as cured from the OTP program has a new event of acute malnutrition during the 6 months following the discharge. The relapse proportion for each group = [Total number of relapsing children] / [total number of discharged children that have been followed up] Relative reduction of 42% (from 12% to 7%) is expected.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in the average weight gain at the OTP discharge</measure>
    <time_frame>an expected average is between 7 and 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The weight gain (g/kg/day) = [weight (g) at discharge - minimum weight (g)] / [Duration from minimum weight to discharge] * [minimum weight (kg)]. The average weight gain (g/kg/day) for each group = [Sum of weight gains of cured children] / [total number of cured children].
Increase of 3 g/kg/day is expected.</description>

    <description>The OTP length of stay is the total number of days spent in the program, from admission of the child to the discharge of a cured child. The average length of stay for all children in each group = [total number of days of cured children] / [number of cured children].
Reduction of 5 days is expected.</description>
