      Background and Significance: Randomized Controlled Trials (RTCs) have demonstrated that
      evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs), particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), are
      highly effective in treating anxiety and depression, the most common mental health disorders
      in primary care settings. Mental health (MH) providers in VA
      Community-Based-Out-Patient-Clinics (CBOCs) are often located in rural areas and isolated
      from educational opportunities. Almost half of Veterans now use CBOCs. Studies have shown
      that the quality of delivery of EBPs (fidelity) impacts clinical outcomes. This study will
      test a computer-assisted tool (CALM Tools for Living) that increases fidelity to CBT in
      treating depression and four common anxiety disorders, including PTSD. Although results of a
      large RCT, the CALM study, suggested that the tool contributed to fidelity to the CBT
      protocol, this hypothesis has not been tested. This study will test the tool in primarily
      rural CBOCs in VA VISN16.

      Objective: To modify a computer-assisted CBT tool to meet the needs of CBOC MH providers and
      Veterans, to evaluate the impact on providers' fidelity to the CBT model and clinical
      outcomes, and to assess how best to support future implementation.

      Specific Aims/Hypothesis: (1) Engage CBOC MH providers in modifying the computer-assisted CBT
      tool such that its content is relevant and acceptable to Veterans and providers. The
      investigators hypothesize that the modified tool will be acceptable to both Veterans and
      providers. (2) Compare MH provider fidelity to CBT and clinical outcomes among providers who
      used the tool and those who did not. The investigators hypothesize that clinicians who use
      the tool will have a higher fidelity to CBT and clinical outcomes among patients will be
      superior. (3) Prepare for future implementation of the tool in the VA.

      Methodology: This study will use a Type III hybrid effectiveness design. Methods common to
      the field of Instructional Design and Technology (IDT) will be used to modify the tool.
      Thirty-four CBOC MH providers will be trained in CBT and randomized to use the tool or not.
      Both groups will receive external facilitation to encourage the full implementation of CBT
      into practice on the clinic level. MH providers will treat 10 patients each. Patients will be
      assessed at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months. Provider fidelity to the CBT protocol will be
      measured, and finally, a tool kit for future implementation of the tool will be disseminated.

      Impact: The investigators expect the intervention to improve the technical quality of MH
      treatment in CBOCs and improve clinical outcomes among Veterans.

               2. have depression, PTSD, or other anxiety disorder (PD, GAD, SAD)

               3. want to receive CBT specifically

               4. are willing to have their therapy sessions audio-taped

               5. are willing and able to participate in clinical assessments (baseline, 3, 6, and
                  12 months) by phone.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be considered ineligible if they
