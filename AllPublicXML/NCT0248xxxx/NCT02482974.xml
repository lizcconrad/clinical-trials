      This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of conversion of sirolimus to everolimus
      in the maintenance treatment of LT recipients. Patients will be monitored every 12 weeks
      after the switch of treatment for 48 weeks. The laboratory tests including hematological,
      renal, hepatic, and metabolic parameters will be performed at each visit. Twenty-four-hour
      urine creatinine clearance and proteinuria will be determined from a 24-hour urine collection
      at baseline and week 48.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Everolimus (EVL) and sirolimus (SRL), an antagonist of mammalian target of rapamycin, has
      been introduced into solid organ transplantation to either replace or reduce the dose of
      potentially nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors. Although not approved for liver
      transplantation (LT), SRL has still been used in several LT centers. After EVL was approved
      by FDA and the Ministry of Health in Turkey for use in LT recipients, SRL was converted to
      EVL in our institution. This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of conversion of
      SRL to EVL in the maintenance treatment of LT recipients.

      Patients who switch from SRL to EVL will be monitored every 12 weeks after the switch of
      treatment for 48 weeks.

      Efficacy measure will be included any observation in terms of biopsy-proven acute/chronic
      rejection and graft or patient loss due to rejection.

      Safety evaluations will be included discontinuation of EVL and analyses of adverse events and
      grading laboratory abnormalities.

      Laboratory evaluations will be included hematological (CBC), renal (serum creatinine,
      estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and
      Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI)], and electrolytes), hepatic
      (serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transferase, bilirubin, and albumin),
      and metabolic parameters (fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride) at each visit.
      Twenty-four-hour urine creatinine clearance and proteinuria will be determined from a 24-hour
      urine collection at baseline and week 48.

      For patients who were on additional immunosuppressive treatments, those medications will also
      be continued.
