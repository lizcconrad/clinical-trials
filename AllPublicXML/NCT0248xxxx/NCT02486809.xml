  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the bioequivalence in healthy participants between a
      high-concentration formulation of lebrikizumab withdrawn from a vial and administered SC as a
      single injection by a needle and syringe, and a low-concentration formulation of lebrikizumab
      administered SC as a single injection via PFS-NSD.
