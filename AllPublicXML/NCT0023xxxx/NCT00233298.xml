  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the hormones in the taste buds are affected
      by tasting and eating food, and also whether these hormone levels are affected by an increase
      in body weight or type 2 diabetes.

      Cephalic phase of insulin secretion is regulated by autonomic and endocrine responses to
      food-related sensory stimulation such as sight, smell, and taste. Human taste perception
      comprises of at least five distinct qualities: bitterness, saltiness, sourness, sweetness,
      and umami, the sensation elicited by glutamate, commonly found in protein (meat, fish, and
      legumes) and flavor enhancer such as monosodium glutamate (MSG).

      Both the sweet and umami taste stimuli had been shown to illicit cephalic-phase insulin
      release in rats. Oral sensory stimulation in human with modified sham feeding (MSF where food
      is smelled, chewed, but not swallowed) had been shown to enhance insulin release during the
      cephalic phase, lower postprandial glucose level, and improve glucose tolerance in healthy
      subjects. The loss of pre-absorptive insulin response has been shown to impair glucose
      tolerance. Furthermore, patients with type 2 diabetes and their first degree relatives had
      been shown to have impairment of sweet taste.

      Recently, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) have been found in the taste
      cells located in the taste buds of mice (unpublished data). These new findings raise several
      interesting questions of whether strict tasting of food without ingestion may stimulate
      secretion of GLP-1 and PYY from the taste cells, whether their secretion is involved in the
      afferent input of the cranial nerves, and whether this secretion is impaired in obesity and
      in patients with pre-diabetes or type 2 diabetes. We also want to investigate whether
      different tastants, such as sweet versus umami, and different food contents such as percent
      fat versus carbohydrate compositions, would elicit different hormonal responses.
