      Background:

      - The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is a clinical research program on human
      aging that began in 1958. Volunteers of different ages join the study when they are healthy,
      and have follow-up visits for life. Visits last for multiple days. Participants are evaluated
      for many physical elements as well as for brain function. Physical tests are given.
      Information on mood, personality, and social aspects of life is also collected. This program
      has contributed more than any other research project to our understanding of aging.

      Objectives:

      - To characterize the many aspects of the aging process and learn how people can successfully
      adapt to aging.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy individuals at least 20 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will receive a booklet and video describing the tests they will take.

        -  During a 3-day visit at the study hospital, participants will take the following tests:

        -  Urine will be collected for 24 hours. Blood samples will be taken. A small piece of
           muscle tissue may be collected by a needle.

        -  A medical questionnaire and a physical exam will be given.

        -  Participants hearts will be tested, including with blood pressure tests and electronic
           monitors. They will breathe into a tube to test their lungs.

        -  Participants will perform several exercises, including treadmill walking.

        -  Vision, hearing, and taste will be tested.

        -  Bone and joint X-rays may be taken.

        -  Imaging tests will be given, such as an MRI.

        -  Participants will answer questions to test their mental abilities.

        -  Participants will return for follow-up visits every few years for life. The tests listed
           above will be given at every visit.

      The Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) is the NIA s major clinical research program
      in human aging that has been conducted in Baltimore since 1958. The study population is a
      series of healthy volunteers of different ages followed indefinitely with serial evaluations
      over time. The major aim of the study is to characterize the aging process in its
      multifaceted aspects. To accomplish this task, a large cohort of volunteers dispersed over a
      wide age range are enrolled in the study when they are healthy, and then followed with
      regular follow-up visits for life. Since the aging process involves the whole range of
      physiological domains, participants receive an extensive evaluation of physiological
      parameters, biomarkers, risk factors, disease-related measures, impairments, and physical and
      cognitive function over follow-up visits that last for multiple days. Blood samples and other
      specimens are collected to obtain part of these measures and/or to be stored for future use.
      Information on mood, personality, psychological and social aspects of life that are relevant
      to the study of aging is also collected. Information collected in the BLSA represents a
      unique source of longitudinal data on aging. Historically the BLSA has contributed more than
      any other research project to our understanding of aging. More recently, the BLSA has begun
      to focus on factors associated with exceptionally healthy aging.
