      Objectives

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Pilot Study: A preliminary assessment of the exposure and safety of oral A-60444 in
           post-stem cell transplant patients with RSV infection.

        -  Main Study: To determine the antiviral effect of oral A-60444 versus placebo in
           post-stem cell transplant patients with RSV infection and to assess the safety of oral
           A-60444 in post-stem cell transplant patients with RSV infection.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To study the pharmacokinetics of A-60444 in the presence of concomitant medications such
           as immunosuppressants and antifungals, in post-stem cell transplant patients with RSV
           infection.

      Sample Size: Six patients will be included in the open, pilot phase of the study and there is
      an option to include a further 22 patients into the main, placebo-controlled study, depending
      on the pilot study findings. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will assess the
      findings of the pilot study.

      Clinical will be recorded daily. A-60444 PK will be studied pre-dose and at peak dose on the
      last day (Day 5) of dosing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients diagnosed with RSV infection who have had a stem cell transplant.

          2. Female patients must be of non-childbearing potential or have a negative pregnancy
             test prior to study start and be deemed not at risk of becoming pregnant. Females of
             non-childbearing potential are defined as women who have had a hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy, tubal ligation, or who have been post-menopausal for at least two years;
             or are considered to be sterile due to recent chemotherapy.

          3. Aged between 18 and 65 years.

          4. Patients who have given their written informed consent to participate in the study.

          5. Patients who are willing and able to comply with the protocol and study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have received an investigational drug within one month preceding the
             start of dosing.

          2. Patients who have a documented history of allergy to benzodiazepines.

          3. Patients with significant hepatic impairment (alanine transaminase [ALT] more than 5 x
             upper level of normal [ULN], total bilirubin more than 3 x ULN). Biochemistry data
             collected four weeks prior to screening is acceptable.

          4. Patients, who in the opinion of their general practitioner or the Investigator, should
             not participate in the study.
