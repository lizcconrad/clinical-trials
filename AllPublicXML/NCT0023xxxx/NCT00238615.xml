    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess how well this particular combination of chemotherapy,
      radiation and surgery works to help people with locally advanced lung cancer, how well PET
      scans indicates whether someone has responded to chemotherapy and radiation, and gene
      expression patterns related to outcomes in patients with locally advanced lung cancer who
      receive this treatment regimen.

    <measure>2 Year Overall Survival After a Combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and Surgery in Stage III NSCLC Patients Following the Protocol Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Two years</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were analyzed for 2 year overall survival after receiving trimodality (chemotherapy/radiation/surgery) therapy for stage III NSCLC. Patients had a chest x-ray and a doctor visit with a physical examination every 3 months after completion of all therapy for 3 years then every 6 months for 3 years to look for evidence of recurrent disease and to follow survival. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 6, 12, 18 months after completion of all therapy and then yearly for 3 years or as clinically indicated to evaluate for relapse.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, 5 weeks after combined chemo-radiation</time_frame>
    <description>The change in standardized uptake values (SUV)max on PET scans obtained pre- and after 5 weeks of combined chemo-radiation for patients enrolled on the trial were evaluated for ability to predict outcomes including complete resection at time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of the chemo-radiation), progression-free survival and 2 year overall survival.

This will be a 16 Gy boost given with concurrent weekly chemotherapy as during the neoadjuvant period.</description>

          <description>Patients were treated on this prospective phase II trial of trimodality therapy. Induction treatment consisted of weekly docetaxel 20 mg/m2 and weekly carboplatin at an area under curve (AUC) of 2 concurrent with 45 Gy thoracic radiotherapy. Resection was performed unless felt to be unsafe or if patients had progressive disease. Postoperative consolidation consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin at an AUC of 6 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles with growth factor support. Patients were followed for survival outcomes.</description>

          <description>The change in standardized uptake values (SUV)max on PET scans obtained pre- and after 5 weeks of combined chemo-radiation for patients enrolled on the trial were evaluated for ability to predict outcomes including complete resection at time of surgery (3-6 weeks after completion of the chemo-radiation), progression-free survival and 2 year overall survival. The mean SUVmax pre chemoradiation minus the mean SUVmax post-radiation is reported.</description>

        <title>2 Year Overall Survival After a Combination of Chemotherapy, Radiation and Surgery in Stage III NSCLC Patients Following the Protocol Therapy.</title>
        <description>Patients were analyzed for 2 year overall survival after receiving trimodality (chemotherapy/radiation/surgery) therapy for stage III NSCLC. Patients had a chest x-ray and a doctor visit with a physical examination every 3 months after completion of all therapy for 3 years then every 6 months for 3 years to look for evidence of recurrent disease and to follow survival. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 6, 12, 18 months after completion of all therapy and then yearly for 3 years or as clinically indicated to evaluate for relapse.</description>

            <description>Patients were treated on this prospective phase II trial of trimodality therapy. Induction treatment consisted of weekly docetaxel 20 mg/m2 and weekly carboplatin at an area under curve (AUC) of 2 concurrent with 45 Gy thoracic radiotherapy. Resection was performed unless felt to be unsafe or if patients had progressive disease. Postoperative consolidation consisted of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin at an AUC of 6 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles with growth factor support. Patients were followed for survival and progression free survival outcomes.These results are published PMID: 21752720.</description>

            <groups_desc>2-year overall survival (OS) Our null hypothesis was a probability of survival at 2 years of 0.30. The study was powered at 80% (with α 5% two-tailed) to detect a probability of survival at 2 years of 0.55. This would require 30 patients assuming accrual over 2 years with 1 year of additional follow-up. The probability of survival at 2 years of 0.55 is based on previous studies of neoadjuvant approaches with reported 2 year survival in the 40-60% range.</groups_desc>
