      The purpose of this study is to determine:

        1. If vacuum assisted closure (VAC®) therapy results in altered proteomic expression of
           angiogenic markers compared to moist wound therapy.

        2. If VAC® therapy results in increased angiogenesis compared to moist wound therapy.

             weeks and less than one month.

          -  Patient has transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2) evaluation that demonstrated tissue
             hypoxia in the periwound region, as indicated by a reading of 10-40 mmHg within the
             prior two weeks.

          -  Ankle Brachial Index &gt; 0.7 within the prior two weeks.

          -  Patient does not plan on becoming pregnant during the course of the study.

          -  Patient is willing to use effective method of contraception for the duration of the
             study, is permanently sterilized, or post-menopausal as defined by cessation of menses
             for at least one year prior to enrollment in study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosed and untreated wound infection.

          -  Presence of sickle cell disease.

          -  Presence of connective tissue disease (e.g. history of or active lupus).

          -  Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels greater than 9% thirty days prior to screening visit (if
             patient is confirmed diabetic).

          -  Treatment with an investigational therapy within the previous 30 days.

          -  Lower extremity wound (under consideration for study) with malignancy.

          -  Lower extremity wound (under consideration for study) with untreatable cellulitis.

          -  Presence of untreated osteomyelitis.

          -  Presence of any systemic hematologic disorder or condition that would impede healing.

          -  History of radiation to the wound area.

          -  History of drugs that may delay wound healing.

          -  History of thermal injury to the wound area.

          -  Prior VAC® therapy to the wound within 30 days of enrollment.

          -  Current or prior treatment with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) or warm-up therapy to
             the same wound.

          -  Recent diagnosis of cancer or active management of cancer within the last year.

          -  Treatment with skin or dermal substitutes or dressings with living cells capable of
             producing growth factors within the previous 30 days.

          -  End stage renal disease.

          -  History of alcohol or drug abuse that may impact protocol compliance or delay wound
             healing.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to hydrogel or any disposable component of the VAC® Therapy
             System.

          -  Necrotic tissue with eschar present which cannot be debrided.

          -  Any other severe concurrent disease, which, in the judgment of the investigator, would
             make the patient inappropriate for entry into the study.
