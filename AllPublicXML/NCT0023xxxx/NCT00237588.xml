  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine if angiotensin-II AT-1 receptor blockade(ARB) may improve insulin sensitivity
      assessed by the hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic glucose clamp, more than CCB therapy at a
      comparable dose with regards to the blood pressure-lowering effect.

      Patients with hypertension have an increased prevalence of insulin resistance and an
      increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus with ageing. Different antihypertensive
      regimens have varying effects on glucose metabolism and the development of diabetes mellitus.
      In a double-blind,randomized cross-over study we aim to compare the metabolic effects of 10
      mg amlodipine and 100 mg losartan + 5 mg amlodipine in patients with hypertension and other
      risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.

      After a 4-week open label amlodipine 5 mg run-in period, all hypertensive patient will be
      randomized to additional treatment with either amlodipine 5 mg or losartan 100 mg for 8
      weeks. At the end of this 8-week treatment-period we will do a physical examination,
      laboratory-tests, hyperinsulinaemic isoglycaemic glucose clamp, heart rate variability and
      baroreflex sensitivity measurements. Following this is a 4-week wash-out phase where the
      subjects continue open label 5 mg amlodipine, before crossed over to the opposite treatment
      regimen for another 8 week before the final examination.
