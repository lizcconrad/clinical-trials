  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NGX-4010 administered at
      intervals of no less than 12 weeks over 1 year, based on the presence or return of pain, for
      the treatment of painful HIV-AN and PHN. Participation is limited to former study subjects
      from previous trials of NGX-4010 at selected sites.

      Study C118 is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm study for subjects who successfully
      completed a previous NGX-4010 study and have not received open-label or blinded NGX-4010
      study patches within the 12 weeks prior to study entry. One hundred eligible subjects will
      receive an initial open-label NGX-4010 study patch application and up to three additional
      open-label NGX-4010 applications at intervals of no less than 12 weeks, based on the presence
      or return of pain. Eligible subjects will have moderate to severe neuropathic pain secondary
      to HIV-AN or PHN, with average pain levels deemed appropriate for further treatment with
      NGX-4010 as judged by the Investigator.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Summary eligibility criteria:

          -  Subjects must be in good health and have successfully completed a past trial of
             NGX-4010 with no past occurrence of adverse events that would contraindicate further
             treatment.

          -  The time between the last study patch on the previous study and the first study patch
             on this study must be at least 12 weeks.

          -  Topical pain medications are exclusionary and require washout prior to study patch
             application for this study.

          -  Chronic, nontopical pain medications are allowed but must be stable (not as needed)
             for a defined period prior to first study patch application.

          -  Other specific inclusion and exclusion criteria must be met prior to enrollment on the
             study.
