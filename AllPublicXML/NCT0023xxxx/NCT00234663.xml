  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the disease is caused by a nonsense mutation
      (premature stop codon) in the gene that makes the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
      (CFTR) protein. PTC124 has been shown to partially restore CFTR production in animals with CF
      due to a nonsense mutation. The main purpose of this study is to understand whether PTC124
      can safely increase functional CFTR protein in the cells of patients with CF due to a
      nonsense mutation.

      In this study, patients with CF due to a nonsense mutation will be treated with a new
      investigational drug called PTC124. Evaluation procedures (history, physical examination,
      blood and urine tests to assess organ function, electrocardiogram (ECG), chest x-ray, and
      CF-specific tests) to determine if a patient qualifies for the study will be performed within
      21 days prior to the start of treatment. Eligible patients who elect to enroll in the study
      will then participate in two 28-day treatment and follow-up periods (56 days total). Within
      the first 28-day period, PTC124 treatment will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 14
      days at doses of 4 mg/kg (breakfast), 4 mg/kg (lunch) and 8 mg/kg (dinner); there will then
      be an interval of 14 days without treatment. Within the second 28-day period, PTC124
      treatment will be taken 3 times per day with meals for 14 days at doses of 10 mg/kg
      (breakfast), 10 mg/kg (lunch) and 20 mg/kg (dinner); there will then be an interval of 14
      days without treatment. There will be a 2-night stay at the clinical research center at the
      beginning and at the end of each 14 days of PTC124 treatment, which means that there will be
      four 2-night stays at the clinical research center during the study. During the study, PTC124
      efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics will be evaluated periodically with measurement of
      transepithelial potential difference (TEPD), nasal mucosal brushing to assess for cellular
      CFTR mRNA and protein, medical history, physical examinations, blood tests, urinalysis, ECGs,
      chest x-ray, and pulmonary function tests.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of CF based on documented evidence of a conclusively abnormal sweat test
             (sweat chloride &gt;60 mEq/liter).

          -  Abnormal chloride secretion as measured by TEPD (a less than -5 mV TEPD assessment of
             chloride secretion with chloride-free amiloride and isoproterenol).

          -  Presence of a nonsense mutation in one of the alleles of the CFTR gene.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Body weight ≥40 kg.

          -  FEV1 ≥40% of predicted for age, gender, and height (Knudson standards).

          -  Oxygen saturation (as measured by pulse oximetry) ≥92% on room air.

          -  Willingness of male and female patients, if not surgically sterile, to abstain from
             sexual intercourse or employ a barrier or medical method of contraception during the
             study drug administration and follow-up periods.

          -  Negative pregnancy test (for females of childbearing potential).

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan,

             or laboratory abnormality that, in the investigator's opinion, could adversely affect
             the safety of the patient, makes it unlikely that the course of treatment or follow-up
