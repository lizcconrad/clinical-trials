  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using a protective
      device/drug to prevent renal injury during renal artery stenting and to assess whether the
      preventative effects are measurable and if there is a differential treatment effect for
      either device alone or in combination.

      This study is designed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of using protective device/drug
      to prevent renal injury during renal artery stenting (RAS) and to assess whether the
      preventative effects are measurable, and if there is a differential treatment effect for
      either device alone or in combination.

      Specific goals of the study include:

        -  To establish device and drug safety

        -  To identify appropriate markers for renal injury

        -  To measure effectiveness of drug and device

        -  To enable the design of FDA efficacy trials for renal artery stenting inclusive of
           device and or drug

      The study will address the four following hypotheses:

        -  AngioGuard™ distal protection device provides significant protection from
           atheroembolization during RAS procedures as measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month
           after the procedure.

        -  Abciximab (ReoPro) offers protection against platelet aggregation and embolization as
           measured by affected kidney GFR at 1 month after the procedure.

        -  AngioGuard™ and Abciximab are safe, alone and in combination.

        -  Is there an interaction effect between AngioGuard™ and ReoPro for efficacy and safety?
