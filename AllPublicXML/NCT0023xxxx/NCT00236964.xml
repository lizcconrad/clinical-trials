      The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of oral iron (ferrous sulfate) plus
      erythropoietin to Iron Sucrose plus erythropoietin for managing anemia patients with chronic
      renal failure who are not receiving dialysis.

      Randomized open-label multicenter active-controlled study of anemic patients with Chronic
      Renal Failure who are not yet receiving dialysis. The duration of the study was five months.
      After screening procedures including multiple hemoglobin values, patients were randomly
      assigned to either IV Iron Sucrose (200mg X 5) or oral iron sulfate (325mg TID)for 29 days.
      Safety assessments included the recording of all adverse events, physical examinations, vital
      signs, electrocardiograms and clinical laboratory tests. Efficacy parameters included
      hematologic parameters.
