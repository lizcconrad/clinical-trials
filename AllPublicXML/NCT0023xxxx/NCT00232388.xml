  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the carboxy-terminal of procollagen type I
      (PICP) can be a useful marker of different degrees of myocardial fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abnormality of diastolic function, particularly a more advanced form known as restrictive
      tilling pattern, has been correlated with worse outcome in patients with systolic dysfunction
      associated with chronic heart failure or following an acute myocardial infarction. Recently,
      the severity of diastolic dysfunction has also been shown to predict the response to cardiac
      synchronization therapy for refractory heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.

      Varying degree of diastolic dysfunction has been reported among patients with comparable
      severity of systolic dysfunction. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed
      discordance between systolic and diastolic dysfunction in these patients remains incompletely
      understood.

      The carboxy-terminal of procollagen type I (PICP), a peptide that is cleaved from procollagen
      type I during the synthesis of fibril-forming collagen type I, has been associated with
      myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial fibrosis is a major determinant of both systolic and
      diastolic function of the heart. We hypothesize that differential degrees of myocardial
      fibrosis may be responsible for these discrepancies.
