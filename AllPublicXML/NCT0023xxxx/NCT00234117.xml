  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if 20mg BID of Rabeprazole is effective in
      controlling GERD in patients with concomitant bronchial asthma and to assess improvement in
      asthma after reflux control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease has been considered as having a role in the course of asthma,
      as shown by the improvement of symptoms with adequate acid suppression therapy. It is
      important to consider and establish the presence of GERD in patients with asthma specially,
      those who fail to respond to conventional asthma management. It is believed that two
      mechanisms may play a role in the association between Bronchial Asthma and GERD, most
      commonly microaspiration of acid causing bronchoconstriction, the second being increased
      vagal tone.

      Establishing an adequate and timely diagnosis and confirming or excluding a relationship
      between the two entities in asthmatic patients is the first step towards effective patient
      management. The next important consideration is establishing the correct acid suppression
      therapy and monitoring response to therapy with objective testing such as Pulmonary Function
      Testing (PFT) and esophageal pH testing. Since there is not a real &quot;normal&quot; or physiologic
      reflux measure for patients with extresophageal manifestations as seen in patients with
      &quot;classic&quot; reflux where a total time of exposure to acid (pH &lt; 4) less than 5% is considered
      normal, in these patients it will be necessary to establish a more strict pH control than in
      those with classic GERD. Achieving complete acid control in this population is expected to
      require higher doses of medication than those used in patients with classic reflux and no
      extraesophageal manifestations. Thus we have developed this study in which we will assess the
      response to 20 mg BID dosing of Rabeprazole measured by pH monitoring and then follow
      improvement in Pulmonary Function Testing ( objective measure),as well as symptomatic
      response.
