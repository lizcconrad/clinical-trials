  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to test accuracy of positive preejection velocity to predict left
      ventricular remodeling and long-term prognosis after revascularization in 200 patients with
      chronically dysfunctional myocardium. Patients will be followed for 3 years.

      Our hypothesis is that tissue-Doppler-derived analysis of positive preejection velocity
      allows to select optimal responders to revascularization; it means individuals with the
      greatest benefit in terms of LV remodeling and long-term prognosis.

      The objective of the project is to study clinical and prognostic value of new
      echocardiographic technique, so called positive preejection velocity (+VIC), in patients with
      chronic ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction indicated for revascularization. Pilot
      studies has shown high accuracy of pulsed Tissue Doppler imaging (TDI)-derived resting
      pattern of +VIC to detect viable myocardium in patients with both acute myocardial infarction
      and chronically dysfunctional myocardium. The aim of the project is to test accuracy of +VIC
      to predict LV remodeling and long-term prognosis after revascularization in patients with
      chronically dysfunctional myocardium. Study population will consist of two groups of patients
      with stable ischemic LV dysfunction: group A- patients indicated for revascularization
      (n=200), group B- matched control group treated conservatively (case-control design) (n=100).
      All patients will be followed for 3 years. Endpoints include: 1) LV remodeling at 6 and 24
      months and 2) MACE at 6, 12 and 36 months follow-up. Our hypothesis is that TDI-derived
      analysis of +VIC allows to select optimal responders to revascularization; it means
      individuals with the greatest benefit in terms of LV remodeling and long-term prognosis.
