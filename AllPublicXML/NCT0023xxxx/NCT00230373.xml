  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Localized scleroderma or morphea is a fibrotic disease, imiquimod induces cytokines which
      inhibit fibrotic activity . We propose that topical imiquimod 5% cream is efficacious and
      safe in treating plaque-type morphea. Twenty adults will be enrolled for a pilot study. A
      screening and baseline clinic visit will be required for each patient enrolled in the study.
      Each visit will involve completing a medical history, skin examination, digital pictures,
      histologic examination if the patient consents and an ultrasonographic score. One morphea
      plaque will be treated with topical imiquimod 5% cream, and another morphea lesion with
      vehicle cream. Patients will be asked about side effects (local and systemic). Patients will
      be followed up in the clinic at 3, 6 and 9 months of therapy, and 3 months following end of
      treatment period (month 12).
