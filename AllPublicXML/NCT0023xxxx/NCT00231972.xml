  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, the spread of HIV and other STDs has increased, especially among men who
      have sex with men. This increase signifies continued sexual risk taking within this
      population. In order to curb the increase of HIV infections, prevention programs are needed.
      A standard prevention case management program has been developed; however, new programs that
      further improve outcomes are needed. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a
      behavioral intervention program versus standard prevention case management (PCM) in promoting
      safer sex practices in HIV-infected men.

      Participants in this 1-year open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either PCM
      alone or a behavioral intervention called Project Enhance, in addition to PCM. The behavioral
      intervention will be administered by a trained medical social worker on an individual basis.
      It will include an education component, as well as motivational and behavioral skills
      enhancement. PCM will entail standard case management, as well as referrals to specific
      services that each individual may need. Treatment will occur for only the first 3 months,
      after which follow-up sessions will be held every 3 months for the remainder of the year.
