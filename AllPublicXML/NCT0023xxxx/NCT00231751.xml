  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing data support the concept that a genetic predisposition for inhibitor development
      exists. The aim of the Malmö International Brother Study (MIBS) is to evaluate genetic
      factors associated with the development of inhibitory antibodies in patients with hemophilia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII develop in 10-15% of all patients with hemophilia A and
      in 25-30% of patients with the severe form of the disease after exposure to factor VIII
      concentrates. Both genetic and environmental risk factors for inhibitor development have been
      evaluated, but in most cases without consistent results. Among the genetic factors, an
      association between large rearrangements of the factor VIII and IX genes and a higher risk
      for inhibitors has been described. However, a majority of patients with null mutations,
      including the intron 22 inversion, do not develop inhibitory antibodies. It is obvious that
      other genetic markers influencing the immune response to replacement therapy in patients with
      hemophilia remain to be identified and the aim of Malmö International Brother Study (MIBS) is
      to characterize these factors.
