    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and possible usefulness of infliximab
      therapy for patients with severe plaque psoriasis. In a previous small study of infliximab in
      33 patients with psoriasis, about 80% of patients treated with infliximab showed improvement
      in their psoriasis symptoms after the first 3 infusions, while 20% of patients who received
      placebo showed improvement. The patients will receive infusions of infliximab either 3 or 5
      mg/kg or placebo at weeks 0,2,6. Patients who have significant psoriasis at week 26 will
      receive an additional infusion.
