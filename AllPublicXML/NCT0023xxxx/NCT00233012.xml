      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics safety and tolerability of
      topiramate in infants aged 1-24 months with refractory partial-onset seizures. Topiramate is
      an antiepileptic drug approved for use in adult and pediatric patients (aged 2 to 16 years)
      with refractory partial onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalized
      seizures, primary generalized tonic clonic seizures, or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS).

      This is a open-label, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on
      chance), dose comparison, multicenter study of topiramate in infants of age 1-24 months with
      refractory partial-onset seizures (POS). The trial will evaluate the pharmacokinetics,
      safety, and tolerability of topiramate used as additional treatment in infants with
      refractory POS. Topiramate is administered as liquid and sprinkles as adjunct (additional
      treatment) to concurrent anticonvulsant therapy. The study will consist of 4 phases: a
      pretreatment phase that includes screening (up to 7 days) and baseline (1 day), an open-label
      treatment phase (up to 6 weeks), an open-label extension phase (54 weeks), and a
      posttreatment phase (up to 4 weeks). Seizure diaries will be maintained throughout the study
      by the patients' parents, legally acceptable representatives, or caregivers. In the
      open-label treatment phase, patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments:
      topiramate 3, 5, 15, or 25 mg/kg per day. Venous blood samples (four 1 milliliter [mL]
      samples) will be collected on 2 days during the study to determine plasma concentration of
      topiramate. Safety will be evaluated throughout the study by monitoring adverse events and by
      results from clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, venous ammonia, hematology, and
      urinalysis), electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital sign measurements (pulse and blood pressure),
      physical examination, neurologic examination, Vineland Scales of Adaptive Behavior, renal
      ultrasound, assessments for adequate food and liquid intake, hyperthermia, oligohydrosis, and
      rash, and take-home records. Liquid or sprinkles form of topiramate, 3,5,15,or 25mg/kg per
      day for 54 weeks.

          -  bottle- or cup-fed) with or without breastfeeding

          -  weigh &gt;/=3.5 kilograms (kg) and &lt;15.5 kg

          -  Length using an infant measuring table (heel to crown) must be = 49 cm

          -  clinical or electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence of POS (simple or complex) with or
             without secondary generalization of at least 1 month in duration in infants &gt;6 months
             of age, or at least 2 weeks in duration in infants &lt;6 months of age

          -  Multiple seizure types allowed as long as POS is present

          -  Taking 1 or 2 concurrent marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for &gt;1 month for infants
             &gt;6 months of age and for &gt;2 weeks for infants &lt;6 months of age

          -  the regimen of AEDs at entry must be considered inadequate in controlling seizures,
             after being optimized in the opinion of the investigator

          -  Have had a computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scan to confirm the
             absence of a progressive lesion such as a tumor, with the exception of lesions of
             tuberous sclerosis and Sturge-Weber syndrome, which are allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusively breast-fed and cannot take oral liquid medication

          -  Receives regular enteral feeding using gastrostomy, jejunostomy, or nasogastric tube

          -  have surgically implanted and functioning vagus nerve stimulator

          -  Have febrile seizures or seizures due to an acute medical illness

          -  Have infantile seizures as a result of a correctable medical condition such as
             metabolic disturbance, toxic exposure, neoplasm, or active infection

          -  History of nonepileptic seizures, either current or at any point in the past

          -  Any progressive neurologic disorder, including malignancy, brain tumor, active central
             nervous system infection, demyelinating disease, or degenerative or progressive
             central nervous system disease with the exception of tuberous sclerosis and Sturge
             Weber syndrome.
