  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A primary hypothesis to be explored here is that, given its pharmacodynamic profile and
      hypothesized mechanisms associated with schizophrenia, escitalopram will, in comparison to
      placebo, be effective when added to risperidone or olanzapine treated group in reducing the
      severity of resistant symptoms, particularly existing subsyndromal anxiety and depression.

      The objective of this trial is to determine the efficacy and safety of augmenting risperidone
      or olanzapine with escitalopram for treatment of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients with
      incomplete response to adequate trials of either of the two antipsychotic medications. To our
      knowledge, this is the first double blind randomized study designed to examine the potential
      augmentation benefit of escitalopram combined with a commonly used atypical agent in chronic
      schizophrenic patients with incomplete response to risperidone or olanzapine. The current
      proposal offers the possibility to test the efficacy of augmentation treatment in a
      controlled fashion with clinical and biological variables used as indicators of response and
      tolerability. From a broader perspective, it would test the hypothesis of potential validity
      of SSRI augmentation strategy in treatment of resistant symptoms of schizophrenia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Meet DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia adn schizoaffective disorder and clinically
             stable on fixed dose of risperidone or olanzapine for at least 6 weeks.

          2. Incomplete response to risperidone or olanzapine for at least 6 weeks per subjective
             report and minimum score on rating instruments (PANSS total &gt;50 at baseline).

          3. Current positive and negative symptoms sufficiently severe to require adjuvant
             treatment despite good compliance and adequate doses of antipsychotic before trial
             (risperidone 4 to 6mg/day, olanzapine15 to 20mg/day for 4-6 weeks of treatment).

          4. Males and females between 18-55 years of age. No restrictions to recruitment based on
             race.

          5. Able to participate fully in the informed consent process or have legal guardian able
             to participate in the informed consent process. All prospective research subjects will
             be screened for decisional capacity using the MacArthur Competence Assessment
             Tool-Research (MacCAT-CR)

          6. Educational level of at least 10th grade.

          7. Score on at least on PANSS psychosis items (P1,P2,P3,P5,or P6)&gt;4 adn CGI Severity
             score &gt;4 at point of maximum severity of illness to date or total PANSS score at
             baseline assessed as moderate (PANSS total &gt;50).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Meets full DSM-IV criteria for current Major Depressive Disorder, Bipolar Disorder,
             Anxiety Disorder or any other active disorder on Axis I. Present but not past history
             of substance abuse is exclusion criterion.

          2. Extrapyramidal symptoms as defined by score of 4 or more on Simpson-Angus rating
             scale.

          3. Non-English speaking.

          4. Serious unstable medical illness or any acute medical condition.

          5. Known allergy to any study medication.

          6. Serious suicidal or homicidal risks.

          7. Participation in clinical trial of an investigational drug within 30 days of visit 1.

          8. Evidence at screening of any medical conditions including but not limited to:
             infection, electrolyte abnormality, recent physical trauma, malignancy, autoimmune
             disorders, endocrine diseases and neurological diseases, history of CNS trauma or
             active seizure disorder requiring medication and known history of mental retardation.

          9. Any other condition, which in the opinion of the investigator would make the patient
             unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere with participating in or completing the
             protocol.
