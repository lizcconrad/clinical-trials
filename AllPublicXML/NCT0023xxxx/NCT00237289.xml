  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of adding topiramate as
      compared to placebo to the medications a patient with bipolar disorder is already taking
      (lithium or valproate) to see if adding topiramate will better control the patient's manic
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) require more than one
      medication to control their symptoms. This is a 12-week, multicenter, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groupd study to evalute the efficacy and safety of
      topiramate versus placebo as add-on therapy to lithium or valproate for the treatment of
      bipolar 1 disorder as an outpatient setting. These patients must already be taking either
      lithium or valproate for at least 6 weeks before the first visit and have been on the same
      dose of the mood stabilizer for at least 2 weeks before the first visit. Paitents will be
      randomized to receive either placebo or topiramate, an anti-seizure medication not approved
      for the treatment of bipolar disorder, in addition to their lithium or valporate. The study
      consists of 56-day titration (topiramate will be titrated up to 400mg per day or the maximum
      tolerated dose), 28-day continuation period, and 7 days of follow-up to taper off the
      medication. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be more effective than placebo in
      the treatment of mania in type 1 bipolar disorder patients as measured by the Young Mania
      Rating Scale (YMRS) and will be well tolerated. YMRS is a questionnaire consisting of 11
      items designed to assess severity of mania symptoms.

      Patients will start taking topiramate 25 mg per day or placebo by mouth. Over the next 8
      weeks, doses will be increased to up to 400 mg per day or to the maximum tolerated dose,
      whichever is lower. After the first 8 weeks, patients will stay at the established dose for
      the next 4 weeks.
