  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will systematically apply a specialist version of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy
      (CBT), known as Recovery Therapy, to a random sample of patients with psychotic disorders.
      Previously, the therapy has been developed and efficacy established, but the extent of
      applicability to (unselected) mental health service patients is unknown. The main aim is to
      establish the extent to which this therapy is acceptable and effective for mental health
      service clients. A secondary aim is to develop guidelines for the conduct of such therapy in
      public mental health settings.
