      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a topiramate
      controlled-release formulation in the treatment of obese, type 2 diabetic patients managed
      with diet alone or combined with metformin.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. Studies have shown that an immediate
      release formulation of topiramate reduces body weight in obese patients with or without type
      2 diabetes. A novel controlled-release formulation of topiramate using OROS® technology has
      the potential for better efficacy and safety in the treatment of obesity. This double-blind,
      placebo controlled study will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the controlled-release
      formulation in the treatment of obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. The study consists of 2
      screening visits, a baseline visit, 7-week titration phase (topiramate dose will be increased
      from 25mg daily to 175mg daily), 9-week maintenance phase, 2-week taper phase and a 2-week
      follow-up. Effectiveness will be evaluated by the percent change in body weight, body mass
      index, and anthropometric measurements (waist and hip circumferences and their ratio). Safety
      evaluations (incidence and severity of adverse events, physical measurements and clinical
      laboratory tests) will be conducted throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that
      topiramate 175 mg daily, when administered as the OROS® controlled-release formulation, is
      effective (in terms of percent reduction in body weight from baseline to week 16) and safe,
      as compared with placebo, in the treatment of obese, type 2 diabetic patients managed with
      either diet alone or combined with metformin. During the titration phase, topiramate (in the
      OROS® controlled-release formulation) will be gradually increased to 175mg daily by mouth,
      and the dose will be maintained for 9 weeks, and then slowly discontinued over 2 weeks.
