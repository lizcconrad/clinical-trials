  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients of the core study who are interested of being treated with EC-MPS will be
      included in an open-label extension study to collect further information on the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of this drug.

      The aim of this study is to compare the renal function, 6 months after transplant, in de novo
      old-age renal transplant recipients treated with EC-MPS plus reduced dose CsA-ME or with
      EC-MPS plus standard dose CsA-ME, both in combination with basiliximab and short-term oral
      steroids.

        Inclusion criteria Male or female patients 55_75 years old, recipients of a primary kidney
        transplant from a cadaver donor Subjects in whom CsA-ME plus basiliximab is selected as
        basic immunosuppressive regimen.

        Cold ischemia time 20 hrs. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum
        pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment and must use an effective contraception
        during the trial and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication.

        Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and from
        whom written informed consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion criteria Multi-organ recipients (e.g. kidney and pancreas, double kidney) or any
        previous transplant.

        Patients with any known hypersensitivity to mycophenolic acid or other components of the
        formulation (e.g. lactose).

        Patients with thrombocytopenia (75,000 mm), with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,500 mm
        and or leukocytopenia ( 2,500 mm3) and/or hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL at Screening or Baseline.

        Patients who have received an investigational drug within four weeks prior to study entry.

        Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised squamous
        or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are pregnant and
        or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception.

        Presence of clinically significant infections requiring continued therapy. Known positivity
        to HIV or positive HBsAg test. Evidence of drug and or alcohol abuse Existence of any
        surgical or medical condition, other than the current transplant, which in the opinion of
        the investigator might significantly alter the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
        excretion of study medication, and/or presence of severe diarrhea, active peptic ulcer
        disease, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

        Patients with Panel Reactive Antibodies (PRA) historical peak evaluation 30% or most recent
