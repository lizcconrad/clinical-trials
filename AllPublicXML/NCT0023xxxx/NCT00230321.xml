  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the trial are to assess erythroid response to darbepoetin alfa, as
      determined by changes in hemoglobin and/or red blood cell (RBC) transfusion-dependence and to
      describe the safety profile of darbepoetin alfa in patients with MDS. The secondary objective
      is to assess bone marrow progenitor BFU-E growth before and after treatment with darbepoetin
      alfa.
