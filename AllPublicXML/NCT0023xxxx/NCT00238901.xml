  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The natural history of HCV infection in liver transplant recipients may be accelerated when
      compared to that in patients with normal immune systems.

      The objective of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of basiliximab, in
      combination with cyclosporin and MMF on the success rate of liver transplants for HCV related
      cirrhosis, in comparison with standard steroid treatment.
