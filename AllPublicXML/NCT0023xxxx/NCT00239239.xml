      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of
      darbepoetin alfa administered at a subcutaneous (SC) dose of 0.45 mcg/kg three times weekly
      (TIW) in anemic patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving multicycle chemotherapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Non-myeloid malignancy

          -  Currently receiving 3-week cyclic chemotherapy treatment with a minimum of 2
             additional cycles of chemotherapy planned at the time of enrollment

          -  Anemia predominately due to cancer or chemotherapy (Hb &gt;= 9.0 and &lt; 11.0 g/dL) at the
             time of screening

          -  18 years of age or older at the time of screening

          -  Adequate liver and kidney function Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known primary hematologic disorder, which could cause anemia, other than non-myeloid
             malignancies

          -  History of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
             myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), hairy cell leukemia,

             hemolysis, bleeding, sickle cell anemia)

          -  Clinically significant inflammatory disease as determined by the investigator (eg,
             rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease)

          -  Clinically significant co-morbid medical or psychiatric conditions that may impact
             subject safety or confound the ability to evaluate study endpoint as determined by the
             investigator

          -  Unstable or uncontrolled cardiac disease or condition (ie, angina, congestive heart
             failure, or cardiac arrhythmia)

          -  Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg at screening

             days prior to enrollment

          -  ESP therapy (i.e., recombinant human erythropoietin [rHuEPO] or darbepoetin alfa)
             within 21 days prior to screening or between screening and the first dose of study
             drug

          -  RBC transfusion(s) within 21 days prior to screening
