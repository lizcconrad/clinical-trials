  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the trial is to determine whether human albumin, administered within 5 hours of
      symptom onset, improves the 3-month outcome of subjects with acute ischemic stroke.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human serum albumin, at 2 g/kg, administered over 2 hours by intravenous infusion, will be
      compared to placebo (isovolumic normal saline) among patients with acute ischemic stroke. All
      patients will have a baseline stroke severity measured as NIH Stroke scale score &gt; 5.
      Patients will treated according to the best standard of care including concurrent treatment
      with intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis where appropriate. The primary outcome will
      be determined at 3 months. The primary hypothesis is that, using the composite outcome of a
      modified Rankin score 0-1 or NIH stroke scale score 0-1 at 3 months (or both), the proportion
      of patients with improved outcomes will be greater by 10% or more in the active treatment
      group. [The current trial is termed &quot;Part 2&quot; and incorporates revisions to the initial
      protocol that were instituted after the DSMB suspended subject recruitment because of a
      safety concern after 434 subjects had been enrolled. The protocol revisions of Part 2
      resulted from the study team's thorough review of the Part-1 safety data and were designed to
      optimize safety going forward.]
