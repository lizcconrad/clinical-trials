  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of viramidine to
      ribavirin in chronic hepatitis C patients who have never before recieved treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compare the efficacy and safety of viramidine 600 mg BID versus ribavirin 1000/1200 mg/day,
      both drugs administered in combination with pegylated interferon alfa-2b to treatment-naive
      patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC)
