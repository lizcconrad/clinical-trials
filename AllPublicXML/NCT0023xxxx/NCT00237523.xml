      -  History of clinical breast pain for at least the last six months.

        -  At least six days of moderate or severe breast pain per cycle.

        -  Fibrosis, cysts, nodules involving at least 25% of the surface of one breast.

        -  Euthyroid with no prior history of thyroid disease.

        -  Six months of daily therapy with molecular iodine.

        -  Placebo controlled vs active (1:1).

      Primary efficacy parameters will be measured by patient self-assessment of pain/tenderness
      using a categorical daily pain diary. Clinical pain is defined as a patient assessment of
      moderate or severe pain for any given day. Total clinical pain per menstrual cycle is
      calculated based upon the categorical ratings recorded in a patient’s daily pain diary over
      the course of a complete menstrual cycle.

      A directed breast examination will be used as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Changes in the
      brest examination will be determined by the physician after consideration of both the nature
      of the examination findings and the surface area of breast involvement. Changes as noted
      after six months of therapy, relative to the screening visit (baseline) will be used to
      evaluate this endpoint.
