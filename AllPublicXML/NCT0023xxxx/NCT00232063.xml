          -  Patients with severest atopic dermatitis [according to the &quot;Guidelines for Treatment
             of Atopic Dermatitis 2002, the severity of atopic dermatitis will be classified as
             severest when an eruption associated with severe inflammation (a lesion associated
             with erythema, papule, erosion, infiltration, lichenification, etc.) is noted on at
