  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well sorafenib works in treating patients with
      unresectable or metastatic gallbladder cancer or cholangiocarcinoma. Sorafenib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and by blocking
      blood flow to the tumor

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the objective response probability (complete responses and partial responses)
      for BAY 43-9006 in patients with unresectable or metastatic gallbladder or
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To assess overall survival, time to treatment failure and progression-free survival in
      these patients.

      III. To assess quantitative and qualitative toxicities of this regimen. IV. To evaluate in a
      preliminary fashion relevant prognostic and predictive molecular markers of clinical outcome
      in gallbladder and cholangiocarcinoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years.

          -  Patient must not have received prior therapy for unresectable or metastatic disease;
             patient may have received prior chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy,
             radiation therapy (to less than 25% of bone marrow only) or chemoradiotherapy as

             registration

          -  Patient must not have uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Patient must not have known brain metastases because of their poor prognosis and

             the target lesions are not irradiated

          -  Women/men of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control or abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of protocol treatment; post-menopausal women must be amenorrheic for
             at least 12 months to be considered of non-childbearing potential; pregnant or nursing
             women are not eligible for this protocol; should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her treating
             physician immediately; breastfeeding must be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with BAY 43-9006

          -  HIV-positive patients must have a CD4 count &gt; 500 and must have no active
             opportunistic infection; in addition, patient must not be receiving combination
             anti-retroviral therapy

          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated
             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated
             stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or any
             other cancer from which the patient has been disease free for five years

          -  If day 14, 28 or 42 falls on a weekend or holiday, the limit may be extended to the
             next working day

               -  In calculating days of tests and measurements, the day a test or measurement is
                  done is considered day 0; therefore, if a test is done on a Monday, the Monday
                  two weeks later would be considered day 14; this allows for efficient patient
                  scheduling without exceeding the guidelines

          -  All patients must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and must
             sign and give written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal
             guidelines

          -  At the time of patient registration, the treating institution's name and ID number
             must be provided to the Data Operations Center in Seattle in order to ensure that the
             current (within 365 days) date of institutional review board approval for this study
             has been entered into the data base
