  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the MOM Program Continuation is to promote child development by helping
      families become more competent in accessing and using available health, developmental and
      educational resources. The program focuses are childhood immunizations, Early Intervention
      services, lead screening, Early Head Start and Head Start enrollment. The Intervention
      consists of frequent phone calls and home visits to encourage mothers to have their babies
      immunized on schedule and to participate in needed developmental and educational services.
      The program seeks to fill the gap between children's need for services and mothers' ability
      to assure their children's participation in those services.

    <textblock>
      The MOM Program Continuation builds on the work of The MOM Program, a 3 year randomized
      intervention. The premise of the MOM Program was that professional support through home
      visits and frequent phone contacts would improve children's cognitive and behavioral
      development, ultimately improving their early educational success. The children were enrolled
      in the MOM Program at birth. The MOM Program Continuation provides continued intervention for
      the children and mothers of the original cohort to assure that the children are prepared for
      kindergarten entry at 5 years of age and to evaluate the children's cognitive and behavioral
      outcomes at age 5 years. The program will also create a longitudinal database to study the
      linkages between maternal cognitive ability and child cognitive, educational, and behavioral
      outcomes through entry into school.

    <description>Cognitive ability was assessed through the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-III). The WPPSI-III has been developed and standardized for children ages 2 years, 6 months through 7 years, 3 months of age. The WPPSI-III yields a Verbal Score, a Performance Score, a General Language Score, and a Full Scale Score. These scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The range of possible values is 50 (worst value) to 150 (best value).</description>

    <description>Caregivers completed The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Preschool form from The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). The CBCL is standardized for children ages 1.5 to 5 years and measures child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems. Respondents are asked to rate 99 problem items as 0 for &quot;not true of the child,&quot; 1 for &quot;somewhat or sometimes true of the child,&quot; and 2 for &quot;very true or often true of the child&quot; based on the past two months. The range of possible values is 0-100. Percentage of Participants with Abnormal Behavior is calculated by: % abnormal = # of Abnormal / (# of Normal + # of abnormal).</description>

          <description>Cognitive ability was assessed through the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Third Edition (WPPSI-III). The WPPSI-III has been developed and standardized for children ages 2 years, 6 months through 7 years, 3 months of age. The WPPSI-III yields a Verbal Score, a Performance Score, a General Language Score, and a Full Scale Score. These scores have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 15. The range of possible values is 50 (worst value) to 150 (best value).</description>

        <description>Caregivers completed The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Preschool form from The Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). The CBCL is standardized for children ages 1.5 to 5 years and measures child internalizing and externalizing behaviors and total problems. Respondents are asked to rate 99 problem items as 0 for “not true of the child,” 1 for “somewhat or sometimes true of the child,” and 2 for “very true or often true of the child” based on the past two months. The range of possible values is 0-100. Percentage of Participants with Abnormal Behavior is calculated by: % abnormal = # of Abnormal / (# of Normal + # of abnormal).</description>
