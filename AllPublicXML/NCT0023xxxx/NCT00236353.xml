      risperidone given as a once monthly injection to adult patients with schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder.

    <textblock>
      Risperidone, taken by mouth on a daily basis, has been an effective treatment for
      schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Risperidone is also available in a long-acting
      injectable form so that patients can take their medicine by bi-weekly injections. This study
      will assess the effectiveness and safety of long-acting risperidone injection given once a
      month instead of every two weeks (based on previous studies with dosing every 2 weeks).
      During the four-week lead-in phase, patients will receive one 50-milligram injection every
      two weeks for two doses. Patients continue to take their prescribed dose of risperidone
      tablets (from 2 to 6 milligrams per day) for the first 14 days. After the first month,
      patients will receive one 50-milligram injection once a month for 48 weeks. This dose can be
      increased to 75 milligrams if patient meets relapse criteria, and is willing to stay in the
      trial. Patients will be asked questions to help determine how well the monthly injections are
      working. Laboratory tests (including drug levels), physical examinations and adverse event
      reporting will be performed to determine the safety of the monthly injections. Risperidone
      oral tablets, 2 to 6 milligrams per day, for first 2 weeks; long-acting risperidone
      intramuscular injections, 50 mg in 2 milliliters of liquid, every 2 weeks for 1 month, then
      injections once a month for 48 weeks. Monthly injection dose may be increased to 75 mg in
      2-mL if needed.
