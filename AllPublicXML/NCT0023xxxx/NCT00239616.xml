      This is an open-label, multicenter pharmacokinetic study of HD od PD patients receiving
      erythropoietin. Patients were administered 100mg of iron sucrose undiluted by slow IV push
      over 5 minutes. Patients underwent serial blood draws and were subsequently followed for 7
      days for safety endpoints.
