  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is the follow-on trial to a preceeding open-label trial which included patients
      with chronic refractory neuropathic pain. It is conducted at one site in the United Kingdom
      and the patient enrollment is completed. The patients had successfully completed the above
      mentioned trial and, in the investigator's opinion, would benefit from long-term
      administration of Lacosamide. After a 1-week run-in phase the patients were uptitrated to
      their optimal dose and then continued into the maintenance phase. Different pain qualities
      are assessed by a patient's diary.

      <pre_assignment_details>One subject was discontinued on the study due to the Adverse Event of Vertigo. However, the Termination page of the Case Report Form reflected that the subject withdrew consent. Therefore, the Participant Flow will reflect 3 subjects did not complete the study, while the subjects withdrawing from Adverse Events will reflect 2.</pre_assignment_details>
