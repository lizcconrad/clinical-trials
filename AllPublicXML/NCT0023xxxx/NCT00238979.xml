  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is whether a switch of stable renal transplant recipients who receive
      tacrolimus with or without corticosteroids from mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to enteric-coated
      mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is safe and well tolerated by the patients.
