    <textblock>
      This research trial involves the development of a new treatment for lung tumors. It is for
      patients whose tumor cannot be surgically removed, have refused surgery, or the tumor has not
      responded well to other forms of treatment. This treatment uses a needle probe to deliver
      energy into the lung tumor. This probe is placed utilizing a CT scan image. The energy heats
      the tumor causing tumor cell death.
