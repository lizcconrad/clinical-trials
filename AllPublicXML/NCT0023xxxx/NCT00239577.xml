  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This descriptive study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 5 different
      formulations of the WRAIR dengue vaccine compared to a placebo.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized into one of 6 groups. One group will receive a placebo vaccine
      and the others will receive one of 5 different dengue vaccine formations. Each subject will
      receive two doses six months apart. Study subjects who elect to participate in a mosquito
      transmissibility component of the study will undergo mosquito feedings during each of the two
      assigned follow-up visits after vaccine dose 1. All subjects will have 11 venipunctures
      during 11 visits (i.e., screening plus 10 study visits) over a period of nine months.
