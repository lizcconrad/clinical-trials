  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial was the follow-on trial to a preceeding double-blind, placebo controlled trial
      which included patients with at least moderate pain due to postherpetic neuralgia. It was
      conducted at six sites in Germany and has been clinically finalized. The patients had
      successfully completed the above mentioned trial in postherpetic neuralgia and, in the
      investigator's opinion, would benefit from long-term administration of Lacosamide. After a
      1-week run-in phase the patients were uptitrated to their optimal dose and then continued
      into the maintenance phase. Dose adjustments were allowed throughout the trial.The change in
      pain was measured daily as well as interference of pain with sleep and general activity. As
      per protocol this trial was terminated after two years of treatment.
