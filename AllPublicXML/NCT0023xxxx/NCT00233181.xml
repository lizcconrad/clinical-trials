      BACKGROUND:

      While increased asthma morbidity and mortality have been observed across all ethnicities,
      results from several studies have found that asthma morbidity has increased
      disproportionately in low-income African American children. Elementary school-based asthma
      education programs have shown promise in improving asthma management, and reducing asthma
      morbidity in this high-risk population, however, the fastest growing asthma risk is
      associated with children young than six. By elementary age many parents and children with
      asthma have well-established patterns of inappropriate asthma management that may be
      difficult to change. To date, no research has examined the impact of early intervention for
      asthma management in low-income, high-risk children.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The primary outcome that the study was designed to evaluate medical record documented
      emergency care for asthma at the JHPED over the eighteen-month follow-up period.

      The secondary outcomes Adherence with asthma therapy based on Medicaid pharmacy claims for
      asthma medications, other asthma health care (urgent and primary), self-reported medication
      adherence, barriers to health care, restricted activity, nighttime symptoms, asthma
      medications, self and family asthma management behaviors, asthma management self-efficacy,
      functional status, and quality of life.
