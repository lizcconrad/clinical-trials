    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of oral escalating dosages of CEP-701 at 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg given twice daily (bid) in achieving complete or nearly clearing of psoriasis in patients with severe, recalcitrant, plaque-type psoriasis, as assessed by the Physicians Static Global (PSGA) at baseline and at the end of treatment. A PSGA score of 0 is defined as no evidence of plaque elevation, no evidence of erythema, and no evidence of scaling. A PSGA score of 5 is defined as plaque elevation (2.5 mm or greater)dusky to deep red coloration, very thick tenacious scale predominates.</description>

          -  the patient is at least 21 years old.

          -  The patient has sever, recalcitrant, plaque-type psoriasis and has failed at least 1
             systemic therapy (for the purposes of this study psoralen with ultraviolet light A is
             considered to be a systemic therapy).

          -  The patient has psoriatic involvement of at least 10% of BSA.

             this method for the duration of the study (and for 60 days after taking the last dose
             of CEP-701 because of the possible effects on spermatogenesis).

          -  The patient must be willing and able to comply with study procedures and restrictions
             and willing to return to the clinic for the follow-up evaluation as specified in this

             retinoids, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, etanercept, efalizumab, other biological
             agents or other immunomodulators) within 4 weeks, or UV based therapy within 2 weeks,
             or alefacept within 6 weeks of the planned 1st day of study treatment.

          -  The patient has received treatment with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors including
             cyclosporine, clotrimazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole,
             erythromycin, clarithromycin, and troleandomycin, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             protease inhibitors, or nefazodone within 1 week (7 days) of the planned 1st day of
             study treatment.

          -  The patient is currently receiving warfarin.

          -  The patient has hypersensitivity to CEP-701 or any component of CEP-701.

          -  The patient has one or more of the following serum chemistry values as determined at
             the screening visit (visit 1):

          -  bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  ALT or AST levels greater than 2 times the ULN

          -  serum creatinine levels or more than 2mg/dL

          -  The patient requires current treatment for HIV with protease inhibitors.

          -  The patient is taking medication for a clinical diagnosis of gastrointestinal
             ulceration or has experienced melena or hematoemesis in the previous 3 weeks.
