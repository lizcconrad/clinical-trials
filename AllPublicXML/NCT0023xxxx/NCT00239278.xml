  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the budesonide+formoterol combination is
      effective in the treatment of exacerbations of COPD with a main emphasis on investigating the
      effects on inflammation and a secondary emphasis on clinical efficacy
