  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder induce urgency, urge incontinence, nocturia and pollakiuria. This
      condition is often resistant to anticholinergic drugs used as a first line treatment for this
      purpose. Moreover muscarinic side effects (constipation, mouth dryness) often limits the use
      of those treatments. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of botulinum
      toxin A injected into the detrusor muscle to control symptoms and improve quality of life for
      patients resistant or intolerant to anticholinergic drugs.
