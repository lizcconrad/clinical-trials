             with a size increase of 5 mm or greater over a six month period will also be included
             for possible treatment.

             aneurysms are &gt; 3.0 cm in diameter or there is evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or
             greater over a six month period) in iliac aneurysms &lt; 3.0 cm.

        17-19.9 mm 8-13 mm 14-16.9 mm 8-11mm

        *NOTE: An aortic diameter cannot be treated if the iliac diameter is not in the same range
        (e.g. 26-28 mm aortic necks must be in conjunction with 13-18 mm common iliacs).

        Anatomic (surgical controls)

        · Surgical controls will be required to meet only the aortic or aorto-iliac aneurysm size
        requirements for anatomic inclusion criteria.

        Aortic Aneurysm Diameter

          -  &gt; 4.5 cm

          -  Those aortic aneurysms &lt;4.5 cm that are at least 1.5 times the diameter of the aorta
             with a size increase of 5 mm or greater over a six month period will also be included
             for possible treatment.

          -  Aorto-iliac aneurysm in which the aortic aneurysm is &lt;4.5 cm but the iliac artery
             aneurysm are &gt;3.0 cm in diameter or there is evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or
             greater over a six month period) in iliac aneurysms &lt;3.0 cm.

        clinical inclusion criteria.

        size increase of 5 mm or greater within a six month period.

        Aorto-iliac Aneurysms

          -  &lt; 3.0 cm in diameter unless evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater within a six
             month period).

          -  The iliac portion of the aneurysm extending to the bifurcation bilaterally which would
             necessitate covering both internal iliac arteries with the device.

        Aortic Neck

          -  Diameter &lt; 17 mm and &gt; 28 mm (Phase I)

          -  Diameter &lt; 14 and &gt;28 (Phase II)

          -  Thrombus lined

          -  Highly calcified

               -  NOTE: See inclusion criteria for length below the renals and degree of
                  angulation.

        Iliac Arteries

          -  &lt; 8 mm and &gt; 18 mm (native) (Phase I and Phase II)

          -  Highly calcified (common)

        size increase of 5 mm or greater within a six month period.

        Aorto-Iliac Aneurysms

          -  &lt; 3.0 cm in diameter unless evidence of recent expansion (5 mm or greater within a six
             month period).

          -  The iliac portion of the aneurysm extending to the bifurcation bilaterally which would
             necessitate surgically covering both internal iliac arteries.

        Clinical (stent-graft)

          1. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.

          2. Renal insufficiency – creatinine level &gt; 2.5 mg/dl.
