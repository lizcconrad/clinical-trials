    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the superiority or non-inferiority of the
      sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITY® stent compared to intravascular brachytherapy in patients with
      in-stent restenotic native coronary artery lesions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The patient has an in-stent restenosis of &gt; 50% (by subjective angiographic
             determination of the minimal luminal diameter compared to the distal reference
             diameter) within a native coronary artery which has previously undergone stent
             placement ( 4 weeks). Lesions must meet ISR Classification I-III.

             2. The patient has a history, signs of, or laboratory studies that suggest coronary
             ischemia attributable to the target stenosis. The diagnosis of angina pectoris is
             defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society Classification (CCS I, II, III, or IV) OR
             unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald Classification B&amp;C, I-II) OR patients with
             documented silent ischemia;

             3. The study target lesion must be located in an in-stent restenotic native coronary
             artery measuring &gt; 2.75mm and 3.5mm in diameter and &gt; 15mm and 40mm in length to allow
             treatment with a maximum of three 18mm stents. The target lesion must have undergone
             coronary interventional treatment &gt; 4 weeks previously. Patients with one or more
             prior percutaneous coronary interventions at the target lesion are acceptable
             candidates.

             4. The vessel 1cm distal to the target lesion is &gt; 2.5mm in diameter;

             5. Ejection Fraction must be &gt; 40%;

             6. The study target lesion cannot be located in a vessel containing a second lesion
             requiring treatment at the time of the procedure.

             7. Male or non-pregnant female patients &gt; 18 years of age inclusive. NOTE: Females of
             child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) prior to
             enrollment and must use birth control for 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The study target lesion has definite or possible thrombus present by angiographic
             criteria.

          2. The patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with
             documented total CK &gt; 2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and
             CK-MB enzymes remain above normal at the time of treatment.

          3. Impaired renal function (Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0mg/dl);

          4. The patient has unstable angina classified as Braunwald III B or C, or is having peri
             infarction angina.

          5. The left ventricular ejection fraction is &lt; 40%.

          6. The target vessel has previously sustained a perforation.

          7. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level);

          8. Prior stent within 5mm of target lesion;

          9. There is a total occlusion of the restenosed-stent (ISR Classification IV) prior to
             the interventional procedure.

         10. Has an ostial target lesion;

         11. Significant (&gt; 50%) in-stent restenoses proximal or distal to the target lesion that
             might require revascularization or impede runoff;
