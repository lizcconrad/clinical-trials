  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the bronchodilator efficacy and safety of once
      daily dosing of tiotropium inhalation capsules (18 ?g) and Atrovent? MDI (2 puffs of
      ipratropium bromide 20 ?g four times daily) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study to compare the
      bronchodilator efficacy and safety of tiotropium inhalation capsules and Atrovent? MDI in
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

      Following an initial screening visit, patients will enter a 2-week baseline period. Patients
      who successfully complete this phase will be randomized into the double-blind portion of the
      study in which they will receive tiotropium once daily (morning) or Atrovent? four times
      daily for 4 weeks. Pulmonary function testing will be conducted just prior (i.e. 5 minutes
      before) to the start of therapy at Visit 2 (i.e. randomization visit after completion of the
      2-week run-in period) and at 30, 60, 120 and 180 minutes post-dosing. Pulmonary function
      testing will be repeated at the same time intervals after 14 days of therapy (visit 3) and at
      the end of therapy.

      Those patients taking theophylline, will be questioned about their last theophylline intake
      in order to ensure adherence to the washout requirements.

      Vital signs will be measured in conjunction with the pulmonary function tests. Adverse events
      will be recorded throughout the entire run-in and treatment period.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis is that there is no difference in mean response between tiotropium and
      Atrovent. The alternative hypothesis is that there is a difference in mean response between
      tiotropium and Atrovent.

      Comparison(s):

      The primary pulmonary function variable will be FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in one second)
      and trough FEV1 response at the end of the four week treatment period, i.e. visit 4, will be
      the primary efficacy endpoint.

      Trough FEV1 is defined as FEV1 at the end of the dosing interval (for tiotropium at
      approximately 24 hours post treatment administration). On test days (Visits 3 and 4) it is
      measured by the PFT just prior to dosing. Trough FEV1 response is defined as change from
      baseline in trough FEV1. Baseline FEV1 is defined as FEV1 measured just prior to first dosing
      in the morning of randomization visit (Visit 2).

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All patients must have a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according
             to the following criteria:

             Patients must have relatively stable airway obstruction with an FEV1 ? 65% of
             predicted normal and FEV1 70% of FVC.

             Predicted normal values will be based on the following formula. Males: FEV1 pred.(L) =
             height2(m) x (-0.016 x age(year) + 1.823) Females: FEV1 pred.(L) = height2(m) x
             (-0.012 x age(year) + 1.4427)

          2. Male or female patients 40 years of age or older.

          3. Patients must have a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years. A pack-year is
             defined as the equivalent of smoking one pack of cigarettes per day for a year.

          4. Patients must be able to perform pulmonary function tests as required in the protocol.

          5. Patients must be able to inhale medication from the HandiHaler device and should have
             a good technique of inhaling aerosol administered from an MDI.

          6. All patients must sign an Informed Consent Form prior to participation in the trial
             i.e., prior to pre-study washout of their usual pulmonary medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with significant diseases other than COPD will be excluded. A significant
             disease is defined as a disease which in the opinion of the investigator may either
             put the patient at risk because of participation in the study or a disease which may
             influence the results of the study or the patient's ability to participate in the
             study.

          2. Patients with clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology, blood chemistry or
             urinalysis, if the abnormality defines a disease listed as an exclusion criterion will
             be excluded.

          3. All patients with a SGOT and SGPT twice the normal range, bilirubin 150% or creatinine
             125% of the normal range will be excluded regardless of the clinical condition. Repeat
             laboratory evaluation will not be conducted in these subjects.

          4. Patients with a recent history (i.e. one year or less) of myocardial infarction.

          5. Patients with a recent history (i.e. three years or less) of heart failure or patients
             with any cardiac arrhythmia requiring drug therapy.

          6. Patients with regular use of daytime oxygen therapy.

          7. Patients with known active tuberculosis.

          8. Patients with a history of cancer within the last five years. Patients with treated
             basal cell carcinoma are allowed.

          9. Patients with a history of life-threatening pulmonary obstruction, or a history of
             cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis.

         10. Patients who have undergone pulmonary resection.

         11. Patients with an upper respiratory tract infection in the past 6 weeks prior to the
             Screening Visit (=Visit 1) or during the baseline period of 2-weeks (run-in period).

         12. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, lactose or any other
             component of the inhalation capsule delivery system or the MDI.

         13. Patients with known symptomatic prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.

         14. Patients with known narrow-angle glaucoma.

         15. Patients who are being treated with cromolyn sodium or nedocromil sodium.

         16. Patients who are being treated with antihistamines.

         17. Patients using oral corticosteroid medication at unstable (i.e. less than 6 weeks on a
             stable dose) or at a dose in excess of the equivalent 10 mg of prednisone per day or
             20 mg every other day.

         18. Pregnant or nursing women or women of childbearing potential not using a medically
             approved means of contraception (e.g. oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices, or
             diaphragm).

         19. Patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopy or who have a blood
             total eosinophil count &gt;= 400 per µl (males) or &gt;= 320 per µl (females). A repeat
             eosinophil count will not be conducted in these patients.

         20. Patients with a history and/or active alcohol or drug abuse.

         21. Patients who have taken an investigational drug one month or six half-lives (whichever
             is greater) prior to the Screening Visit (=Visit 1).
