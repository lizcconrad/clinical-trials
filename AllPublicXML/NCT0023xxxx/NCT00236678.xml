  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine fatigue (tiredness) in subjects with
      chronic Rheumatoid Arthritis with chronic anemia. Fatigue in subjects who get PROCRIT will be
      compared to fatigue in subjects who get placebo (a medically inactive substance). The study
      will also evaluate hemoglobin levels (oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells), safety,
      anemia related health concerns, vitality, arthritis related function and work productivity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PROCRIT is not approved for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease in rheumatoid
      arthritis patients.

      Approximately 270 subjects will be participating in this trial, at approximately 25 centers
      in the United States. Patients will be eligible to participate in this study if hemoglobin
      (Hb) is &lt;=11.0 g/dL. The hypothesis is that PROCRIT improves fatigue scores in rheumatoid
      arthritis patients with anemia of chronic disease. If a patient chooses to participate,
      he/she will be randomized to receive either PROCRIT or placebo on a weekly basis starting at
      20,000 units per injection (up to a maximum of 40,000 units).
