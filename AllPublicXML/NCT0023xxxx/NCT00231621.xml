  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of daily topiramate versus
      placebo for the treatment of obese subjects with dyslipidemia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. Studies have shown that topiramate
      reduces weight in obese patients with or without Type 2 diabetes, and may have the adjunctive
      benefit of reducing triglyceride and cholesterol levels in these patients. This double-blind,
      placebo controlled study evaluates the long-term efficacy of topiramate for reduction of
      weight and triglyceride levels in obese patients with borderline to high
      hypertriglyceridemia, and the safety and tolerability of topiramate in this patient
      population. The study consists of four phases: 4-week enrollment (screening) phase, 8-week
      titration phase (topiramate dose will be increased from 16mg/day to the assigned dose),
      52-week maintenance phase, and 6-week follow-up. Effectiveness of topiramate will be
      evaluated by multiple measurements such as change in body weight, body mass index, fasting
      serum triglyceride levels, cholesterol and other lipid profiles. Safety evaluations will
      include incidence/severity of adverse events, vital signs, clinical laboratory results. The
      hypothesis is that topiramate as compared to placebo will provide a greater percent reduction
      in body weight and in fasting serum triglycerides from Week 0 (baseline) to Week 60. After
      the initial 8-weeks titration phase, the patients will be randomized to receive either 96mg
      (48mg twice daily) or 192mg (96mg twice daily) topiramate or placebo (twice daily) by mouth
      for 52 weeks.
