    <criteria>

        De Novo-Inclusion criteria

          1. Males and females aged 6 years or over.

          2. Recipients of cadaveric, living unrelated or living related kidney transplant, treated
             with CsA-Me, with or without corticosteroids, as primary immunosuppression.

        Maintenance-Inclusion criteria

          1. Males and females aged 6 years or over.

          2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaveric, living related or unrelated donor kidney
             transplant.

          3. Patients currently receiving CsA-ME with or without Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or
             azathioprine, with or without corticosteroids as part of their immunosuppressive
             regimen for at least 3 months prior to Screening.

          4. Patients in a stable condition in terms of graft function (serum creatinine not above
             2.3 mg/dL (=204 µmol/L) at screening and at baseline, or not increased by more than
             20% at baseline compared to values obtained at screening), no change of immune
             suppressive regimen due to graft malfunction, and any known clinically significant
             physical and/or laboratory changes for at least 2 months prior to enrollment.

        De Novo and Maintenance-Exclusion Criteria

          1. Multi-organ recipients (e.g. kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any
             organ other than kidney.

          2. Patients with any known hypersensitivity to MPA, EC-MPS or other components of the
             formulation (e.g. lactose).

          3. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt; 75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of &lt;
             1,500/mm3, and/or leukocytopenia (&lt; 2,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt; 6 g/dL at
             Screening or Baseline.

          4. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
