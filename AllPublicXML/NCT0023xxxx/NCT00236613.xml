  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of topiramate (64mg,
      96mg, 192mg, and 384mg daily) with placebo in the treatment of obesity.

    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This is a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study to assess the safety and effectiveness of topiramate in
      treatment of obese patients. Patients will receive 24 weeks of treatment by topiramate or
      placebo, followed by 2 week taper and a safety follow-up. Effectiveness will be determined by
      changes from baseline to week 24 in body weight, body mass index (BMI), anthropometric
      measurements (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip ration), fasting lipid
      profiles, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c (shows average blood sugar level over months),
      fasting uric acid, fasting insulin, and blood pressures. Safety evaluations (incidence of
      adverse events, physical examinations, 12 lead ECGs, vital signs, Computerized
      Neuropsychological Test Battery) will be performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis
      is that topiramate will be effective in achieving and maintaining weight reduction in obese
      patients and is well tolerated. The patients will be randomized to receive either topiramate
      (64, 96, 192, or 384 mg daily) or placebo daily by mouth for 24 weeks.
