  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The value of fusion of functional and anatomical data has been described using several fusion
      techniques for various nuclear medicine procedures and morphologic imaging modalities
      (SPECT-CT, SPECT-MRI, Coincidence-CT). We hypothesize that NM -CT data has advantages over
      the data obtained using separately performed NM study and conventional anatomic imaging as
      CT. We hypothesize that more accurate localization of the radio-isotope activity on NM images
      will improve diagnostic accuracy and will have an impact on patient management:

      Improved accuracy of NM study will improve tumor localization, the evaluation of the extent
      of disease and the post therapy follow up.

      It will direct other diagnostic procedures to lesions otherwise undetected, or exclude the
      need for more invasive procedures. It can also guide invasive procedures and
      radiation-therapy planning, thus improving therapy results and avoiding unnecessary
      treatment-related side effects.
