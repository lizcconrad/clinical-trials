  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, dose-response study to
      evaluate the efficacy in tracheal intubation and safety of gantacurium chloride for injection
      in healthy adult patients undergoing surgery with general anesthesia.

      Gantacurium chloride for injection (previously referred to as AV430A) is a new,
      investigational non-depolarizing ultra-short acting neuromuscular blocking agent (NMB).
      Preliminary results in animals and healthy human subjects (Phase 1 studies in adult
      volunteers) suggest that gantacurium chloride for injection may provide a useful adjunct to
      general anesthesia by permitting rapid intubation. This Phase 2 study will provide more
      definitive information on the ultra-short acting profile of the compound by determining the
      quality of intubation in patients, at 60 seconds, as assessed by a blinded intubator. In
      addition, the safety of the compound will be assessed. In this study, the efficacy and safety
      of gantacurium chloride for injection will also be compared to a reference drug,
      succinylcholine, and to placebo.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine the dose-response relationship of
      gantacurium chloride for injection on tracheal intubation conditions after a single rapid
      bolus intravenous (i.v.) dose as a component of a propofol/opioid induction-intubation
      sequence and to assess the safety profile of this compound.
