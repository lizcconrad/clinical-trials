  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All patients of the core study who are interested of being treated with EC-MPS will be
      included in an open-label extension study to collect further information on the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of this drug.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of steroid withdrawal in the setting
      of immunosuppression with a combination of EC-MPS, cyclosporine and steroids in de novo
      kidney allograft recipients.
