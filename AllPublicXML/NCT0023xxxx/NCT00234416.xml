      The primary objective of the trial is to identify the dose of gemcitabine given as a 2-hour
      intravenous (iv) infusion that can be administered in combination with ZD1839 250 mg once
      daily and a standard course (45 Grays [Gy]) of radiotherapy in patients with locally
      advanced, unresectable pancreatic cancer.
