  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of asthma and sleep apnea. Our hypothesis is that untreated sleep
      apnea causes inflammation in the lung, which can worsen asthma. We believe treatment of sleep
      apnea will reduce this inflammation, and improve asthma control. This study will help us
      better understand what happens to the lung and bronchial tubes before and after treatment of
      sleep apnea, which could benefit all patients with sleep apnea. This study involves 2
      bronchoscopies.
