    <textblock>
      The purpose of Phase 1 of this study is to evaluate the safety of the combination regimen,
      bexarotene and ZD1839. Phase II will evaluate the median survival, time to disease

             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter

          -  Patients must have had at least 1 prior systemic therapy for NSCLC, or have shown

             for investigational therapy), prior to beginning protocol therapy (6 weeks if
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C). Palliative radiotherapy to bony sites of disease is
             allowed while on trial and up to time of enrollment provided patient has no
             significant side effects from the radiotherapy.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum ß HCG with

             must have used 2 reliable forms of effective contraception used simultaneously or have
             been sexually abstinent for at least 4 weeks prior to the negative pregnancy test
             through entry in the study. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant
             while participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician
             immediately.

               -  Retinoid class agents are known teratogens.

          -  Female patients and male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must
             agree to sexual abstinence or to practice 2 reliable forms of effective contraception
             used simultaneously during the entire period of bexarotene capsule treatment and for
             at least 1 month after treatment is discontinued. Male patients must agree to use
             condoms if they have a female sexual partner who is, or may become, pregnant.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes &gt;= 3,000/ul

               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500/ul

               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR calculated creatinine clearance
                  &gt;= 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional
                  normal

               -  triglycerides and cholesterol levels which are within normal limits or
                  &quot;normalized&quot; with medication

          -  Patients may take the following agents, but with caution due to interactions with P450
             metabolism: dexamethasone, protease inhibitors, ketoconazole and other azole
             antifungals, erythromycin and other macrolides antibiotics, grapefruit juice, other
             retinoid class drugs, beta-carotene compounds, and agents which enhance insulin
             secretion and sensitivity. They may not take phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin,
