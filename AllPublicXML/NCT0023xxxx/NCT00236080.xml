  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to compare the overnight efficacy and plasma concentration-time
      profiles of armodafinil and PROVIGIL, after multiple doses, in patients with excessive
      sleepiness associated with chronic Shift Work Sleep Disorder (SWSD).

    <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the likelihood of falling asleep. Five 20-minute (maximum) MSLT naps were performed (at 2300, 0100, 0300, 0500, and 0700) at both the screening/baseline assessment visit (Visit 2) and at endpoint (Visit 4). Each nap was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred. Sleep latency was measured as the elapsed time from lights out to the first epoch scored as sleep.</description>

    <measure>Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (Visit 4) change from baseline (Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <description>The computer-based PVT took 10 minutes to complete and measured reaction time stimulus in milliseconds. The reaction time consisted of the digits 000 initially appearing in a window on the PVT device, after which the 3-digit numbers increased in milliseconds until the response button was pressed by the patient. The resulting number at the button press was the reaction time in milliseconds. There was a variable 1- to 10-second interstimulus interval. After pressing the button in response to each stimulus, the button was released and the patient awaited the next stimulus.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients are included in the study if all of the following criteria are met:

          -  The patient speaks and writes in English.

          -  The patient is a man or woman of any ethnic origin aged 18 through 65 years.

          -  The patient is in good health as determined by a medical and psychiatric history,
             medical examination, serum chemistry, and hematology.

          -  The patient has a diagnosis of SWSD according to the International Classification of
             Sleep Disorders (ICSD) criteria, and must have had excessive sleepiness during night
             shifts for at least 3 months.

          -  The patient must be planning to work at least 3 to 5 nights (per week), of which at
             least 3 nights will be consecutive.

          -  The patient must work night shifts that include at least 6 hours between 2200 and 0800
             (+30 minutes) and be no longer than 12 hours (+30 minutes) in duration.

          -  The patient has a mean sleep latency of 6 minutes or less as determined by the MSLT
             (average of naps at 0100, 0300, 0500, and 0700).

          -  The patient has a Clinical Global Impression of Severity of Illness (CGI-S) rating of

        <title>Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT)</title>
        <description>The Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) is an objective assessment of sleepiness that measures the likelihood of falling asleep. Five 20-minute (maximum) MSLT naps were performed (at 2300, 0100, 0300, 0500, and 0700) at both the screening/baseline assessment visit (Visit 2) and at endpoint (Visit 4). Each nap was terminated after 20 minutes if no sleep occurred. Sleep latency was measured as the elapsed time from lights out to the first epoch scored as sleep.</description>

        <population>1 Placebo Patient did not have an MSLT but did complete the other Primary Measure (PVT) and other requirements. This patient was termed a &quot;Completer&quot;.
1 Patient in the &quot;Armodafinil 200 mg/day group&quot; had an MSLT performed but then discontinued the study drug before reaching the study endpoint and was termed a &quot;Non-Completer&quot; for the Study.</population>

        <description>The computer-based PVT took 10 minutes to complete and measured reaction time stimulus in milliseconds. The reaction time consisted of the digits 000 initially appearing in a window on the PVT device, after which the 3-digit numbers increased in milliseconds until the response button was pressed by the patient. The resulting number at the button press was the reaction time in milliseconds. There was a variable 1- to 10-second interstimulus interval. After pressing the button in response to each stimulus, the button was released and the patient awaited the next stimulus.</description>
