  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial was to characterise the intra and post operative metabolic, endocrine
      and inflammatory response to laparoscopic fundoplication in children. We are testing the
      hypothesis that laparoscopic fundoplication is associated with a lack of hypermetabolism and
      catabolism and blunting of the endocrine/inflammatory stress response
