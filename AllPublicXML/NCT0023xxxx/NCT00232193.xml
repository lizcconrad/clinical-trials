  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether giving intravenous dexamethasone every 4
      weeks during the first 12 months of weekly Avonex dosing will reduce the progression of
      functional impairment, brain atrophy, relapse rate and frequency, and new and enlarging brain
      lesions over the first 24 months of Avonex therapy in patients with relapsing-remitting or
      mono-symptomatic multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beta Interferon-1a (Avonex)was approved by the FDA in 1996 to treat relapsing-remitting
      multiple sclerosis. Clinical trials have shown evidence in the reduction of relapses and
      progression of neurological and cognitive disability with the use of Avonex, as well as
      reduction in brain atrophy and new MS lesions on MRI were observed. Despite this, Avonex does
      not abolish disease activity, therefore, there is frequent need for adjunctive therapy, such
      as short courses of corticosteroids.

      This study will research the value of adding monthly pulsed corticosteroids as adjunctive
      therapy during the first year of Avonex use to determine: a)safety and tolerability b)if this
      therapy will reduce the progression of functional impairment, and c)if this therapy will
      reduce the progression of whole brain atrophy over a 13 month observation period.
