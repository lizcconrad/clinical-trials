      This is research study for women diagnosed with breast cancer and major depression. Women
      with breast cancer who are depressed may report greater pain, poorer quality of life and
      worse overall functioning than those without depression. The study will determine whether or
      not bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) is useful in lessening the symptoms of
      depression in women with breast cancer. One reason for conducting this research with
      bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XLTM) instead of another antidepressant is because
      bupropion has a lower likelihood of causing the side effects of weight gain, sexual
      dysfunction, and fatigue, which may be important for women with breast cancer and may even
      have a beneficial effect on these symptoms.

      Bupropion extended release (Wellbutrin XL™)is approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the treatment of major depression.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women aged 18 years or older

          -  Diagnosis of breast cancer, confirmed by histopathology; Stages 0, I, II, IIIA, or
             IIIB

          -  Clinical diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (DSM-IV-TR)

          -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (Zigmond and Snaith, 1983) depression subscale
             score of 11 or greater

          -  Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery and Asberg, 1979) score
             of 25 or greater at Screening and Baseline visits

          -  Use of antidepressants in a previous episode of major depression or in the past for
             any other indication does not affect the patient’s inclusion in this study.

          -  During the current episode of major depressive disorder, as stated in the Exclusion
             criteria, failure to respond to one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant will
             exclude the patient from the study since this is not a study of “treatment-resistant
             depression”.

          -  During the study, the patient may not use any other antidepressants.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of another current clinically significant Axis I disorder like bipolar
             disorder, schizophrenia, or panic disorder

          -  Current (in past 6 months) comorbid active substance abuse or dependence

          -  Failure to respond to one or more adequate trials of an antidepressant in the current
             episode of MDD

          -  A reduction in MADRS score of 20% or greater from Screening to Baseline visit

          -  Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that in the judgment of the
             Investigator would increase risk of adverse effects with bupropion

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  History of an eating disorder, seizures, head injury, or other intracranial pathology
             because these conditions are usually contraindications to the use of bupropion XL

          -  Previous allergy or intolerance to bupropion

          -  Patients judged to be at significant suicidal risk
