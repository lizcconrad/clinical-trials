    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of perioperative administration of PROCRIT
      to that of autologous blood donation on post-operative rehabilitation outcomes in patients
      undergoing unilateral knee surgery.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare the effect of perioperative administration
      of PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous donation on post-operative rehabilitation
      outcomes in subjects undergoing primary unilateral knee arthroplasty.

      Secondary objectives are : 1) To compare the effect of perioperative administration of
      PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous donation on hemoglobin, change in hemoglobin,
      number of units transfused and transfusion rate during the study period; and 2) To compare
      the effect of perioperative administration of PROCRIT to that of preoperative autologous
      donation on inpatient rehabilitation length of stay.

      The study will test the hypothesis that perioperative administration of PROCRIT will improve
      post-operative rehabilitation outcomes, compared with preoperative autologous donation.
      40,000U PROCRIT or Placebo SC in relation to surgery date: Days -21, -14, -7, 0 (day of
      surgery), 7, and 14.
