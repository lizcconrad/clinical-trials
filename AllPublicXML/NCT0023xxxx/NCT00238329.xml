      RATIONALE: PEG-interferon alfa-2b may interfere with the growth of tumor cells. Biological
      therapies, such as thalidomide, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop
      tumor cells from growing. PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide may also stop the growth of
      melanoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with
      thalidomide may be an effective treatment for melanoma.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving PEG-interferon alfa-2b together with
      thalidomide works in treating patients with recurrent or metastatic melanoma.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma
           treated with PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide.

        -  Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously once weekly and oral
      thalidomide once daily. Treatment continues for at least 2 weeks but no more than 8 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete
      response (CR) receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b and thalidomide for 2 months beyond
      documentation of CR.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 14-38
      months.
