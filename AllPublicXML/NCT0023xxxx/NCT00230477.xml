  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a randomized, open-label trial of adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) and lamivudine
      combination therapy versus adefovir dipivoxil (Hepsera) monotherapy. Both adefovir dipivoxil
      and lamivudine are nucleoside analogues approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of chronic
      hepatitis B.

      The primary hypothesis is that subjects treated with combination therapy will see their viral
      DNA count decrease in an amount greater than subjects treated with monotherapy. The secondary
      hypothesis is that subjects treated with combination therapy will have a higher HBeAg
      conversion rate compared to historical controls of subjects treated with lamivudine or
      adefovir dipivoxil monotherapy.
