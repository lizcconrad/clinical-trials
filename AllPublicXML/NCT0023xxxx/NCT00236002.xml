      Multi-center,double blind randomized phase III placebo controlled study in 250 men with
      histologically proven prostate cancer with out bone metastases who are beginning ADT therapy
      and who will receive concomitant treatment with either oral Fosamax 70mg once weekly or
      placebo for one year.These men will be treated and follow up for one year,during which time
      changes in BMD, markers of bone resorption and formation will be monitored.All patients will
      receive calcium and vitamin D through out the study.

      This is a phase three multicentre, double blind, randomize parallel group, placebo-controlled
      study in 250 men with histologically proven cancer without bone metastases who are beginning
      ADT therapy and who will receive a concomitant treatment with either oral Fosamax 70 mg once
      a weak (n=125) or placebo (n=125) for one year. Changes in BMD, markers of bone absorption
      and formation are monitored.
