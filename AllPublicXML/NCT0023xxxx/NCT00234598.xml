      This study tests whether special oral care provided by nurses to critically ill patients who
      are on a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator) can help to reduce the build-up of dental
      plaque on the teeth and reduce the risk of pneumonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonia is the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. Intubation and
      mechanical ventilation greatly increase the risk of bacterial ventilator associated
      pneumonia. Growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria in dental plaque of critically ill
      patients provides a nidus of infection for microorganisms that have been shown to be
      responsible for the development of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia. Since these organisms are
      concentrated in dental plaque, removal of organisms from the oral cavity by oral care
      interventions is a theoretically attractive method to reduce the risk of development of
      Ventilator Associated Pneumonia. However, evidence-based protocols for oral care of
      mechanically ventilated patients are not available. Results of the study have the potential
      to improve nursing care, and to positively affect patient well-being, morbidity, mortality,
      and health care costs.
