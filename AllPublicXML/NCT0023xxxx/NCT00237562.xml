  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Implement a single-visit program (SVP) for cervix cancer prevention in clinics serving a
           multi-ethnic population of women;

        2. Set up an efficient system for interpretation of Pap smears for patients in the SVP that
           will minimize waiting time;

        3. Determine the follow-up rates and compare them between women assigned to the SVP and a
           usual care program (UCP);

        4. Determine satisfaction and compare it between women assigned to the SVP and the UCP;

        5. Determine the cost-effectiveness and compare it between the SVP and UCP

    <textblock>
      Women were recruited from underserved communities to participate in this single visit cervix
      cancer project. Large loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) was performed on SVP
      subjects with either a diagnosis of HGSIL/AGUS or suspicion of carcinoma. All other subjects
      with abnormal Papanicolaou smears were referred to our abnormal cytology clinics or received
      care in the community.
