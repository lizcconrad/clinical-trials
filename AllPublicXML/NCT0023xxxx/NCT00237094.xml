  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have demonstrated that intensive disease management of diabetes and its associated
      risk factors, hypertension and dyslipidemia, can prevent the progression of vascular
      complications. However, implementation of well defined guidelines for intensive disease
      management has been suboptimal. Barriers to success occur at multiple levels, including
      health care systems, health care providers and patients.

      In rural regions of the U.S., reduced availability of primary care providers and specialty
      services, including diabetes education, present additional barriers to effective diabetes
      care. Use of a nurse practitioner led interdisciplinary team to intensively manage urban and
      rural diabetic patients, utilizing telehealth technology to provide care to rural areas, will
      help begin to address these barriers

      The long term goal of the project is to develop a practical and sustainable system of
      intensive diabetes management that will be effective in helping diabetic patients achieve and
      maintain goals within established treatment guidelines regardless of geographic location.

      Specific aims are:

        1. To determine in both urban and rural areas if a nurse practitioner led team approach to
           intensive diabetes management and education improves disease-specific outcomes and
           patient education compared to traditional care (current diabetes management of urban
           patients).

        2. To determine if telehealth is an effective and accepted mechanism for delivery of a
           nurse practitioner led team approach to intensive diabetes management and education in
           rural areas.

        3. To determine if a nurse practitioner led intensive disease management team can identify
           patient risk factors (psychological, financial, and work-related factors) that may be
           barriers to patient adherence, earlier in the management of urban diabetic patients
           compared to traditional care.

        4. To compare volume and type of service utilization of a nurse practitioner led team
           approach to diabetes management and education to that of traditional care in both urban
           and rural areas. Disease-specific outcomes will include physiologic variables (HbA1c,
           blood pressure, lipid levels), measurement and documentation of preventive services
           (dilated eye exam, monofilament exam, microabumin testing) and patient's knowledge of
           disease tested by questionnaire.

      Results should show improved outcomes and patient knowledge in urban and rural patients
      receiving intensive disease management compared to traditional care.
