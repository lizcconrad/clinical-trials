    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term, &quot;on-demand&quot;
      maintenance therapy with rabeprazole in patients with non-erosive reflux disease (NERD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than half of patients with typical gastroesophageal reflux symptoms such as heartburn
      are considered to have non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), which is characterized by a lack of
      clinically defined damage to the esophagus. One approach to maintain control of these
      symptoms is to have medication available &quot;on-demand.&quot; This is a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness of &quot;on-demand&quot; rabeprazole in the long-term
      maintenance of heartburn control in NERD patients, for whom heartburn was resolved with
      short-term, daily rabeprazole therapy. The study has two phases: an acute phase (4 weeks)
      during which patients receive rabeprazole medication daily, and an &quot;on-demand&quot; phase (6
      months) during which patients take medication (rabeprazole or placebo) as needed. Only
      patients who have complete resolution of heartburn at the end of the acute phase are eligible
      to continue in the &quot;on-demand&quot; phase. Efficacy assessments include the proportion of patients
      discontinuing treatment in the &quot;on-demand&quot; phase because of insufficient heartburn control,
      and the severity of heartburn and patient satisfaction determined at the beginning and end of
      &quot;on-demand&quot; phase. Safety assessments include incidence of adverse events throughout the
      study, physical examination at study initiation, and vital signs at the beginning and the end
      of the study. The study hypothesis is that &quot;on-demand&quot; therapy with rabeprazole is superior
      to placebo in maintaining heartburn control and is well tolerated by the patients with NERD.
      Rabeprazole tablet (10 milligrams[mg]) once daily in the morning for 4 weeks. Rabeprazole
      tablets (10mg) once daily on an &quot;on-demand&quot; basis for the following 6 months.
