  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatments targeted to the hormonal factors
      and the cyclicity of TMD symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle are more effective in
      relieving TMD pain and symptoms than standard self management treatment.

    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of painful conditions involving the muscles of
      mastication and the temporomandibular joint. These pain problems are about twice as common in
      women as in men in the community, and prevalence peaks during the reproductive years. The
      etiology of TMD pain is unknown, but psychological stress, depression and the presence of
      other somatic complaints have been shown to influence the course of these disorders. Prior
      research suggests that female reproductive hormones may also influence TMD pain.
      Specifically, normally cycling women with TMD experience rising levels of TMD pain
      pre-menstrually during a time of precipitous drop in estrogen and show peak TMD pain during
      menses. Interestingly, a secondary peak of TMD pain occurs at about the time of ovulation,
      another phase corresponding to rapid estrogen change. These data demonstrate a systematic
      relationship between levels of TMD pain and phases of the menstrual cycle. The proposed
      clinical trial will manipulate the behavioral and hormonal factors that are hypothesized to
      influence TMD pain, comparing the effects of:

        -  a continuous oral contraceptive intervention designed to suppress menses and stabilize
           the hormonal environment;

        -  a self-management intervention focused on and timed to the chronobiology of TMD symptoms
           across the menstrual cycle; and

        -  a usual self-management intervention not timed to biological events. The aims of this
           clinical trial are to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the cyclic nature of TMD
           pain and symptoms in women, as well as to determine which treatment modality results in
           the greatest improvement in TMD pain and symptoms.

    <description>Two 1.5-hour in-person sessions and 6 10-15-minute telephone calls delivered by a dental hygienist, trained and supervised by a clinical psychologist. Structured, manual-based treatment based on standard cognitive-behavioral pain therapies and self-management interventions for chronic TMD pain. Sessions included education about the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain, TMD etiology and treatments, and the rationale for self-management; relaxation and stress management training; discussion of the role of stress and emotions as potential factors exacerbating and maintaining TMD symptoms; instruction and practice in self-monitoring of symptoms to identify factors that might be helpful to modify through self-care methods; practice of dentist-prescribed self-care treatments; and discussion of strategies to maintain gains and prevent relapse.</description>

          <description>Two 1.5-hour in-person sessions and 6 10-15-minute telephone calls delivered by a dental hygienist, trained and supervised by a clinical psychologist. Structured, manual-based treatment based on standard cognitive-behavioral pain therapies and self-management interventions for chronic TMD pain. Sessions included education about the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain, TMD etiology and treatments, and the rationale for self-management; relaxation and stress management training; discussion of the role of stress and emotions as potential factors exacerbating and maintaining TMD symptoms; instruction and practice in self-monitoring of symptoms to identify factors that might be helpful to modify through self-care methods; practice of dentist-prescribed self-care treatments; and discussion of strategies to maintain gains and prevent relapse.</description>

            <description>Two 1.5-hour in-person sessions and 6 10-15-minute telephone calls delivered by a dental hygienist, trained and supervised by a clinical psychologist. Structured, manual-based treatment based on standard cognitive-behavioral pain therapies and self-management interventions for chronic TMD pain. Sessions included education about the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain, TMD etiology and treatments, and the rationale for self-management; relaxation and stress management training; discussion of the role of stress and emotions as potential factors exacerbating and maintaining TMD symptoms; instruction and practice in self-monitoring of symptoms to identify factors that might be helpful to modify through self-care methods; practice of dentist-prescribed self-care treatments; and discussion of strategies to maintain gains and prevent relapse.</description>
