  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of topiramate (96, 192, and
      256mg daily) with placebo in long-term treatment of obesity.

      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study assesses long-term effectiveness and safety of topiramate in
      patients with obesity. After completing 6 weeks of run-in phase (a single-blind
      placebo-treatment phase during which patients begin non-pharmacological therapy), patients
      will be randomized to receive either topiramate or placebo. Topiramate group will receive
      16mg of topiramate and the dose will be titrated over 8 weeks. Patients will then receive two
      years of treatment. Effectiveness will be evaluated by body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI),
      anthropometric measurements (waist circumference, hip circumference, waist/hip ratio),
      fasting lipid profile, fasting plasma glucose, HbA1c, fasting uric acid, fasting insulin,
      blood pressures, body fat compositions, mass of left ventricle of the heart (as measured by
      echocardiography), and Health Related Quality of Life scores. Safety evaluation (incidence of
      adverse events, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs) will be performed
      throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be effective in achieving
      and maintaining weight reduction in obese patients. During the initial 8 weeks, the doses of
      topiramate or placebo will be gradually increased to the target dose (either 96mg, 192mg, or
      256mg daily by mouth) and the doses will be maintained for 2 years.
