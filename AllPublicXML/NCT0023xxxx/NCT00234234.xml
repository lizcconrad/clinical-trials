  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory rheumatic disease which is
      characterized by joint inflammation (clinical involvement), by osteo-cartilaginous lesions
      (structural damage) and generally by bone involvement. All those features lead to great
      disability. Because it represents a major problem of the public health care system, RA has
      been selected as one of the main objectives of the government for the next five years.

      RA patients who do not respond to DMARDs require a treatment by TNF-a blocking agents.
      However, no information is available to predict the clinical, structural and bone responses
      to those new drugs that can be responsible of severe side-effects. Moreover, they are
      particularly expensive since their yearly cost is estimated between 75000 and 112500 k euros
      for the G4 region.

      The purpose of the present research project is to determine potential predictive factors of
      the response to a new TNF-a blocker ie adalimumab. To address this question, several
      investigations will be performed including measurement of different blood markers,
      particularly bone markers, well-defined autoantibodies and new autoantibody populations
      identified by proteomic analysis, large-scale analysis of gene expression with cDNA arrays
      from blood mononuclear cells, and use of different imaging tools.

      The criteria of judgement will be the clinical, structural and bone responses to those new
      agents.

      This study requires the recruitment of about 100 patients receiving adalimumab for a 1-year
      period.

      At the end of the study, we hope to identify predictive factors of the response to
      adalimumab, which will lead to a better management of this TNF-a blocker. Indeed, they will
      be prescribed only for the patients who are likely to respond to those drugs. Thus, this
      study should allow to elaborate theranostic algorithms. Such an approach will have great
      benefits for the patients: more rapid efficacy, less severe side-reactions and lower costs.
