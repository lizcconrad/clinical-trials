  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There has been considerable debate over the last 30 years about the interaction between
      asthma and parasitic infection. It has been suggested that at least part of the reason for
      the increasing prevalence of asthma in the developed world is a decrease in parasite
      infections resulting from improved living conditions with economic development. Our previous
      studies in Ethiopia suggest that hookworm infection may be particularly important in this
      process.

      To establish definitively whether parasites can protect against allergic disease, and
      specifically asthma, ultimately requires a randomised clinical trial of parasite infection in
      patients with asthma. We, the researchers at the University of Nottingham, have completed a
      study in normal volunteers to establish the dose of hookworms necessary to generate infection
      at the level shown to be protective in population surveys, and shown that infection is well
      tolerated. We now propose two randomised placebo-controlled double blind clinical trials. The
      first will test the effectiveness of hookworm infection in reducing symptoms in allergic
      patients with rhinitis, and will also serve to allow us to check the likely safety of
      hookworm infection in asthma. Assuming that the results of this study are favourable, we will
      then carry out a trial of hookworm infection in asthma. We will also take the opportunity
      during both of these studies to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the effect of hookworm
      infection on the immune system.

      Epidemiological evidence suggests that human hookworm infection is associated with a reduced
      risk of asthma and allergic disease. This association is potentially important not only to
      understanding the aetiology of asthma and allergic disease, but also because it suggests that
      hookworms or their products might be therapeutically effective in these conditions. To test
      the hypothesis that hookworms protect against asthma ultimately requires a clinical trial.

      We have carried out a dose-ranging study to establish the dose of hookworm larvae necessary
      to generate infection at the intensity shown to be protective in epidemiological studies,
      with acceptable side effects, and now propose to test the effect of 12 weeks of hookworm
      infection at this level of intensity in two randomised placebo controlled clinical trials.
      The first will be in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, to determine whether
      hookworm infection improves rhinitis symptoms and also, because these patients will have
      measurable airway responsiveness, to determine whether airway responsiveness changes during
      the lung migration phase of the hookworm life cycle. If this study confirms that hookworm
      infection does not increase airway responsiveness, we will proceed to a similar trial in
      patients with asthma.

      In both studies we will also measure a range of relevant immunological parameters to explore
      the relation between these parameters and expression of the allergic and asthmatic
      phenotypes.
