        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ambulatory male or female subjects &gt; 13 years old.

          -  A female subject must be non-lactating and at no risk for pregnancy.

          -  Diagnosis of USSSI with 2 or more of the following local signs and symptoms:

               -  Pain/tenderness

               -  Swelling

               -  Erythema

               -  Localized warmth

               -  Purulent drainage/discharge

               -  Induration

               -  Regional lymph node swelling or tenderness

               -  Extension of redness

          -  Acceptable USSSI include, but are not limited to:

               -  Cellulitis

               -  Erysipelas

               -  Impetigo

               -  Simple abscess

               -  Wound infection

               -  Furunculosis

               -  Folliculitis

          -  A sample for microbiologic culture must be obtained from the primary infection site
             within 48 hours prior to study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Medical history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to penicillin and/or
             cephalosporin (including cefdinir and cephalexin) antibiotics according to the
             judgment of the Investigator.

          -  Subject with a complicated skin and skin structure infection as judged by the
             investigator.

          -  A chronic or underlying skin condition at the site of infection (e.g., a secondary
             infected atopic dermatitis or eczema) or infections involving prosthetic materials
             (e.g., catheter tunnel infections, orthopedic hardware).

          -  A wound secondary to burn injury or acne vulgaris.

          -  Any infection site that requires:

               -  intraoperative surgical debridement;

               -  excision of infected lesions or body parts.

          -  Infections that can be treated by surgical incision alone according to the judgment of
             the Investigator.

          -  Any other infection that necessitates the use of additional concomitant oral or
             parenteral antibiotic therapy.

          -  Known significant renal or hepatic impairment indicated by:

               -  Serum Creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL (176.8 mol/L)

               -  SGOT (AST) &gt; 3x the upper limit of the reference range

               -  SGPT (ALT) &gt; 3x the upper limit of the reference range

               -  Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2x the upper limit of the reference range

               -  Total Bilirubin &gt; 2x the upper limit of the reference range

          -  Underlying condition and/or disease that, according to the judgment of the
             Investigator, would be likely to interfere with completion of the course of study drug
             therapy or follow-up.

          -  The Investigator considers the subject an unsuitable candidate for cefdinir or
             cephalexin administration
