    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITYTM stent in reducing target vessel failure in de novo native
      coronary artery lesions as compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITYTM balloon-expandable stent.
      Both stents are mounted on the Raptor√¢ over-the-wire (OTW) Stent Delivery System.

      This is a multicenter (55 sites), prospective, 2-arm randomized, double-blind study designed
      to assess the safety and effectiveness of the sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITYTM stent as
      compared to the uncoated Bx VELOCITYTM stent. A total of 1100 patients will be entered in the
      study and will be randomized on a 1:1 basis. Patients with de novo native coronary artery
      lesions &gt;/=15mm and &lt;/=30mm in length and &gt;/=2.50mm to &lt;/=3.5mm in diameter by visual
      estimate who meet all eligibility criteria will be either randomized to the sirolimus-coated
      Bx VELOCITYTM stent or the uncoated Bx VELOCITYTM stent. Patients will be followed at 30
      days, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years post-procedure, with
      approximately 850 patients having repeat angiography at 8 months. A subset of approximately
      17 centers will participate in an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) sub study, in which all
      patients at these centers will be enrolled in the sub study. Additionally, data will be
      collected for a medical economic analysis. These data will include costs associated with the
      index hospitalization and length of stay, and rehospitalizations during the 12-month
      follow-up period. This is a single lesion treatment study. Patients who have had
      interventions of other lesions within 30 days of the study procedure or have interventions
      planned after the index procedure are excluded. It is anticipated that the total length of
      the study will be 101 months: 5 months to complete patient enrollment and 8 years for
      follow-up.
