  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery (esophagectomy or removal of the esophagus)has been the standard treatment for cancer
      of the esophagus. However, evidence suggests that preoperative chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy may add benefit. The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment program of
      combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to surgery and chemotherapy after surgery
      will delay or eliminate recurrence of the cancer.

        Patient Eligibility:

          1. Histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or mixed
             adeno/squamous of the the esophagus or gastroesophageal junction.

          2. Disease limited to the esophagus and regional lymph nodes. However, celiac node
             enlargement will be acceptable for tumors of the distal esophagus, because they will
             be included in the radiation field.

          3. Disease must be able to be encompassed in a single radiation field.

          4. No medical contraindication to surgery.

          5. All treatment is to be administered at the University of Michigan Medical Center

          6. Karnofsky Performance Status &gt; 60%

          7. Ages 18-75

          8. Adequate renal function (BUN &lt;1.5 x N; creatinine &lt;1,5 mg/dl, or measured creatinine
             clearance&gt;60 ml/min.).

          9. Adequate bone marrow reserve (WBC&gt;3500/ul; Platelets&gt;100,000/ul.).

         10. Adequate hepatic function (Bilirubin&lt;1.5x N; AST &lt;2 x upper limit of normal).

         11. Prior malignancy is acceptable if the patient is considered to be cured. In most cases
             this will mean a 5 year disease-free period.

         12. Ability to give informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with active infection, pregnancy, lactating females, serious inter-current
             medical conditions including congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, or
             symptomatic coronary artery diseases are ineligible.

          2. No prior treatment allowed. No prior thoracic radiation.
