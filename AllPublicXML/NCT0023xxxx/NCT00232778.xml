      The objectives of this study are:

        1. To show a reduction in the late thrombosis (LT) rate following percutaneous
           revascularization using current interventional techniques with new stent placement and
           intravascular radiation therapy (IRT) with a long-term antiplatelet regimen (12 months)
           compared to the stented patients on short-term antiplatelet regimen (2 months) from the
           IRT arm of GAMMA I Trial.

        2. To show equivalence in the LT rate following percutaneous revascularization using
           current interventional techniques without new stent placement and IRT with a long-term
           antiplatelet regimen (6 months) compared to non-stented patients on short term
           antiplatelet therapy (2 months or less) from a pooling of the IRT arms of the GAMMA I,
           SCRIPPS, and WRIST Trials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient has a restenosis of &gt;60% (by subjective angiographic determination of the
             minimal luminal diameter compared to the distal reference diameter) within a native
             coronary artery which has previously undergone stent placement.

          2. The patient has a history, signs of, or laboratory studies that suggest coronary
             ischemia attributable to the target stenosis.

          3. The study target lesion must be located in a restenotic native coronary artery
             measuring &gt;2.75 and &lt;4.0 mm in diameter and 45 mm in length. The target lesion must
             have undergone coronary interventional treatment &gt;4 weeks previously.

          4. The vessel 1 cm distal to the target lesion is &gt;2.5 mm in diameter.

        5 Patients age must be &gt;18 years and &lt;85 years.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Attempts to treat lesions in other vessels during the procedure were unsuccessful.

          2. The patient sustained a recent (&lt;72 hours) myocardial infarction defined as a serum CK
             2x the upper limit of normal and elevated MB.

          3. Serum creatinine &gt;2.0 mg/dl.

          4. The left ventricular ejection fraction is &lt;40%.
