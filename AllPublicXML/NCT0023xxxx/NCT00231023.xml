      This study will evaluate which of the three following treatment options is better for
      diabetic macular edema: laser alone, steroid injection alone, or steroid injection followed
      by laser. Macular edema is a swelling in the small central part of the retina - the part of
      the retina that is used for sharp, straight-ahead vision. Laser treatment is the only
      treatment that has been proven to be beneficial for diabetic macular edema. It reduces the
      swelling and lessens the chance of further vision loss, but it does not improve vision.
      Triamcinolone is a steroid drug that decreases inflammation and scarring. Injections of the
      drug have decreased macular edema in some patients and improved vision. Swelling may return,
      requiring repeat injections, and it is not known if the vision improvement is permanent. This
      3-year study will examine and compare the benefits and side effects of both treatments, alone
      and in combination.

      Patients 18 years of age and older with diabetic macular edema may be eligible for this
      study. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures.

      At the beginning of the study:

        -  Blood tests to measure HbA1C (measure of diabetes control).

        -  Measurement of blood pressure.

        -  Eye examination to assess visual acuity (eye chart test) and eye pressure, and to
           examine pupils, lens, retina and eye movements. The pupils are dilated with drops for
           this examination.

        -  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to measure retinal thickness. This test shines a
           light into the eye and produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina. These
           measurements are repeated during the study to determine if retinal thickening is getting
           better or worse, or staying the same.

      Photographs of the retina and lens. A special camera with bright flashes is used to take
      these photographs.

      Treatments

      Some patients will have one eye treated and some patients will have both eyes treated. The
      treatment for a given individual is determined by chance:

        -  Triamcinolone acetonide injection alone. The steroid is injected in the tissue around
           the eye. Two injection procedures are used in the study, differing in their location and
           dose. Numbing drops are placed over the area to be injected and the steroid is injected.

        -  Laser treatment alone. The surface of the eye is numbed with drops and a contact lens is
           placed on the eye during the laser beam application. Before the treatment, patients may
           have fluorescein angiography, in which pictures of the retina are taken using a yellow
           dye. The dye is injected into a vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eye. The
           camera flashes a blue light in the eye and takes pictures that show the amount of dye
           leakage into the retina. Treatments may be repeated at several visits.

        -  Triamcinolone acetonide plus laser treatment. Patients who receive both the steroid
           injection and laser have the steroid injection first and the laser treatment 1 month
           later.

      Follow-up

      Patients return to the clinic for follow-up visits at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 36 months, or
      more often if needed, after the initial treatment for an eye exam, measurement of visual
      acuity, and OTC. Photographs of the retina are taken at the 4- and 8-month visits and at the
      1-, 2- and 3-year visits. Fluorescein angiography may be done at 4 months. Blood pressure is
      measured at the 1-, 2- and 3-year visits, and an HbA1c blood test is done at 4 and 8 months
      and at the yearly visits. Participants may be asked to complete a questionnaire once a year
      about their vision and medical condition. Treatment options are discussed at the 4- and
      8-month visits.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of visual impairment in the United States. Diabetic
      macular edema (DME) is a manifestation of diabetic retinopathy that produces loss of central
      vision. Data from the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) estimate
      that after 15 years of known diabetes, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is
      approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM), 25% in patients with type 2
      DM who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2 DM who do not take insulin.

      In a review of three early studies concerning the natural history of diabetic macular edema,
      Ferris and Patz found that 53% of 135 eyes with diabetic macular edema, presumably all
      involving the center of the macula, lost two or more lines of visual acuity over a two year
      period. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), 33% of 221 untreated eyes
      available for follow-up at the 3-year visit, all with edema involving the center of the
      macula at baseline, had experienced a 15 or more letter decrease in visual acuity score
      (equivalent to a doubling of the visual angle, e.g., 20/25 to 20/50, and termed &quot;moderate
      visual loss&quot;).

      In the ETDRS, focal/grid photocoagulation of eyes with clinically significant macular edema
      (CSME) reduced the risk of moderate visual loss by approximately 50% (from 24% to 12%, three
      years after initiation of treatment). Therefore, 12% of treated eyes developed moderate
      visual loss in spite of treatment. Furthermore, approximately 40% of treated eyes that had
      retinal thickening involving the center of the macula at baseline still had thickening
      involving the center at 12 months, as did 25% of treated eyes at 36 months.

      Although several treatment modalities are currently under investigation, the only
      demonstrated means to reduce the risk of vision loss from diabetic macular edema are laser
      photocoagulation, as demonstrated by the ETDRS, and intensive glycemic control, as
      demonstrated by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom
      Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). In the DCCT, intensive glucose control reduced the risk
      of onset of diabetic macular edema by 23% compared with conventional treatment. Long-term
      follow-up of patients in the DCCT show a sustained effect of intensive glucose control, with
      a 58% risk reduction in the development of diabetic macular edema for the DCCT patients
      followed in the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications Study.

      The frequency of an unsatisfactory outcome following laser photocoagulation in some eyes with
      diabetic macular edema has prompted interest in other treatment modalities. One such
      treatment is pars plana vitrectomy. These studies suggest that vitreomacular traction, or the
      vitreous itself, may play a role in increased retinal vascular permeability. Removal of the
      vitreous or relief of mechanical traction with vitrectomy and membrane stripping may be
      followed by substantial resolution of macular edema and corresponding improvement in visual
      acuity. However, this treatment may be applicable only to a specific subset of eyes with
      diabetic macular edema. It also requires a complex surgical intervention with its inherent
      risks, recovery time, and expense. Other treatment modalities such as pharmacologic therapy
      with oral protein kinase C inhibitors and antibodies targeted at vascular endothelial growth
      factor (VEGF) are under investigation.

      The use of intravitreal corticosteroids is another treatment modality that has generated
      recent interest. However, use of intravitreal corticosteroids generally has been reserved for
      cases of DME in which there is at least moderate loss of visual acuity (e.g., worse than
      20/40). This treatment generally has not been widely used for mild cases of DME due to
      concerns about its potential risks, particularly glaucoma and cataract, relative to the
      potential benefit.

      Injection of corticosteroids around the eye (anterior subtenon's, posterior subtenon's,
      retrobulbar) has been used as an alternative to intravitreal injection. Although data are
      limited, it is presumed that the adverse effects on the eye are lower with an injection
      around the eye compared with in the eye. There are also little data on the efficacy of this
      treatment. This study is being conducted to collect pilot data on the safety and efficacy of
      peribulbar corticosteroids to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of efficacy to
      merit conducting a phase 3 randomized trial.

          1. Patients less than18 years old are not being included because DME is so rare in this
             age group that the diagnosis of DME may be questionable.

          2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

             - Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes
             is present:

             Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes

             Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes

             Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria

          -  Patients in poor glycemic control who, within the last 4 months, initiated intensive
             insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in the next 4
             months should not be enrolled.

             7. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of study entry that
             involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval at the time
             of study entry.

             8. Known allergy to any corticosteroid or any component of the delivery vehicle.

             9. History of systemic (e.g., oral, IV, IM, epidural, bursal) corticosteroids within 4
             months prior to randomization or topical, rectal, or inhaled corticosteroids in
             current use more than 2 times per week.

             10. History of steroid-induced intraocular pressure elevation that required

             12. Blood pressure greater than 180/110 (systolic above 180 OR diastolic above 110).

          -  If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, patient can
             become eligible.

             13. Patient is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not
             covered by another clinical center during the next 8 months.

        STUDY EYE CRITERIA

        The patient must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria (a-e) and none
        of the exclusion criteria (f-t) listed below.

        A patient may have two study eyes only if both are eligible at the time of randomization

        The eligibility criteria for a study eye are as follows:

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Best corrected E-ETDRS visual acuity score of greater than or equal to 69 letters
             (i.e., 20/40 or better).

          2. Definite retinal thickening due to diabetic macular edema based on clinical exam.

          3. Retinal thickness in the OCT central subfield measuring 250 microns or more

          4. Maximal laser has not already been given and investigator believes that either
             peribulbar steroids or laser may benefit the eye (note: subjects may be enrolled
             without having received prior macular laser).

          5. Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs and OCT.

             EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          6. Macular edema is considered to be due to a cause other than diabetic macular edema.

             - An eye should not be considered eligible: (1) if the macular edema is considered to
             be related to intraocular surgery such as cataract surgery or (2) clinical exam and/or
             OCT suggests that vitreoretinal interface abnormality (e.g., a taut posterior hyaloid
             or epiretinal membrane) is judged to be a cause of the macular edema.

          7. An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the investigator, visual
             acuity would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy,
             pigmentary changes, dense subfoveal hard exudates, nonretinal condition).

          8. An ocular condition is present (other than diabetes) that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, might affect macular edema or alter visual acuity during the course of
             the study (e.g., vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease,
             neovascular glaucoma, Irvine-Gass Syndrome, etc.).

          9. History of prior treatment with intravitreal, peribulbar, or retrobulbar
             corticosteroids for DME.

         10. History of focal/grid macular photocoagulation within 15 weeks (3.5 months) prior to
             randomization.

             - Note: Patients are not required to have had prior macular photocoagulation to be
             enrolled.

         11. History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to
             randomization.

         12. Anticipated need for PRP in the 4 months following randomization.

         13. History of prior vitrectomy.

         14. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any
             intraocular surgery, etc.) within prior 6 months or anticipated within the next 6
             months following randomization.

         15. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.

         16. Intraocular pressure greater than or equal to 25 mmHg.

         17. History of open-angle glaucoma (either primary open-angle glaucoma or other cause of
             open-angle glaucoma; note: angle-closure glaucoma is not an exclusion).

               -  A history of ocular hypertension is not an exclusion as long as (1) intraocular
                  pressure is less than 25 mm Hg, (2) the patient is using no more than one topical
                  glaucoma medication, (3) the most recent visual field, performed within the last
                  12 months, is normal (if abnormalities are present on the visual field they must
                  be attributable to the patient's diabetic retinopathy), and (4) the optic disc
                  does not appear glaucomatous.

               -  Note: if the intraocular pressure is 22 to less than 25 mm Hg, then the above
                  criteria for ocular hypertension eligibility must be met.

         18. History of prior herpetic ocular infection.

         19. Exam evidence of ocular toxoplasmosis.

         20. Exam evidence of pseudoexfoliation.
