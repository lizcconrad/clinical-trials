  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare how risperidone and olanzapine, two
      antipsychotic medications, affect the regulation of glucose (sugar) in the body.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The newer antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine effectively treat
      schizophrenia and related disorders, and they may cause fewer side effects than the older
      antipsychotic drugs do. However, some of the newer antipsychotic medications could have a
      negative effect on the regulation of blood glucose (sugar) in the body. This negative effect
      could make the patient gain weight and even develop diabetes mellitus. This randomized,
      double-blind study will assess and compare how risperidone and olanzapine affect the
      regulation of glucose in the body in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective
      disorder. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive risperidone (target oral dose of 6
      milligrams per day) or olanzapine (target oral dose of 20 milligrams per day) for 6 months.
      Repeat laboratory measurements will be performed and questions will be asked of the patients
      to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the drugs. The primary laboratory test used to
      assess the patient's regulation of blood glucose will be the Disposition Index derived from
      the Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test. Risperidone 2 milligram
      oven-encapsulated tablets taken orally once a day for 6 months; olanzapine 5 milligram
      tablets taken orally once a day for 6 months
