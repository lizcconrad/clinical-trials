      Abnormal blood cholesterol levels increase the risk of developing, or dying from heart
      disease. It is well recognised that if &quot;harmful&quot; LDL cholesterol is high, and &quot;protective&quot;
      HDL cholesterol is low, this risk is increased. Drugs called statins are routinely used in
      patients with heart disease, are well tolerated, and decrease the harmful LDL cholesterol
      levels. However, statins only increase protective HDL cholesterol to a small extent. Some
      patients may thus benefit from additional medication to increase protective HDL-cholesterol
      further. One of the most effective drugs which can do this is nicotinic acid. This drug is
      well established having been available for over 30 years. Previous use has been limited by
      facial flushing in a large percentage of patients receiving the drug. However a new
      formulation called Niaspan is now available which is associated with much less flushing.
      Although many patients will have transient flushing, it is estimated that only 1 patient out
      of every 20 receiving the drug will have to discontinue treatment. We therefore propose, in
      patients with coronary artery disease and low HDL cholesterol despite being on a statin, to
      study the effect of Niaspan on HDL cholesterol and other lipid parameters, and to assess its
      tolerability.

      Objective: To assess, in patients with coronary heart disease and low HDL-cholesterol, the
      efficacy and tolerability of Niaspan as an adjunct to statin therapy in clinical practice.

      Background: Despite the clear reduction in mortality and cardiovascular morbidity associated
      with reduction of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by statin therapy, a sizeable proportion of
      patients remain at risk of subsequent adverse cardiac events [1-3]. It is clear that in some
      patients, further risk reduction may be obtained by addressing other elements of the lipid
      profile. In particular, sub-analysis of the Framingham study has shown that for any given
      level of LDL-C, the risk of coronary heart disease events decreased with increasing HDL
      cholesterol (HDL-C) levels [4]. In addition, the adverse cardiac risk associated with
      elevated triglycerides is predominantly seen in patients with low HDL-C levels [5]. The
      protective effect of HDL-C appears predominantly mediated via reverse cholesterol transport.
      In this process, excess cholesterol in cell membranes is transferred to HDL-C in the
      peripheral tissues, cholesterol is converted to cholesteryl ester in HDL-C by
      lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), the newly synthesized cholesteryl ester is
      transported from HDL-C to lower density lipoproteins by the action of cholesteryl ester
      transfer protein (CETP) and finally, the cholesterol is removed from plasma by hepatic
      clearance of plasma lipoproteins. Of the available licensed lipid lowering agents, nicotinic
      acid has the greatest potential for raising HDL-C, in addition to giving favourable
      reductions in LDL-C, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B-100 and elevation of
      Apolipoprotein A-1.

      Early studies with nicotinic acid confirmed its efficacy in improving cardiac outcomes. The
      Coronary Drug Project [6], studied 8341 men with previous MI. A 26% reduction in non fatal MI
      and 24% reduction in cerebrovascular events was reported after 6 years follow up [6] and an
      11% reduction in mortality after 15 years follow up [7]. The Stockholm Ischemic Heart Disease
      Secondary Prevention Study [8] compared niacin plus clofibrate vs. placebo in 555 post MI
      survivors and after 5 years reported a 26% reduction in overall mortality (p&lt;0.05) and 36%
      reduction in CHD mortality (p&lt;0.01). In the current era, statin therapy is considered
      mandatory for patients with confirmed coronary artery disease [3]. However, nicotinic acid
      appeared safe and efficacious in combination with statin therapy as demonstrated in the more
      recent HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS) [9], where the frequency of the composite
      end point (death, MI, stroke, or revascularization) was reduced from 24% with placebo to 3%
      with simvastatin-niacin therapy. While flushing was previously a use limiting factor with the
      immediate release nicotinic acid (niacin), a new extended release preparation (Niaspan) has
      reduced the incidence of use limiting flushing to &lt;6%. Several studies demonstrate the
      ability of Niaspan to improve HDL levels, either as monotherapy [10,11], or in addition to
      statin therapy [12]. To date the safety and efficacy of Niaspan has not been studied in a
      placebo controlled manner, in a group of patients with coronary artery disease already on
      statin therapy.

      Study population: Patients will be recruited primarily from the cardiology wards of Craigavon
      Cardiac Centre, Craigavon Area Hospital.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Persisting low HDL-C (&lt;0.9mmol/l) on a full lipid profile result (which for inpatients
           should have been taken &lt;24 hours after admission).

        2. Objective diagnosis of coronary heart disease (previous biomarker proven MI, positive
           stress test, angiogram with at least one &gt;50% diameter stenosis)

        3. Established for at least 6 weeks on a “maintenance” dose of statin therapy (defined as
           Pravastatin 40mg, Simvastatin 40mg or Atorvastatin ≥10mg). The dose and type of statin
           should not be altered during the study period

        4. Absence of concurrent major systemic illness (particularly liver or renal failure, or
           hypo or hyperthyroidism)

      Exclusion criteria:

        1. Previous use of Niaspan or other non-statin lipid lowering agent within the previous 12
           weeks

        2. Contraindications to Niaspan therapy

        3. Participation in another medical trial within the previous 30days

        4. Failure to obtain informed consent

      Study Design: To be considered as a pilot study. Patients will be prospectively randomized,
      in a double blind fashion with 1:1 ratio, to receive Niaspan or to an otherwise identical
      placebo, with doses titrated according to the clinical response. The primary outcome measure
      will be the number of patients achieving target HDL-C levels (defined as HDL-C &gt;1.0mmol/l in
      males or &gt;1.29mmol/l in females) after completion of the study protocol while taking Niaspan
      compared with placebo. The final HDL-C blood sample for comparative analysis between groups
      will be taken at week 11, or at week 15, if the HDL-C target had not been reached by week 11.
      Given the HDL-C inclusion criteria of &lt;0.9mmol/l, assuming a least difference to detect of
      0.09mmol, and allowing for study drop outs, 30 patients per group will have &gt;90% power to
      detect this difference as statistically significant. Analysis by intention to treat will be
      made by an independent samples T test.
