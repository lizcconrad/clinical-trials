  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the long-term use of highly (＞98%)
      purified EPA, in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), would be more effective
      than statin alone in preventing cardiovascular events in Japanese patients with
      hypercholesterolemia.

      Epidemiological studies from many countries including Finland, Italy, Japan, and The
      Netherlands have suggested that an increased intake of dietary fish or fish oil rich in the
      long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is inversely related to the risk of atherothrombotic diseases, in
      particular coronary artery disease (CAD).

      Results of many prospective observational cohort studies have found that diets rich in marine
      PUFAs may be protective against major cardiovascular events, including mortality from CAD,
      total cardiovascular death, all-cause mortality, and nonfatal myocardial infarction. To date,
      only a few studies have examined the effects of purified n-3 PUFA preparations in human
      subjects for short observation periods. The principle aim of the current study is to test the
      hypothesis that the long-term use of highly purified EPA(eicosapentaenoic acid: 1800mg/day),
      in addition to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is effective in preventing cardiovascular events
      in Japanese patients with hypercholesterolemia.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible participants had a total cholesterol level of ≧250mg/dL(6.5m mol/L) at
             baseline.

          -  Hyperlipidemic patients with serum total cholesterol of 250mg/dL or more. (Measurement
             of serum total cholesterol)

          -  Serum total cholesterol should be measured twice at interval of 2-4weeks. A single
             measurement is acceptable if the cholesterol is measured by blood collection at
             fasting under strict compliance with dietary advice after withdrawal of the
             antihyperlipemic drug.

          -  (Wash Out) The wash out period of 4weeks (8 weeks for probucol) is necessary in
             patients under treatment with antihyperlipemic drug. However, if treatment with the
             antihyperlipemic drug was started within 6 months of the initiation of the study, the
             patient can participate in the study without the washout period.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute myocardial infarction occurring within last 6 months

          -  Unstable angina pectoris

          -  A history or complication of serious heart disease(severe arrhythmia, heart failure,
             cardiac myopathy, valvular disease, congenital disease, etc.)

          -  Receiving cardiovascular reconstruction within last 6 months

          -  Cerebrovascular disorders occurring within last 6 months

          -  Complication of serious hepatic disease or renal disease

          -  Malignant tumor

          -  Uncontrollable diabetes

          -  Hyperlipidemia arising from the following disease: Nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism,
             Cushing's syndrome, secondary hyperlipidemia due to other disease

          -  Hyperlipidemia due to some drugs such as steroid hormone

          -  Hemorrhage(hemophilia, capillary fragility, gastrointestinal ulcer, urinary tract
             hemorrhage, hemoptysis, vitreous hemorrhage, etc.)

          -  Hemorrhagic diathesis

          -  Hypersensitivity to the study drug formulation

          -  Patients intending to undergo surgery

          -  Patients judged to be inappropriate by the physician in charge
