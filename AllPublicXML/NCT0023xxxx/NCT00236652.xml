  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a once-daily
      administration of 750 milligrams levofloxacin (an antibiotic) for five days, in treating
      bacterial sinus infections.

    <textblock>
      Acute bacterial sinusitis is a common diagnosis for which an antibiotic is prescribed in
      outpatients. Some types of bacteria that cause sinusitis are resistant to penicillin and
      certain other classes of antibiotics, but may be treatable with the antibiotic levofloxacin.
      This will be an open-label, multi-center, non-comparative clinical trial involving
      outpatients with protocol-defined acute bacterial sinusitis suitable for treatment with oral
      antibiotics. At the Preliminary Visit, a sinus radiograph will be obtained to confirm the
      clinical diagnosis of sinusitis, and the Investigator will perform a nasal exam. Sinus
      puncture and placement of an indwelling sinus catheter into an affected maxillary sinus will
      be performed on all eligible patients at the first visit. Patients meeting the study criteria
      will receive 750 milligrams levofloxacin tablets once daily for 5 days. The primary objective
      is to establish the rate and extent of bacteriological eradication, defined as eradication of
      pathogens from the maxillary sinus, and to establish the effectiveness and safety of
      once-daily 750 milligrams levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in
      adults.
