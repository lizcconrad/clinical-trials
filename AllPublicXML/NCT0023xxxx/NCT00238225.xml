      RATIONALE: Calcitriol may cause solid tumor cells to look more like normal cells, and to grow
      and spread more slowly. Ketoconazole and dexamethasone may help calcitriol work better by
      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug. Giving calcitriol together with ketoconazole
      and dexamethasone may kill more tumor cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of calcitriol when
      given together with ketoconazole and dexamethasone in treating patients with metastatic or
      unresectable solid tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of calcitriol when administered with ketoconazole
           and dexamethasone in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerability and toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of calcitriol and dexamethasone with or without
           ketoconazole in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamics of this regimen, in terms of CYP24 expression and
           activity and vitamin D receptor expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of calcitriol.

      Patients receive oral dexamethasone twice daily beginning on day 0 and oral ketoconazole 3
      times daily beginning on day 4. Patients also receive oral calcitriol once daily on days 1-3
      of each week. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
