      RATIONALE: Calcitriol may cause pancreatic cancer cells to look more like normal cells, and
      to grow and spread more slowly. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Calcitriol may also help docetaxel work better by making the tumor cells
      more sensitive to the drug. Giving calcitriol together with docetaxel may kill more tumor
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving calcitriol together with docetaxel
      works in treating patients with metastatic or locally advanced pancreatic cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with metastatic or locally advanced
           pancreatic cancer treated with calcitriol and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the median and one-year survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the change in pancreatic cancer-induced pain in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral calcitriol on days 1, 8, and 15 and docetaxel IV over 15-30
      minutes on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
