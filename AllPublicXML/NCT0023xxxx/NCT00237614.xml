  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty are at high risk for
      renal injury due to the toxic effect of contrast agents. Patients developing renal
      dysfunction after primary angioplasty have worse outcome. To investigate the role of the
      antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in preventing renal injury in angioplasty, we randomized
      352 consecutive patients undergoing primary angioplasty into three groups: the first group
      received NAC at standard dose (NAC group, 600 mg i.v. bolus before primary angioplasty,
      followed by oral 600 mg twice daily for the following 48 hours; n=115), the second group
      received NAC at double dose (DD-NAC group; 1,200 mg i.v. bolus and oral 1,200 mg twice daily
      for 48 hours; n=118), and the last group received placebo (controls; n=119).

        Inclusion Criteria:Consecutive patients admitted to the Coronary Care Unit for ST-segment
        elevation acute myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty. Patients were
        included if they presented within 12 hours (18 hours for acute myocardial infarction
        complicated by cardiogenic shock) from the onset of symptoms. -

        Exclusion Criteria:Patients in chronic peritoneal or hemodialytic treatment and those with
        known allergy to N-acetylcysteine.
