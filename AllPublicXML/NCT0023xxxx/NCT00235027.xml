  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient safety is at the forefront of critical issues in health care. Medications are the
      single most frequent cause of adverse events, and in the inpatient setting adverse drug
      events (ADEs) are common, expensive, injurious to patients, and often preventable. Relatively
      little, however, is known about the frequency of ADEs in the ambulatory setting, how to
      monitor for outpatient ADEs, or on the impact of prevention strategies such as
      computerization of prescribing supplemented by decision-support.

      Specific Aim 1: Increase routine identification of outpatient adverse drug events (ADEs)
      through development of a computerized ADE detection monitor.

      Specific Aim 2: Use basic computerized outpatient prescribing to reduce preventable ADEs in a
      diverse array of outpatient settings.

      Specific Aim 3: Use advanced decision-support within computerized prescribing to reduce the
      frequency of preventable ADEs, medication errors, and potential ADEs.
