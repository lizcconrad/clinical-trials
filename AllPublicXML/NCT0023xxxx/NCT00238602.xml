  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two primary objectives. The first objective is to determine the maximal
      tolerated dose (MTD) that can be delivered with stereotactic radiosurgery in patients with
      inoperable malignant lung tumors. Once the MTD is established, the second objective is to
      determine the efficacy of radiosurgical ablation of lung tumors in terms of symptoms and
      radiographic responses.

        Exclusion Criteria:1. No chemotherapy within 2 weeks of radiation treatment.

        2. Refusal to sign informed consent.

        3. Refusal to take a pregnancy test prior to treatment if the patient is a woman with child
        bearing potential.
