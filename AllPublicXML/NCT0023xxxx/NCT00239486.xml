      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different doses of
      pramipexole (Sifrol) on subjective and objective symptoms of idiopathic Restless Legs
      Syndrome (RLS) and also to determine the optimal dose of pramipexole in patients with RLS by
      polysomnography and evaluation of clinical improvement.
