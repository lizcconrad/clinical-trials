  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The synergistic value of the fusion of physiologic and anatomical data has been described
      using several co-registration techniques for various nuclear medicine procedures and
      morphologic imaging modalities (single photon emission computed tomography-computed
      tomography [SPECT-CT], SPECT-magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], camera-based positron emission
      tomography [PET]-CT and PET-CT). The researchers hypothesize that fusion of nuclear medicine
      (NM) and CT data acquired sequentially in a single imaging session on one device is
      clinically superior to side-by-side evaluation of separately performed imaging tests. They
      hypothesize that more accurate localization of increased radiotracer activity on NM
      procedures will improve the diagnostic accuracy for detection of infection and will
      subsequently have a significant impact on patient management.

      The purpose of the present study is to assess the clinical value of this new technology of
      fused imaging in patients undergoing diagnostic nuclear medicine evaluation for suspicion of
      an infection process.
