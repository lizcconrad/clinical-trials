    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether desmopressin administered as a melt tablet
      is effective in reducing the number of wet nights in children and adolescents who suffer from
      bedwetting.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE), or bedwetting, is a common childhood urological disease.
      Factors contributing to nocturnal enuresis include nocturnal polyuria due to, at least in
      part, a relative deficiency of antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) which has been
      supported by the finding that some enuretic children lack a nocturnal increase in endogenous
      AVP secretion. Desmopressin, a synthetic, structural analogue of AVP, selective for
      V2-receptors and with a longer half life than the natural hormone, has been found to be
      especially beneficial in PNE subjects with nocturnal polyuria and normal functional bladder
      capacity.

      A melt tablet formulation offers benefits compared to regular tablets and nasal spray.
      Regular tablets are more difficult to swallow for some patients and require fluid intake for
      swallowing. Nasal spray absorption may be altered by seasonal allergies, upper respiratory
      infections or improper administration.
