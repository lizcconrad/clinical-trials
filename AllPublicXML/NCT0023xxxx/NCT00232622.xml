    <textblock>
      The optimal dosage and duration of administration of clot-dissolving medications for the
      treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves with clots is not known. We hypothesized
      that a large dose of the clot-dissolving medicine given initially (akin to the dose given in
      the treatment of heart attacks), might speed up the dissolution of the clot and rapidly
      restore the functioning of the mechanical heart valve.

      The optimal fibrinolytic strategy for left sided prosthetic valve thrombosis (PVT) is not
      known. A large initial bolus dose of streptokinase (SK) might accelerate fibrinolysis and
      restore valve function more rapidly.

      This is a prospective, randomized trial comparing 2 fibrinolytic protocols in a first episode
      of PVT. In the rapid fibrinolytic protocol (RFP) 1.5 MU of SK is given over 1 hour, followed
      if required by a 0.1 MU/h infusion. In the standard protocol (SP) 0.25 MU is given over 30
      minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.1 MU/h. Serial echocardiography and fluoroscopy will be
      done to monitor therapy. The primary end point is the occurrence of a complete clinical
      response (CCR, complete hemodynamic response without any major complication). 58 patients are
      required in each arm for detecting a 30% difference with 80% power at Î±=0.05.
