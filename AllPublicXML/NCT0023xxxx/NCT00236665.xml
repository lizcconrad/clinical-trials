  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of daily topiramate (96mg or
      192mg) versus placebo in obese patients with mild to moderate high blood pressure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. The use of topiramate to reduce
      weight in obese patients may have the adjunctive benefit of reducing blood pressure in
      subjects with treated or untreated hypertension, on or off background antihypertensive
      medications. This double-blind, placebo controlled study investigates the long-term efficacy
      of topiramate for reduction of weight and blood pressure in obese patients with mild-moderate
      hypertension, and the safety and tolerability of topiramate in this patient population. The
      study consists of 4 phases: 6 week run-in phase (2 weeks screening and 4 weeks single-blind
      placebo), 8 week titration phase (topiramate group will have their dose increased from
      16mg/day to either 96mg/day or 192mg/day), 52 week maintenance phase (patients will receive
      fixed dose of either topiramate or placebo) and 6 week follow-up phase. Beginning at
      enrollment and throughout the study, all subjects participated in a standardized behavioral
      modification program which provides subjects with lifestyle and self-management strategies
      for diet, nutrition and physical activity. Effectiveness will be evaluated by multiple
      measurements such as change in body weight, sitting diastolic blood pressure, sitting
      systolic blood pressure, Body Mass Index, number and proportion of treatment responders,
      volume of left ventricle of the heart as measured by echocardiography, and fasting lipid
      profile. Safety evaluations (incidence and severity of adverse events, vital signs, 12 lead
      ECG, clinical laboratory results) will be conducted throughout the study. The study
      hypothesis is that topiramate is effective in reducing blood pressure in obese patients with
      mild to moderate hypertension and is well tolerated. During the initial 8 weeks, the dose of
      topiramate or placebo will be gradually increased to the target doses (either 48mg twice
      daily or 96mg twice daily by mouth) and the doses will be maintained for 52 weeks.
