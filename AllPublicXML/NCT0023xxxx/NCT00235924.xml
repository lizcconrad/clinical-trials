      This is an international multicentre open study, assessing the innocuity on breast and
      endometrium of a 70 mg daily dose of isoflavones standardized extract (Phytosoya).

      This study follows the European guidelines :one-year treatment duration, biopsy and
      mammography performed at the beginning and at the end of the trial, recruitment of enough
      subjects in order to have 300 patients with an evaluable biopsy after one year of treatment.

      After 3 weeks of screening phase, the patients will be taken Phytosoya during 52 weeks. At
      the end of the first year of treatment, an endometrial biopsy, an endovaginal
      ultrasonography, a mammography, breast ultrasounds, a clinical examination and a biological
      assessment will be performed.

      In addition, it will be proposed to patients to continue treatment during 2 additional years.
      At the end of the third year,the same examinations will be performed.
