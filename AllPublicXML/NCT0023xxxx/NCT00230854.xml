    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of repeated intravenous
      infusions of EMZ702 in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in patients with
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 1.

    <textblock>
      In this study, 28 patients with chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 who have failed previous
      treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin will be treated. The study treatment will
      consist of the same type and doses of pegylated interferon and ribavirin to which the patient
      failed to respond plus EMZ702. EMZ702 will be administered intravenously twice a week during
      the first 12 weeks of treatment. Thereafter and according to viral response, patients will
      continue to receive pegylated interferon and ribavirin only for up to 36 weeks.
