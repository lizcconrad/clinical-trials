      The main objective of this study is to compare the performance of the Cypher
      sirolimus-eluting and the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent systems in a prospective,
      multi-center, randomized clinical study.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study conducted at 90 centers in Europe, Latin-America and
      Asia. A total of 1335 patients will be entered into the study and will be randomized on a 1:1
      basis to either the sirolimus-eluting or the paclitaxel-eluting stent system. All patients
      will have repeat angiography at eight months and will be followed for 24 months
      post-procedure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          2. Treatment of up to two de novo native coronary artery lesions in a maximum of two
             major coronary arteries;

          3. Ostial lesions;

          4. Bifurcations;

          5. Target vessel diameter of both lesions must be &gt;=2.25mm and &lt;=3.0mm in diameter
             (visual estimate);

          6. One target lesion must be at least 15 mm in length and the second lesion has to be at
             least 10 mm in length with no upper limit on either;

          7. Target lesion stenosis for both lesions is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (visual estimate).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             total CK &gt;2 times normal within the preceding 72 hours and the CK and CK-MB enzymes
             remain above normal at the time of treatment;

          2. Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald A I-II-III;

          3. Any of the lesions is an unprotected left main coronary disease with &gt;=50% stenosis;

          4. Angiographic evidence of thrombus within target lesion;

          5. Heavily calcified lesion and/or calcified lesion, which cannot be successfully
             predilated (applies to both lesions);

          6. Documented left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;=25%;

        8. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level) (applies to both lesions);

        9. Prior stent within 10mm of target lesion (applies to both lesions).
