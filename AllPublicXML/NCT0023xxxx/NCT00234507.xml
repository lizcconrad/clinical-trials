        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with a confirmed diagnosis of bilateral benign essential blepharospasm, and
             having symptoms of such for at least 6 months prior to the baseline visit

          -  na誰ve patients to botulinum toxin type A treatment, or patients who had received a
             single treatment of botulinum toxin type A, or those who had demonstrated a
             satisfactory response, in the investigator's opinion, to the last 2 injections of
             botulinum toxin type A with a minimum of 12 weeks since the last injection and where a
             further injection at full dosage was now indicated

          -  patients with a minimum score of 8 on the BDS

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with either neuroleptic-induced blepharospasm, isolated levator dysfunction
             or apraxia

          -  previous surgical, chemical and thermal myectomy or neurectomy

          -  any condition where intramuscular injection is contraindicated

          -  ophthalmolgical infection

          -  myasthenia gravis or other disorders of the neuromuscular junction

          -  prescription of antispastic, muscle relaxants or medications affecting neuromuscular
             junction transmission, or medication where the dose or choice of medication has not
             been constant for the last 30 days
