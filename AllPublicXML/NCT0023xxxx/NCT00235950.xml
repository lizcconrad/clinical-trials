  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy between two lipid lowering treatments,
      rosuvastatin (10-40 mg) and atorvastatin (20-80 mg) in reducing low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) levels after 16 weeks of treatment in patients with coronary heart
      disease
