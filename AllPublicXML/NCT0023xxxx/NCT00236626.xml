    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate (1) the effect of topiramate on insulin
      sensitivity in overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and (2) the safety
      of topiramate in type 2 diabetic patients. The study will also investigate the effect of
      topiramate on body weight, body fat, fat distribution, and metabolic control including both
      glucose and lipid levels.

    <textblock>
      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This double-blind, placebo
      controlled study investigates the effect of topiramate on insulin sensitivity in overweight
      or obese patients with Type 2 Diabetes. After a screening phase, patients are randomized to
      receive either topiramate (96 milligrams[mg] twice daily) or placebo for 9 months in the
      double-blind phase. After 9 months, patients have the option to continue in the open-label
      phase and receive treatment with topiramate for 1 year. Patients in the placebo group then
      receive topiramate with dosage increasing gradually to 96 mg twice daily, with the option of
      increasing to 256 mg twice daily. Patients in the topiramate group continue with the
      maintenance dose received during the double-blind phase, with the option of increasing to 256
      mg twice daily. Assessments of effectiveness made monthly include insulin sensitivity, body
      composition (as measured by computed tomography [CT]), body weight and Body Mass Index (BMI),
      waist and hip circumferences, fasting lipid profile, fasting glucose and hemoglobin type A1c
      (HbA1c) levels, and blood pressure. Safety evaluations, including incidence of adverse
      events, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and electrocardiograms [ECGs]), are
      performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will improve insulin
      sensitivity in type 2 diabetic patients and will be well tolerated. Patients will be
      randomized to receive 192 mg/day (96mg twice daily) of topiramate, or placebo, per mouth for
      9 months, with an option of topiramate treatment increasing to 256mg/day both groups during
      the extension period of 1 year.
