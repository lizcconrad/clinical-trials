      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of galantamine treatment in
      patients with mild cognitive impairment.

      This is an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
      Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who are clinically at risk for development of
      Alzheimer's disease will be treated for 24 months with either placebo or galantamine
      hydrobromide. Memory and overall clinical improvement will be evaluated using the Alzheimer's
      Disease Assessment Scale with cognitive subscale adapted to MCI (ADAS-cog/MCI) and the
      Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of the Boxes (CDR-SB). Overall functional skills and the
      severity of dementia will be assessed with the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of the Boxes
      (CDR-SB) and the overall Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score. Additional assessments include
      the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) to measure attention. Safety will be assessed using
      adverse event reports, vital signs, laboratory parameters, physical examination, and
      electrocardiogram. The study hypothesis is that treatment with galantamine will be well
      tolerated and, compared with placebo, will significantly improve the signs and symptoms
      associated with mild cognitive impairment in patients who are considered likely to develop
      Alzheimer's disease. Galantamine hydrobromide immediate-release tablets (4, 8, or 12
      milligrams), taken by mouth 2 times daily: 8mg/day for 4 weeks, 16mg/day for 4 weeks, then
      increased to 24mg/day for the remainder of the 24-month trial. Doses may be reduced at
      investigator's discretion after 12 weeks.
