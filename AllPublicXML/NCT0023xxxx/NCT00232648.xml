      This study is as an extension study of SD-004-0765, to assess the safety profile of long-term
      use of budesonide inhalation suspension in Japanese young children with bronchial asthma.
      Children completing study SD-004-0765 continued administration of budesonide inhalation
      suspension as judged by the investigator; the dose is adjusted as appropriate within the
      range of 0.25 to 1.0 mg per day administered once or twice daily, according to the symptoms.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - 1. Clinical benefit from continued treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension was
        expected in patients with bronchial asthma participating in study SD-004-0765, as judged by
        the investigator(s) at the completion of that study (Visit 11, Week 24), and the patient's
        caregiver wished the continued treatment with budesonide inhalation suspension A written
        consent to participate in this study had been obtained from the patient's legal
        representative (a person who exercises parental authority for the patient, or if no one was
        applicable, a guardian: in principle, the patient's parent).

        3. The patient was younger than 5 years old. Patients aged 5 years could be included in
        this study if no other effective treatment for the patient's bronchial asthma was available
        as judged by the investigator(s).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        -1. Concurrent severe diseases of liver, kidney, heart or other complications. 2.
        Contra-indications (eg, known or suspected allergy) to budesonide or excipients contained
        in the investigational product.

        3. Other conditions, in which the investigator(s) judges patient's participation in this
        study inappropriate.
