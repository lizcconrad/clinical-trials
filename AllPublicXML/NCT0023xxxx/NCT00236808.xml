      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of levofloxacin to
      ciprofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis.

    <textblock>
      Prostatitis (an inflammation of the prostate) is the most common condition affecting the
      urinary system in men under 50 years of age. Symptoms of chronic (long-term) prostatitis may
      include urgency to urinate, frequency or difficulty in urinating or abdominal, pelvic, or
      rectal pain. A frequent cause of prostatitis is bacterial infection, treatable with
      antibiotics. This multicenter, double-blind study evaluates the safety and effectiveness of
      levofloxacin as compared to ciprofloxacin in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis.
      Patients receive treatment with either levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin for 28 days and are
      evaluated during treatment and 5-12 days after the last dose of study drug (posttherapy
      visit), and 1 month after the last dose (poststudy visit). Patients are contacted six months
      after the last dose to follow up on the potential recurrence of their prostatitis.
      Effectiveness is assessed by measuring the ability of the study drug to eliminate bacteria
      causing prostatitis and to reduce the signs and symptoms of chronic prostatitis. Laboratory
      tests for presence of bacteria are performed throughout the study and at each visit, patients
      are questioned as to the relief of their symptoms. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse
      events, physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The
      study hypothesis is that levofloxacin is at least as effective as ciprofloxacin in treating
      chronic bacterial prostatitis without any significant safety issues being observed.

      Levofloxacin 500 milligrams (mg) by mouth once daily or ciprofloxacin 500 mg by mouth twice
      daily for 28 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic prostatitis meeting all 3 of the following criteria: 1) clinical
             signs and symptoms of prostatitis including tender prostate and one or more of the
             following: difficulty in, frequency of, or urgency of urinating, retention of urine or
             hesitancy in urinating, decreased urinary stream, painful ejaculation, pelvic or low
             back pain, pain on examination, fever or chills

          -  2) history of chronic prostatitis defined as 1 previous episode lasting 4 weeks or 2
             or more episodes during the previous 12 months

          -  And 3) laboratory evidence of prostatitis

          -  Able to take oral medications

          -  Over-the-counter medications for chronic prostatitis are continued at the same dose
             during the study or are discontinued before study entry

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have taken an antibiotic similar to levofloxacin for any reason within the past 14
             days

          -  Have received any medication for more than 24 hours during the past 7 days that may be
             effective in treating prostatitis unless there is evidence of treatment failure after
             5 or more days of treatment with the other medication

          -  Have had certain surgeries during the past 6 months, including prostate surgery,
             surgical opening of the bladder or kidney or insertion of a permanent catheter (tube)
             for urination

          -  Taking any medications that may affect bladder or prostate
