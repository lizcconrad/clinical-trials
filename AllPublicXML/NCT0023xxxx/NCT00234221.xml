      This study will compare three alternative interventions in the emergency department (ED) to
      promote substance abuse assessment, referral, and treatment entry: 1) a 5 session
      strengths-based case management model (SBCM); 2) a 2-session motivational enhancement therapy
      (MET); or 3) a one-time brief informational feedback (BIF) session. The primary outcome
      variables for this trial include follow-through on receiving an assessment and referral, and
      treatment engagement. Additional outcomes include degree of treatment completion,
      alcohol-related measures, health service utilization, health status changes, and psychosocial
      factors.

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Strengths Based Case Management Model (SBCM) consists of 5 case-management sessions designed to promote linkage and engagement in assessment and treatment services, while assisting with the patient's perceived needs, as well as personal strengths and barriers to linkage and engagement.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET)</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The MET therapist will conduct 2 motivational enhancement sessions to work through the content of an educational workbook targeting the participant's alcohol use/abuse with the goal of negotiating a 'contract' to: 1) link to services, with the eventual goal of seeking and receiving specialized alcohol treatment; or 2) provide a strategy to self-monitor alcohol use, consider consequences, and later seek assessment.</description>
