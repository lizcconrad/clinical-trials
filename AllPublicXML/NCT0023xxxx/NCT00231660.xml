  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy (in terms of weight and hemoglobin type
      A1c [HbA1c]) and safety of topiramate (96 milligrams[mg] or 192 mg daily) with placebo in the
      treatment of obesity in Type 2 diabetic patients receiving metformin.

      Topiramate is not approved for the treatment of obesity. This double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate in Type
      2 diabetic patients with obesity who are well-controlled on metformin alone. Patients are
      randomized to receive either topiramate (up to a target dose of 96 or 192 mg per day) or
      placebo for one year. Assessments of efficacy include weight reduction, levels of HbA1c
      (shows average blood sugar level over a few months), Body Mass Index (BMI), and Health
      Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) measures. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events,
      vital signs, hypoglycemic events, electrocardiograms [ECGs], clinical laboratory values) are
      monitored throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate, combined with
      metformin and non-pharmacologic therapy, can effectively achieve significant weight reduction
      and is well tolerated. During the first 8 weeks, oral doses of matching placebo or topiramate
      are increased gradually to target dose (96 milligrams[mg] or 192mg daily); the dose will be
      maintained for 1 year, then gradually reduced and stopped
