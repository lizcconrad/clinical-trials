  <brief_title>Study of Enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium Maintenance Therapy in Patients With Renal Transplant Receiving Cyclosporine Microemulsion and Steroids,</brief_title>
  <official_title>Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium (EC-MPS) Administration in Maintenance Renal Transplant Patients Receiving Cyclosporine Microemulsion (CsA-ME) and Steroids, for the Withdrawal of Concomitant Steroid Therapy: a Prospective, Open-label, Exploratory Study</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if the addition of EC-MPS to CsA-ME allows the safe
      withdrawal of the concomitant corticosteroid therapy in long-term maintenance renal allograft
      recipients.

      All patients of the core study who are interested of being treated with EC-MPS will be
      included in an open-label extension study to collect further information on the long-term
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of this drug.

        Inclusion criteria

        1. Male or female, 18 years of age or older. 2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaver,
        living related or unrelated donor kidney transplant performed at least 6 month before
        screening (Visit 1) 3. Patients currently receiving CsA-ME and corticosteroids (at least 5
        mg of prednisone equivalents) for at least 3 months prior to Screening, with or without
        Mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine.

        4. Serum creatinine levels &lt; 2.3 mg/dL (=204 Âµmol/L) at screening and at baseline 5. Stable
        kidney function, i.e. increase in serum creatinine less than 20% in the last 3 months
        before screening and at baseline (baseline value as compared to the value obtained at
        screening) Exclusion Criteria

          1. Multi-organ recipients (e.g., kidney and pancreas, double kidneys) or previous
             transplant with any other organ different from kidney

          2. Patients whit a second transplant who rejected the first one for immunological reasons
             or because of the relapse of the autoimmune disease which leaded to the end-stage
             renal failure

          3. Histological evidence of acute rejection or treatment for acute rejection within the
             three months prior to Screening, or histological signs or clinical signs of chronic
             rejection (as significant proteinuria, i.e. &gt; 300 mg/24 hours.

          4. Patients with maintenance steroid therapy for other diseases (i.e. autoimmune
             diseases, Lupus).

          5. Patients with any known hypersensitivity to EC-MPS or other components of the
             formulation (e.g., lactose)

          6. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of
             &lt;1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia (&lt;4,000/mm3), and/or anemia (hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g/dL)
             prior to Screening visit.

          7. Patients who have received an investigational drug within two weeks prior to Screening
             visit.

          8. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          9. Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are
             pregnant and/or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception

         10. Presence of clinically significant infection requiring continued therapy, severe
             diarrhea, active peptic ulcer disease, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that would
             interfere with the appropriate conduct of the study.

         11. Any changes of immunosuppressive regimen due to graft malfunction, or any known
             clinically significant physical and/or laboratory changes in the 2 months prior to
             Screening visit.

         12. Known positivity for HIV, HBsAg

         13. Active viral hepatitis, as shown by liver function tests (AST or ALT) higher than
             twice the upper limit of normality

         14. Evidence of drug and/or alcohol abuse Other inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply
