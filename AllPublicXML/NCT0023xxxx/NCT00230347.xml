      This study is intended to establish the practicality of treating cancer in the liver with
      precisely administered single fractions of high-energy radiation using a radiosurgical
      (cross-firing) technique. A second purpose is to establish a safe dose for such therapy.
      Finally, the efficacy of radiosurgical ablation of liver tumors, in terms of radiographic
      response, will be measured.

        Inclusion Criteria:All the following criteria must be met:

          -  Liver tumors not to exceed 5 cm in diameter. If this size can be increased at all,
             that would be beneficial as many liver lesions present at a larger size given the lack
             of symptoms until they are larger and adequate hepatic function with albumin &gt;3.0,
             total bilirubin &lt;3, INR 1.8. In the case of patients with known or 7 Dose Escalation
             Study Evaluating Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Liver Malignancies suspected cirrhosis,
             patients must have creatinine &lt;1.5 and cannot have uncontrolled ascites,
             encephalopathy, active or recent gastrointestinal bleed (GIB).

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Histologically confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic
             cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC), or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast/colon.
             Metastatic tumors of other histologic types or sites of origin may be included if the
             patients have a life expectancy of 6 months or greater. In the case of suspected HCC
             in patients with known cirrhosis, noninvasive criteria recommended by the European
             Association for the Study of Liver Diseases may be used. Hypervascular lesions &gt; 2cm
             with alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) &gt; 400ng/mL or hypervascular lesions &gt;2cm on at least 2
             imaging studies.

          -  Unresectable disease as determined by a surgeon

          -  Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0,1 or 2

          -  No chemotherapy within 1 month of registration

          -  No prior radiotherapy to the liver or upper abdominal area

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months

          -  Patients with IHCC or HCC with distant metastasis are not eligible for this study.

          -  For colon cancer patients with metastatic tumor of the liver who are not amenable to
             surgical resection due to the efficacy of removal of simultaneous lung and liver
             metastasis.

        Exclusion Criteria:- Children are excluded because HCC, IHCC, and hepatic metastases rarely
        occur in this age group. Furthermore, treatment requires a great deal of patient
        cooperation including the ability to lie still for several hours in an isolated room.

        - No laboratory personnel will be included.
