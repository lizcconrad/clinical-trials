      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil and cisplatin, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving drugs directly into the arteries around the tumor may kill more tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. It is not yet known
      whether surgery and hepatic arterial chemotherapy are more effective than surgery alone in
      treating patients with liver cancer that has spread to the portal vein.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying surgery and hepatic arterial
      chemotherapy to see how well they work compared to surgery alone in treating patients with
      liver cancer that has spread to the portal vein.

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Compare the efficacy of surgical resection with vs without postoperative hepatic
           arterial chemotherapy in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and portal vein tumor
           thrombus.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to grade
      of portal invasion and Child-Pugh classification. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo macroscopic curative resection. Within 28 days after surgery,
           patients without post-surgery complications undergo hepatic arterial infusion comprising
           fluorouracil and cisplatin on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19. Treatment continues for 6
           months.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo macroscopic curative resection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
