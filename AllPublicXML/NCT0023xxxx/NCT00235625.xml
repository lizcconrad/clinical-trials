      Turmeric (Curcuma Longa) is member of the ginger family and is best known for its culinary
      use as the major of component of curry powder. The volatile of oils (called curcuminoids) of
      the turmeric root, however, have anti-inflammatory actions which make them promising
      candidates for the treatment of psoriasis. For example, curcumin has been shown to improve
      psoriasis in experiments using in vitro models. Turmeric has been shown to have minimal side
      effects in doses up to 12 grams per day. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety
      and to estimate the efficacy of oral Curcuminoid C3 Complex® in patients with chronic
      psoriasis vulgaris.

             psoriasis therapies.

          -  Psoriasis must cover at least 6% of subject's body surface area and lesions must have
             moderate plaque thickness

          -  Subjects must be willing to and have the capacity for giving written informed consent

             female subjects must consent to a urine pregnancy test at screening and at start of
             study, which must be negative at both time points. Male subjects who are sexually
             active with female partners and are capable of fertilization must ensure that their
             female partners will either be postmenopausal, surgically incapable of childbearing,
             or will use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the entire study
             period

        and UVB therapy for psoriasis (not including non-medicated emollients or shampoos) within
        14 days prior to day 0 or at any time during the study period. •Subjects, who have received
        an experimental drug, used any experimental medical devise within 30 days prior to
        screening •Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities •Subjects with significant
        medical comorbidities •Subjects for whom the dose of the following medications has changed
