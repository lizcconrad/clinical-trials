    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and safety of the sirolimus-coated
      Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent in treating patients with true bifurcation lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized study that will be conducted at up to 5 centers in Europe
      and the US. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with the
      sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent and Stent Delivery System (SDS). As a
      secondary objective, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one stent in the
      main branch with balloon angioplasty by a kissing balloon technique in the side branch
      (stent/PTCA group), or to receive stents in both the main and side branches (stent/stent
      group). It is anticipated that up to 70% of the patients enrolled in the stent/PTCA group
      will be considered treatment failures and require a stent in the side branch. These patients
      will have a sirolimus-coated stent placed in the side branch and will be followed per the
      protocol, but will be analyzed separately. Therefore, it is anticipated that up to 75
      patients will be enrolled in the trial. All patients will have repeat angiography at six
      months, with clinical follow-up to 5 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Has a diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II) OR has documented silent ischemia;

          2. Involves a single treatment of a de novo bifurcation lesion in native coronary
             arteries of patients with single or multivessel disease; patients with multiple
             lesions can be included only if other lesions treated during the index procedure are
             successfully treated prior to the treatment of the bifurcation lesion;

          3. Has a true bifurcation lesion defined as stenosis &gt; 50% in both the main branch and
             the ostium of the side branch;

          4. Has a main branch vessel that is &lt;=2.5 mm and &lt;=3.5 mm in diameter by on-line QCA
             proximal to the bifurcation;

          5. Has a side branch vessel that is &lt;=2.5 mm and &lt;=3.5 mm in diameter by on-line QCA.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             elevation of CK levels &gt; 2 times normal or CK-MB levels &gt; 3 times normal within the
             preceding 24 hours and/or the CK and CK-MB enzymes remain above normal at the time of
             treatment;

          2. Has unstable angina classified as Braunwald A I-III, or III B or C, or is having a
             peri infarction;

          3. Has a bifurcation lesion in a non protected left main;

          4. Has an ejection fraction &lt;=35%;

          5. There is presence of thrombus in the bifurcation lesion;
