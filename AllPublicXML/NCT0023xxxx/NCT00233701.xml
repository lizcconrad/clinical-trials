  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the registry is to develop a longitudinal, observational database that is
      focused on adult patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) that can be used as a
      source of clinical information for individual surgeons, as well as a national data repository
      for scientific inquiry and publications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, observational database to collect data on the
      characteristics, management practices, and patient outcomes of NPH patients. It will be
      offered to a geographically representative group of U.S. physicians who will enroll NPH
      patients. The physician makes his/her own clinical decisions; thus, the data captured
      provides current practice patterns related to diagnosis, management, and results. The
      registry may also assist physicians in patient follow-up and certain practice management
      tasks. The data collected will serve to inform the medical community on optimal care for this
      patient population
