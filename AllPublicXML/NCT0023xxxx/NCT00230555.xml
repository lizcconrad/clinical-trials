      The purpose of the MOM Program is to promote child development by helping families become
      more competent in accessing and using available resources. The program focuses are childhood
      immunizations, Early Intervention services, lead screening, Early Head Start and Head Start
      enrollment. The hypothsis is that children receiving the intervention will participate in
      more of the public services and primary healthcare activities which have been shown to be
      effective in improving their development.

      The MOM Program is a 3 year randomized controlled trial of mothers and newborns. At
      enrollment subjects are given a questionnaire to assess self efficacy and a non-verbal test
      of intelligence. Program personnel are blind to the results of this testing. Test results
      will be used in data analysis at the end of the study to compare outcomes of the intervention
      and control groups and to assess how mothers with impaired cognitive ability have benefited
      from participation in the study.The Intervention consists of frequent phone calls and home
      visits to encourage mothers to have their babies immunized on schedule and to participate in
      needed developmental and educational services. At 33 months of age all children receive a
      developmental assessment.
