  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy has a well-established role in the treatment of Hodgkin's Disease and
      non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. With technological developments, 3-D Dimensional (3D) planning has
      evolved as a highly precise treatment planning option. High-precision radiation therapy has
      the potential for more accurate dose delivery to the tumour volume and can result in a
      greater sparing of normal tissue. An important component of safe radiotherapy delivery is the
      feasibility and reproducibility of current and new immobilization devices for highly
      conformal treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the reproducibility of an immobilization device
      known as BodyFIX(TM) using conventional treatment techniques.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients undergoing curative or palliative treatment in whom it is considered that
             immobilization of part or all of an anatomical region would be of benefit to their
             care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any case where ideal treatment may be compromised with use of immobilization method.

          -  If the patient has any social issues, language barriers resulting in difficulties
             comprehending the nature of the study, or poor performance status, that could
             compromise compliance with the study guidelines.
