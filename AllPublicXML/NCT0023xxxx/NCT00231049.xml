    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, sequential, dose-escalating study of three dose cohorts
      of AG-707. Individuals who meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for eligibility
      will be randomized to receive either AG-707 (at the 80 µg dose), AG-707 with QS-21 (at the 80
      µg dose), placebo, or QS-21. Each patient will be monitored for safety as specified in the
      protocol.

      Primary Objective:

      Determine the overall safety profile of three different dose levels of AG-707 vaccination
      (with and without an adjuvant, QS-21) at 80, 240 and 400 µg compared to placebo and QS-21
      alone in HSV-2 seropositive adults.

      Secondary Objective:

      Determine immune response to AG-707 vaccination (with and without QS-21) at dose cohorts of
      80, 240, and 400 µg as compared to placebo and QS-21 alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be seropositive for HSV-2 (+/- HSV-1) and have a documented history of
             clinically active genital herpes (at least one prior outbreak).

          -  Patients must be seronegative for HIV.

          -  Patients must be seronegative for hepatitis B and C

          -  Have baseline chemistry and hematology (hemoglobin, white blood cell (WBC), absolute
             neutrophil count (ANC), eosinophils) within normal limits; prothrombin time (PT) and
             partial thromboplastin time (PTT) below the upper limit of normal (ULN), and platelets
             above the lower limit of normal (LLN). Basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes must be
             within 1.2 x ULN or 0.8 x LLN and considered not clinically significant by the
             investigator. Total creatine phosphokinase (CPK) laboratory values &lt; 1.25X the upper
             limit of normal (according to the normal reference ranges of the Central Laboratory)
             at baseline (Screening and Pre-Study Visit) and considered not clinically significant
             by the Investigator.

          -  Patients must not be taking antiviral therapy.

          -  Must be between the ages of 18 and 50 years of age and willing to either use an
             effective method of contraception or abstain from sexual activity for the 28-week
             duration of the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe active infection, compromised cardiopulmonary function, or other serious
             medical illness that, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator, would prevent
             study completion.

          -  History of HSV infection of the eye (herpes simplex interstitial keratitis or
             uveitis), or herpes-associated erythema multiforme.

          -  History of immune suppression or autoimmune disorder.

          -  Concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications
             (including nasal and inhaled steroids). The use of nasal steroids for seasonal
             rhinitis is acceptable.

          -  Patients with known hypersensitivity or allergies to acyclovir or valacyclovir.
