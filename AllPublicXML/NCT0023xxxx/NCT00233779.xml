      The objective of this study is to assess the performance and safety of a sirolimus-eluting,
      heparin-coated, cobalt chromium balloon-expandable stent (Small Vessel Stent) in patients
      with de novo native coronary artery lesions in small vessels as compared to historical data
      from small vessel patients in the RAVEL trial receiving the Sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITYâ„¢
      stent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be minimum 18 years of age;

          2. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

        3 Treatment of one lesion in a native coronary artery. The treated lesion will be the one
        with the highest % diameter stenosis by visual estimate. Additional study stents may be
        used for procedural complications such as dissections. Multivessel treatment is permissible
        in non-target vessels; however, additional lesions may only be treated with commercial
        stents. If other non-target vessels are treated with commercial stents during the index
        procedure, they must be successfully treated prior to the study lesion;

        4. The target lesion is &gt;/=2.0 mm and &lt;/=2.5mm in diameter (visual estimate);

        5. The target lesion can be covered with a single 18mm stent;

        6. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (TIMI I) (visual estimate);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             total CK&gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CK-MB enzymes
             remain above normal at the time of treatment;

          2. Target lesion is due to in-stent restenosis;

          3. Ejection fraction 30%;

          4. Totally occluded vessel (TIMI 0 level);

          5. Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL);
