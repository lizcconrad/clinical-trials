      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of two antibiotic
      regimens in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in non-hospitalized adult patients.
      A 5-day course of 750 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily will be compared to a
      10-day course 500 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily.

      Levofloxacin is an antibiotic that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of sinusitis,
      chronic bronchitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and community-acquired
      pneumonia. This multicenter, double-blind (neither the patient nor the study doctor will know
      the dose of levofloxacin being administered) study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of
      two antibiotic regimens in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in adult patients. A
      5-day course of 750 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily will be compared to a 10-day
      course 500 milligrams of levofloxacin given once daily. Patients receive levofloxacin by
      mouth or through a vein depending on the severity of their pneumonia. Patients are assessed
      after 3 days of treatment; treatment is discontinued if no significant improvement is noted.
      Patients showing signs of improvement continue in the study, with assessments on study days
      12-16, and 17-21 (posttherapy visits), and 31-38 (poststudy visit). Effectiveness is assessed
      by measuring the ability of the study drug to eliminate bacteria causing pneumonia and to
      reduce the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Chest x-rays and laboratory tests for presence of
      bacteria are performed during the study. Safety evaluations (incidence of adverse events,
      physical examinations, laboratory tests) are performed throughout the study. The study
      hypothesis is that levofloxacin administered at a higher dose for a shorter duration is at
      least as effective as levofloxacin administered at a lower dose for a longer duration in the
      treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and is generally well-tolerated.

      Levofloxacin, 500 milligrams (mg) by mouth or through vein daily for 10 days or 750 mg by
      mouth or slowly through a vein daily for 5 days

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia as follows: clinical signs and symptoms of a
             lower respiratory tract infection and chest-x-ray findings consistent with pneumonia
             within 24 hours before entry into the study

          -  At least one of the following: abnormal temperature (high or low) or abnormal white
             blood cell count

          -  Previous antibiotic treatment &lt;= 24 hours or, if the duration of treatment was &gt;= 72
             hours and that therapy failed based on at least 2 of the following: fever within 12
             hours of entry into the study, chest x-ray findings have worsened compared to the
             initial chest-x-ray, white blood cell count is significantly increased, respiratory
             rate higher than at the start of treatment and &gt;= 20 breaths per minute or need for
             supplemental oxygen if not previously needed

          -  Patients whose infection is acquired in the community or, if in a nursing home, who
             had been living there &lt; 14 days

          -  Fine Class (rating scale used to assess patients' overall condition which includes
             information such as age, gender, other diseases, physical examination and laboratory
             findings) score &lt;= 130 upon admission (patients with Fine Class scores &gt; 70 but &lt; =
             130 must initially be hospitalized

          -  Patients with scores of &lt;= 70 may be treated as outpatients or hospitalized at the
             discretion of the investigator)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pneumonia known or suspected to be due to a bacteria resistant to levofloxacin

          -  Previous allergic or serious reaction to or failed therapy with levofloxacin or
             similar drugs

          -  Life expectancy &lt; 72 hours

          -  Hospitalized within 2 weeks before entry in the study or within 1 month before entry
             in the study if treated with antibiotics

          -  Pneumonia acquired in a hospital
