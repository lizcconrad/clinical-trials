      To study the efficacy of multicomponent treatment and care for patients with acute illness or

    <textblock>
      Managers at St. Olavs University Hospital and the City of Trondheim local authority decided
      in 2001 to establish a reinforced department at a nursing home with a multicomponent approach
      to patient treatment.

      In the study treatment at a nursing home will be compared with conventional treatment in
      ordinary hospital beds in medical, surgical and orthopedic departments at a hospital.
      Participating doctors at the hospital together with general practitioners shall develope
      inclusion criteria through Delphi technique. Eligible participants will be hospitalized from
      their ordinary home and expected to return to home after treatment. When an eligible patient
      is identified and accepted for inclusion, randomization will be performed by the Clinical
      Research Department at the Faculty of Medicine.
