      The purpose of the study is to check wether training mixed teams of physicians and nurses
      from intensive care units on patient simulators reduces stress in team members.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient safety and the prevention of medical error are primary goals of healthcare
      organizations. Stress reduction may reduce or ameliorate such errors. Simulation training,
      using advanced patient simulators, has been shown to improve diagnostic, resuscitation and
      technical skills amongst physicians and nurses.We intend to check wether stress during ICU
      shifts may be reduced by using specifically designed scenarios based on real life
      experience,in integrative multidisciplinary ICU teams.
