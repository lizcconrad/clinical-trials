  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Delivery of conformal radiation therapy following radical prostatectomy is limited by the
      inability to define the clinical target volume (CTV). This stems from a poor understanding of
      patterns of local recurrence and limitations of standard imaging techniques.Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising modality for imaging the prostatic bed following
      radical prostatectomy. MRI provides more detailed postoperative anatomy to guide CTV
      delineation, the ability to document local recurrence patterns, and a method to assess
      intrafraction prostatic bed motion and deformity to define appropriate planning target volume
      margins. The aim of this pilot study is to develop a technique for external beam radiation
      therapy (EBRT) following radical prostatectomy based on MRI-delineation of the CTV. Twenty
      patients will be enrolled in this pilot, development phase.
