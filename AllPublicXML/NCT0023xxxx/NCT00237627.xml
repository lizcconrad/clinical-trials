      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome, work in
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping
      them from dividing. Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome together with
      bortezomib may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of bortezomib when
      given together with doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome and to see how well they work in
      treating patients with refractory hematologic cancer or malignant solid tumor or metastatic
      breast cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when administered with pegylated
           doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome in patients with refractory hematologic or solid
           tumor malignancies. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I [closed
           to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with this
           regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response in patients with hematologic or solid tumor malignancies treated
           with this regimen. (Phase I [closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007])

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients with metastatic breast cancer
           treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Obtain further evidence of the safety of this regimen in patients with metastatic breast
           cancer. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I (closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007), dose-escalation study of
      bortezomib followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 10/15/2007): Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1,
           4, 8, and 11 and pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV over 1 hour on day 4.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive bortezomib (at the maximum tolerated dose determined in phase
           I) and pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome as in phase I.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 1 week.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of the
      study and 40 for the phase II portion.
