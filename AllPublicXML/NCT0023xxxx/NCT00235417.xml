      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intracoronary bone marrow transplantation
      can improve left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with severe ischemic heart failure
      and no other option for standard therapies (revascularization and drugs).

      Despite standard therapies (revascularization and drugs), patients with severe ischemic heart
      failure have a high morbidity and mortality.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether intracoronary transfer of autologous bone
      marrow cells can induce angiogenesis, subsequently improving regional myocardial perfusion,
      and finally resulting in improved systolic and diastolic left ventricular function in
      patients with severe ischemic heart failure.

      35 patients with stable left ventricle function will - with four months interval - receive
      two treatments with bone marrow transplantation intracoronary in vessels supplying
      dysfunctional myocardial territories. Echocardiography is performed three times prior (four
      and two months and just before) and two times after (four and eight months after) therapy. It
      is a non-randomised trial, patients will enter as their own control.
