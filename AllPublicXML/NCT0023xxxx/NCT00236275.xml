  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Predict and follow thanks to imaging the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in locally
      advanced breast carcinoma. Hypothesis : FLT-(18F)PET will be a predictor superior to both
      FDG-(18F) PET and MRI
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PET/CT with FDG-(18F) and FLT-(18F) and MRI are performed at the initial staging, 3 times
      during sequential adjuvant chemotherapy and prior to surgery, aiming to find the most
      efficient modality to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy of the primary breast
      cancer and its possible lymph node metastases. Post-surgical histology and a 6 month
      follow-up (to detect occult metastases) will constitute the standard of truth for
      determination and comparison of diagnostic performances.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Breast cancer scheduled for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Indicated chemotherapy without that a curative tumorectomies is foreseen(planned)

          -  Patient presenting an evolutionary infectious or inflammatory pathology, including an
             inflammatory breast cancer, being able to be source(spring) of false-positive
             results(profits) in TEP-FDG

          -  Patient in the course of radiotherapy or of chemotherapy or operated at the level of
             the thorax in 4 weeks preceding the date foreseen(planned) by the examination TEP
             (pose(installation) of implantable room(chamber) excludes)

          -  Diabetic waits

          -  Patient already includes in the other protocols of search(research) for Nuclear
             Medicine or for imaging using ionization radiations

          -  Patient not having given her lit(enlightened) assent

          -  Wait among which the surveillance TEP or the MRI during the chemotherapy will be
             impossible (that is by geographical or professional imperative, or if contraindication
             in the MRI, ex: port(bearing) of a pacemaker, cochlear magnetic implants, metal
             foreign bodies cf protocol)

          -  Of less than 18 years old or pregnant patient.
