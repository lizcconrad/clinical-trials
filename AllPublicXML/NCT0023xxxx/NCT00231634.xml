  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of topiramate with
      placebo in the treatment of obesity and Type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients who have failed
      on sulfonylurea therapy.

    <textblock>
      Topiramate is a medication for the treatment of seizures, but not approved for the treatment
      of obesity. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of topiramate in Type 2 diabetic patients with obesity who have
      failed on treatment with sulfonylurea. After a 4-week enrollment phase and 8-week titration
      phase, patients receive either topiramate (96, 192, or 256 mg twice daily) or placebo for 44
      weeks, followed by a 6-week follow-up phase. Assessments of effectiveness include body
      weight, hemoglobin type A1c [HbA1c] (a measurement of average blood sugar level over several
      months), Body Mass Index (BMI), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level, fasting lipid profile,
      fasting insulin, uric acid level, blood pressures, and health related quality of life (HRQOL)
      measures. Safety evaluations, including incidence and severity of adverse events,
      hypoglycemic episodes, clinical laboratory results such as the liver enzymes, and vital
      signs, are performed throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that topiramate will be
      effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes through weight reduction. During the initial
      8-weeks, oral doses taken twice daily of topiramate or placebo will be gradually increased to
      target doses (either 96 milligrams[mg], 192mg, or 256mg daily); the dose will be maintained
      for 44 weeks.
