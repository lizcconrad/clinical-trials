          -  Subjects with ≤ 7 days of signs and symptoms of CAP.

          -  Subjects with chest x-ray findings that support a diagnosis of acute pneumonia with
             presence of a new infiltrate. For subjects with history of chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD), a comparison to previous chest x-ray report is required to
             confirm the finding of new infiltrates.

        Subjects with diagnosis of acute mild to moderate CAP based on at least one of the
        following:

          -  fever (oral &gt;37.5°C/99.5°F or axillary &gt;37.4°C/99.4°F or rectal &gt;38.5°C/101.5°F) or

          -  elevated total peripheral white blood cell count &gt;10,000/mm3 or &gt;15% immature
             neutrophils (bands), regardless of total peripheral white count and

          -  new and sudden onset (equal or less than 48 hours) of at least two of the following
             signs or symptoms:

               -  cough

               -  dyspnea or tachypnea (particularly if progressive in nature)

               -  pleuritic chest pain

               -  purulent sputum production or change in sputum character

               -  auscultatory findings (such as rales and/or evidence of pulmonary consolidation)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study.

               -  Subjects with CAP requiring hospitalization.

               -  Subjects with signs and symptoms of severe CAP lasting greater than 7 days.

               -  Subjects requiring parenteral antibiotic treatment.

               -  Subjects discharged from hospital within the 10 days before study entry.

               -  Subjects with visible/gross aspiration pneumonia.

               -  Subjects with any concomitant pulmonary disease, condition or complication that
                  could confound the interpretation or evaluation of drug efficacy or safety,
                  including:

          -  severe bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis or suspected active pulmonary tuberculosis

          -  suspected acute pulmonary embolism

               -  Subjects with neoplastic lung disease (lung cancer) or another malignancy
                  metastatic to the lungs, and/or requiring chemotherapeutic interventions for this
                  or other neoplasms.

               -  Subjects with infection requiring administration of other systemic antimicrobial
                  agents.
