  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of a four-week trial of CX516 900mg tid
      compared to placebo upon verbal memory, attention and negative symptoms. The AMPA receptor
      positive modulator, CX516, will be added to a stable dose of clozapine, olanzapine or
      risperidone in inpatients and outpatients with schizophrenia. The trial is intended to extend
      and replicate results from our previous placebo-controlled pilot trial of CX516 added to
      clozapine in which the investigators found improvement in memory and attention
      (moderate-to-large between group effect sizes) and did not observe serious side effects.
      Because the investigators' pilot trial also detected at two-week follow-up persistence of
      cognitive benefits and emergence of a large therapeutic effect upon negative symptoms, this
      trial will also repeat clinical and cognitive assessments at follow-up, four weeks after
      completion of the study medication to evaluate persistence and/or strengthening of effects.
