  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is the 5th leading cause of death among women. Long-term
      survival is poor for the majority of women with EOC because many present with advanced
      disease. Chemotherapy and cytoreductive surgery produces a 50% - 60% response rate but
      relapse is not uncommon. Adding more systemic agents has failed to show a clear benefit in
      survival and is associated with unacceptable toxicity. This phase II, dose-finding, open
      label trial will enrol women with newly diagnosed EOC and randomize them to receive one of 3
      doses of a LMWH dalteparin in conjunction with standard adjuvant taxane- and platinum-based
      chemotherapy. The primary outcome is disease response, measured according to Gynaecologic
      Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) Cancer Antigen (CA)-125 response criteria. Secondary outcomes
      include symptomatic venous thromboembolism, bleeding, and compliance. The dose of dalteparin
      associated with the best response will be tested further in a phase III randomized clinical
      trial in the same patient population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must meet all of the following criteria to be considered for enrolment:

          -  Women with newly diagnosed, histologically proven EOC are potentially eligible.
             Patients with primary peritoneal or fallopian tube tumours of equivalent histology are
             also considered for enrolment. If open or true cut biopsy is not available, fine
             needle aspiration (FNA) showing an adenocarcinoma is considered diagnostic for EOC if
             all 4 (a to d) of the following conditions are satisfied:

               1. Patient has a pelvic mass, AND

               2. Any evidence of disease larger than 1 cm in the upper abdomen (unless proven
                  stage IV), AND

               3. Normal mammography within 6 weeks of randomization, AND

               4. Serum CA-125/CEA greater than or equal to 25. If the ratio is less than 25, a
                  barium enema (or colonoscopy) and gastroscopy (or radiological examination of the
                  stomach) must be negative for a primary tumour.

          -  Between the ages of 18 and 75.

          -  FIGO stage IIB to IV disease.

          -  A pre-study CA-125 level at least twice the upper limit of normal.

          -  Eligible for standard adjuvant treatment with taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy
             by meeting all of the following laboratory findings within 7 days prior to
             randomization:

               1. Absolute granulocyte count of at least 1.5 x 10 9/L (1500 per cubic millimetre).

               2. Platelet count of at least 150 x 109/L (100,000 per cubic millimetre).

               3. Serum creatinine no greater than 177 micromol/L (2.0 mg/dL).

               4. Total bilirubin level no greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal at the
                  local centre.

               5. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and
                  alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels no greater than 3 times the upper limit of
                  normal of the local centre.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Borderline ovarian tumours.

          -  Received prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy for EOC.

          -  Received mouse antibodies anytime during the 28 days prior to the pre-study CA-125
             level.

          -  History of another malignancy, unless disease-free for 5 years or greater;
             non-melanomatous skin carcinoma or curatively treated carcinoma-in-situ of the cervix
             are excepted.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 3 or 4.

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 weeks.

          -  Complete bowel obstruction at the time of study enrolment.

             fibrillation, mechanical heart valves).

          -  Bleeding diathesis (e.g., evidence of DIC, hereditary or acquired bleeding disorder).

          -  History of allergy to any heparin (e.g., heparin-induced thrombocytopenia).

          -  Significant cardiac history including myocardial infarction within preceding 6 months,
             congestive heart failure, clinically relevant atrial or ventricular arrhythmias,

                  to taxanes or platinum analogues.

               2. Significant neurologic or psychiatric disorder that would impair obtaining
                  informed consent and reliable follow-up.

               3. Uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical therapy.

               4. Active, uncontrolled infection.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating or are of childbearing potential but are not using
