        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients were eligible for inclusion if they met all of the following criteria:

          -  Male or female aged 18 or older (prior to Amendment 1: more than 2 years old)

          -  Non-immune patients suffering from acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria, or mixed
             infection including P. falciparum, with parasitemia of less than or equal to 2%
             asexual P.falciparum parasites, confirmed by microscopy using Giemsa-stained thick
             film.

          -  Non-immune patients were regarded as those who had not spent the first five years of
             their life, nor the last five years in a malaria endemic area, and did not have acute
             P. falciparum malaria diagnosed during those past five years.

          -  Non-immune patients who had received prophylaxis with anti-malarials (excluding
             halofantrine) were included only if clear progression of acute P. falciparum infection
             was documented.

          -  Female patients were eligible to participate in the study if they were of
             non-childbearing potential or had a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) at
             screening, and using an acceptable contraceptive method

          -  Patients, who had been informed of the study procedures and medication, and had given
             written informed consent and were willing to comply with the study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were to be excluded from participation if they met any of the following
             criteria:

               -  Known hypersensitivity to artemether or lumefantrine

               -  Signs/symptoms indicative of severe/complicated malaria according to the WHO
                  classification (e.g. cerebral malaria, see Post-text supplement 1)

               -  Treatment with artemisinin derivatives within the previous 7 days

               -  Concurrent administration of other treatment / prophylaxis for malaria

               -  Concurrent administration of medications with potential hemolytic effects

               -  Patients taking any drug metabolized by cytochrome isoenzymes CYP3A4 or CYP2D6

               -  Received any other investigational drugs in the last 4 weeks before entry into
                  the study

               -  Severe cardiac impairment (i.e. evidence of existing cardiac conduction defect or
                  overt symptoms of cardiac dysfunction or abnormalities of baseline ECG not
                  associated with acute malaria); clinically relevant bradycardia or congestive
                  cardiac failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction; pre-existing
                  prolongation of the QT interval; history of symptomatic cardiac arrhythmias

               -  Having received halofantrine or any other drug known to influence cardiac
                  function within 4 weeks prior to Screening visit or taking other drugs that are
                  known to prolong the QT interval, including class IA and III antiarrhythmics,
                  neuroleptics, antidepressive agents, certain antibiotics (including some
                  macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole, and triazole antifungal agents), certain
                  non-sedating antihistaminics (terfenadine, astemizole) and cisapride

               -  History of splenectomy

               -  Clinically significant abnormal baseline hematology (not associated with acute
                  malaria) or clinical chemistry parameters, including evidence of hepatic or renal
                  impairment, known disturbances of electrolyte balance e.g. hypokalemia or
                  hypomagnesaemia

               -  Serious, uncontrolled disease (including serious psychological disorders) likely
                  to interfere with the study, or concomitant disease which could mask the response
                  to treatment

               -  Unlikely, in the opinion of the investigator, to complete the dosing or follow-up
                  periods, or who have evidence of alcohol, drug or solvent abuse.

               -  Women who are pregnant, lactating or of childbearing potential and not using an
                  acceptable contraceptive method were also excluded.
