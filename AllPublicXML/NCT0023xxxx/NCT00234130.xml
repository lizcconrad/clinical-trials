  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether a new form of home hemodialysis carried out at night during
      sleep reduces blood levels of hormone-like substances called cytokines that may cause fatigue
      and increase blood fats and sugar. Participants will stay twice in the Rockefeller Hospital
      and receive a standard diet and blood testing. Training for nocturnal hemodialysis will be
      provided at the nearby Manhattan Dialysis Center of The Rogosin Institute, affiliated with
      The Rockefeller University.

      Patients treated with conventional hemodialysis for at least 3 months and interested in
      learning home nocturnal hemodialysis will be screened in the Rockefeller Outpatient Research
      Center. If eligible, during the first 8 day hospital stay, participants will receive a
      standard diet and dialysis treatment nearby at the Rogosin Institute Dialysis Center. During
      the last 2 days, their blood will be frequently sampled for cytokines, fats and sugar.
      Dialysate will also be sampled. They will have the same diet and tests repeated during a
      second admission after either 4 months of conventional dialysis or 1 month training for
      nocturnal dialysis followed by 3 months of home nocturnal dialysis (randomized 1:1). After
      the second admission, patients treated with conventional dialysis will be discharged from the
      study and trained in nocturnal hemodialysis. Off-site computer monitoring will be utilized
      when patients dialyze themselves at home or during the admission in The Rockefeller
      University Hospital.
