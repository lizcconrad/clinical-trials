      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a brief motivational intervention for
      alcohol use in incarcerated women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hazardous alcohol use continues to be a problem of major significance throughout the United
      States. Alcohol use is a prevalent condition that independently acts as an important
      behavioral cofactor for HIV infection in women, contributing to both sexual and drug risk.
      The rationale for a brief intervention with incarcerated women who hazardously use alcohol
      and have HIV risk behaviors is compelling. For such women, we believe that the negative
      effects of drinking may be increased. An intervention that successfully connects alcohol use
      with HIV risk behaviors may be sufficient to tip the decisional balance in favor of reducing
      risk-prone alcohol consumption. If alcohol consumption is reduced more generally in a
      person's life, this may improve judgment in pursuing behaviors which risk other negative
      consequences. Hazardous alcohol, and high-risk drug and sexual activities may be
      manifestations of a general behavior pattern among incarcerated women, and strategies that
      engage such individuals are needed. Given the strong association between hazardous alcohol
      use and high HIV risk sexual and drug activities, interventions that attempt to lower the
      prevalence of HIV drug and sexual risk activities by lowering alcohol consumption are well
      justified. Brief alcohol interventions have been efficacious in reducing alcohol use across
      many populations over the past decade.

      Comparison(s): Participants are assigned, in this 6 month study, to an assessment-only
      condition or an assessment plus motivational interview condition. Two motivational interview
      sessions are conducted during the first month of study participation.
