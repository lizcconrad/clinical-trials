  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia leads to increased morbidity and mortality. Heat loss mainly occurs during
      anesthesia and surgery. Therefore prevention of hypothermia in pediatric patients undergoing
      general anesthesia is very important. However, there is very little information about
      effectiveness of various insulating materials used in the operating room.

      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of cotton and plastic for prevent intraoperative
      hypothermia in pediatric patients.

      A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 42 pediatric patients (age 1 month-3 years,
      ASA physical status 1-2) who were scheduled for elective maxillofacial or genitourinary
      surgery. The patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups. The patientâ€™s arms, legs and
      bodies were wrapped with either plastic (study group) or cotton (control group). All patients
      received standard general anesthesia with endotracheal tube and control ventilation with a
      fresh gas flow at 1 l/min. The core temperature (rectal temperature) was recorded every 10
      minutes for 60 minutes.
