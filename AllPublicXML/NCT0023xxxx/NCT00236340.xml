  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the efficiency and maternal and fetal tolerance of two techniques of
      amnioreduction used in cases of symptomatic second and third trimester polyhydramnios:
      syringe manual aspiration technique (S group) and continuous suction technique (C group) set
      to – 250 mmHg

      Polyhydramnios is defined as more than 2 liters of amniotic fluid. Ultrasound diagnosis is
      made either by measurement of a deepest vertical pocket exceeding 8 cm, or by use of an
      amniotic fluid index (AFI) exceeding 25 cm. Potential complications of polyhydramnios are
      preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, altered utero-placental perfusion, and
      maternal discomfort.

      Amniodrainage has become an established technique to improve maternal comfort and reduce the
      risks of severe polyhydramnios in both singleton and twin pregnancies, decreasing uterine
      contractility, as well as over-stretching of membranes and uterus. It also acts on the
      pathological processes of twin to twin transfusion syndrome.

      Several techniques are used to reduce symptomatic polyhydramnios. Passive gravitational
      drainage is long, does not allow to evacuate larger amounts of amniotic fluid and continuous
      maternal and fetal monitoring is difficult. The standard syringe technique is often a source
      of discomfort for both the patient and the operator. Continuous aspiration is faster and
      limits patient's discomfort.

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency and maternal and fetal tolerance of these
      two latter techniques of amnioreduction.

      A preliminary study permitted to assess the depression value created at the tip of the needle
      during amniodrainage: the syringe aspiration technique showed large depression variations
      from 0 to – 300 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The continuous wall suction was thus chosen to
      be set to – 250 mmHg: depression at the needle's tip didn't vary during the procedure.
