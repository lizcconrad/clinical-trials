  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of the investigational drug, Pagoclone, in the treatment of
      persistent developmental stuttering (PDS), which includes frequent repetitions or
      prolongations of sounds or syllables or words, or frequent hesitations or pauses that disrupt
      the flow of speech. Pagoclone is an investigational drug, so it is not approved by the United
      States Food and Drug Administration.
