  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of the pectus multicenter outcomes study is to document the utility of PEx
      repair in improving health and quality of life and to test the prevailing belief that the two
      predominant surgical procedures currently in use for PEx repair are essentially equivalent in
      terms of long-term outcomes.

      We believe the uncertainty about the impact of PEx on cardiopulmonary function is due to part
      to the fact that the previous studies have not measured the physiological parameters mostly
      likely affected by the defect. A protocol to test this was developed. Thus, we propose to use
      these measures as well as conventional output of progressive exercise test to examine
      cardiopulmonary function before and after surgical repair of PEx within the context of the
      original study.
