  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcitonin has been used for many years for treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women,
      and it has been shown that calcitonin reduces pain after spine and hip fracture in women with
      osteoporosis. Therefore, this study assesses the safety and efficacy of salmon calcitonin
      nasal spray on muscle strength after a forearm fracture, pain, quality of life and fracture
      healing in postmenopausal women.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Post-menopausal women, aged at least 60 years old

          -  Having a forearm fracture within the last 3-7 days before treatment

          -  Fracture is treated with either a plaster cast only, or a cast plus Kirschner wires

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Multiple fractures, severe fractures, or the forearm fractured in more than one place

          -  Nerve damage in the forearm caused by the fracture

          -  Other conditions which would interfere with the grip strength measurements (e.g.
             swelling, paralysis, skin diseases or rheumatoid arthritis)

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
