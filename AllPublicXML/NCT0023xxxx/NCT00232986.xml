  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to use three different survey methodologies to evaluate whether
      adolescents report on their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors on sexual and reproductive
      health issues differently based on the manner in which questions are asked.

      Specific Aims and Research Questions Aim 1: To compare adolescents’ levels of reporting of
      their own reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and behaviors using three survey
      methodologies: (1) Face-to-face interview (2) Audio-CASI (Computer Assisted Self Interview)
      and (3) a culturally appropriate interactive methodology.

      The following hypothesis will be tested:

      • Overall, adolescents will be more likely to divulge their own reproductive knowledge,
      attitudes and behaviors with Audio-CASI and the interactive method as compared to
      face-to-face interviews. Levels of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors will vary by education,
      age and gender.

      Aim 2: To compare respondents’ levels of comfort, accuracy and honesty with the survey
      methodologies (i.e. face to face, audio-CASI and interactive methodology) to their reporting
      of knowledge, attitudes and behaviors related to sexual and reproductive health.
