  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether maintenance renal transplant patients on micophenolate mofetil (MMF) can
      be safely converted to EC-MPS, based on adverse events and acute rejection within 6 months
      after switching from MMF to a EC-MPS regimen.

        Inclusion criteria

          1. Males and females aged between 18 and 80 years.

          2. Recipients of first or secondary cadaveric, living related or unrelated donor kidney
             transplant at least 6 months after transplantation.

          3. Patients currently receiving CsA-ME with MMF , with or without corticosteroids as part
             of their immunosuppressive regimen for at least 3 months prior to Screening.

          4. Patients receiving MMF at reduced dose prior to study entry

          5. Patients in a stable condition in terms of graft function (serum creatinine not above
             2.3 mg/dL (=204 Âµmol/L) at screening and at baseline, or not increased by more than
             20% at baseline compared to values obtained at screening), no change of
             immunosuppressive regimen due to graft malfunction, and any known clinically
             significant physical and/or laboratory changes for at least 2 months prior to
             enrollment.

          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7
             days prior to or at screening. Effective contraception must be used during the trial,
             and for 6 weeks following discontinuation of the study medication, even where there
             has been a history of infertility.

          7. Patients who are willing and able to participate in the full course of the study and
             from whom written informed consent has been obtained.

        Exclusion Criteria

          1. Multi-organ patients (e.g., kidney and pancreas) or previous transplant with any other
             organ different from kidney (secondary kidney transplant is allowed)

          2. Evidence of graft rejection or treatment of acute rejection within two months prior to
             Screening.

          3. Patients with any known hypersensitivity to EC-MPS or other components of the
             formulation (e.g., lactose)

          4. Patients with thrombocytopenia (&lt;75,000/mm3), with an absolute neutrophil count of
             &lt;1,500/mm3 and/or leukocytopenia (&lt;2,500/mm3), and/or hemoglobin &lt;6.0 g/dL prior to
             enrollment.

          5. Patients who have received an investigational drug within two weeks prior to Screening
             (i.e., before Day -14 of run-in period).

          6. Patients with a history of malignancy within the last five years, except excised
             squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

          7. Females of childbearing potential who are planning to become pregnant, who are
             pregnant and/or lactating, who are unwilling to use effective means of contraception

          8. Presence of clinically significant infection requiring continued therapy, severe
             diarrhea, active peptic ulcer disease, or uncontrolled diabetes mellitus that would
             interfere with the appropriate conduct of the study.

          9. Known positive HIV and/or Hepatitis B surface antigen positive.

         10. Evidence of drug and/or alcohol abuse.
