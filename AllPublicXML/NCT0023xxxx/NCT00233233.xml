  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine how the assessment mode influences the validity of self-reported
      adherence to asthma therapy. Self-reported adherence to asthma therapy data will be collected
      using one of three randomized assessment modes (interview, computer, or telephone).

      BACKGROUND:

      Self-reports are a primary source of behavioral data. Studies have highlighted the variable
      validity and reliability of self-report measures of health behaviors such as adherence to
      therapy. Research on self-reports of sensitive information, such as sexual behavior and drug
      use, suggests that the mode of data collection may enhance validity of self-reports. However,
      no studies have determined how the mode of data collection influences self-reports when an
      objective measure of the behavior is available.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The primary aim of this study is to examine the influence of the mode of data collection on
      the validity of self-reports of inhaled anti-inflammatory medication adherence.

      The key secondary outcomes of the study will attempt to answer the following questions: 1)
      does the assessment mode influence self-reports of commonly used asthma outcome measures of
      disease-related symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life?; 2) does the
      relationship between the assessment mode, the validity of self-reports of adherence, and
      other measures (i.e., asthma symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life) change
      over time?; and 3) does the assessment mode interact with baseline personality
      characteristics and mood to influence the validity of self-reports of adherence and other
      outcome measures (i.e., asthma symptoms, self-management behaviors, and quality of life)?
