    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, global study to evaluate the contraceptive efficacy,
      cycle control, safety, compliance and subject satisfaction of the transdermal contraceptive
      system. Sixteen hundred healthy women will wear the contraceptive patch for either 6 or 13
      cycles. The first 530 subjects will wear the patch for 13 cycles, and all subsequent subjects
      will wear the patch for 6 cycles. At admission Visit 1, study drug (plus 3 reserve patches)
      and diary cards are dispensed for Cycle 1; first patch application will be on the first day
      of menses. Study drug and diary cards are dispensed on day 28 of Cycle 1 (Visit 2) for Cycles
      2 and 3, on day 28 of Cycle 3 (Visit 3) for Cycles 4 to 6, on day 28 of Cycle 6 (Visit 4) for
      Cycles 7 to 9, and on day 28 of Cycle 9 (Visit 5) for Cycles10 to13. At each of these visits,
      diary cards and empty medication packages are collected. Final study visits are on day 28 of
      Cycles 6 and 13. Diary card information is used to record compliance and bleeding information
      (to assess cycle control). Contraceptive efficacy is assessed by means of the Pearl Index and
      life table analysis (gross cumulative probability of pregnancy). Safety evaluations are based
      on adverse events, which are collected throughout the study, and changes in gynecologic
      examinations, vital signs, and laboratory results from admission to final visit. Each
      transdermal contraceptive patch, containing 6 mg NGM and 0.75 mg EE, and delivering 250 ug
      17-dNGM and 25 ug EE over 24 hours for 7 days, is worn for 1 week and replaced for 3
      consecutive weeks. The fourth week is patch-free. The patch can be worn on: upper arm or
      torso, buttock, or abdomen.
