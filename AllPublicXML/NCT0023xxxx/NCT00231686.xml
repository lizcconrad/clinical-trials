  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial was to determine whether a (and if so which)
      physical conditioning program is effective to improve health status, physical activity, and
      quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis. A positive effect of physical conditioning
      was expected.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A high level of physical activity might be beneficial for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).
      Several studies have indicated that physical training might improve fitness and lung
      functions (or, at least, slow the decline in lung functions). However, there are no long-term
      studies comparing the effects among aerobic training, strength training and no training.
      Furthermore, motivation to continue a training with little variations between sessions has
      been shown to decline rapidly. Thus, adherence with such a program may be low. Finally, not
      all patients feel happy with the same program. Therefore, a home-based individualized sports
      program might be best suitable to achieve long term benefits. The MUKOTRAIN study is a
      multicenter randomized controlled trial to determine the effects of a home-based physical
      training in patients with CF.

      Comparisons:

      Study A) Patients training aerobically 3 * 30 min per week (supervised in a sports club near
      their homes) in addition to their baseline physical activity compared to patients training
      upper and lower body strength 3 * 30 min per week (supervised in a sports club near their
      homes) compared to patients maintaining their physical activity. The supervised intervention
      lasted 6 months, thereafter patients were followed for an additional 18 months.

      Study B) Patients asked to participate in sport activities at least 3 * 60 min per week (free
      choice of activities) in addition to their baseline physical activity compared with patients
      asked to maintain their baseline physical activity.
