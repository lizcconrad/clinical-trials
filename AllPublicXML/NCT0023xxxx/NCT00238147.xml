      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine, work
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by
      stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill
      more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Capecitabine
      may also make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Giving combination
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of docetaxel when
      given together with carboplatin and capecitabine followed by chemoradiotherapy in treating
      patients who are undergoing surgery for locally advanced esophageal cancer.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of docetaxel when
           administered with carboplatin and capecitabine as neoadjuvant induction therapy in
           patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the clinical and pathological response in these patients treated with
           neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising docetaxel, carboplatin, and capecitabine
           followed by chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes
           on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
           every 28 days for 2 courses.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Approximately 7 days after completion of induction therapy, patients proceed to
      chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-42 and
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, on days 1-40.

        -  Surgery: Approximately 4-8 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients undergo
           surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued for this study.
