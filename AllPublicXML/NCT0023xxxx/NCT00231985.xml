      This study will compare the efficacy of supportive therapy versus habit-reversal therapy for
      the treatment of Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorder are neurological disorders characterized by tics.
      Tics are involuntary, rapid motor movements or vocalizations that occur suddenly and
      repeatedly. In adults, the symptoms of Tourette syndrome or chronic tic disorder can be
      severe. These symptoms often cause difficulties in interpersonal relationships and high
      unemployment rates. Medication treatments are available for both Tourette syndrome and
      chronic tic disorder, but most are not completely effective and cause considerable negative
      side effects. Therefore, non-medication treatments are needed. This study will compare the
      efficacy of supportive therapy versus habit-reversal therapy for the treatment of Tourette
      syndrome and chronic tic disorder.

      Participants in this open-label study will be randomly assigned to receive either supportive
      therapy or habit-reversal therapy. Over the course of 10 weeks, all participants will receive
      8 treatment sessions of their assigned therapy. The supportive therapy will focus on
      educating participants on what tics are, how tics present themselves, the causes of tics, the
      common conditions that may occur along with tics, and environmental factors that may affect
      their tics (e.g. family, social, school, stress). Habit-reversal therapy will consist of
      awareness training, relaxation training, self-monitoring, and competing response training.
      Tic severity, tic-related impairment, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and
      obsessive-compulsive symptoms will be assessed at each study session, using diagnostic
      interviews and self-report scales.
