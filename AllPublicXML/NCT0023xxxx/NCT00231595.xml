  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of topiramate
      (50 milligrams[mg], 100mg, and 200mg per day) compared with placebo in the prevention of
      migraine. The study will also assess the dose response relationship and the efficacy of
      treatment with topiramate versus placebo on Health-Related Quality of Life.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-center study to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of three different doses of topiramate (50mg, 100mg, and
      200mg daily) in migraine prophylaxis. The study consists of five phases: Baseline
      (determination of whether patients meet the eligibility criteria and tapering of any migraine
      medication patients are already taking), Double-Blind (patients receive either 50
      milligrams[mg], 100mg, 200mg of topiramate, or placebo), Blinded Transition Phase (doses of
      study medication are adjusted over 7 weeks in preparation for the Open-Label Extension
      Phase), Open-Label Extension Phase (patients continue the study medication in open-label
      manner for up to 6 months; doses are adjusted to maximize effectiveness and minimize side
      effects), Taper/Exit Phase (study medication is slowly discontinued over 2 weeks). The
      primary study hypothesis is that one or more of the three doses of topiramate (50, 100, 200
      mg/day) will be superior to placebo in the prophylaxis of migraine based on the change in
      monthly (28 day) migraine period rate from the Prospective Baseline Period to the
      Double-Blind Phase. Topiramate tablets (50milligrams [mg], 100mg, 200mg, or placebo) taken by
      mouth as twice-daily regimen during the 26-week Double-Blind Phase. Doses are adjusted and
      continued during the 6 month Open-Label Extension Phase after which they are tapered over 2
      weeks.
