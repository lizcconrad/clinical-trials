      To learn if there is a connection between low vitamin D level and hardening of the arteries.

    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis and vascular disease are two of the most common disorders affecting
      postmenopausal women. A potential association, beyond aging, has long been speculated. Our
      previous study revealed evidence of loss of vascular compliance in postmenopausal women with
      lower bone density, suggesting women with lower bone density had &quot;stiffer&quot; blood vessels.
      This proposal further investigates that association and a potential role of vitamin D
      deficiency as a possible common link between both bone loss and &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot;.
