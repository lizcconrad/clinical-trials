      The objective of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of the treatment with
      Cypher DES in diabetic patients with documented ischemia due to stenosis (small coronary
      artery 2.5 -3 mm in lumen diameter, with lesion between 15 mm 30 mm in length, ) in native
      coronary arteries.

      The objective of this study is to document that the use of Cypher DES in these diabetic
      patients undergoing percutaneous revascularization for stenosis is safe.

      Safety will be assessed over a period of 12 months.

      This is a prospective, multicenter, comparative, non randomised, open registry of 1000
      patients who will be followed up to 12 months at 100 sites in France.

      Patients will be screened according to normal practice and in relation to the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Patients should have a documented ischemia related to the target vessel.

      Procedure of stent placement should be done under existing in hospital procedural protocol
      and care should be taken to follow Cordis instructions as set forth in the Instructions For
      Use.

      Follow up will be done according to normal procedure and the minimum should be a telephone
      contact at 1, 6 and 12 months.

      All data gathered during the enrollment, procedure, follow up and when specific events to the
      patient may occur, will be entered into the Internet CRF form, by the treating physician or a
      person from his staff specifically appointed to this task.

      Patient enrollment is anticipated to last 8 months.
