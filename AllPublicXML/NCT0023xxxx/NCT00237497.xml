  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ramelteon, once daily
      (QD), compared to placebo with Zopiclone in adults with chronic insomnia

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vast majority of people are affected by chronic insomnia in the western world. Several
      studies have looked at this and have estimated that 30% to 48% of the general population is
      affected at some time in their life with a form of insomnia that goes on for several months,
      and about one third of those are described as severely affected. Daytime symptoms of insomnia
      include tiredness, lack of energy, difficulty concentrating, and irritability. Recent
      epidemiologic research focusing on the quality of life has identified significant
      insomnia-related conditions that relate to work productivity, health care utilization, and
      risk of depression. Insomnia is associated with diminished work output, absenteeism, and
      greater rates of accidents.

      This study will examine the effect of ramelteon on balance/postural stability on Night 14 at
      peak plasma concentration levels, compared with placebo and using zopiclone as the reference
      arm.

          -  Used melatonin, or other drugs or supplements known to affect sleep/wake function
             within 1 week or 5 half-lives of the drug (whichever was longer) prior to the first
             day of single-blind study medication.

          -  Used any central nervous system (CNS) medication within 1 week or 5 half lives of the
             drug (whichever was longer) prior to the first day of single-blind study medication.
