    <textblock>
      This prospective study will evaluate the feasibility of the defined decision tree for the
      treatment of asthmatic young children. Children who develop episode (=3 consecutive days) of
      any troublesome lower respiratory symptoms are treated according to a strictly pre-defined
      multi-steps treatment algorithm until the age of 6 years.
