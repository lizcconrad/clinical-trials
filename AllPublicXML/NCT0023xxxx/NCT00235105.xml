      Reduction of signs and symptoms in patients with moderate to severely early axial
      spondyloarthritis (without radiological sacroiliitis) who have had an inadequate response to
      or do not tolerate NSAID therapy.

      Study Objectives:Efficacy –To assess whether patients with moderate to severely active early
      axial spondyloarthritis (without radiological sacroiliitis) will show response when
      adalimumab is added to the pre-existing or in case of intolerance to NSAID therapy. Response
      will be measured at week 12 by change of efficacy parameters compared to baseline.Safety – To
      demonstrate the safety of adalimumab in study patients with moderate to severely active early
      axial spondyloarthritis (without radiological sacroiliitis) in patients who have had an
      inadequate response to or do not tolerate NSAID therapy.

      The study is a two center 12-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adalimumab in
      patients with moderate to severely active axial spondyloarthritis (without radiological
      sacroiliitis) who have had an inadequate response to who are or intolerant to NSAID therapy.
      Patients may have been treated in the past with concomitant DMARDs. For these patients a
      washout period of at least 4 weeks is necessary. If Leflunomide was discontinued, it should
      be stopped at least 3 months or should be washed out within 4 weeks before study start.
      Patients who have been treated previously with approved biologics are allowed to enter the
      study if they failed due to lack of efficacy and/or intolerance. The placebo-controlled
      treatment period of 12 weeks will be followed by an open-label maintenance therapy up to Week
      52. Following screening and baseline evaluations, patients will be assessed at Weeks 2, 4, 8,
      and 12. During the maintenance therapy visits will be performed at Weeks 16, 20 and every
      eight weeks thereafter.Efficacy and safety measurements will be recorded throughout the
      entire 52 weeks study.Non-responders (fail to reach ASAS 40) at and after week 12 of open
      label therapy (at week 24), will be eligible for adalimumab dose escalation to 40 mg
      weekly.The study will be followed by a 24 weeks follow up phase. During this period the
      patients will be assessed every eight weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients 18 years of age or older who have moderate to severely active axial
        spondyloarthritis.

             concurrent NSAID therapy, or intolerance to NSAIDs.

        Other inclusion criteria include:
