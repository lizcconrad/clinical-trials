      Objective: To assess the impact of quetiapine on core PTSD symptoms and associated
      psychiatric comorbidity including depressive and positive and negative psychotic symptoms.

      Research Design: 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, fixed-flexible dose
      trial of quetiapine monotherapy.

      Intervention: Eligible patients will be randomized to receive quetiapine starting at 25 mg
      daily or matching placebo. Dose adjustments (to a minimum of 50 mg or a maximum of 800 mg),
      will be made at the investigator's discretion and according to patient's clinical response.
