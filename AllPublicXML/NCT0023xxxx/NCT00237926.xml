      The purpose of this study is to compare the health outcomes of a 12-week exercise program
      focused on aerobic training (using a treadmill) to a 12-week exercise program focused on
      resistance training (using Thera-Bands) in sedentary patients within 6 months of completing
      treatment for cancer.
