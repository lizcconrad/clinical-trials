  <brief_summary>

      We intend to test in a randomized, rater blinded, placebo controlled, prospective study the
      primary hypothesis that an escitalopram-rTMS-combination treatment is more efficacious in the
      treatment of refractory major depression assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale

      We intend to test in a randomized, rater blinded, placebo controlled, prospective study the
      primary hypothesis that an escitalopram-rTMS-combination treatment is more efficacious in the
      treatment of refractory major depression assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      compared to placebo.

      A second hypothesis is that the treatment of MDE with escitalopram (that means in the
      &quot;Placebo group&quot;) alone lead to typical changes like

        -  An increase in neurotrophic factors concentration (measured by blood concentrations of
           nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived nerve growth factor (BDNF),

        -  An increase in hippocampal metabolites (measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy
           (MRS

        -  An increase in motor cortical inhibitory activity (measured with motor evoked potentials
           (MEP

        -  An increase in serotonergic activity (measured with EEG parameters, Moreover, it is
           hypothesized that similar but pronounced changes occur in the group treated with the
           combination treatment.
