  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a four-year study, funded by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, related
      to antimicrobial resistance in rural communities. The project consists of four components: A)
      surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, B) promotion of appropriate antimicrobial drug
      prescribing, C) preliminary assessment of the environmental impact of antimicrobials, and D)
      the development of new antimicrobial products. Six rural communities in Utah, and six rural
      communities in Idaho are participating in this study. Component D is being performed by
      investigators at Harvard University, under the direction of Co-Investigator Roger Inouye.
