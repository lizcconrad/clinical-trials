      The goals of the trial are:

        -  To determine the prevalence of osteoporosis in subgroups of COPD patients.

        -  To look for risk factors of osteoporosis in COPD patients.

        -  To create sub-groups for prospective research concerning the effects of bisphosphonates
           on osteoporosis variables in COPD patients.

      Background:

      Osteoporosis is defined as a systemically skeletal disorder characterized by a low bone mass
      and deterioration of the micro-architecture of the bone and is therefore associated with a
      higher risk of fractures. Large epidemiological studies to determine the incidence and
      prevalence of osteoporosis in COPD patients in different stages of their disease are not
      available. The etiology of osteoporosis in COPD patients is complex and depends on multiple
      factors.

      Goals of the Trial:

        -  To determine the prevalence of osteoporosis in subgroups of COPD patients.

        -  To look for risk factors of osteoporosis in COPD patients.

        -  To create sub-groups for prospective research concerning the effects of bisphosphonates
           on osteoporosis variables in COPD patients.

      Study Design:

      Patients diagnosed with COPD (according to the American Thoracic Society [ATS] guidelines and
      divided in stages according to the Global Initiative on Obstructive Lung Diseases
      [GOLD]-classification) who visit the out-patient clinic of pulmonology of the Catharina
      Hospital Eindhoven will be asked to participate in the trial. A database will be created
      (prospectively) of the (medical) information about these patients, which will be analysed
      retrospective. To gather information we will use the medical records, a questionnaire, a
      blood sample, long function testing including a 6-minute walking test and a DEXA-scan.
