  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the hypothesis that In Home Hospital Care (IHHC) is as safe and effective, less
      burdensome to families, and less expensive for care of common acute pediatric problems now
      managed with hospitalization.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized trial compared health care systems with and without IHHC. Eligible children
      presented to the Emergency Department of our medical center, had common acute problems, and
      were considered for hospital admission.

      Physicians decided disposition from the emergency department. Note that subjects were not
      randomized directly to IHHC but to a system of care that either included IHHC or did not. To
      allow best use of scarce home nursing resources, we used a disproportionate selection
      favoring the system with IHHC.

      Quality measures included adverse events, parent anxiety and satisfaction with care, family
      disruption, and perceived child health.
