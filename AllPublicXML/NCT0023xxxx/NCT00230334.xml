  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to determine the safety and efficacy of Gleevec&quot; in idiopathic
      hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and to characterize the molecular basis for the therapeutic
      benefit of Gleevec&quot; in HES.

        Inclusion Criteria:- At study entry, absolute peripheral blood eosinophil count greater
        than upper limit of normal at the laboratory where the analysis is performed.

          -  Patients must have symptomatic disease, e.g. signs or symptoms of organ involvement
             related to eosinophilia. Examples include pulmonary, cardiac, GI, or central nervous
             system disease, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or skin disease.

          -  BCR-ABL-negative by PCR.

          -  Patients are imatinib-naive.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Ability to swallow capsules.&amp;#xA; Exclusion Criteria:- Pregnant or nursing women.
             Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to
             initiation of study drug. Male and female patients of reproductive potential must
             agree to employ an effective barrier method of birth control during the study and for
             3 months following discontinuation of study drug.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;2.0.

          -  Total serum bilirubin &gt;2.0 mg/dl. AST(SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) more than 2.5 x the upper
             limit of normal range (ULN) at the laboratory where the analyses is performed.

          -  Presence of clonal T-lymphocyte population by PCR or southern blotting.

          -  ECOG Performance Status Score &gt; or = to 3.

          -  Busulfan within 6 weeks of starting treatment.

          -  IFN-a within 14 days of starting treatment.

          -  Low dose cytosine-arabinoside or vincristine within 14 days of starting treatment.

          -  Hydroxyurea within 1 day of starting treatment.

          -  Prednisone or other immunosuppressives (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporine-A) within 14
             days of starting treatment.

          -  AML/ALL-type induction chemotherapy within 4 weeks of starting treatment

          -  Persistent peripheral blood count toxicity of grade 2 or higher after receiving
             AML/ALL-type induction chemotherapy.

          -  Treatment with other investigational agents within 28 days of starting treatment.

          -  History of non-compliance to medical regimens.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (Grade 3 / 4 New York Heart
             Association Criteria), unstable angina pectoris or cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  History of HIV-positivity.
