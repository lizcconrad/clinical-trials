  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no established standard preoperative treatment in rectal cancer. Two large
      randomized studies in North America closed from lack of accrual; therefore the only method of
      assessing preoperative treatment in rectal cancer is from Phase II studies. This study builds
      on the experience at PMH gained in two previous studies which demonstrated a lower than
      expected toxicity with concurrent 5FU infusion and external radiotherapy. The current
      standard at PMH is preoperative radiation, 46Gy in 23 fractions with concurrent 5FU infusion
      225mg/m2. An increase of radiation dose and consequent increase in chemotherapy may improve
      the response rate, but may also increase toxicity. It is proposed to increase the dose of
      radiotherapy to 50Gy in 25 fractions with concurrent chemotherapy and measure acute toxicity
      and complete remission rate.
