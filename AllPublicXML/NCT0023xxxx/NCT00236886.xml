      The purpose of this study is to assess a possible predictor for weight loss seen in epilepsy
      patients treated with topiramate.

      Topiramate has been shown to be an effective anti-epileptic medication with a good safety
      profile. In clinical trials, some patients have experienced substantial weight loss. This
      prospective single center, open, pilot study will investigate whether there is any metabolic
      predictor for the weight loss. The patients will receive daily oral dose of topiramate in
      addition to anti-epileptic medications already prescribed by their physicians. A battery of
      metabolic tests including Body Mass Index (BMI), lean body mass, blood lipids and fasting
      glucose in tandem with other examinations will be taken before dispensing of topiramate,
      after 3 months and at the final visit. The study hypothesis is metabolic test results will
      provide a predictor of weight loss with topiramate. Patients will receive between 25 to 400mg
      daily of topiramate by mouth in addition to current anti-epileptic medications for up to 1
      year. Dose will be adjusted (up to 1000 mg daily) by the investigators depending on the
      patients' clinical response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A diagnosis of partial onset epilepsy, with or without secondary generalization.
             Patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy characterized by primary generalized
             tonic-clonic seizures may also qualify

          -  Currently taking one or more anti-epileptic medications on a stable dose for one month

          -  Weight between 40 and 130 kg (88 to 286 lbs)

          -  Female patients must be postmenopausal for at least 1 year, surgically incapable of
             childbearing, practicing an acceptable method of contraception (requires negative
             pregnancy test).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with rapidly progressive disorders that may impair their weight or their
             reliable participation in the study

          -  Patients prone to severe malabsorption and/or metabolic disorders

          -  Patients who have mental retardation or impairment which would confound the
             interpretation of this study

          -  History (within the past six months) of a psychiatric or mood disorder requiring
             medical treatment

          -  History of poor compliance with past anti-epileptic drug therapy

          -  Suicide attempt in the past five years
