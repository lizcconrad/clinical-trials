    <textblock>
      We tested the hypothesis that insulin therapy rather than sulfonylurea (SU) treatment has a
      preferable outcome to reverse or preserve beta cell function in the patients with diabetes
      that is called slowly progressive insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes (SPIDDM) or latent
      autoimmune diabetes in adult (LADA).

    <textblock>
      In a multicenter, randomized, nonblinded clinical study, 4,089 non-insulin dependent diabetic
      patients were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADAb). Sixty
      GADAb-positive non-insulin requiring diabetic patients with duration of diabetes =/&lt;5 years
      were assigned to either the SU group (n = 30) or the Insulin group (n = 30). Serum C-peptide
      response to annual oral glucose tolerance tests were followed for 57 mean months. The primary
      endpoint was insulin-dependency (IDDM: integrated C-peptide values [sigma C-peptide] &lt;4
      ng/ml).
