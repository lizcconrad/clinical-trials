  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flexible doses of
      escitalopram (Lexapro) compared to sertraline (Zoloft) for treatment of Dysthymic Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysthymic Disorder is a common, chronic type of depression that is often seen as a mild
      condition and is under-treated. Because of its chronic course, it is often complicated by
      episodes of major depression and may require long-term treatment.

      This is a twelve week study during which daily doses of escitalopram (10-20 mg) or sertraline
      (50-200 mg) will be given to outpatients meeting criteria for Dysthymic Disorder or Double
      Depression. Medications will be assigned 1:1 and clinicians will be blinded to treatment.
      Efficacy will be based on scores for the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, patient subjective
      reporting, and clinician observation. The study will have a total of 8 visits over 12 weeks,
      with a one-week medication taper period at the end. Subjects will have a physical exam, labs,
      and vital signs monitored at first visit and vital signs monitored at every subsequent visit.
      Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at screening. All
      subjects will remain on the lowest medication dose for the first four weeks of the study.
