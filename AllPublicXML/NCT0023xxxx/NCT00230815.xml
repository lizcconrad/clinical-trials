        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Infertile woman wishing to conceive who has had at least 1 previous cycle of treatment
             with injectable gonadotropins within the past 6 months, excluding treatment with any
             gonadotropin multi-dose formulation in vials or administered by Pen device, whose
             physician has recommended that she undergo ovulation induction. This inclusion
             criterion is modified to include subjects who had previous treatment with any
             gonadotropin multi-dose formulation in vials, excluding those gonadotropins
             administered by a Pen device

          -  Premenopausal and aged 18-40 years, inclusive

          -  Ovulatory dysfunction as defined by any of the following (a) usual cycle length less
             than (&lt;) 21 or greater than (&gt;) 35 days with at least 6 menses per year (b) usual
             cycle length &gt; 35 days with less than 6 menses per year. Subjects in this group must
             have a positive response to a progesterone challenge within the past 6 months or
             during the screening period

          -  Spontaneous menses or a positive response to progestin withdrawal within 6 months of
             the start of gonadotropin therapy or positive response to clomiphene citrate
             withdrawal at least 30 days prior to start of gonadotropin therapy is acceptable to
             demonstrate induced menses

          -  Normal Papanicolaou (PAP) smear within 6 months prior to initial visit

          -  Male partner with an acceptable semen analysis within 6 months prior to study entry,
             according to the standard practice at the clinic, for ovulation induction. Use of
             donor sperm is acceptable

          -  Body mass index (BMI) less than 35.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2). BMI = Body
             Weight / Height x Height (BMI is equal to body weight [kilogram {kg}] divided by
             Height * Height [square meter {m^2}])

          -  Patency and apparent normality of at least 1 fallopian tube with an ipsilateral
             functional ovary, as documented by an hysterosonogram or hysterosalpingography (HSG)
             within 3 years prior to study entry

          -  Local laboratory screening results demonstrating the following, within the past year:
             (a) prolactin within normal limits (b) Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) within the
             normal limit for the early follicular phase at the local laboratory (c) thyroid
             stimulating hormone (TSH) within normal limits. Subjects with low TSH levels who were
             receiving replacement therapy could be enrolled at the discretion of the Investigator

          -  Been willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the study

          -  Voluntarily provided written informed consent and a subject authorization under Health
             Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), prior to any study-related
             procedure not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent could
             be withdrawn by the subject at any time without prejudice to their future medical
             care. The male partner must also have provided a written subject authorization under
             HIPAA

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior excessive response to gonadotropin stimulation as defined by development of &gt;3
             mature follicles at a treatment dose of 75 IU FSH

          -  Treatment with gonadotropins, clomiphene citrate, insulin-sensitizing agents (e.g.,
             metformin, Avandia®) or Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) analogs within 1 month
             prior to study entry

          -  Hypothyroidism (untreated). Subjects with low Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels
             who were receiving replacement therapy (e.g., Synthroid) could be enrolled at the
