  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled nitrous oxide (iNO) will be compared to aerosolized iloprost (ILO) in pediatric
      patients after cardiac surgery with pulmonary hypertension. The hypothesis is that iloprost
      is more effective in preventing pulmonary hypertensive crises.

      Investigators, Study Sites: Single-center trial at the Department of Pediatric Cardiology,
      Department of Cardiac Surgery and Department of Anesthesiology, University Medical Center,
      Heidelberg, Germany Exploratory proof of concept study (Investigator initiated trial)

      Indication: Postoperative pulmonary hypertension in infants and children undergoing
      cardiopulmonary bypass surgery for intracardiac repair of left-to-right shunt

      Objectives: To compare the efficacy of aerosolized iloprost with inhaled nitric oxide to
      prevent postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crises

      Design: Exploratory, open label, randomized study with parallel-group design;

      Duration of observation: 72 hours

      Population: Infants older than 4 weeks and children less than 18 months of age presenting
      with left-to-right shunt and increased pulmonary blood flow. Inclusion will be independent on
      the presence or absence of preoperative pulmonary hypertension

      Sample Size:

        -  20 patients: inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) - group;

        -  20 patients: aerosolized iloprost (ILO) -group

      Treatment:

        -  Both groups: controlled ventilation, sedation, analgetics, inotropic substances as
           required, standardized intensive care treatment.

        -  iNO - group: concentration of iNO at 10 ppm; administered by mechanical ventilation.

        -  ILO - group: aerosolized Iloprost at a dose of 0,5 µg/kg body weight (12x / 24h),
           administered by ultrasound nebulizer.

      Efficacy Parameters: Occurrence of &quot;minor&quot; or &quot;major&quot; pulmonary hypertensive crises (PHTC)

      Safety Parameters: Arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, complete blood count

      Statistical Procedures: All analyses in this exploratory trial are descriptive, giving
      confidence intervals for differences between treatment groups.

      Primary analysis variable: Rate of occurrence of &quot;major&quot; or &quot;minor&quot; pulmonary hypertensive
      crises

      Secondary variables: Presence of hours of pulmonary hypertension, Duration of mechanical
      ventilation
