  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with cancer of the head and neck and rectum, knowing the exact location of the
      tumor is important for designing the radiation field to ensure delivery of high dose of
      radiation to the tumor while sparing surrounding normal tissues. A new medical imaging method
      which is a combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT)
      scan, has shown promise in helping the radiation oncologist in defining the exact location
      and extent of the tumor in certain cancers such as lung cancers. Therefore the purpose of
      this study is to determine if these imaging methods can be used in combination with the
      standard radiation treatment planning procedure to improve the accuracy to targeting your
      tumor with radiation. In addition the PET-CT scan, similar to the PET scan alone with better
      resolution, can be used to determine whether the tumor has spread to any part of the body
      outside of the head and neck sites.
