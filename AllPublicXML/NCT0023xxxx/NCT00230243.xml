      This retrospective study is designed to provide a consistent method of screening and
      collecting data on patients who will serve as controls for a comparison of the efficacy of
      the available antifungal therapies used as salvage treatments for patients with refractory
      IFI or for patients with refractory IFI or for patients with IFI who are intolerant to
      standard antifungal therapies.

      The current clinical trial is designed to provide historicals controls comparable to the
      P00041 study population, that is, a) patients with invasive fungal infections which are
      refractory or resistant to standard antifungal therapies or b) patients who have developed
      intolerance to standard antifungal therapy. This clinical trial also serves to allow
      collection of historical data regarding the efficacy of available antifungal therapies
      against a variety of invasive fungal infections which although serious and life-threatening
      are sufficiently rare so that they cannot be studied in a controlled, randomized clinical
      trial.

      This trial will be conducted primarily at the investigative sites that enrolled subjects into
      P00041 and/or investigators who are members of the Mycosis Study Group.

          -  Males and females of any race greater than or equal to 13 years of age

          -  Treatment for an IFI between April 30, 1996 and April 30, 2001 at one of the centers
             participating in P00041 or at other non-P00041 centers

          -  A diagnosis of proven or probable IFI based on MSG/EORTC criteria

          -  Refractory IFI or intolerence to standard therapy

        The date of diagnosis of an IFI will be the earliest date on which one or more of the
        following diagnostic procedures used to establish the diagnosis was performed:

          -  Fungal culture, histopathology, bronchoscopy, and autopsy report

          -  X-Rays, CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, and bone scan

          -  Serology

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subject who was pregnant or nursing at the time IFI was diagnosed

          2. Hepatic function tests: ALT or AST greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal at
             the time IFI was diagnosed

          3. Enrollment in P00041 for treatment of the IFI

          4. Patient with sarcoidosis, aspergilloma, or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

          5. Patients with chronic invasive aspergillosis (chronic necrotizing pulmonary
             aspergillosis)

          6. Patients with diagnosis of CMV pneumonia

          7. Patients with a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis

          8. Death within 72 hours of the start of antifungal therapy

          9. Patients on artificial ventilation, who were not extubated within 24 hours of
             commencing standard antifungal therapy
