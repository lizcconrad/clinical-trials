  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to examine the percentage of patients with PTSD who were prescribed
      an antipsychotic over the past seven years in the VA Network 7 (AL, GA, SC) and compare the
      percentage on an annual basis. We will also determine the type and dose of antipsychotics
      received. We hypothesize that there has been a significant increase in antipsychotic use,
      especially atypical antipsychotics, prescribed for patients with PTSD over the last 7 years

      This study is a retrospective electronic review of the VISN 7 Data Warehouse to determine
      what have been the emerging trends in prescriptions of atypical antipsychotic medications
      over the past seven years for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the VA

      This study is a retrospective electronic review of patients of the VISN 7 Data Warehouse of
      patients with a diagnosis of PTSD treated with antipsychotics as monotherapy or adjunctive
      therapy at a VA Medical Center or VA clinic in VISN 7 (GA, SC, and AL). The data will be
      retrieved from a computerized list of patients treated in VA VISN 7 for PTSD from 1998-2005
      and cross-referenced with the electronic pharmacy file for having received a prescription of
      an antipsychotic medication. No personal identifiers will be collected. The data will then be
      examined to determine what type of antipsychotics were prescribed and the dose and duration
      of the antipsychotics. In addition, demographics and clinical characteristics available
      through the Data Warehouse will be collected.
