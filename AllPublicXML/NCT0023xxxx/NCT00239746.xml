      The purpose of this study is to test the effect of ibuprofen on the levels of a number of
      different proteins (called biomarkers) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and urine to see
      whether ibuprofen can influence certain biomarkers associated with the progression of
      Alzheimer's Disease.

      The hypothesis to be tested is that the possible role of ibuprofen in preventing AD can be
      detected in changes in biomarkers of AD.

      Eligible participants will complete an enrollment visit to include: a physical exam, a
      neurological exam, neuropsychological testing, and a minor blood draw. At the second visit,
      approximately 2 weeks later, participants will undergo a baseline lumbar puncture, and will
      be issued either ibuprofen or placebo to take once daily for 6-12 weeks. Both the
      participants and the clinicians will be masked to treatment assignment. After 6-12 weeks, the
      participants will undergo a second, and final, lumbar puncture. This will complete
      participant involvement in the study.
