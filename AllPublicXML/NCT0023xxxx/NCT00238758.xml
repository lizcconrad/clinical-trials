      The study will be a 6 week, parallel-group, double-blind randomized controlled trial of the
      efficacy of Omega-3 as a monotherapy for depression. People aged 21-65 who have major
      depression but are not currently on an antidepressant or planning to take an antidepressant
      in the next 14 weeks will be recruited. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive
      Omega-3 (fish oil) or placebo (paraffin oil) for 6 weeks. Participants will be followed up
      weekly and will be asked to rate their mood daily for the 6 week study period. Blood samples
      will be taken pre and post treatment to measure change in omega-3 levels. At the end of 6
      weeks all participants will receive a further 8 weeks supply of omega-3.
