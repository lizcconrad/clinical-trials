      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, etoposide phosphate, and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy)
      may kill more tumor cells. Mannitol may help chemotherapy work better by making it easier for
      these drugs to get to the tumor. Chemoprotective drugs, such as acetylcysteine and sodium
      thiosulfate, may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy. Giving
      acetylcysteine together with mannitol, combination chemotherapy, and sodium thiosulfate may
      be an effective treatment for malignant brain tumors.

      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of acetylcysteine when
      given together with mannitol, combination chemotherapy, and sodium thiosulfate in treating
      children with malignant brain tumors.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of acetylcysteine when given in
           combination with blood-brain barrier disruption treatment with mannitol, combination
           chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide, etoposide phosphate, and carboplatin, and
           delayed high-dose sodium thiosulfate in pediatric patients with malignant brain tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the blood/bone marrow toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of acetylcysteine.

      Patients receive acetylcysteine IV over 30-60 minutes followed, at least 15 minutes later, by
      x-ray-guided femoral artery catheterization under general anesthesia on days 1 and 2. After
      placement of the catheter, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 10 minutes, etoposide
      phosphate IV over 10 minutes, mannitol intra-arterially (IA) over 30 seconds, and carboplatin
      IA over 10 minutes also on days 1 and 2. Patients then receive high-dose sodium thiosulfate
      IV over 15 minutes 4 hours after completion of carboplatin. Some patients may receive a
      second dose of sodium thiosulfate 8 hours after completion of carboplatin. Beginning 48 hours
      after the last dose of chemotherapy on day 2, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously once daily for 7-10 days or until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats
      every 4 weeks for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of acetylcysteine until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 3 patients are treated at the
      MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
