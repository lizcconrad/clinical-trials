  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test whether a telephone call-in program is a feasible way to
      collect mood and drug-related information in individuals enrolled in a methadone maintenance
      program.

    <textblock>
      Participants will complete a baseline interview and a follow-up interview at 5-weeks
      post-baseline. Two-thirds of the participants will be randomized into the telephone call-in
      group, and will be asked to complete daily, 10-minute, telephone interviews. To complete
      these interviews, participants will call into a toll-free telephone interview system with a
      unique and private Study ID number, and answers questions by using the telephone key pad.
      Questions during both the face-to-face interviews and the telephone interviews will assess
      mood, sleep, treatment utilization and drug-related experiences. Participants will be
      compensated for their time.

      Comparison(s): Participants randomized into the telephone component of the study as compared
      to participants in the interview-only component of the study.
