  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Croup affects 5% of children under 6 years of age, resulting in visits to hospital Emergency
      Departments, and in 1% of children, hospitalization. Traditionally, the first therapy offered
      is humidification which can liquify airway secretions and decrease airway swelling. This
      study will compare the effectivenesss of 40% and 100% humidity through a specially designed
      machine called a nebulizer, with the usual humidity set-up (blown into the patient's face
      from a hose).
