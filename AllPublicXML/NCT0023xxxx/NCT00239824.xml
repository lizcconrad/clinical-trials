      treatment of urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence is a well known side effect of radical prostatectomy. The prevalence
      differs according to time period after the operation and the definition of incontinence used.
      However, a prevalence of 10-20% have been reported one year after the operation. Pelvic floor
      muscle training has been suggested as a treatment of urinary incontinence. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effect of pelvic floor muscle training in the treatment of urinary
      incontinence after radical prostatectomy.We conduct a randomized clinical trial, comparing
      one group(n=40) following a pelvic floor muscle training program after prostatectomy and one
      group (n=40) receiving only standard information.Primary outcome variable is self
      registration of urinary incontinence.
