  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment
      regime in the management of painful neuropathy.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The addition of CBME to the existing treatment regime will result in a significant
           improvement in both primary and secondary outcome measures.

        2. The side effect profile and tolerability of CBME will be minimal and comparable to
           placebo.

      1. To investigate the benefit of adding CBME to the existing treatment regime in the
           management of painful neuropathy.

        2. To study the tolerability and side effect profile of CBME.

        3. To study the effects of CBME treatment on vibration perception thresholds (VPT) and
           nerve conduction study parameters.

        4. To evaluate the effects of CBME on central nervous system deep nuclei using MR
           Spectroscopy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Diagnoses of diabetes will be based on the criteria set by the World Health Organisation.

        Subjects must be over 18 years of age. Female subjects of child bearing potential and male
        subjects whose partner is of child bearing potential must be willing to ensure that they or
        their partner use effective contraception during the study and for three months thereafter.

        Written consent will be obtained. Volunteers must have had symptoms consistent with painful
        neuropathy for at least six months to be eligible for recruitment (NTSS 6 score of greater
        than 4 and less than 16).

        Subjects in whom the symptoms of painful neuropathy persist despite an adequate trial with
        tricyclic antidepressants (TCA).

        Stable dose of current treatment for neuropathy for at least 3 months prior to entry into
        the study.

        Able (in the investigators opinion) and willing to comply with all study requirements.

        Willing to allow his or her GP and consultant, if appropriate, to be notified of
        participation in the study.

        Willing to allow his or her name to be notified to the Home Office and GW Pharma for
        participation in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Previous cerebrovascular events or other neurological disorders. unstable glycaemic control
        for six months. History of cardiovascular disorders. History of schizophrenia or any other
        psychiatric illnesses other than depression associated with painful diabetic neuropathy
        History of epilepsy. Serious illnesses precluding the gathering of or potentially having an
        impact on primary and secondary outcome measures for example major organ failure, neoplasia
        or coeliac disease.

        Unwilling to stop driving or operating dangerous machinery for four hours after dosing on
        study medication or if experiencing its side effects.

        Anticipated foreign travel within the first 15 weeks of the trial. Participants in other
        research studies currently or within the previous three months.

        Current or past history of substance abuse. Previous or current history of consuming more
        than 20 units of alcohol a week. Neuropathy due to other aetiologies. Known or suspected
        hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of the study medications.

        Known or suspected adverse reaction to cannabinoids. Pregnancy or lactating mothers or
        planning pregnancy during the course of the study.

        Not using adequate contraception Current use of fentanyl Significant renal or hepatic
        impairment as shown in medical history or indicated by clinical laboratory results from
        samples taken at baseline.

        Scheduled elective surgery or other procedures requiring general anaesthesia during the
        study.

        Regular levodopa therapy within 7 days of study entry. Severe cognitive impairment such
