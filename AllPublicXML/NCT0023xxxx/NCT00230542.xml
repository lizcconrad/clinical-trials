  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects (good and bad) the combination of
      carboplatin and pemetrexed have on patients with recurrent ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian
      tube cancer.

      -  Before patients receive any chemotherapy treatments they will be given three medications
           to prevent side effects from the chemotherapy drugs. These medications are vitamin B12,
           folic acid and dexamethasone.

        -  Chemotherapy treatments will be given intravenously in the outpatient clinic. Pemetrexed
           will be given first and will take 10 minutes to infuse followed by carboplatin which
           will take 30-45 minutes to infuse. These treatments will be repeated once every three
           weeks for 6 cycles of chemotherapy (18 weeks).

        -  Before each chemotherapy treatment the following tests and procedures will be performed:
           physical exam and medical history; evaluation of ability to undertake daily activities;
           and blood tests.

        -  After every 2 cycles of chemotherapy (every 6 weeks) patients will have a CT or MRI scan
           to measure how well their cancer is responding to treatment.

        -  The study treatment will last for 6 cycles of chemotherapy as long as the tumor does not
           grow and the patient isn't experiencing any severe side effects.
