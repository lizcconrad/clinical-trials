        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Have evidence of venous insufficiency documented by venous duplex scanning or
             impedance plethysmography within the past 6 months. The study report must contain the
             actual terms &quot;venous incompetence&quot; or it must be repeated.

          -  Have a venous ulcer of &gt;3 but &lt;25 cm2 in area, by planimetry.

          -  Have a venous ulcer that has been open continuously for &gt;1 but &lt;18 months prior to
             treatment.

          -  Have been in the prescribed compression for at least 7 days immediately prior to
             randomization, but no more than 14 days (consecutive or non-consecutive).

          -  If female, the subject must: be postmenopausal without menses for at least 1 year, or
             have had a hysterectomy or tubal ligation or otherwise be incapable of pregnancy, or
             have a negative serum Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) and be willing to practice an
             approved form of birth control for the duration of the trial.

          -  Subject agrees to participate in the study, including all study related procedures and
             evaluations and documents this agreement by signing the IRB-approved informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have the designated study wound below the malleolus or above the popliteal fossa.

          -  Have been treated with becaplermin (PDGF-BB) or any other topical recombinant therapy
             to the study wound within the 30 days prior to randomization.

          -  Have had the study wound treated, at any time, with a skin substitute or an autologous
             growth factor.

          -  Have had a surgical procedure to treat venous or arterial disease of the affected limb
             within the past 90 days.

          -  Have evidence of significant arterial insufficiency (i.e. an ankle brachial index of &lt;
             0.8). Subjects with an ABI &gt;1.0 must have a toe brachial index (TBI) of &gt; 0.6 or a
             supine transcutaneous oxygen measurement on the affected leg and distal to the wound
             of &gt;30mmHg.

          -  Have clinical evidence of active infection at the wound site.

          -  Have evidence of active vasculitis, cellulitis or collagen vascular disease.

          -  Have participated in a clinical trial of an investigational agent within the last 30
             days.

          -  Have significant acute or chronic diseases (i.e., cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological or infectious diseases) that are not
             adequately controlled by medical treatment as determined by the Investigator's
             judgment.

          -  Have diabetes mellitus with a hemoglobin A1c &gt; 10%.

          -  Have an active skin disease, such as psoriasis, which could impair the ability to
             assess the study wound.

          -  Have an allergy to the components of the dressings used in this study.

          -  Require concomitant use of pentoxifylline or clopidogrel bisulfate during the study.

          -  Have undergone enzymatic debridement of the study wound at any time during the 7 days
             prior to the first application of study treatment.

          -  Have any requirement for the use of systemic steroids or immunosuppressive or
             cytotoxic compounds during the period of the study or received low-dose steroid
             therapy for more than 5 days within the past year.

          -  Expect to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy at any time during the study.
