        Inclusion Criteria:- Pancreatic tumors not to exceed 7.5 cm.

          -  Histologically confirmed malignancies of the pancreas, (ampulla of Vater or
             periampullary duodenum, tumors may be included when the head of pancreas is
             secondarily involved and unresectable criteria are met).

          -  Unresectable by CT criteria or unresectable at exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy.
             CT criteria for unresectability include encasement of the superior mesenteric vein
             (SMV), portal vein (PV) or invasion of the celiac artery or superior mesenteric artery
             (SMA).

          -  Patients with metastatic disease may be treated if they are symptomatic from the
             primary tumor.

          -  Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0, 1 or 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:Chemotherapy within 1 month of registration.
