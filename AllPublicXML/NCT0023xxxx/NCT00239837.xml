  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The transition from elementary school to middle school presents a complex set of challenges
      for adolescents. These include increased expectations for time management and
      self-monitoring, renegotiation of rules and boundaries with parents, increased peer
      influence, and pubertal changes. For children in foster care, this transition is further
      complicated by issues such as a possible history of maltreatment, unpredictable changes in
      their living situations, and difficulty explaining their foster care background to peers and
      teachers. Such issues may be more serious for girls in foster care. Social problems for these
      girls in middle school can lead to a number of negative effects, including delinquency,
      substance abuse, poor school performance, mental health problems, and participation in risky
      sexual behavior. Despite such risks, adolescent girls are less likely to receive specialty
      mental health or school-based services than their male counterparts. This study is aimed at
      determining the effectiveness of a preventive intervention for preadolescent girls living in
      foster/kinship care. The intervention targets include preventing delinquency, initiation of
      substance use, participation in risky sexual behavior, school truancy and failure, and mental
      health problems.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive either the preventive intervention or usual
      foster care services in the summer before entering middle school (typically sixth grade). The
      preventive intervention consisted of weekly training and support sessions for both
      participants and their foster or kin parents. The sessions began at study start and continued
      throughout participants' first year in middle school. Participants' relationship development,
      delinquency, school behavior and performance, sexual behavior, and substance use were
      assessed through questionnaires. Parenting practices were assessed through interviews.
      Assessments were conducted at study entry and at Months 6, 12, and 24, and 36. A new,
      follow-up assessment on the girls' decision making was conducted at age 14-16.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Delinquency</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>36 items from the general delinquency scale from the Self-Report Delinquency Scale (SRD; Elliott, Huizinga, &amp; Ageton, 1985). Units on a scale. Girls were asked to rate how many times they had committed various delinquent acts (e.g., damaging or destroying properties, and stealing) in the past year, using an open-ended format. The mean of frequencies across these items was used to represent the level of delinquency for girls. The general delinquency scale scores ranged from 0 to 24 (full scale) and from 0 to 13 (log transformed). Higher scores indicate higher levels of delinquency.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The girls were asked how many times in the past year they had smoked cigarettes or chewed tobacco. The response scale ranged from 1 (never) through 9 (daily). Units on a scale.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Marijuana Use</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The girls were asked how many times in the past year they had used marijuana. The response scale ranged from 1 (never) through 9 (daily). Units on a scale. Log transformed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mental Health Problems</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Months 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>Internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 12 and 24 months were measured with caregiver report on the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). This widely used checklist for psychopathological behaviors includes scales for behaviors such as Anxious/Depressed; Withdrawn; Somatic Complaints; Thought Problems; Attention Problems; Aggressive Behavior; Rule-Breaking Behavior; and Intrusive. The ASEBA has been shown to have both construct and content validity in the literature. For the present study, raw scores for the internalizing and externalizing symptoms subscales were used. Scores at 12 and 24 months were combined and averaged (mean). Units on a scale. Range = 0-66. Higher scores indicate higher levels of internalizing or externalizing problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participation in Risky Sexual Behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Month 36</time_frame>
    <description>Eight items from the girls' in-person interviews were used to assess health risking sexual behavior at the 36-month followup. The girls reported on items such as touching a boy's body above or below the waist, having sexual intercourse, having sex with someone who they just met, or having sex with someone using drugs in the past 12 months. Positive answers to these items were totaled to represent the cumulative number of health-risking sexual behaviors. The frequency of the cumulative number of risky sexual acts ranged from 0 to 7. Units on a scale. Higher scores indicate more health-risking sexual behaviors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Social Competence</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Months 6, 12</time_frame>
    <description>Prosocial behavior was measured with a subscale from the Parent Daily Report (PDR; Chamberlain &amp; Reid, 1987). The PDR was administered individually by telephone to foster parents on 3 consecutive or closely spaced days (1-3 days apart) at each assessment. A trained interviewer asked the foster parent whether a list of prosocial behaviors took place during the previous 24 hr (yes/no format). The prosocial scale was computed based on nine items, such as &quot;cleans up after herself&quot; and &quot;do a favor for someone.&quot; The PDR was designed to avoid the potential bias of aggregate recall of frequency estimates. Studies have reported concurrent and predictive validity of the PDR checklist. The scores were averaged (mean) across calls from 3 days. Scores on prosocial behavior at 6 and 12 months were averaged and the mean across both time points was used in analysis. Units on a scale. Range = 0-9. Higher scores indicate more prosocial behavior.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Placement Changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at Months 6 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Child welfare system records were collected at each assessment to determine the girls' placement changes (including the number and type of changes). Placement changes since the start of the study through 12 months were summed for each girl. The number of placement changes ranged from 0 to 7 during this period. Units on a scale. Higher scores indicate more placement changes.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Making</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at age 15-17</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Cups&quot; task (Weller et al., 2007). On each trial, participants see 2 arrays with equal number of X cups (2, 3, or 5) each. On gain trials, participants informed that under each cup in one array is 1 quarter, and the other array includes 1 cup with Y quarters (either 2, 3, or 5), but the other cups have 0 quarters. Choosing from the riskless side leads to a sure gain of 1 quarter while choosing the risky side can lead to gain of Y quarters or no quarters. On loss trials, participants shown that choosing cup from 1 array will lead to 1 quarter taken away while choosing cup from other array will lead to no quarters or Y quarters taken. Cups task consists of 54 trials of 3 trials each of all combinations of 2 levels of domain (gain, loss). Expected Value Sensitivity (EV) calculated by subtracting proportion of risky choices made when EV actually favored the sure choice from proportion of risky choices made on trials where EV favored risky option. Score can range from -1.0 to -1.0.</description>

          <description>Participants receive the preventative intervention. The intervention consisted of two primary components: (a) six sessions of group-based caregiver management training for the foster parents and (b) six sessions of group-based skill-building sessions for the girls. The groups met twice a week for 3 weeks, with approximately seven participants in each group. The caregiver sessions were led by one facilitator and one cofacilitator. The girl sessions were led by one facilitator and three assistants to allow a high staff-to-girl ratio (1:2) for individualized attention, one-on-one modeling/practicing of new skills, and frequent reinforcement of positive behaviors. In addition to the summer group sessions, follow-up intervention services (i.e., ongoing training and support) were provided to the caregivers and girls in the intervention group once a week for 2 hr (foster parent meeting; one-on-one session for girls) during the first year of middle school.</description>

          <description>The girls and caregivers in the control condition received the usual services provided by the child welfare system, including services such as referrals to individual or family therapy, parenting classes for biological parents, and case monitoring. Of the girls in the control condition, 62% received individual counseling, 20% received family counseling, 22% received group counseling, 30% received mentoring, 37% received psychiatric support, and 40% received other counseling or therapy services (e.g., school counseling, academic support) during the first year of middle school. Note that many girls received more than one service, and therefore the percentages listed above exceed 100%. Child Welfare caseworkers managed each case and were responsible for making all decisions on referrals to community resources, including individual and family therapy and parenting classes.</description>

        <description>36 items from the general delinquency scale from the Self-Report Delinquency Scale (SRD; Elliott, Huizinga, &amp; Ageton, 1985). Units on a scale. Girls were asked to rate how many times they had committed various delinquent acts (e.g., damaging or destroying properties, and stealing) in the past year, using an open-ended format. The mean of frequencies across these items was used to represent the level of delinquency for girls. The general delinquency scale scores ranged from 0 to 24 (full scale) and from 0 to 13 (log transformed). Higher scores indicate higher levels of delinquency.</description>

            <description>Participants receive the preventative intervention. The intervention consisted of two primary components: (a) six sessions of group-based caregiver management training for the foster parents and (b) six sessions of group-based skill-building sessions for the girls. The groups met twice a week for 3 weeks, with approximately seven participants in each group. The caregiver sessions were led by one facilitator and one cofacilitator. The girl sessions were led by one facilitator and three assistants to allow a high staff-to-girl ratio (1:2) for individualized attention, one-on-one modeling/practicing of new skills, and frequent reinforcement of positive behaviors. In addition to the summer group sessions, follow-up intervention services (i.e., ongoing training and support) were provided to the caregivers and girls in the intervention group once a week for 2 hr (foster parent meeting; one-on-one session for girls) during the first year of middle school.</description>

Of the girls in the control condition, 62% received individual counseling, 20% received family counseling, 22% received group counseling, 30% received mentoring, 37% received psychiatric support, and 40% received other counseling or therapy services (e.g., school counseling, academic support) during the first year of middle school. Note that many girls received more than one service, and therefore the percentages listed above exceed 100%. Child Welfare caseworkers managed each case and were responsible for making all decisions on referrals to community resources, including individual and family therapy and parenting classes.</description>

        <description>Internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 12 and 24 months were measured with caregiver report on the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment (ASEBA). This widely used checklist for psychopathological behaviors includes scales for behaviors such as Anxious/Depressed; Withdrawn; Somatic Complaints; Thought Problems; Attention Problems; Aggressive Behavior; Rule-Breaking Behavior; and Intrusive. The ASEBA has been shown to have both construct and content validity in the literature. For the present study, raw scores for the internalizing and externalizing symptoms subscales were used. Scores at 12 and 24 months were combined and averaged (mean). Units on a scale. Range = 0-66. Higher scores indicate higher levels of internalizing or externalizing problems.</description>

        <title>Participation in Risky Sexual Behaviors</title>
        <description>Eight items from the girls’ in-person interviews were used to assess health risking sexual behavior at the 36-month followup. The girls reported on items such as touching a boy’s body above or below the waist, having sexual intercourse, having sex with someone who they just met, or having sex with someone using drugs in the past 12 months. Positive answers to these items were totaled to represent the cumulative number of health-risking sexual behaviors. The frequency of the cumulative number of risky sexual acts ranged from 0 to 7. Units on a scale. Higher scores indicate more health-risking sexual behaviors.</description>

        <title>Social Competence</title>
        <description>Prosocial behavior was measured with a subscale from the Parent Daily Report (PDR; Chamberlain &amp; Reid, 1987). The PDR was administered individually by telephone to foster parents on 3 consecutive or closely spaced days (1–3 days apart) at each assessment. A trained interviewer asked the foster parent whether a list of prosocial behaviors took place during the previous 24 hr (yes/no format). The prosocial scale was computed based on nine items, such as “cleans up after herself” and “do a favor for someone.” The PDR was designed to avoid the potential bias of aggregate recall of frequency estimates. Studies have reported concurrent and predictive validity of the PDR checklist. The scores were averaged (mean) across calls from 3 days. Scores on prosocial behavior at 6 and 12 months were averaged and the mean across both time points was used in analysis. Units on a scale. Range = 0-9. Higher scores indicate more prosocial behavior.</description>

            <description>The girls and caregivers in the control condition received the usual services provided by the child welfare system, including services such as referrals to individual or family therapy, parenting classes for biological parents, and case monitoring. Of the girls in the control condition, 62% received individual counseling, 20% received family counseling, 22% received group counseling, 30% received mentoring, 37% received psychiatric support, and 40% received other counseling or therapy services (e.g., school counseling, academic support) during the first year of middle school. Note that many girls received more than one service, and therefore the percentages listed above exceed 100%. Child Welfare caseworkers managed each case and were responsible for making all decisions on referrals to community resources, including individual and family therapy and parenting classes.</description>

          <title>Social Competence</title>
          <description>Prosocial behavior was measured with a subscale from the Parent Daily Report (PDR; Chamberlain &amp; Reid, 1987). The PDR was administered individually by telephone to foster parents on 3 consecutive or closely spaced days (1–3 days apart) at each assessment. A trained interviewer asked the foster parent whether a list of prosocial behaviors took place during the previous 24 hr (yes/no format). The prosocial scale was computed based on nine items, such as “cleans up after herself” and “do a favor for someone.” The PDR was designed to avoid the potential bias of aggregate recall of frequency estimates. Studies have reported concurrent and predictive validity of the PDR checklist. The scores were averaged (mean) across calls from 3 days. Scores on prosocial behavior at 6 and 12 months were averaged and the mean across both time points was used in analysis. Units on a scale. Range = 0-9. Higher scores indicate more prosocial behavior.</description>

        <description>“Cups” task (Weller et al., 2007). On each trial, participants see 2 arrays with equal number of X cups (2, 3, or 5) each. On gain trials, participants informed that under each cup in one array is 1 quarter, and the other array includes 1 cup with Y quarters (either 2, 3, or 5), but the other cups have 0 quarters. Choosing from the riskless side leads to a sure gain of 1 quarter while choosing the risky side can lead to gain of Y quarters or no quarters. On loss trials, participants shown that choosing cup from 1 array will lead to 1 quarter taken away while choosing cup from other array will lead to no quarters or Y quarters taken. Cups task consists of 54 trials of 3 trials each of all combinations of 2 levels of domain (gain, loss). Expected Value Sensitivity (EV) calculated by subtracting proportion of risky choices made when EV actually favored the sure choice from proportion of risky choices made on trials where EV favored risky option.

Of the girls in the control condition, 62% received individual counseling, 20% received family counseling, 22% received group counseling, 30% received mentoring, 37% received psychiatric support, and 40% received other counseling or therapy services (e.g., school counseling, academic support) during the first year of middle school. Note that many girls received more than one service, and therefore the percentages listed above exceed 100%. Child Welfare caseworkers managed each case and were responsible for making all decisions on referrals to community resources, including individual and family therapy and parenting classes.</description>
