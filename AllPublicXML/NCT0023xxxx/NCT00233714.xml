    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to assess safety and effectiveness of double dose
      sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITY stents in diabetic patients with a de novo native coronary
      lesion, as compared to single dose sirolimus-eluting Bx VELOCITYâ„¢ stents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient must be minimum 18 years of age;

          2. Patients must be previously diagnosed with diabetes with documented treatment with
             insulin, oral medications, or diet for a minimum of 3 months;

          3. Diagnosis of angina pectoris as defined by Canadian Cardiovascular Society
             Classification (CCS I, II, III, IV) OR unstable angina pectoris (Braunwald
             Classification B&amp;C, I-II-III) OR patients with documented silent ischemia;

          4. Treatment of one lesion in a native coronary artery. The treated lesion will be the
             one with the highest % diameter stenosis by visual estimate. Additional study stents
             may be used for procedural complications such as dissections. Multivessel treatment is
             permissible in non-target vessels; however, additional lesions may only be treated
             with commercial stents. If other non-target lesions are treated with commercial stents
             during the index procedure, they must be successfully treated prior to the study
             lesion;

          5. The target vessel is 2.5 mm and 3.5mm in diameter (visual estimate);

          6. The target lesion is &lt;30 mm in length (visual estimate) located in a native coronary
             artery;

          7. Target lesion stenosis is &gt;50% and &lt;100% (TIMI I) (visual estimate);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has experienced a Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction with documented
             total CK&gt;2 times normal within the preceding 24 hours and the CK and CK-MB enzymes
             remains above normal at the time of treatment;

          2. Patients admitted for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis &gt; 2 times in the past six
             months (Brittle Diabetics);

          3. Ejection fraction 30%;

          4. Impaired renal function (creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL);
