    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression Severity Score (CGI-S) From Baseline Through End of Study- - Safety Population.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 348</time_frame>
    <description>Baseline is Day 1 of the study, prior to first dose. CGI-S is a questionnaire completed by the clinician which evaluates the severity of mental illness of a participant at a specific point in time. It consists of 7 categories with the lower categories indicating less illness and the higher numbered categories indicating greater severity of illness: 0=not assessed; 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3= mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Death, Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), Adverse Events (AEs), and Discontinuation Due to an AE - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 348</time_frame>
    <description>AE=any new unfavorable symptom, sign, or disease or worsening of a preexisting condition that may not have a causal relationship with treatment. SAE=a medical event that at any dose results in death, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or drug dependency/abuse; is life-threatening, an important medical event, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect; or requires or prolongs hospitalization. Treatment-related=having certain, probable, possible, or missing relationship to study drug.</description>

    <measure>Mean Exposure to Aripiprazole at Days 541 to 630, Days 721 to 810 and Days 1081 to 1170 - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 to Day 1170</time_frame>
    <description>Mean exposure is mean number of milligrams per day (mg/day) of aripiprazole administered to the participants.</description>

    <description>Clinically relevant abnormalities: greater than, equal to (&gt;=); less than, equal to (&lt;=). Upper limits of normal (ULN). milligram per deciliter (mg/dL); milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L); nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL);outside of normal range inclusive (): alanine transaminase (ALT&gt;= 3*ULN; aspartate aminotransferase (AST &gt;=3*ULN; alkaline phosphatase &gt;=3*ULN; total bilirubin &gt;= 2.0 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen &gt;= 30mg/dL; calcium (8.40 - 9.90 mg/dL); chloride (85.00 - 108.00 mEq/L); total cholesterol (140.0 - 200.0 mg/dL); cholesterol high density (HDL) and low density (LDL) lipoprotein (39.0 - 116.0 mg/dL); creatine kinase (15.0 - 170.0 U/L); creatinine &gt;=2.0 mg/dL; prolactin (3.00 - 29.00 ng/mL); sodium (136.0 - 144.0 mEq/L); Glucose fasting (70.0 - 110.0 mg/dL); triglycerides (58.0 - 164.0 mg/dL; uric acid male &gt;= 10.5, female &gt;= 8.5mg/dL. Baseline is Day 1 of the study, prior to study drug administration.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Relevant Hematology Laboratory Abnormalities During Treatment - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 348)</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically relevant laboratory abnormality: Hemoglobin male &lt;= 11.5 g/dL; female &lt;= 9.5 g/dL. Hematocrit male &lt;= 37 and 3 point decrease from baseline (BL); female &lt;=32 and 3 point decrease from BL. Leukocytes &lt;= 2800 mm^3 or &gt;= 16000 mm^3; eosinophils &gt;=10%. Baseline is Day 1 of the study, prior to study drug administration.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Relevant Vital Sign Abnormality During Treatment - Safety Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to end of study (Week 348)</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs include standing, sitting and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and standing, sitting and supine heart rate, measured in beats per minute. Baseline (BL) is Day 1 of the study, prior to study drug administration. Criteria for identifying vital sign values as clinically relevant: Systolic blood pressure (criterion value=90-180 mmHg) change relative to baseline: increase of greater than, equal to (&gt;=) 20; decrease of &gt;= 20 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure (criterion value=50 - 105 mmHg) change relative to baseline: increase of &gt;= 15; decrease of &gt;= 15 mmHg. Heart rate (criterion value=50-120bpm) change relative to baseline: increase &gt;=15; decreased &gt;= 15 mmHg. To be clinically significantly abnormal: value must meet the criterion value and also represent a change from the participant's pre-treatment value of at least the magnitude shown in the change relative to baseline.</description>

It consists of 7 categories with the lower categories indicating less illness and the higher numbered categories indicating greater severity of illness: 0=not assessed; 1=normal, not at all ill; 2=borderline mentally ill; 3= mildly ill; 4=moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6=severely ill; 7=among the most extremely ill.</description>
          <population>Safety Population - all participants who received at least one dose of drug. N=number of participants who were analyzed at each specific time point. Baseline N=97, 20 for first and second arms, respectively.</population>

        <description>Vital signs include standing, sitting and supine systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and standing, sitting and supine heart rate, measured in beats per minute. Baseline (BL) is Day 1 of the study, prior to study drug administration. Criteria for identifying vital sign values as clinically relevant: Systolic blood pressure (criterion value=90-180 mmHg) change relative to baseline: increase of greater than, equal to (&gt;=) 20; decrease of &gt;= 20 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure (criterion value=50 - 105 mmHg) change relative to baseline: increase of &gt;= 15; decrease of &gt;= 15 mmHg. Heart rate (criterion value=50-120bpm) change relative to baseline: increase &gt;=15; decreased &gt;= 15 mmHg. To be clinically significantly abnormal: value must meet the criterion value and also represent a change from the participant's pre-treatment value of at least the magnitude shown in the change relative to baseline.</description>
