  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label trial of Taxotere® + ZD1839 in elderly patients with Stage
      III-b or IV NSCLC who have received no prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. Patients
      with prior adjuvant chemotherapy were allowed to enroll on this trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to test the efficacy and tolerability of a standard chemotherapy
      agent, Docetaxel, in combination with an oral agent, Iressa, in elderly patients with
      advanced stage lung cancer. Current practices utilize two chemotherapeutic medications that
      may result in increased toxicities and poor outcomes in the elderly population. Treatment
      consists of an infusion of docetaxel every 21 days for four doses while taking Iressa every
      day. A computed tomography (CT) scan will measure disease response after two cycles. Response
      determines continuation of treatment. Lab work will be collected before every treatment. Side
      effect information will also be collected at every visit. Once the infusion phase of the
      study is completed, a maintenance phase of taking just the Iressa begins and disease
      assessment occurs every two months. This period will last until disease progression is
      demonstrated.

    <description>ORR: Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR). Response rate for Elderly (&gt; 70 years) previously untreated patients with Stage IIIb (With Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPE)) or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving Taxotere + ZD1839. Best clinical response to treatment with combination was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.0): * Complete Response (CR)- Disappearance of all target lesions; * Partial Response (PR)- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; * Progressive Disease (PD)- At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; * Stable Disease (SD)- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must be greater than or equal to 70 years of age.

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is
             Stage IIIb (with pleural effusions) or Stage IV.

          -  Patients must be previously untreated for metastatic disease but may have received
             previous adjuvant chemotherapy more than six months prior to registration. Patients
             may also have received radiation therapy for advanced disease; however there should be
             measurable disease outside the radiation ports.

          -  Disease must be at least unidimensionally measurable. Lesions, which are located
             within a previously irradiated field, are not considered measurable unless there is a
             documented growth in its size.

          -  Patients must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of
             0 or 1.

          -  Laboratory values must be as follows: White blood cell count greater than or equal to
             3,000/mm^3; Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mm^3; Platelets
             greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3; Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.0 x
             institutional upper normal limit; Serum creatinine less than or equal to 2 x
             institutional upper normal limit; aspartic transaminase (AST) or ALANINE TRANSAMINASE

             serum albumin).

          -  Patients with combined alkaline phosphatase, AST and/or ALT elevations will not be
             allowed to enroll on protocol.

          -  Patients must have recovered from all acute toxicities from previous therapy,
             excluding alopecia.

          -  In keeping with the policies of the institution, patients must sign an informed
             consent form indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of this

             guardian signs the consent form after a full informed consent process is completed.
             Whenever feasible the cognitively impaired person will also give assent to
             participation in the trial.

          -  Male Patients with female sexual partners in the reproductive age group who refuse to
             use effective methods of contraception will be excluded from the trial.

          -  Patients with concurrent serious infections (i.e., receiving an intravenous
             antibiotic) are not eligible.

          -  Patients with an unstable or serious concurrent medical condition are excluded.

             within 30 days of Day 1 of trial treatment.

          -  Patients with a history of other cancers except basal cell skin cancers, carcinoma of
             the cervix in situ, or curatively-treated cancers with &gt; 2 years non-recurrence prior
             to entry in the trial. Patients with a history of other cancers must have histological
             confirmation that current disease is compatible with diagnosis of NSCLC.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt;2. (Peripheral neuropathy must be &lt; grade 1)

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic

Response rate for Elderly (&gt; 70 years) previously untreated patients with Stage IIIb (With Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPE)) or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving Taxotere + ZD1839. Best clinical response to treatment with combination was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST V1.0): * Complete Response (CR)- Disappearance of all target lesions; * Partial Response (PR)- At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum LD; * Progressive Disease (PD)- At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions; * Stable Disease (SD)- Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.</description>
