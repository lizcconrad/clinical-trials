  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many people with type 2 diabetes cannot maintain target blood glucose levels when taking a
      single oral drug. The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety and
      effectiveness of vildagliptin, an unapproved drug, compared to that of pioglitazone in
      lowering overall blood glucose levels when added to metformin in people with type 2 diabetes
      not at target blood glucose levels on metformin alone.
