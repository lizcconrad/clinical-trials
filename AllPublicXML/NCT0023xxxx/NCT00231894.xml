  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study with an approved drug for treating type 2 diabetes, for its effects on
      treating glucose and lipid abnormalities in patients being treated with first or
      second-generation antipsychotics, and comparison of effects of this drug with another
      treatment lifestyle modification. Patients who meet inclusion criteria will be treated with
      pioglitazone for 12 weeks. They will be evaluated for fasting glucose and lipids,
      glucose-tolerance tests, and neurocognitive battery and tests of verbal memory at baseline
      and during treatment with pioglitazone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of pioglitazone added to weight-lifestyle
      intervention vs. placebo plus lifestyle intervention on reversing or reducing impaired or
      abnormal triglycerides, HDL and glucose metabolism in schizophrenics treated with first or
      second-generation antipsychotics.. Another aim is to examine the effects of impaired glucose
      metabolism on verbal memory and other cognitive function in schizophrenic patients treated
      with these medications and the relationship to improvements in impaired glucose metabolism to
      impairments in cognitive function. Clozapine and olanzapine, and some other first or
      second-generation antipsychotics effective for treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorders,
      have been reported to be associated with increased incidence of diabetic type metabolic
      abnormalities, decreases in insulin sensitivity, and abnormal glucose tolerance tests. This
      can lead to the development of type 2 diabetes and also abnormal lipid metabolic levels which
      can lead to atherosclerotic changes and increased risk of cardiovascular disease and other
      diabetes related complications. Drug treatments which could reduce or correct these diabetic
      metabolic changes would permit many patients to continue to receive the benefits of these
      antipsychotic medications with reduced drug-induced comorbidity. Previous research using
      non-psychotic subjects has shown that diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are associated
      with cognitive impairments, especially in verbal memory, and provides a rationale for testing
      whether corrections of impaired glucose metabolism are associated with cognitive improvements
      in schizophrenic patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients will be males or females, 18-70 yrs of age, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia
             or schizoaffective disorder, and currently being treated with olanzapine or clozapine.

          2. Patients will have evidence of:

               1. glucose levels indicating at least impaired fasting glucose: fasting glucose 100
                  mg/dL or 2 hr glucose tolerance test 140 mg/dL, or current treatment with oral
                  antidiabetic drugs with history of hyperglycemia;

               2. Triglyceride levels &gt; 120 mg/dL and/or HDL levels &lt; 40 mg/dL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Diabetes mellitus, type 1

          2. Recent diabetic ketoacidosis;

          3. Patients not currently treated with oral antidiabetic drugs but fasting is glucose 140
             mg/dL [WHO criteria] on repeat testing in last three months, or random blood glucose
             &gt;200 mg/dL plus 2 hr glucose on GTT &gt;200 mg/dL; (these patients may need more
             immediate treatment with antidiabetic drugs and it is less certain if weight-lifestyle
             treatment would be effective in treating such high glucose levels);

          4. Patients with active liver disease with clinical abnormalities which need current
             treatment, or liver enzymes (Alt) 3 times upper limit for normal values in chart
             records in last year, or patients who are recorded as positive for hepatitis C;

          5. Congestive heart failure (Class III or IV cardiac status) or history of MI in medical
             record (because pioglitazone can increase blood volume slightly);

          6. Hematocrit greater than 10% below normal (hematocrit may be decreased 2 to 4% due to
             increased plasma volume);

          7. Female patients on current oral contraceptives (because pioglitazone may interfere
             with effects of some oral contraceptives);

          8. Patients taking ketoconazole,

          9. Patients who have started on atorvastatin or gemfibrozil in the past 2 months or have
             had a dose increase in atorvastatin in the last month (since these drugs can also
             lower triglycerides and raise HDL, recent start of therapy with these drugs could be a
             confound).

         10. Patients are not concomitantly treated with aripiprazole or ziprasidone.
