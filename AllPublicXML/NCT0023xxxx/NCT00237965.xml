        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects will be excluded from the study if they have significant skin disease which
             would not allow manipulation of their photographs consistent with the rest of the
             subjects.

          -  Since the study instructions are in English, Non-English speakers will be excluded.

          -  Those with co-morbidity sufficiently severe to prevent them from being able to perform
             a SSE will be excluded.

          -  In addition, those with cognitive impairment who are unable to give informed consent,
             or to understand the study instructions given to them, will be excluded.
