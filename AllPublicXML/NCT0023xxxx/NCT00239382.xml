    <textblock>
      The objective of this trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of 15 mg meloxicam i.m.
      once daily compared with 15 mg meloxicam tablets once daily p.o. in patients with Rheumatoid
      arthritis over a time period of 7 days.

    <textblock>
      This was a randomized (1:1), open-label, multi-center, active-control, parallel-group study
      to compare the efficacy of 15 mg meloxicam i.m. once daily compared with 15 mg meloxicam
      tablets once daily p.o. in patients with rheumatoid arthritis over a time period of 7 days.

      The primary endpoint:

        -  Patient's assessment of overall pain

        -  Patient's global assessment of disease activity

      The secondary endpoint:

        -  Tender/swollen joint count

        -  Investigator's global assessment of disease activity

        -  Patient's assessment of physical function

        -  Duration of morning stiffness

        -  Patient status with regard to change of arthritic condition assessed by the
           patient/investigator

        -  Onset of action

        -  Time to maximum pain relief

        -  Paracetamol consumption

        -  Withdrawals due to inadequate efficacy

        -  Final global assessment of efficacy by the patient/inveatigator

      Safety endpoints

        -  Local tolerability assessment of the injections by the patient/investigator

        -  Patient's /Investigator's assessment of overall tolerability

        -  Number, nature and severity of adverse events

        -  Laboratory investigations

        -  Withdrawals due to safety reasons

      Patients eligible for the trial who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who gave
      their informed consent were randomized to one of two treatment groups (i.e. meloxicam ampoule
      or meloxicam tablet).

      The study period totaled 8-14 days included screening, randomisation, study drug
      administration, and 7-day follow-up. The relevant assessment were performed on the day of
      randomisation and 7-day follow up.

      The primary endpoint: Pain on active movement,

      The secondary endpoint:

        -  Pain at rest

        -  Patient status with regard to change of arthritic condition assessed by the
           patient/investigator

        -  Patient's assessment of arthritic condition

        -  Onset of action

        -  Time to maximum pain relief

        -  Paracetamol consumption

        -  Withdrawals due to inadequate efficacy

        -  Final global assessment of efficacy by the patient/investigator

      Safety endpoints

        -  Local tolerability assessment of the injections by the patient/investigator

        -  Patient's /Investigator's assessment of overall tolerability

        -  Number, nature and severity of adverse events

        -  Laboratory investigations

        -  Withdrawals due to safety reasons

      Patients eligible for the trial who met all inclusion and exclusion criteria and who gave
      their informed consent were randomized to one of two treatment groups (i.e. meloxicam ampoule
      or meloxicam tablet).

      The study period totaled 8-14 days included screening, randomisation, study drug
      administration, and 7-day follow-up. The relevant assessment were performed on the day of
      randomisation and 7-day follow up.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The null hypothesis of interest is that the primary endpoint for meloxicam ampoule is
      inferior to oral meloxicam. The alternative is that meloxicam ampoule is noninferior to the
      oral meloxicam .

      Comparison(s):

        -  Patient's assessment of overall pain by VAS prior and after the treatment

        -  Patient's global assessment of disease activity by VAS prior and after the treatment
