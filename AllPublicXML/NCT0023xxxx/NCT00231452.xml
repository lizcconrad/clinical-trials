  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the effect of exposure to Plasmodium (P.) falciparum
      erythrocytic stage antigens during different periods of infancy on the development of
      naturally acquired immunity (NAI).

      Hypothesis: Exposure to P. falciparum prior to 5 months of age does not result in the
      development of NAI, while exposure to P. falciparum after 5 months of age leads to the
      development of NAI. The risks of clinical malaria and anaemia during the second year of life
      will be compared between cohorts, as well as their correlations with the type and quality of
      immune responses (antibodies to several P. falciparum antigens, cytokines), oxidative stress
      markers and host genetic factors. These results should shed light on the determinants of the
      development of anti-P. falciparum responses early in life and the potential constraints to
      early life immunisation.
