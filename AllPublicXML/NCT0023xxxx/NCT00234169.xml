  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are used to support the administration of high dose
      chemotherapy for a range of human cancers. For a safe HSC transplantation, a minimum of 5
      million HSC per kilogram are required. HSC are collected from the bone marrow by using drugs
      such as G-CSF (filgrastim) which 'mobilize' them from the bone marrow into the bloodstream.
      HSC are collected from the bloodstream using an apheresis machine. Between 5 and 60% of
      patients fail to mobilize the minimum HSC dose required for safe transplantation, and this
      trial is investigating a way to enhance mobilization to overcome this problem. This trial
      aims to determine if a new vitamin A derivative is capable of enhancing HSC mobilization when
      used in conjunction with G-CSF. Patients will undergo two mobilization procedures. They will
      be given G-CSF alone, or a combination of the study drug plus G-CSF, and their stem cells
      will be collected. A comparison group of patients will be given G-CSF alone for both
      mobilizations. Stem cells collected from patients in this trial will be frozen and stored
      until they are required for transplantation into that patient. At that time, patients will be
      monitored for how well they recover from their high dose chemotherapy and HSC
      transplantation.

    <description>VTP195183: 60mg/m2 orally daily G-CSF: 10mcg/kg/day subcutaneously Provision is made for dose reduction of VTP195183 in the event of unexpected dose-limiting toxicities G-CSF10mcg/kg/day will commence on day 1 and will continue until the peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ count falls below baseline, or below 5 x 106/L, whichever happens first.
Patients will be treated with VTP195183 alone at 60mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 7. On day 8 VTP195183 will be continued and G-CSF10mcg/kg/day will be added. VTP195183 plus G-CSF will continue until the peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ count falls below baseline, or below 5 x 106/L, whichever happens first.</description>
