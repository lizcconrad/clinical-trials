      The ASSURE Study will evaluate shock conversion performance when programming the first shock
      of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillation (ICD) is based on an implant test consisting of
      either 1) a single induction of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and subsequent demonstration
      conversion success at 14 J or 2) an upper limit of vulnerability (ULV) test at 14 J.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who meet current indications for an ICD including cardiac resynchronization
             therapy (CRT) devices

          -  Patients who sign and date a Patient Informed Consent form prior to the implant visit

          -  Patients who remain in the clinical care of the enrolling physician in approved
             centers

          -  Patients who receive only left-sided pectoral implantations with the ICD lead placed
             in the right ventricular apex

          -  Patients who have a minimum R wave of at least 7 mV; or for ICD replacement, patients
             who have a minimum chronic R wave of at least 5 mV

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are involved in Non-Invasive Programming Stimulation (NIPS) studies

          -  Patients who undergo lead repositioning

          -  Patients who are expected to receive a heart transplant during the duration of the
             study

          -  Patients who have or who are likely to receive a tricuspid valve prosthesis

          -  Patients who are currently enrolled in another investigational study or registry that
             would directly impact the treatment or outcome of the current study

          -  Patients who are younger than 18 years of age

          -  Patients who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the study

          -  Patients whose life expectancy is less than 12 months

          -  Patients who are mentally incompetent and cannot sign a Patient Informed Consent form
             or comply with the study
