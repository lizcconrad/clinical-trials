  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The co-primary endpoints are migration of the OptEase™ IVC filter as determined by abdominal x-ray at 1-month post-implantation and symptomatic thrombosis at 1-month post-implantation. Migration is defined as &gt; 2 cm movement in either cranial or caudal</measure>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess major adverse event rates related to the filter or filter procedure, up to 6-month follow-up, in aggregate and individually. Major adverse events are defined as 1) death, 2) pulmonary embolism, 3) symptomatic thrombosis, 4) caval penetration</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the longer-term stability of the filter defined by the lack of migration as seen on abdominal x-ray at 6-month post-implantation. Migration is defined as &gt; 2 cm movement in either cranial or caudal direction as seen on abdominal x-ray compar</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the clinical success of the filter up to 6-month follow-up. Clinical success is defined as the absence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) evaluated clinically at post-implantation, 1- and 6-months post-implantation.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the technical success of the filter up to 6-month follow-up. Technical success is defined as the filter successfully deployed at the intended site in the IVC with the correct orientation.</measure>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess significant tilting (&gt; 15° off the axis of the IVC) up to 6-month follow-up.</measure>

    <measure>To assess filter fracture up to 6-month follow-up.</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  · Pulmonary thromboembolism when anticoagulants are contraindicated.

               -  Failure of anticoagulant therapy in thromboembolic diseases.

               -  Emergency treatment following massive pulmonary embolism where anticipated
                  benefits of conventional therapy are reduced.

               -  Chronic, recurrent pulmonary embolism where anticoagulant therapy has failed or
                  is contraindicated.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  · Patients with risk of septic embolism.

               -  Patients with uncontrolled infectious disease.

               -  Patients with an IVC diameter &gt; 30 mm.

               -  Patients contraindicated for procedures under fluoroscopy.

               -  Patients with demonstrated hypersensitivity to one or more of the components of
                  the OptEase™ filter
