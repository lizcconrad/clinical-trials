  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of 50 patients to establish whether there is a potential role for MRI
      perfusion in the detection of locally recurrent or persistent prostate carcinoma after
      previous treatment with radiotherapy. All subjects will be patients who have had localised
      prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and have already agreed to undergo a biopsy of the
      prostate to look at local control within the prostate as part of their management. The
      objective of the study is to establish whether there is a relationship between recurrent or
      persistent disease within the prostate and increased perfusion on MRI at these sites.
