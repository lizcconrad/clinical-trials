      This is a Phase IIIB, randomized, prospective, multicenter, single-country, open-label,
      controlled pilot trial designed to evaluate the effect of infliximab induction therapy on
      sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment with pegylated interferon alfa-2b plus
      ribavirin in a group of 96 therapy-naïve subjects with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV)
      infection and high serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha values.
