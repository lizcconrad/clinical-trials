      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of the 5HT2 receptor antagonist
      nefazadone in SAD, and to explore regional cerebral blood flow in patients with SAD when
      confronted with a personal phobic stimulus, using positron emission tomography (PET). Changes
      in cerebral blood flow were correlated with self-rated anxiety measures.
