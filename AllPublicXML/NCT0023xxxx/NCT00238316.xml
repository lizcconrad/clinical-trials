      RATIONALE: Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming, growing,
      or coming back. The use of letrozole may stop cancer from forming or coming back in
      postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer due to high breast density.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well letrozole works in preventing
      breast cancer in postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for breast cancer due to high
      breast density.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the proportion of postmenopausal women who are at increased risk for the
           development or recurrence of breast cancer, based on high breast density (≥ grade 4),
           who achieve a decrease in breast density of ≥ 1 grade after treatment with letrozole for
           1 year.

      Secondary

        -  Determine whether a decrease in breast density grade is sustained at 1 year in patients
           treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate plasma estrogen profile (E1, E1S, E2) with breast density grade at baseline in
           these patients.

        -  Determine the percentage of patients with breast tissue hyperplasia and atypical
           hyperplasia, as assessed by histopathological examination of breast tissue biopsies,
           before and after treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine the changes in estrogen profile from baseline, at 1 year, and 1 year after
           cessation of this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare changes in predetermined specific parameters of safety at the end of 1 year of
           treatment with this drug with baseline evaluations of these patients.

        -  Determine whether modifications of these predetermined specific parameters of safety are
           sustained 1 year after cessation of treatment with this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the general safety of 1 year of treatment with this drug in these patients.

        -  Compare the effects of this drug on menopause-specific quality of life of these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to breast density grade (4/6 vs 5/6 vs 6/6). Patients are randomized
      to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole once daily for 1 year in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 1 year in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Menopause-specific quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 12 and 24 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 months and 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (80 in arm I and 40 in arm II) will be accrued for
      this study within 12 months.
