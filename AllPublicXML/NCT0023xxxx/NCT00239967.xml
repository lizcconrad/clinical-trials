  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of rimonabant 20 mg on HDL (high density
      lipoprotein) cholesterol and on TG (triglycerides) plasma levels over a period of one year
      when prescribed with a hypocaloric diet (600 kcal deficit per day) in abdominally obese
      patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low HDL and/or high TG plasma levels). The secondary
      objectives are to evaluate specific metabolic parameters, visceral fat (in selected sites),
      safety and tolerability of rimonabant 20 mg.
