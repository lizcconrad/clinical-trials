  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is designed to answer the question: Is there an acute IGFBP-3 response in normal
      children?

      Our specific hypothesis states that under the influence of growth hormone secretagogues,
      intact IGFBP-3 molecule will undergo proteolysis and liberate IGFBP-3 fragments, along with
      other components of the ternary complex. This proteolysis will result in measurable rise in
      IGFBP-3, which will indicate the subject’s growth hormone status. Short children with growth
      hormone deficiency will not show an IGFBP-3 response.

      The diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency is problematic, given the shortcoming of the
      standard growth hormone stimulation test. This study is designed to investigate a new tool
      for the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency.

      Ten short, prepubertal children, who fulfill the inclusion criteria, will undergo a
      two-secretagogue standard growth hormone stimulation test, and an insulin like growth factor
      binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) stimulation test simultaneously. During this test, components of
      the ternary complex moieties, viz, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGFBP-3 and acid
      labile subunit (ALS) will also be measured along with growth hormone.

      The aim of this study is to detect an acute rise in IGFBP-3 of &gt;15% from baseline.

      The importance of this study is that it inculcates the specificity and improved sensitivity
      of stimulated IGFBP-3 in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency.
