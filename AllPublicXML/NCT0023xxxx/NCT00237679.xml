  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis and management of childhood dysphonia is a significant clinical problem;
      however, there have been few studies aimed at defining standard assessment methods for
      pediatric dysphonia. Accordingly, pediatric dysphonia is difficult to diagnose and it is
      difficult to quantify change following treatment. The long-term goal of this research program
      is to develop valid, responsive, reliable, and age-appropriate methods for assessing vocal
      pathology in children. In the present small grant, our objective is to define assessment
      methods that are appropriate for use in determining response to treatment. Our main focus,
      therefore, is the issue of assessment responsivity. The first specific aim is to develop a
      set of responsive measures of vocal pathology in school-aged children by inducing short-term
      change in vocal status via behavioral and medical management of extraesophageal reflux
      disease (EERD). Because we are treating children suspected of EERD, this study also presents
      the opportunity for examining the benefits of combined vocal hygiene and medical management
      in the treatment of pediatric EERD. Accordingly, our second specific aim is to determine
      predictive criteria for improvement in vocal status in dysphonic children suspected of EERD.
      Our hypothesis is that a particular set of measurements will emerge as particularly
      responsive to change in vocal pathology in this population, and will allow for informed
      prediction of degree of improvement with treatment. The proposed research is significant in
      filling a gap in knowledge in childhood dysphonia assessment and treatment, which are
      important clinical issues consistent with the mission and intent of the NIDCD. Because
      phonatory disorders in children may have lasting negative effects, studies geared toward
      accurate assessment and treatment are very important.
