      This project will expand current knowledge of reproductive biology in women with bipolar
      disorder as well as assessing the impact of lamotrigine use for the treatment of bipolar
      disorder on reproductive function. Specifically, this study examines mood over the menstrual
      cycle and ovulation for three consecutive menstrual cycles in women treated for bipolar I,
      II, or NOS (not otherwise specified) with lamotrigine. In addition, testosterone and lipid
      concentrations will be measured before the participant starts receiving lamotrigine, as well
      as six months after receiving lamotrigine.

    <description>This is a research study to determine how effective lamotrigine is in the treatment of bipolar disorder in women of reproductive age. Participants are between the ages of 18 and 45, have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and have indicated that they are about to begin or are considering treatment with lamotrigine. The purposes of this study are to explore the safety of lamotrigine in treating bipolar I disorder, bipolar II disorder, and rapid cycling bipolar disorder in women compared to other mood stabilizers and anti-depressants. In addition, this study aims to explore lamotrigine's effects on the association between the mood and the menstrual cycle and to compare the effects of various medications that participants receive for treatment of their illness in regards to reproductive hormone levels.</description>
