  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open, multicenter and prospective study to evaluate the impact of the treatment with
      zoledronic acid 4 mg, on the quality of life and the skeletal-related events in patients with
      prostate cancer and bone metastasis that responds to hormonal therapy. Zoledronic acid is
      given to patients in a 15 minute-infusion every 4 weeks until a skeletal-related event
      occurs.
