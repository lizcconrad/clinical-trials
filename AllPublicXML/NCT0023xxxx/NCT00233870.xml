  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this survey is to identify any concerns regarding the following efficacy and
      safety-related issues in clinical practice with the new drugs &quot;Fabrazyme for intravenous
      infusion 5mg&quot; and &quot;Fabrazyme for intravenous infusion 35mg&quot; and to confirm the safety of
      these products in long-term use in the clinical setting.

        1. New adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that cannot be predicted from the Precautions (in
           particular, clinically significant ADRs)

        2. The incidence of ADRs under the actual conditions of use of the drug

        3. Causal factors that might potentially affect safety

        4. Efficacy evaluation in long-term use

      This survey will be conducted in accordance with the approval condition established for
      Fabrazyme:

      &quot;To conduct a special surveillance of Efficacy and Safety in long term treatment and
      Pediatric with the drug.&quot;

      Medical institutions or physicians will be asked to periodically complete the survey forms
      for all patients registered. Survey forms include baseline information available, and then
      data collected every 6 months, as available including: demographic information, concomitant
      medications/therapy, treatment record, ECG, Echocardiogram, computed tomography scan /
      magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), Fabry symptoms, labs, functional disorder, blood
      concentration of GL-3, and anti-agalsidase beta antibody test (IgE testing) to survey whether
      the productions of antibodies to agalsidase beta is a causal factor of treatment-related
      reactions.

      The survey period shall be approximately 7 years from June 1, 2004 during which survey shall
      be undertaken as follows:

        -  The observation period for each patient shall range from 1 to about 7 years after
           starting treatment

        -  Registration period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2010

        -  Survey period: June 1, 2004 to March 31, 2011

      In institutions for which retrospective surveys are feasible, the survey period will trace
      back to the date of approval (January 29, 2004), as far as possible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in Japan with the indication of &quot;Fabry Disease&quot; and for whom the usual dosage
             and administration is 1mg of agalsidase beta (recombinant) per 1 kg body weight each
             time, administered by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks

          -  Because the efficacy evaluation of enzyme replacement therapy with Fabrazyme
             [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] will require the comparison of findings before
             and after the start of enzyme replacement therapy, the efficacy evaluation set will be
             defined as including patients using Fabrazyme [agalsidase beta (recombinant form)] for
             the first time in the post-marketing setting and those for whom it is possible to
             obtain retrospective data for before the start of enzyme replacement therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients registered in the post-marketing trials during the post-marketing clinical
             trial period.
