  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin affects many physiological processes through its anti-inflammatory actions. Various
      cancers, including prostate cancer, appear to utilize inflammatory signals to facilitate
      their growth and progression.

      We hypothesize that oral aspirin acts directly on prostate epithelial cells to alter
      COX-2-related metabolism and inhibit prostate cell growth.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men and is the second leading
      cause of cancer death among U.S. men. 221,000 new cases and 29,000 deaths are expected in
      2003. The incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis is increasing at 3% per year. Prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) screening has resulted in improvements in early diagnosis of prostate
      cancer. However, available treatments all may have a significant negative effect on quality
      of life.

      Studies have implicated a beneficial association between ASA use and a lower risk of other
      types of malignancies, including stomach, esophageal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer.
      There is significant evidence to suggest that aspirin has a protective effect against
      prostate cancer.
