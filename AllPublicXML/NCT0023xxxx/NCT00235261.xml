  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients scheduled for primary total hip replacement needs postoperative pain treatment: i.e.
      morphine. Unfortunately morphine has side-effects: nausea, vomiting, sedation and dizziness,
      which is unpleasant for the patients and sometimes keeps them at bed longer time than needed.
      We investigate in new combinations of analgesics for postoperative pain, hoping to minimize
      the need for morphine and improve the patients pain score after operation.

      We investigate the effect of paracetamol versus paracetamol + pregabalin versus paracetamol +
      pregabalin + dexamethasone on pain and morphine usage in the first 24 hours postoperatively
      in patients getting a new hip alloplastic.
