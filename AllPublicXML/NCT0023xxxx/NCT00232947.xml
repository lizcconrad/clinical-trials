  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine whether the immune responses induced by Fluviral, the
      investigational vaccine, are comparable to those induced by Fluzone, which is an influenza
      vaccine currently licensed in the U.S. The study focuses on persons 50 years old and over. In
      addition, the study will compare the rate of reactions to the two vaccines, and the general
      health of persons who receive them over the 42 days after immunization.

      Yearly influenza epidemics are responsible for excess hospitalizations and deaths in the
      elderly population, and also cause lost work and productivity among the healthy, working
      elderly. Fluviral, a product now licensed in Canada, is being tested to determine whether it
      is as active in causing immune responses, and as safe as a currently licensed U.S. vaccine in
      persons 50 y.o. and over.
