  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching purpose of the proposed study is to determine Secretin's (RG1068)
      psychophysiological effects on measures of motor learning, affective, and inhibitory
      information processing in individuals with schizophrenia. Motor learning will be assessed
      with a classical eye-blink conditioning procedure, requiring the learning of a reflexive
      eye-blink response to a weak puff of air to the eye.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter study of Secretin in refractory
      schizophrenics, we found that a patient who received Secretin (1.0 g/kg) intravenously,
      showed a marked improvement in eye blink conditioning following infusion. This subject also
      showed a clinical improvement of &gt; 20% on the Total Score and Total Negative Score of the
      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Therefore, the primary objective of this study
      is to confirm and extend this observation in a larger group of individuals with
      schizophrenia. In this 24 to 48 hour experiment, the acquisition and extinction of the
      conditioned blink response will be assessed in participants with schizophrenia who are
      randomly assigned to one of two double blind treatment groups: (1) subcutaneous saline or (2)
      subcutaneous Secretin (20 ug/kg). Enrolled participants will remain on their stable
      medication regime (i.e., psychotropic medications and related treatments will not be
      manipulated). Furthermore, given evidence that Secretin administration increases the
      amygdala's activation during experimental presentation of fear-related facial cue stimuli, we
      wish to also investigate the effects of the experimental agent on psychophysiological
      processes putatively related to amygdala function. Prepulse inhibition is a widely studied
      paradigm in the schizophrenia literature, thought to reflect disruption of early
      sensory-motor gating that is present in both individuals with schizophrenia and their
      unaffected biological relatives, and can be mediated by various limbic structures including
      the amygdala. Therefore, as a secondary aim, the effects of Secretin will be tested on affect
      modulation, pre-pulse inhibition, and pre-pulse facilitation of the acoustic startle response
      using common psychophysiological research procedures. These procedures are frequently used in
      our laboratory and are currently approved for our use by the IRBs at both IUPUI and IUB.
