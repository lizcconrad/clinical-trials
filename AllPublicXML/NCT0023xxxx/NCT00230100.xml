      The purpose of this study was to develop a gender-specific 12-session, manual-based relapse
      prevention group for women with substance use disorders (SUDs).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I trial compares single-gender Women's Recovery Group (WRG) and an effective
      control condition, mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC). WRG is a new 12-session
      women-focused, manual-based relapse-prevention group therapy that uses a cognitive-behavioral
      approach. It is a 90-minute structured relapse prevention weekly group therapy with both
      women-focused content as well as an all-women group composition. The control condition, Group
      Drug Counseling (GDC), consists of 12 weekly 90-minute structured sessions and is conducted
      in a mixed-gender group composition and has no women-focused content. The GDC was chosen as
      the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment
      as usual within the community. Both groups stress abstinence. Women are randomly assigned to
      one of the two conditions and the groups are conducted in a rolling group, semi-open format.

      The treatment manual for a Women's Recovery Group (WRG) focused on the themes that are
      relevant to women with SUDs. There was an emphasis on educating patients about treatment and
      relapse prevention in a context that is relevant to women. The manual combined therapist
      information and instructions with patient worksheets, handouts and skills practices. The
      treatment intervention was conducted twice in a pre-pilot study led by study investigators.
      The investigators then conducted a pilot study in which outcomes among subjects receiving the
      treatment intervention were compared with outcomes of subjects who received the standard
      mixed-gender Group Drug Counseling (GDC), chosen to approximate treatment in the community.

      The study hypothesis was that the single-gender group composition and women-focused group
      content would result in better treatment outcomes, including decrease number of days of
      substance use compared with baseline during follow-up, reduced substance use, and lengthened
      time to relapse, compared with the mixed-gender control.

    <time_frame>In-treatment phase (month 1-3), Post-treatment phase (month 4-6, 9)</time_frame>
    <description>This represents the change from baseline in the mean number of days per month of any substance use (i.e. drug and/or alcohol). Days of substance use was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline (assessing for the 60 days prior to the baseline interview) and then monthly for months 1-6 (months 1-3 were in-treatment assessments and months 4-6 were post-treatment follow-up assessments), and month 9 (also a post-treatment follow-up assessment). We implemented a general mixed model analysis of variance (MMANOVA), which models the means per group over the respective time period and the covariance between the repeated measures over the assessments. Both the in-treatment and post-treatment time frames were compared to baseline substance use data.</description>

    <time_frame>In-treatment phase (month 1-3), Post-treatment phase (month 4-6, 9)</time_frame>
    <description>This represents the change from baseline in mean composite scores of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol section. The ASI was administered at baseline (assessing for the 60 days prior to the baseline interview) and then monthly for months 1-6 (months 1-3 were in-treatment assessments and months 4-6 were post-treatment follow-up assessments), and month 9 (also a post-treatment follow-up assessment). We implemented a general mixed model analysis of variance (MMANOVA), which models the means per group over the respective time period and the covariance between the repeated measures over the assessments. Both the in-treatment and post-treatment time frames were compared to baseline substance use data.
The ASI is a widely employed multidimensional assessment of substance-related problems. Scores range from 0-1 where higher scores reflect higher addiction severity.</description>

        <title>Change in Mean Days of Any Substance Use for Women</title>
        <description>This represents the change from baseline in the mean number of days per month of any substance use (i.e. drug and/or alcohol). Days of substance use was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline (assessing for the 60 days prior to the baseline interview) and then monthly for months 1-6 (months 1-3 were in-treatment assessments and months 4-6 were post-treatment follow-up assessments), and month 9 (also a post-treatment follow-up assessment). We implemented a general mixed model analysis of variance (MMANOVA), which models the means per group over the respective time period and the covariance between the repeated measures over the assessments. Both the in-treatment and post-treatment time frames were compared to baseline substance use data.</description>

            <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance abuse antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances of abuse; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>

The number of drinks per drinking day was measured using the Timeline Follow-Back at baseline (assessing for the 60 days prior to the baseline interview) and then monthly for months 1-6 (months 1-3 were in-treatment assessments and months 4-6 were post-treatment follow-up assessments), and month 9 (also a post-treatment follow-up assessment). We implemented a general mixed model analysis of variance (MMANOVA), which models the means per group over the respective time period and the covariance between the repeated measures over the assessments. Both the in-treatment and post-treatment time frames were compared to baseline substance use data.</description>

            <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance abuse antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

        <description>This represents the change from baseline in mean composite scores of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) alcohol section. The ASI was administered at baseline (assessing for the 60 days prior to the baseline interview) and then monthly for months 1-6 (months 1-3 were in-treatment assessments and months 4-6 were post-treatment follow-up assessments), and month 9 (also a post-treatment follow-up assessment). We implemented a general mixed model analysis of variance (MMANOVA), which models the means per group over the respective time period and the covariance between the repeated measures over the assessments. Both the in-treatment and post-treatment time frames were compared to baseline substance use data.
The ASI is a widely employed multidimensional assessment of substance-related problems. Scores range from 0-1 where higher scores reflect higher addiction severity.</description>

Questions were answered on a 4-point scale where 1 reflected negative feelings and 4 reflected positive feelings. Participants' scores are calculated by adding up the numbers assigned to their chosen answers. Therefore, scores can range between 12 and 48, with higher scores reflecting greater satisfaction.
The CSQ was administered at week 3, 6, 9, and 12 while participants were in treatment. Scores represent calculated averages of the group averages for week 3, week 6, week 9, and week 12.</description>

            <description>The Women's Recovery Group (WRG) is a manual-based group therapy for women heterogeneous with respect to their substance use disorder, co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma history, age, and stage of life. The WRG is a 12-session, structured relapse-prevention group therapy that utilizes a cognitive behavioral approach and includes gender-specific content and single-gender group composition. Individual session content was derived from research on gender-specific substance abuse antecedents, consequences, and treatment outcomes. The overall goals of the treatment are to (1) promote abstinence from all substances including alcohol; (2) improve understanding of specific aspects of SUDs, recovery, and relapse that are relevant to women, and (3) help participants with skills and strategies useful in preventing relapse and promoting recovery.</description>

            <description>Group Drug Counseling (GDC) is a standard 12-week, 90-minute mixed-gender group therapy. The overall goals of GDC are to 1) help patients to achieve abstinence from all substances of abuse; 2) educate patients regarding recovery from substance use disorders; 3) increase patients’ self-awareness of the problems that their substance use disorder has caused; 4) encourage patients to give mutual support; and 5) help patients learn new ways to cope with problems in order to prevent relapse. The GDC was chosen as the comparison group to approximate group drug counseling that is consistent with treatment as usual within the community.</description>
