  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypofractionated intensity modulated and image guided radiotherapy (HypoIGRT) with fewer
      high-fraction-size treatments would be beneficial for prostate cancer because it would
      deliver a larger biological-equivalent dose to the tumor than would conventional treatment in
      1.8-2.0 Gy fractions, while maintaining a similar or lower incidence of late normal tissue
      reactions. Thus, the investigators aim to assess the hypothesis that HypoIGRT treatment for
      localized prostate cancer will improve the therapeutic ratio by either:

        1. Reducing normal tissue, mainly genitourinary and gastrointestinal, toxicity and / or

        2. Improving tumour control, mainly freedom from biochemical failure survival.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator chose to study a HypoIGRT regimen, in participants with prostate
      adenocarcinoma, tumor which is considered to present a low α / β, and therefore benefit from
      this approach.

      Primary Outcome Measures:

      1. Acute and late radiation induced toxicities.

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

        1. Freedom from prostate cancer recurrence - freedom from biochemical failure survival;

        2. Cause specific and overall survival

        3. Aspects of quality of life and health economics

      Study Design:

      Allocation: Prospective allocation Endpoint Classification: Feasibility Study (Toxicity
      assessment) Intervention Model: Single Assignment Masking: Open Label Primary Purpose:
      Treatment

      Eligibility

      Ages Eligible for Study: 18 Years and older Genders Eligible for Study: Both Accepts Healthy
      Volunteers: No
