  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression (Major Depressive Disorder; MDD) has been dubbed &quot;the common cold among the mental
      illnesses&quot; and it is also a highly recurrent disorder. Secondary prevention has been
      identified as a key goal in the long-term management of depression. High recurrence rate
      suggests that there are specific vulnerability factors that increase people's risk for
      developing repeated episodes of the disorder. Preventive strategies should identify and
      ameliorate these factors to reduce the individual's risk of subsequent episodes. Biased
      attention for emotional stimuli is central to the cognitive model where increased sensitivity
      to negative cues is believed to fuel the negative thoughts and feelings in depression and
      play a key role in maintaining the illness. Selective biases in attention can be modified by
      a simple computerized technique; The Attention Bias Modification Task (ABM). This project
      aims to investigate whether ABM can reduce surrogate and clinical markers of relapse in a
      large group highly vulnerable to depressive episodes. The effects of ABM, immediately after
      the two weeks intervention, on three key risk factors for depression will be studied:
      Residual symptoms, cortisol awakening response and emotion regulation strategies. The
      participants will be followed up after 1 month, 6 months and 12 months. The hypothesis that
      ABM will reduce subsequent episodes of low mood over the following 12 months in this group in
      a manner predicted by early changes in these risk factors will be investigated. It will also
      be tested if such effects in the lab may be dependent on candidate genes which affect
      serotonin reuptake and which have been implicated in malleability and emotional learning.
      Effects on underlying neural correlates of emotion regulation will be studied in an fMRI
      experiment in a sub-sample and which will also be stratified by serotonin transporter
      genotype (see also NCT02931487). The predictive value of meta cognitions related to
      rumination and the possible mediating effects of automatic thoughts and perceived stress will
      also be investigated in a sub group (see also NCT02648165).

      The characterization of the cognitive, genetic and neural mechanisms underlying the ABM
      effect will have key implications for future treatment development and combination with other
      treatment modalities like pharmacotherapy.
