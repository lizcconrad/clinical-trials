  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 trial in two parts. Part A is a prospective, randomized, double-masked,
      vehicle controlled, paired-eye study in approximately 16 subjects to evaluate safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of elamipretide 1.0% topical ophthalmic solution in patients with
      FCED presenting with mild to moderate corneal edema. Part B is a prospective, randomized
      double-masked, vehicle controlled study in approximately 11 subjects to evaluate safety,
      tolerability, and efficacy of elamipretide 3.0% topical ophthalmic solution in patients with
      FCED presenting with mild to moderate corneal edema.

             folds, or stromal haze

             Visit and Baseline Visit

          -  Best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25 to 20/320 (inclusive) at the
             time of Screening Visit and Baseline Visit OU

             time of Screening Visit

          -  Corneal findings of any type (including, but not limited to, stromal haze or stromal
             scarring), in either eye, that, based on investigator's assessment, limit the
             probability of visual improvement after corneal deturgescence

          -  Any ocular pathology requiring treatment with topical ophthalmic drops, with the
             exception of glaucoma or ocular hypertension

          -  Use of topical hypertonic saline drops for 3 days prior to Screening and throughout

          -  History of previous corneal or anterior segment surgery such as LASIK, photorefractive
             keratectomy, endothelial keratoplasty, penetrating keratoplasty cataract surgery or
             glaucoma surgery.

          -  Any disease or medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would prevent
             the subject from participating in the study or might confound study results

          -  Participation in other investigational drug or device clinical trials within 30 days
             prior to enrollment, or planning to participate in any other investigational drug or
             device clinical trials within 30 days of study completion
