    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the use of the Enhancing Connections Program in improving
      communication between patients with incurable cancer and their children. The Enhancing
      Connections Program is an educational program that may provide patients with new competencies
      to improve communication with their children and help them to cope with their parent's
      incurable cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the feasibility of the study protocol in advanced cancer patients
      (recruitment/retention, dosage and fidelity of the intervention; program acceptability of
      program; and logistics).

      II. To evaluate the short-term impact of the program on the diagnosed parents' and children's
      adjustment using a within group design (pre- and post-test design).

      III. To compare outcomes from the Enhancing Connections Program with outcomes obtained from
      the completed Phase III trial (between group design).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients participate in Enhancing Connections Program comprising of anchoring patients to
      help their child, adding to listening skills, building on listening skills, being a detective
      of their child's coping, and celebrating success for 5 sessions. Patients also receive
      workbook which includes text from the sessions, handouts, and at-home assignments to be
      completed between sessions.

(Each session of the Program has its own unique Performance Checklist and each item is scored from 0-2. Performance Checklist items are specific to each session of the Program to be delivered by the patient educator. Higher scores denote higher performance by the patient educator and greater confidence that the Program was delivered as designed.
