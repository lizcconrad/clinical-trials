    <textblock>
      The investigators wish to highlight, in a Case-Control design, if there is an increased
      concentration of BFRs in omental adipose tissue of cases ( women with severe endometriosis
      with surgical indication ) versus bioaccumulation recorded in a control cohort ( women
      recruited in obstetrics and gynecology or visceral surgery showing no sign of endometriosis )
      . Pairing will be operate on Age (+/- 5 years compared to the case ) , BMI ( BMI 5 Classes
      described by the HAS) and previous breastfeeding experience (yes / no , opposite the release
      expected bioaccumulate contaminants in breast adipose tissue , when the lactation ) .
