  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimalarial drug resistance has reached critical levels on the Thai-Cambodian border. Many
      have begun advocating for concerted malaria elimination efforts in Cambodia. However, there
      is currently no consensus on how malaria elimination is to be achieved with the tools
      available.

      In this study, the investigators will conduct operational research with the Royal Cambodian
      Armed Forces (RCAF) and National Malaria Center (CNM) to quantify the relative effectiveness
      of the two major interventional approaches - monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) or focused
      screening and treatment (FSAT) - in a head to-head comparison. In addition, the investigators
      will quantify the relative contribution of a recently advocated vector intervention for
      military personnel - the insecticide treated uniform (ITU) - in addition to other vector
      control measures currently employed by the RCAF. The investigators will employ the same
      permethrin insecticide self-application kits currently used by the US military. The
      investigators will estimate the cost effectiveness of each approach and attempt to define the
      best way forward for malaria elimination efforts in a critically important malaria reservoir
      in military population (and their dependents) who reside on the Thai-Cambodian border. The
      aim of the study is not only to conduct research to better define the best way forward in
      malaria elimination efforts in the high risk military populations, but to also build capacity
      within the RCAF to support and lead future elimination efforts in the most difficult-to-reach
      mobile populations.

      This is a cluster-randomized, open label interventional study to determine the feasibility of
      achieving significant reduction in malaria cases in military encampments on the
      Thai-Cambodian border. The study will compare the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of
      monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) to monthly focused screening and treatment (FSAT). This
      study will thus investigate the effectiveness of two potential interventions for malaria
      elimination. Subjects in the monthly malaria prophylaxis (MMP) arm will receive a standard
      3-day treatment course of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine on months 1, 2 and 3 and weekly
      low-dose primaquine (22.5mg for 12 weeks). Volunteers in the focused screening and treatment
      (FSAT) arm will be screened monthly and then treated for malaria following national treatment
      guidelines. For G6PD-deficient volunteers in the FSAT arm, primaquine will be administered
      weekly (45mg for 8 weeks) as radical curative and/or presumptive anti-relapse therapy. For
      G6PD normal volunteers with vivax infection, primaquine will be administered daily (15mg for
      14 days). All FSAT volunteers with confirmed P. falciparum infection will receive a single,
      low dose (15mg) Primaquine as a P. falciparum transmission-blocking agent. The incremental
      benefit of an insecticide treated uniform (ITU) will also be assessed as a single-blind
      sham-controlled intervention in addition to personal protective measures currently employed
      by the RCAF. Volunteers will be followed monthly for a total of 6 months, to determine the
      proportion remaining malaria-free on day 180 following enrollment.
