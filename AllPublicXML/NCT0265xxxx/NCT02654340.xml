      Association of specific mutations (genotype) after sequencing the TSC1 and TSC2 gene with the
      clinical manifestations (phenotype) of the tuberous sclerosis complex in a cohort of
      clinically well characterized tuberous sclerosis complex patients. The obtained samples will
      be used to establish a tandem-MS-based biomarker.

    <textblock>
      Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that causes non-malignant tumors to
      form in many different organs, primarily in the brain, eyes, heart, kidney, skin and lungs.
      The aspects of TSC that most strongly impact quality of life are generally associated with
      the brain: seizures, developmental delay, intellectual disability and autism. However, many
      people with TSC are living independent, healthy lives and enjoying challenging professions
      such as doctors, lawyers, educators and researchers. The incidence and severity of the
      various aspects of TSC can vary widely between individuals even between identical twins.
      Because TSC can manifest in so many different ways, diagnosis is generally made when
      physicians identify any two major features of TSC in one individual. One major feature is
      cardiac rhabdomyoma, an abnormal growth in the heart muscle generally found in young children
      and sometimes found by ultrasound examination during pregnancy. Other major features include
      specific abnormal skin growths or skin pigmentation, specific non-malignant tumors or growths
      such as subependymal nodules or subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs) in the brain,
      lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in the lungs, angiomyolipomas in the kidney(s), and tubers in
      the brain or hamartomas in the eye. Also, there are other minor features of TSC that might be
      diagnostic if found with a major feature in the same person. TSC can also be diagnosed by
      genetic testing described below. Major advancements in treatments such as these require
      clinical studies to test the effectiveness of experimental drugs, surgery, or other
      interventions in people with TSC. Because the TSC community is in vital need of new
      treatments, individuals with TSC frequently volunteer to participate in cutting-edge clinical
      studies. Some ongoing clinical studies in TSC include testing the effects of drug treatment
      on neurocognitive function, testing a new combination drug treatment for LAM, finding
      biomarkers to identify infants at high risk of developing autism or infantile spasms, and
      testing a topical drug treatment of facial angiofibromas. Thanks to volunteers in these and
      other studies, every new day brings us one step closer to finding improved treatments for
      TSC.

      New methods, like mass-spectrometry give a good chance to characterize specific metabolic
      alterations in the blood (plasma) of affected patients that allow diagnosing in the future
      the disease earlier, with a higher sensitivity and specificity.

      Therefore it is the goal of the study to identify and validate a new biochemical marker from
      the plasma of the affected patients helping to benefit other patients by an early diagnose
      and thereby with an earlier treatment.

      For the development of the new biomarkers using the technique of Mass-spectometry one dry
      blood spot filter card are taken. To proof the correct diagnosis in those patients where up
      to the enrollment in the study no genetic testing has been done, sequencing will be done. The
      analyses are done in the Centogene AG, Schillingallee 68, 18057 Rostock, Germany
