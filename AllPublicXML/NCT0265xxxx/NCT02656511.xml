  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify and provide immediate antiretroviral therapy to a
      cohort of HIV-infected individuals with very early HIV infection (estimated date of infection
      within the last 90 days). The primary aim of the study is to evaluate whether initiation of
      dolutegravir plus emtricitabine/tenofovir during acute/early HIV infection leads to
      protection of CD4+ T cells and other immune cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissue
      from infection.

    <textblock>
      Although ART decreases HIV-associated mortality, it does not appear to completely restore
      immune health, for reasons that remain unclear. In addition, while HIV prevention approaches
      have led to significant successes in decreasing the incidence of new HIV infection over the
      past few years, the epidemic continues to grow both locally and globally. While complete
      eradication may not currently be feasible, a &quot;functional cure&quot; in which patients are able to
      indefinitely maintain undetectable viral loads in the absence of therapy may be an attainable
      immediate goal. Studying patients with early HIV infection and immediate ART will provide a
      unique opportunity to investigate the pathophysiology of the earliest stages of HIV infection
      and may help identify the virologic/immunologic predictors of a functional cure.
