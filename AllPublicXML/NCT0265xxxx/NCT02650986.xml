      This phase I/IIa trial studies the side effects and best dose of a gene-modified T cells and
      to see how effective it is in treating patients with solid tumors expressing cancer-testis
      antigens 1 (NY-ESO-1) gene that have spread from where it started to nearby tissue or lymph
      nodes (locally advanced) or have spread to other places in the body (metastatic). A T cell is
      a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells of the body. Placing a
      modified gene for NY-ESO-1 into the patients' T cells in the laboratory and then given them
      back to the patient may help the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells that
      express NY-ESO-1. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide work in different ways
      to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading, and it may also allow genetically modified T
      cells to grow.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of autologous NY-ESO-1 T cell
      receptor (TCR) (NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduced autologous
      PBL)/dominant-negative transforming growth factor-beta receptor II (dnTGFbetaRII)
      (TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes [TILs]) transgenic T cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. NY-ESO-1 TCR/ dnTGFβRII transgenic T cell persistence by analyzing serial peripheral blood
      samples for the presence of T cells with the NY-ESO-1 TCR by tetramer analysis.

      II. To study T cell differentiation that correlates with higher anti-tumor responses.

      III. Assess clinical response and progression free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of NY-ESO-1 TCR/TGFbDNRII-transduced TILs
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days -5 and -4. Patients
      then receive NY-ESO-1 reactive TCR retroviral vector transduced autologous PBL with
      TGFbDNRII-transduced autologous TILs infusion on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are follow up at weeks 1-4, 8 and 12, at 6 and
      9 months, every 6 months for 5 years, and yearly for 9 years.
