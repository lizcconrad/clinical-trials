    <textblock>
      4 consecutive days with volunteers between the first and fourth postoperative period of
      cardiac valve replacement. The volunteers are randomized into 2 groups: the Control Group
      submitted to cardiac rehabilitation protocol of the hospital where it will be conducted the
      study, which consists of respiratory and metabolic exercises. The second group, called Early
      Mobilization Group in addition to the aforementioned exercises will be added exercise in
      cycle ergometer. For the implementation of rehabilitation protocol in the early mobilization
      group volunteers will be placed in a sitting position in the bed with the backrest raised to
      45 °. The exercise in cycle ergometer will be held for 20 minutes on four consecutive days of
      active mode, the training load shall be such that the voluntary maintained throughout
      training a level of fatigue, maintaining level of heart rate predicted for age increased by
      70% and 1 w / cm2 every minute to keep the parameter within the standards. The evaluation of
      heart rate variability with the Polar monitor RS800CX brand model before surgery was
      performed first postoperative day and fifth postoperative day in the control groups and early
      mobilization.

      The valve disorders are a special group of heart diseases with long period without clinical
      manifestations, when there is the appearance of symptoms, the patient is a likely candidate
      for surgery. In many surgical complications can occur, including the respiratory cause and
      immobility in bed culminating in the need for intensive care. Early mobilization exercises
      conducted by physical therapy in critically ill patients is to minimize complications related
      to immobility in bed from surgery that is performed in exchanges of heart valves. To
      investigate the influence of a cardiac rehabilitation program on cardiac function (Heart Rate
      Varibility) and free radicals (oxidative stress) in patients undergoing surgical heart valve
      replacement. The study is being conducted at the Clinical Hospital Gaspar Viana of Belém, in
      March 2014 period to March 2016, with the proposing institution the Methodist University of
      Piracicaba. The study included 60 volunteers aged 18 to 60 year old male with surgery
      scheduling of heart valve replacement. The volunteers were divided into 2 groups the control
      group who underwent rehabilitation proposed by the hospital with simple exercises like deep
      breathing exercises to improve cough, move your arms and rhythmically legs to maintain joint
      mobility, the second group It was called Early Mobilization Group, where volunteers beyond
      rehabilitation protocol proposed by the hospital, held exercises in a cycle ergometer, The
      volunteers were instructed to pedal lying comfortably with moderate intensity for 30 minutes.
      All groups performed this protocol lasting 4 days. Oxidative stress was analyzed and cardiac
      function before surgery, after surgery in the first and fifth postoperative. The Oxidative
      Stress is analyzed by puncturing a drop of blood and to analyze the photographed area
      coagulum formed. Cardiac function (Heart Rate Variability) will be analyzed using a heart
      rate monitor brand Polar® RS800CX model being evaluated lying down, then the data is
      transferred to the computer and analyzed in a program called Kubios HRV. After collecting the
      data will be analyzed in Biostat 5.2 program. The possible risks to the research subject is
      the inconvenience of collecting the blood sample, the onset of pain resulting from the
      mobilization of the rehabilitation protocol. However, the emergence of at least one of the
      risks mentioned above, the procedure and / or service must be stopped and perform passive
      stretching or temporary home until everything returns to normal. In addition, there may be a
      risk of contamination to volunteer for collecting blood, however this risk is minimized when
      using materials such as sterile needles and blades. The research brings benefit as increased
      range of motion and muscle strength, decreased pain, functional improvement, providing
      improvement in quality of life and functional independence and reduced hospital stay.

    <description>It will be analyzed the uptake of heart rate variability by means of the heart rate monitor Polar ® brand, model RS800CX where FC signal is received by a strap to the signal receiver, to be placed on the thorax at the level of voluntary xiphoid process. This capture is stored in the Polar monitor and transferred to the software Polar ProTrainer program by means of an emission of infrared signals interface, where they are stored and subsequently exported to TXT format, which subsequently can be analyzed by a math routine in Kubios HRV® program. Volunteers will be asked to remain at rest for a period of 10 min, avoiding talking to the researcher so that the heart rate does not undergo changes.</description>

    <description>Morphological evaluation of oxidative stress in the blood plasma is performed by the so called Optical Microscopy Test for In Vitro Analysis Cell or HLB Test. The fingertip of the fourth finger of the previously sanitized hand with alcohol, will collect a drop of blood next to a microscope slide through five light touch of this blade next to the drop .
At the end of this period, the morphology of this clot is microscopically observed under a 40-fold increase in optical microscope brand Nikon® model Binocular E200 Standard and its qualitative graduation will be recorded by the camera attached Nikon® mark on a spreadsheet to later analysis. The observation of morphological patterns of the different obtained clots will be held in the first image taken on each of the blades and the evaluation will be conducted through the program called OxyScanner® developed and marketed by Aldea Global Soluciones (AGS).</description>
