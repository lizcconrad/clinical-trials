    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study conducting in 3 medical centers
      in Asia. Patients will receive erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab or erlotinib alone.
      This study will enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have asymptomatic brain metastases.

      The primary objective is to compare the systemic progression-free survival (PFS) to
      bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who have
      asymptomatic brain metastases.

      This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter phase II study conducting in 3 medical centers
      in Asia. Patients will receive erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab or erlotinib alone.
      This study will enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have asymptomatic brain metastases.

      The primary objective is to compare the systemic progression-free survival (PFS) to
      bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who have
      asymptomatic brain metastases.

      Patients will be randomized, at a 1:1 ratio, into bevacizumab plus erlotinib group or
      erlotinib alone group. Compute tomography (CT) or MRI scans will be performed every 6 weeks
      in the first 12 months since start of investigational drugs, and then performed every 12
      weeks. Patients will be followed until documented progression at brain and/or extra-cranial
      lesions. Patients with intracranial progression only are allowed to continue investigational
      drugs until a second progression of either intracranial progression or extracranial
      progression, developed, and the time-to extracranial progression will be determined. In
      patients with EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC who had brain metastases, it was reported that PFS
      to erlotinib or gefitinib was 6.6 months(Park et al., 2012). In the current study, it is
      assumed that the median PFS, both intracranial and extracranial included, is 7 months for
      erlotinib group alone and is 12.3 months for bevacizumab plus erlotinib group (hazard ratio
      0.57) (Seto et al., 2014). 109 patients will be required for analysis in this randomized
      phase II study. Patients will be stratified according to the EGFR L858R mutation and the EGFR
      exon 19 deletion mutation.

             laboratory test (&gt;5mIU/mL).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physically capable of becoming
             pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during
             dosing and for at least 6 months after stopping study drug. Highly effective
             contraception methods include:

        Male or female sterilization or

        Combination of any two of the following:

        Use oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. Placement of an
        intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS). Barrier methods of contraception:
        condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal
        foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository).

             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug and
             for 6 more months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

          -  Any other condition that would, in the Investigator's judgment, contraindicate
             patient's participation in the clinical study due to safety concerns or compliance
             with clinical study procedures, e.g. infection/inflammation, intestinal obstruction,
             unable to swallow medication, social/psychological issues, etc.
