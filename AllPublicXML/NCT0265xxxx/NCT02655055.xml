  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A longitudinal, randomized, controlled, single-center Phase IV clinical trial will be
      performed to assess changes in bone mineral density (BMD) among voluntary apheresis blood
      donors. The primary outcome measure will be clinically significant decline in BMD at the
      lumbar spine assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apheresis blood donation maximizes an individual's donation by selecting specific blood
      components that are used to save patient lives. Dramatic increases in the number of apheresis
      procedures performed each year are apparent both domestically and internationally. Apheresis
      requires the use of citrate anticoagulation, a substance that confers its anticoagulant
      effect through chelation of cations, like calcium. A small number of cross-sectional studies
      have reported that intermittent exposure to citrate through apheresis is associated with
      significant declines in donor bone mineral density (BMD). In contrast, oral potassium citrate
      of much lower dose has been used to treat low bone density with well-documented efficacy. The
      impact of citrate exposure during apheresis, either positive or negative, is important given
      that BMD is a significant risk factor for low trauma fracture, a problem that affects more
      than 2M people in the U.S. annually. It is ultimately unknown what effect repeated apheresis
      has on skeletal health. To address this knowledge gap, we will perform a Phase IV clinical
      trial of apheresis blood donors using a cross-disciplinary, multi-institutional team. As
      apheresis blood donation continues to affect more people, the importance of understanding the
      effects of repeated exposure to citrate on donor skeletal health is essential in protecting
      this precious community resource.
