      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of TAK-385 40 mg administered orally
      once daily for 12 weeks, compared with placebo in participants having pain symptoms
      associated with uterine fibroids.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate
      the efficacy of TAK-385 40 mg administered orally once daily for 12 weeks compared with
      placebo in participants having pain symptoms associated with uterine fibroids.

      Participants must be diagnosed to have uterine fibroids confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound
      or other methods. Participants must experience pain symptoms associated with uterine fibroids
      (eg, lower abdominal pain and low back pain). The total number of participants to be
      randomized under double-blind conditions is 64 (32 participants each for the TAK-385 40 mg
      group or placebo group).

    <description>An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a drug; it does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, whether or not it is considered related to the drug. A treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an adverse event with an onset that occurs after receiving study drug.</description>
