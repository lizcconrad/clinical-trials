      The safety and efficacy of a urinary catheter designed to prevent catheter associated urinary
      infections is studied.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open randomized controlled trial of 4 weeks duration. The intervention is a
      novel urinary catheter with an electromagnetic therapy to prevent catheter associated
      infections. The catheter is used in patients which require longterm urinary catheterization
      over at least 1 month.

      The endpoint is bacteriological exam and the laboratory is blinded to the therapy status.
      Weekly urinary cultures are drawn and a sonication culture of the catheter tip is performed
      to detect and characterize the biofilm. A colonization rate of &gt;95% is anticipated in the
      control arm. Therefore a 50% reduction in colonization can be detected with 54 patients, a
      90% reduction in colonization can be detected with 20 patients with a power of 0.9.
