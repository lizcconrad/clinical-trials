      The purpose of this research is to study the utility of using the HealtheRx as a tool to
      recruit eligible patients into the Pulmonary Research Registry (PRR) (IRB 15543B) at the
      University of Chicago. HealtheRx is an example of a potential recruitment tool that has high
      reach in populations typically underrepresented in research studies, uses a high tech
      infrastructure that allows matching of research opportunities to patient characteristics, but
      that delivers information in a low-tech, patient-centered mode using the printed HealtheRx
      prescription.

      1. Patients living in one of 16 zip codes of the South and West Sides of Chicago who
           present for care at one or more of 30 clinical sites receive a personalized HealtheRx
           prescription with programs and services in the community from their health care
           provider. The HealtheRx is printed and delivered to the patient at the end of the visit.

        2. Patients age 18+ with a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD will receive a HealtheRx with
           programs/services to help manage their condition, as well as an advertisement to
           participate in a phone survey.

        3. Patients interested in completing the phone survey can call or text the Lindau Lab at
           the University of Chicago.

        4. An experienced survey researcher will first read the consent script and if oral consent
           is received, continue with the phone survey (The survey includes items pertaining to
           program participants' receipt of the HealtheRx, use of community services provided on
           the HealtheRx, thoughts about participation in clinical research.

        5. Participants who choose to complete the survey will receive a $10 check delivered via
           U.S. mail to their home address. Patients interested in joining the PRR will receive the
           PRR consent form with their $25 check.

        6. Participants with interest in joining the PRR will also receive, via mail, a $5 bill as
           thanks for reading, signing and returning the consent form. Participants will be
           randomized to receive the $5 bill at 2 different time points.

        7. Once the signed consent form is received, a member of the Asthma and COPD Center
           research staff will contact the participant by phone and complete the PRR case report
           form by phone.
