      This study evaluates the screening accuracy of a device (OAK) in assessing fall risk in the
      elderly, compared to the assessment provided by the Algorithm for Fall Risk Assessment of the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

      The OAK device is a technologic system, based on virtual reality. It allows to quickly
      perform a fall risk assessment integrating clinical indexes of the Brief-BESTest (The Balance
      Evaluation System Test), and kinematic and posturgraphic indexes. The participants interact
      with the OAK device through simple exercises, then the device provides an assessment of their
      functional mobility, equilibrium and postural reactions.

      Falls are a serious problem among the elderly. Most falls do not cause death, but 20%-30% of
      falls result in serious injuries representing a significant source of morbidity and
      mortality. Good evidence shows that many falls can be prevented. Thus, identifying people
      with risk of falling is crucial. The aim of this study is the evaluation of the screening
      accuracy of a device (OAK) in assessing fall risk in the elderly.

      Participants are recruited at IRCCS Galeazzi Orthopedic Hospital in Milan, among outpatients
      and healthy volunteers. A brief questionnaire is administered in order to collect data
      relevant to the CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Assessment. Then, participants are assessed
      through the OAK device. The OAK assessment is evaluated in terms of performance, accuracy (in
      comparison to the CDC Algorithm for Fall Risk Assessment) and safety.
