    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 randomized trial of carfilzomib, lenalidomide, dexamethasone versus
      lenalidomide alone after stem-cell transplant for multiple myeloma, eligible to subjects who
      completed autologous stem cell transplant for symptomatic myeloma who are considered for
      lenalidomide maintenance.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To compare progression free survival between Kyprolis (Carfilzomib), Revlimid
           (lenalidomide), Dexamethasone (KRd) arm and lenalidomide arm

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To determine the rate of minimal residual negative disease (MRD) at 6 and 12 months
           after randomization

        -  To compare the efficacy (rate of partial response, very good partial response, complete
           response, and stringent complete response) of KRd vs. Lenalidomide alone after
           randomization
