  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of thyroid cancer (TC) has increased exponentially worldwide. The increase in
      diagnosed cases brings about an increase in the number of surgeries performed on the thyroid
      gland, especially total thyroidectomy (TT), given that at present is still the gold standard
      of treatment.

      Transient postoperative hypoparathyroidism (HPT) is one of the most frequent complications,
      with an incidence of between 10 and 46% according to different sources. HPT involves longer
      hospital stay, serial measurements of blood glucose, treatment with calcium and vitamin D
      (with potential risk of hypercalcemia) and therefore an increase in terms of the costs of the
      health system.

      While the investigators know the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti
      emetic of corticosteroids in thyroid surgery, the literature available to date is discordant
      in the use of steroid and its interaction with the HPT making clear the need for randomized
      clinical trials specific to analyze these variables more accurately.

      As inflammation and edema constitute a proposed surgical manipulation in the pathogenesis of
      HPT component, investigators decided t conduct a prospective randomized, triple-blind, in
      order to assess the potential benefits of the most common postoperative complication reported
      in TT.

      Our primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of single-dose corticosteroids
      deposit immediately postintubation in preventing the development of transient
      hypoparathyroidism (PTH, serum calcium and symptoms) in patients after TT.
