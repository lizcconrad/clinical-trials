      The purpose of this study is to determine whether lipid levels are related with incidence of
      atrial fibrillation in Patients with chronic heart failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. Chronic
      Heart failure (CHF) has become a major clinical and public health problem. Both AF and CHF
      often co-exist and complicate each other's administration.Several risk factors have been
      demonstrated to be associated with the risk of AF in Patients with CHF.

      Lopez et al. found that higher levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and total
      cholesterol were associated with a lower incidence of AF independently of other risk factors
      from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study.

      Thus the purpose of this study is to determine whether lipid levels are related with
      incidence of atrial fibrillation in Patients with chronic heart failure. This study maybe
      provide a novel opinion on the prevention of AF in patients with CHF.
