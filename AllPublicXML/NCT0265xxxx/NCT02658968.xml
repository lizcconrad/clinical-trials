    <textblock>
      This study is a phase 1, dose finding, open-label study in patients with relapsed/refractory
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This is a dose escalating study to define the maximum
      tolerable dose of lutetium (177Lu)-lilotomab satetraxetan (Betalutin®) in DLBCL patients who
      are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. The study will also assess safety and
      toxicity, pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and efficacy.
