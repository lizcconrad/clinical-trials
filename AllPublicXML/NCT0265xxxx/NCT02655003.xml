    <textblock>
      Almost all people who suffer from dementia experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in the
      course of the disease. TIME (Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and treatment of
      neuropsychiatric symptoms) is a multicomponent intervention based on the theoretical
      framework of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The TIME trial is designed to assess the
      effects of TIME on NPS in nursing homes patients with dementia and the implementation process
      at staff and organization level.

      TIME (Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and treatment of neuropsychiatric
      symptoms) is a multicomponent intervention based on the theoretical framework of cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT).The TIME trial includes a three months cluster randomized trial in
      36 nursing homes with 164 participants with dementia and a high level of agitation. Each
      nursing home defines a cluster and will be randomized to receive either the intervention with
      TIME or a brief two hours education-only intervention about dementia and NPS for the control
      group. TIME consists of a manual based multicomponent program which includes a rigorous
      assessment, the treatment, and the evaluation of neuropsychiatrc symptoms (NPS). The staff,
      physicians and nursing home managers receive a one-day education. Three nurses from each unit
      will receive further education including practical and theoretical training for three hours.
      Measurements at patient level are taken at baseline prior to randomization and at eight and
      twelve weeks. The primary outcome measure is agitation. Mixed methods will be used to follow,
      measure and explore the implementation process and the effect at individual staff level and
      at organization level.
