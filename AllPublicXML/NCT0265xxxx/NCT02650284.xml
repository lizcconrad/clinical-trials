      This study is a prospective, randomised clinical study comparing clinical outcomes of Knee
      Replacement using the Oxford Knee Score (OKS), in patients receiving either Bicompartmental
      Knee Replacement performed using Stryker's robotic-arm assisted surgery system Mako, to Total
      Knee Replacement using the Triathlon Total Knee System performed with either conventional
      instrumentation or navigation. Functional and radiographic outcomes will be additionally
      collected as part of this study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oxford Knee Score</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months/ 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing clinical outcomes using the Oxford Knee Score. The OKS is a participant completed 12 question form on activities of daily living that assess function and pain. Scores can range from 0 to 48 with lower scores indicating a poor outcome and higher scores indicating a more satisfactory joint outcome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health related quality of life EQ-5D</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months/ 2years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D-3L descriptive system comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, extreme problems. The participant is asked to indicate his/her health state by indicating the most appropriate level for each of the 5 dimensions. Responses may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essentially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimension. The index can be calculated by deducting the appropriate weights from 1= the value for full health. The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled from 100 ='Best imaginable health state' to 0= 'Worst imaginable health state'.</description>

    <measure>VAS pain</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months/ 2years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the VAS pain. Pain at rest and pain during mobilization are measured using a 10 centimeter Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Participants are asked to indicate their level of pain with 0 being no pain and 100 being the worst pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>New Knee Society Score (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months/ 2years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the KSS. The Knee Society Clinical Rating System is comprised of two distinct sub-scores: one for pain, range of motion (ROM) and joint stability, and one for functional parameters. Sub-scores range from a minimum score of 0 to a maximum of 100 points. Although the specific scores are not distinguished as &quot;excellent,&quot; &quot;good,&quot; &quot;fair,&quot; or &quot;poor,&quot; a higher value represents a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Forgotten Joint Score (FJS)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months/ 2years</time_frame>
    <description>Comparing functional and clinical outcomes using the FJS. The Forgotten Joint Score (FJS) is a 12 question form that asks the patient their level of awareness of their artificial joint in 12 scenarios commonly encountered in daily life. Scores can range from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating a better outcome (high degree of forgetting the joint in everyday life).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of loosening, reoperation and revision</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare incidence of loosening, reoperation and revision rates. The incidence (ie number of participants who experienced lossening, reoperation or revision) will be counted and presented as a whole number or percentage of the total number of patients, however they will be identified from analysing Xrays and checking Serious Adverse Event/ Adverse Event reports.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient is a suitable candidate for a Bicompartmental Knee Replacement and has
             moderate to severe patellofemoral wear and medial compartment wear (surgeons
             discretion)

          2. The patient has no fixed flexion greater than 10 degrees.

          3. The patient has maximal flexion greater than 100 degrees

          4. The patient has a passively correctable varus deformity

          5. The patient has a functionally Intact Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL.)

          6. The patient has no significant patellofemoral malalignment
