  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait initiation (GI) difficulty is common in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies
      showed that the GI difficulty was related to impaired anticipatory postural adjustments
      (APA). In healthy people, two phases of APA related center of pressure (COP) shifting were
      observed before GI. In people with PD, delay and decrease amplitude of APA or abnormal
      multiple APAs were observed during GI.

      Conventional balance tests record the maximum displacement and/or velocity of Center of
      pressure (COP). However, these variables could not show the performance of APA. Previous
      studies suggested that balance and gait initiation were controlled by separate neural
      circuitries. This could explain why the conventional COP measurement did not correlate to GI
      very well.

      It is important to develop GI related APA tests and trainings. Researchers found that a
      perturbation applied before the COP displacement during GI could delay both GI and APA. This
      indicates that COP displacement has APA components. Our pilot study shows that there is a
      reverse direction of COP displacement before voluntary COP displacement, suggesting the
      existence of APA.

      This three year project will evaluate the relationship of the APA of voluntary COP
      displacement and the APA of GI, establish the APA test for PD, and investigate the effect of
      APA training on GI in people with PD.

      In the first year, 20 people without disability will be recruited. The APA before voluntary
      COP displacement test, APA before GI, and gait performance will be evaluated. In the second
      year, 15 people with PD and 15 healthy people will be recruited. Subjects will receive GI
      test, gait test, and APA before voluntary COP displacement test. The relationship between
      different types of APA will be established for PD and healthy people. In the third year, 30
      people with PD will be randomized into APA training group, balance group, and control group.
      The different training effect will be evaluated especially on GI, gait performance, and
      freezing of gait.

      This project will advance the knowledge of mechanism of GI difficulty. The result of this
      project can be applied to clinical rehabilitation of people with GI difficulty.
