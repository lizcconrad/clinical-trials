  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a supervised resistance exercise training
      during hemodialysis is effective to increase physical activity in daily life in patients with
      end stage renal disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients will be randomized into two groups: intervention and control groups. Patients in
      the intervention group will receive a supervised resistance exercise training, during
      hemodialysis, three times/week for 12 weeks, and patients allocate to the control group will
      received a passive stretching program during the same timeframe.
