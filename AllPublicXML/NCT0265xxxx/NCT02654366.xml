  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Efforts to help syringe exchange registrants employ additional HIV risk reduction strategies
      are often thwarted by strong social networks that reinforce substance use and other risky
      injection use and sexual behaviors. The proposed study addresses this important problem by
      evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a novel Community Supported Risk Reduction group.
      This structured intervention works with injection drug users and at least one drug-free
      family or friend to mobilize social support, teach HIV risk reduction skills, develop
      treatment readiness, and support participation in community activities designed to expand
      drug-free social networks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants of syringe exchange programs routinely suffer from untreated or under-treated
      substance use disorder, a situation that is associated with significant individual and public
      health costs. These individuals are also routinely embedded within social networks that
      reinforce continued drug use and related HIV-risk behaviors. The welfare of these individuals
      and the public's health can be improved by interventions directed toward reducing drug use
      risks and expanding drug-free support . Previous work by the investigators has demonstrated
      that an intervention combining an HIV risk reduction/treatment readiness group with
      behavioral contingencies is highly associated with increased rates of treatment enrollment
      and re-engagement, and reduced rates of drug use and HIV-injection risks, for up to one year.
      This protocol extends this work by adding a new component to the HIV risk reduction/treatment
      readiness group designed to expand social support and facilitate social network change. This
      intervention requires syringe exchange registrants to attend the group with a drug-free
      family or friend from their personal network that can provide stable support and encourage
      harm reduction and treatment seeking. This intervention uses an alteration network change
      model and posits that repeated exposure to drug-free community support collaterally reduces
      exposure to network members that support risk behaviors. This model also provides a pathway
      to modifying existing social networks by facilitating interaction with the personal social
      networks of drug-free family and friends. The intervention is supported by research showing
      that substance users report substantial pockets of drug-free family or friends in their
      social networks. It is also supported by community reinforcement principles that have shown
      efficacy in treatment samples, but have not been applied to out-of-treatment drug users. The
      present study has four primary aims. The first is to characterize natural drug-free support
      in the social networks of syringe exchangers. The second is to develop a Community Supported
      Risk Reduction group for syringe exchange participants and their community support. This
      group teaches skills for HIV risk reduction, treatment seeking, and healthy network
      expansion. The third and fourth aims are to obtain new data on the feasibility and efficacy
      of this intervention. Primary outcomes include changes in: 1) perceived social support, and
      2) HIV risk behaviors.

    <description>The investigators anticipate that Baltimore Needle Exchange Program (BNEP) registrants will demonstrate greater levels of perceived social support (QRI &quot;support&quot; scale, a continuous measure) across follow-ups (compared to baseline). Mixed model analyses will be used to evaluate change from baseline to follow-up measures (Months 1, 2, 3). The two remaining QRI subscales (&quot;conflict&quot;; &quot;depth&quot;) will also be examined using a similar analytic approach.</description>

    <description>The investigators anticipate that BNEP registrants will have lower rates of any drug use risk behaviors (Risk Behavior Survey) across the 3-month evaluation compared to baseline. Drug use risks include any use of a used needle, cooker and cotton for injection or splitting drugs. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) will be used to assess change from baseline to follow-up measures (Months 1, 2, 3).</description>

    <description>Changes in any sex risk behaviors (Risk Behavior Survey) will be examined using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to assess change from baseline to follow-up measures (Months 1, 2, 3). The investigators expect significant reductions only for the subset of individuals including a romantic partner as a Community Support Person (CSP).</description>

    <description>Following each group session, BNEP registrants interested in enrolling in substance abuse treatment will have an opportunity to schedule a referral to a treatment program. Substance abuse treatment enrollment (including treatment name, modality, start date, stop date, days in treatment) will be assessed at months 1, 2, 3 using a series of questions in the Risk Behaviors Survey.</description>

    <description>Six weekly sessions will be scheduled during daytime and evening hours to accommodate the daily schedules of BNEP registrants and their CSPs. Each session meets for 60 minutes. Groups will consist of 5-6 BNEP registrant-CSP dyads (10-12 individuals). While BNEP registrants and CSPs attending the group together will receive an attendance incentive, BNEP registrants attending without a CSP will not earn one. The group leader will follow a manual that includes a structured outline. The group manual content combines risk reduction / treatment readiness and community outreach approaches. Following the introduction, each group session is divided into two components: 1) Risk Reduction and Treatment Readiness (30 min) and 2) Community Outreach skills (20 min).</description>

    <description>The Risk Reduction and Treatment Readiness skills component includes six modules: 1) BNEP services and substance abuse treatment; 2) nature of chemical dependence (severity/chronicity and medical aspects); 3) infectious diseases (HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) information); 4) injection drug use risk reduction (effective equipment cleaning and drug-splitting techniques); 5) sex risk reduction (reducing high-risk behaviors and effective condom use); and 6) overdose prevention.
The Community Outreach skills component is devoted to discussing the benefits of recovery-focused social support, and directing BNEP registrants and their CSPs to participate in activities together (as determined in the group session) at least 1 time per week to work toward expanding the scope of drug-free social support.</description>
