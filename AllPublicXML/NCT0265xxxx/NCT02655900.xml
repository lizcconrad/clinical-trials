  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Injury to the muscles of the back passage (anal canal) is a relatively common problem. This
      injury can result in problems with bowel control later in life and usually occurs during
      vaginal childbirth (commonly referred to as 3rd and 4th degree perineal tears). Currently
      women who have sustained injury to the muscles of the back passage undergo an ultrasound scan
      by inserting a probe 3 to 4 cms into the back passage. This helps to check if the muscle of
      the back passage has healed i.e is intact or has a defect. The investigators would like to
      establish whether a 3D ultrasound scan probe placed outside the vagina can identify the
      defects and hence avoid inserting the probe into the back passage. In addition to getting the
      above information using 3D ultrasound scan, the investigators would also like to identify
      injuries to the pelvic floor muscle (levator ani) in these patients. Which can be diagnosed
      using the 3D ultrasound probe placed outside the vagina (perineum). Women who sustain injury
      to this muscle are known to develop prolapse later on in life.
