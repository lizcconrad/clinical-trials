  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Humans naturally produce ketone bodies under daily living conditions. The main
      ketone bodies are two functioning acids, beta-hydroxybutyric acid (3-OHB) and acetoacetate,
      and the pH-neutral, but odorous, acetone. In the fed state, level of 3-OHB is suppressed to
      an almost unmeasurable level while, in the fasted state, it rises to 0.1-0.5 millimoles (mM).
      Main regulation of ketone synthesis is the abundance of sugars and resulting adaptations in
      insulin secretion. Thus, ketone bodies are formed when sugar is not readily available and
      insulin is suppressed. This picture is, to a certain degree, seen in acute inflammatory
      states and, indeed, during starvation, where level of 3-OHB increases to 5-8 mM.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Ketone bodies changes the insulin sensitivity and substrate metabolism in human subjects

        2. Ketone bodies changes the GH signaling in muscle and adipose tissue

      Aim: The investigators wish to provide knowledge on changes in metabolites and shift in
      signaling pathways and insulin sensitivity during GH infusion and concomitant ketone bodies
      infusion among healthy subjects.
