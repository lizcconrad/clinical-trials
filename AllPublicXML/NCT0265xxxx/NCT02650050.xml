  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a major cause of blindness in adults in the developed countries. The retinal
      damages associated with diabetes lead to gradual loss of vision, which is accentuated when
      the macula is affected. This results in macular edema.

      Currently, intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF have demonstrated their effectiveness and are
      the first line treatment of macular edema.

      Subthreshold micropulsed laser photocoagulation is an alternative to conventional grid
      photocoagulation. By delivering pulsed impacts under the thermal lesion threshold of the
      pigment epithelium, it would not cause the side effects of conventional photocoagulation.
      Micropulsed photocoagulation combined to anti-VEGF injections, could be the most effective
      treatment with a minimum injection number and without epithelial lesions.

      The main objective of this study is to show that the subthreshold micropulsed laser
      photocoagulation, in association with intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF, allows to reduce
      the number of anti-VEGF injections during the first year of treatment.

      In this randomized, double blind study, eligible patients will be randomized between a
      micropulsed laser photocoagulation arm and a sham micropulsed laser photocoagulation arm.
