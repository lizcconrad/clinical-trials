  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study addresses the highest ranking health research priority in South Africa, which is,
      to develop and test optimal models of HIV-TB service delivery that will enhance retention,
      adherence and coverage of HIV-TB co-infected patients. HIV and TB are highest in sub-Saharan
      Africa, a region with limited health budgets, infrastructure, human resources, and suboptimal
      TB infection control practices. There is compelling clinical evidence suggesting that
      integrating HIV and TB services saves lives and presents an effective and efficient use of
      resources directed at optimizing health outcomes. Quality improvement (QI) methods are
      increasingly being used to systematically test and incorporate local ideas into strategies
      for reliable implementation and scale up. This trial is designed to test a practical,
      implementable and affordable strategy aimed at improving HIV-TB service integration to reduce
      TB and HIV associated deaths. This is a cluster randomized controlled trial, which evaluates
      and tests the effectiveness of implementing a QI model to integrate HIV-TB service delivery
      in primary health care clinics, on reducing morbidity and mortality in TB-HIV co-infected
      patients. This study will be conducted in 2 districts, Ugu and uThungulu, in KwaZulu-Natal,
      South Africa. The model of integrated care delivery for TB and HIV using the QI method offers
      a systems approach to care delivery to directly enhance treatment outcomes by enabling
      comprehensive effective care designed around the patients journey from entry to the clinic,
      through screening treatment initiation, treatment completion, and retention in care that is
      directed at the goals of cure for TB, effective sustainable HIV viral suppression and reduced
      HIV associated TB mortality as the main health impact. The scalability of the model, once
      proven effective, is the critical element that makes it increase population coverage of
      quality diagnosis and treatment of HIV-TB co-infection. QI methods promote front line staff
      engagement in identification and rapid testing of local implementation solutions to gaps in
      performance of processes of care along the steps of the patient journey. Gaps in care are
      identified through continuous feedback on a core set of indicators collected monthly as
      routine collection of data.

      The primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a peer mentor-led,
      quality-improvement model of service delivery of integrated HIV-TB treatment on mortality in
      HIV-TB co-infected patients treated in rural primary health care clinics in KwaZulu-Natal,
      South Africa

      Specific Objectives (i) To determine the impact of a QI-mediated HIV-TB service integration
      on patient mortality. All patients that access services in intervention and control clinics,
      via either the TB entry point or via the HIV entry point will be tracked during clinic
      follow-up visits or, through a community care giver, and will have their vital status
      ascertained 12 months after clinic randomization.

      (ii) To determine the effectiveness of peer-led Quality Improvement (QI) to integrate HIV-TB
      services. The effect, on HIV-TB integrated processes of care, of the deployment of a QI
      approach (systems view, data driven decision making, culture of continuous improvement,
      trained peer mentors) to ensure uniform implementation of an essential package of evidence
      based HIV-TB interventions that support HIV-TB integration. The impact on clinical outcomes
      of using QI methods to implement integrated HIV and TB management will be assessed using the
      following indicators: Time to ART initiation among HIV infected TB suspects and cases; HIV
      testing rates in TB patients; Number of HIV-TB co-infected patients receiving co-treatment
      for TB and HIV at the same facility; Number of patients infected with HIV or TB that are
      retained in care at 12 months; Indicators of treatment adherence such as - number of HIV
      patients that are virologically suppressed at 12 months and TB treatment outcomes;
      Hospitalisation rates among patients receiving co-treatment for TB and HIV.

      (iii) To identify clinic-level factors that impact on integrated HIV-TB services.
      Understanding the context (environmental, social and political factors) in which we are
      working is essential to identifying factors that promote or inhibit the implementation of the
      intervention. We will use the COACH tool (Context Assessment for Community Health) [8] to
      collect data and assess the organizational context and the influence of factors such as
      organizational culture, leadership, resources and HCWs remuneration etc. on the intervention

      (iv) To determine the cost-effectiveness of implementing HIV-TB services using Quality
      Improvement methodology (Intervention Clinics) versus the base-case of implementing HIV-TB
      services independently, through a within-trial approach using both health service (e.g.
      training, remuneration) and patient costs (e.g. travel, opportunity costs) as inputs. We will
      also calculate total intervention costs to assess its affordability and explore
      cost-effectiveness under various scenarios (e.g. different TB-HIV co-infection rates) using
      decision analytical modeling.

      (v) To identify a set of interventions, change ideas, tools and approaches that can be used
      to scale up adoption, implementation and sustainability of integrated HIV-TB services across
      South Africa and in other resource constrained settings.

      (vi) To strengthen the capacity of CAPRISA to independently perform implementation research
      in PRDs, including community-randomized trials and health economic analysis, through expert
      mentoring and supervision of PhD programmes.

    <description>In intervention clinics, staff will follow QI methodology to undertake a detailed assessment of their HIV-TB care and to prioritize the steps to improve treatment outcomes. A senior nurse will be identified to be the QI champion and will be trained by the study team to fulfil this role. The QI champion in the clinic then provides peer-leadership, mentorship and support for the implementation of the prioritized changes until the checklist is complete and all integrated HIV-TB service components meet the required standard.</description>

Technically, QI improves process performance by developing a common simplified view of the components and linkages of integrated care, real-time data feed-back to track system performance, understanding the psychology of system change, and crucially, the iterative testing and incorporation of ideas for performance improvement from the front-line practitioners, managers, and customers in the local context.</description>
