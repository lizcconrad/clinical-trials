  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The experimental design is an open-label two-week trial of tolcapone to evaluate which
      clinical domains are affected by tolcapone treatment and to identify &quot;responders&quot; to
      tolcapone treatment in the two subject groups (BI and NCD)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each patient will receive a two-week specified dosing amount of tolcapone (100mg TID on Day
      1; 200mg TID on Days 2-14). The patient will be instructed to take the study drug three times
      daily. Tolcapone will be tapered after Day 14 to avoid potential withdrawal reactions.

      Clinical Instruments for patients:

        -  Question banks from large patient-reported outcome measure initiatives will be used and
           administered and used by computerized-adaptive tests (CATs). These include the TBI-QoL
           for patients with TBI and question banks from the patient-reported outcome measure
           information systems (PROMIS) and neurology quality of life measurement initiative
           (Neuro-QoL). Patients will answer questions related to their mobility, fatigue, pain
           interference, positive affect and well-being, depression, anxiety, anger and
           irritability, and emotional and behavioral dyscontrol.
