    <textblock>
      The investigators intent to recruit 80 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder families. The
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder families had received executive function training
      one year before.They will be randomized to intervention group and control group using a block
      randomization design. The intervention group will participate in intensive executive function
      training immediately,while the control group will receive executive training after 3 months.
