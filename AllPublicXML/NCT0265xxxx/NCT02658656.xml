      Background Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI) have many adverse secondary medical and
      quality of life (QOL) changes as a result of immobilization. Veterans with SCI who have
      completed rehabilitation after injury and are unable to ambulate receive a wheelchair as
      standard of care (SOC) for mobility. Powered exoskeletons are a technology that has recently
      become available as an alternate form of mobility by providing an external framework for
      support and computer controlled motorized hip and knee joints to assist with over ground
      ambulation.

      Background Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI) have many adverse secondary medical and
      quality of life (QOL) changes as a result of immobilization. Veterans with SCI who have
      completed rehabilitation after injury and are unable to ambulate receive a wheelchair as
      standard of care (SOC) for mobility. Powered exoskeletons are a technology that has recently
      become available as an alternate form of mobility by providing an external framework for
      support and computer controlled motorized hip and knee joints to assist with overground
      ambulation.

      Research Questions (Objectives) Will Veterans with chronic SCI of six months duration, who
      are medically stable and who use a wheelchair as SOC plus an exoskeletal-assisted walking
      (EAW) device in their home and community environments have clinically meaningful net
      improvements in mental health, bladder, bowel, and pain patient-reported outcomes compared
      with those who use only the SOC? Additionally, will the use of an EAW device for four months
      in the homes and/or communities of the participants result in a reduction of total body fat
      mass? Study Design A two-group (Intervention and Control), randomized, clinical trial will be
      performed with a one-year feasibility component. The Intervention group will receive SOC plus
      EAW. The Control group will receive SOC only. The study will require six years in total to
      complete and includes ten VA SCI Services as study sites. A feasibility phase will be
      employed using a staggered start by initially starting six sites and the other four sites
      starting one year later. These initial six sites will be used to assess the start-up
      activities [hiring, training, equipment procurement, Central Institutional Review Board
      (CIRB) paperwork, etc.], the rate of recruitment, and any other issues that may be of value
      for the successful completion of the study. Lessons learned will be implemented for the
      remaining sites.

      Relevance to VA In pilot studies conducted at the James J. Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx,
      NY, improvements in mental-emotional health, physical health and body composition were
      demonstrated by providing the participants the ability to walk for 4 to 6 hours per week over
      the course of three to five months. As of July 2014, a Class 2 designation was established by
      the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for &quot;powered exoskeletons&quot;. To date, one device
      (ReWalk ) has received FDA Class 2 approval for institutional and home use and is currently
      available by prescription. The Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) is the largest single
      provider to persons with SCI in the USA, caring for about 26,000 of the 42,000 estimated
      Veterans with SCI. The VA presently lacks the infrastructure to support Veterans with SCI to
      train to use this device in order to make this technology available for the home/community
      use. A controlled research study would be anticipated to be the optimal manner to demonstrate
      the efficacy, amount of use and safety of a powered exoskeleton in the home and community
      environments; findings would be immediately transferable to clinical care.

      Number of Research Participants (Sample Size) One hundred-sixty participants (80/group) will
      be randomized. Each of the 10 study sites will be expected to pre-screen 100 potential
      participants, screen 60 participants, and randomize 16 participants (8 per group) over the
      2-year enrollment period.

      Participating Sites Ten SCI Services will be selected on the basis of potential recruitment
      numbers (N=9,511 total Veterans with SCI in the sites' catchment areas and N=4,921 followed
      annually at these sites) and geographic location, to permit an even distribution across the
      country. The ten sites include: Boston, Richmond, St. Louis, Tampa, Milwaukee, Minneapolis,
      Dallas, Houston, Palo Alto, and Long Beach. Of these ten sites, five are VA Cooperative
      Studies Program (CSP) Network of Dedicated Enrollment Sites (NODES).

      Duration of Participant Intake (Study Duration) The CS #2003 study duration is projected to
      be a total of six years: The initial six sites will have a start-up year, followed by
      participant enrollment/data collection during years 1 and 2, and continued data
      collection/closeout during year 3, for a total of four years. The remaining four sites will
      begin the start-up year one year after the first six sites and follow the same enrollment,
      data collection and closeout schedule over the next four years. The four sites are expected
      to be completed one year after the initial six sites have completed, and there is an
      additional year for the Coordinating Center and Chairperson's Office to complete data
      analysis and manuscript writing, thus the study total time is six years. Participants in both
      groups will be asked to commit 33 weeks to this study. Participants in the Control arm will
      be offered an additional 8 weeks to receive EAW training in the medical centers, without
      outcome data being collected.

      Treatment (follow-up) The intervention being tested is four months of home and/or community
      use of a powered exoskeleton.

      Definition of Participant Samples (Study Population) One-hundred sixty male or female
      Veterans / Active Duty military personnel with chronic SCI, six months duration, 21 years of
      age, functional use of their hands, medically stabile, and wheelchair users for indoor and
      outdoor mobility, will be eligible for screening. All potential participants will be Veterans
      / Active Duty military personnel with SCI. Study participants will generally be outpatients
      with the exception of those inpatients who meet the eligibility criteria, and who are
      approved by the Site Investigator (e.g., some inpatients may have been admitted for a
      wheelchair fitting or another non-medical reason). Non-veterans with SCI will not be.

      Treatment Arms All participants will receive four months of treatment, randomized into two
      arms: SOC plus EAW or SOC only.

      Endpoints Primary outcome one will be the Mental Component Summary of the Veterans Rand-36
      (MCS/VR-36). Primary outcome two will be the sum T-score of the SCI-QOL bladder management
      difficulties, bowel management difficulties and pain interference item banks. The major
      secondary outcome will be total body fat mass. The two primary and the major secondary
      outcomes will be analyzed as the proportion of participants in each group who achieved a
      clinically meaningful change in score. The endpoint will be success or failure for these
      outcomes.

    <description>The Veterans RAND 36 Item Health Survey (VR-36) is a brief, generic, multi-use, self-administered health survey comprised of 36 items. The instrument is primarily used to measure health related quality of life, to estimate disease burden and to evaluate disease-specific impact on general and selected populations. The items on the questionnaire correspond to eight principal health domains including general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy-fatigue, social functioning and mental health. The outcome in this study is the score from the Mental Health Component Summary (MCS) of the VR-36, which measures the vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health of the participant.</description>

    <description>The Primary Objectives are to demonstrate that Veterans with chronic SCI of =six months duration who are medically stable and are wheelchair users for indoor and outdoor mobility as their standard of care (SOC) plus use of an exoskeletal-assisted walking device in their home and community environments will have clinically meaningful net improvements in the MCS/VR-36 and in patient-reported outcomes for the SCI-QOL bladder, bowel, and pain item banks compared with those who use only SOC for home and community mobility. The primary outcomes to be assessed will be the MCS value and the sum T-score of the SCI-QOL bladder management difficulties, bowel management difficulties and pain interference item banks.</description>
