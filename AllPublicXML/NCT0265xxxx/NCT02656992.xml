  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reduced exercise tolerance is commonly reported in patients with bronchiectasis. The purpose
      of this study is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity inspiratory muscle training
      (High-IMT) and sham High-IMT (control) on exercise capacity, respiratory muscle function
      (strength and endurance) and health related quality of life in patients with bronchiectasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis often demonstrates decreased exercise tolerance, marked dyspnea and fatigue.
      The causes are multifactorial and include altered pulmonary mechanics, inefficient gas
      exchange, decreased muscle mass, and psychological status, which all lead to a progressive
      detraining effect. Essentially both the pathology and the functional manifestations of
      bronchiectasis increase the demand for inspiratory muscle work and that contribute to dyspnea
      and exercise limitation.

      In recent studies reduced strength of respiratory muscles are investigated in bronchiectasis
      and can be contribute the exercise limitation. Additionally IMT has shown to improve
      respiratory muscle function, exercise tolerance and dyspnea in patients with bronchiectasis.
      Despite this, the number of studies are inadequate and so the optimal training protocol
      remains still to be defined. In this study the researchers want to investigate the effects of
      high-intensity inspiratory muscle training in functional results in patients with
      bronchiectasis.

    <description>The incremental shuttle walk test will be performed in an enclosed corridor. Patients are required to walk back and forth, turning around two cones placed 9 meters apart making the shuttle distance 10 meters long. Patients will follow the rhythm dictated by the audio signal.
6-minute walk test will be performed in a long, straight, enclosed corridor 30 meters in length. Patients are required to walk in their walking speed with standardised instructions. The distance walked by subjects during 6 minutes will be recorded.</description>

Each sessions lasted 21 minutes and comprised seven cycles of 2 minutes of breathing on an inspiratory threshold device followed by 1 minute of rest. High-IMT was performed at the maximal load tolerable for each 2-minute work interval and was progressively increased over the training period.</description>
