      Background:

      When there is a threat to the body, the immune system triggers inflammation. Too much
      inflammation can damage the body or cause painful symptoms. Some people with HIV feel sick
      after they start HIV drugs because their recovering immune systems cause too much
      inflammation. Or their immune systems can become activated all the time. This can cause
      serious health problems. Researchers want to test if the drug CC-11050 helps treat
      inflammation in people taking HIV drugs.

      Objectives:

      To test if CC-11050 is safe and well-tolerated for people with HIV who are taking HIV drugs.
      To see if it reduces inflammation.

      Eligibility:

      People ages 18 and older with HIV who have been on antiretroviral therapy for at least 1
      year.

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with:

      Medicine review

      Physical exam and medical history

      Blood and urine tests

      Chest x-ray

      Electrocardiogram (ECG): Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to take capsules of either CC-11050 or a placebo. They
      will take the capsules every day for 12 weeks. They will continue to take their HIV drugs.

      Participants will have a baseline visit within 2 months of screening. This includes:

      Physical exam and medical history

      Blood and urine tests

      ECG

      Leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that
      removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other
      arm.

      Participants will have follow-up visits 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the baseline visit.
      These may include repeats of some of the baseline tests.

    <textblock>
      CC-11050 is a novel anti-inflammatory compound with potential to treat a variety of chronic
      inflammatory conditions and cytokine storms associated with infectious diseases. CC-11050 is
      a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4) that is active in several in vivo models of
      inflammatory disease, inhibiting systemic TNF- production, colitis symptoms of the colon,
      psoriasiform features in the skin, arthritogenic swelling in the joints, neutrophilia and
      eosinophilia in the lung, and reducing choroidal neovascularization. These data suggest that
      CC-11050 may have therapeutic potential for chronic inflammatory conditions and/or as an
      antiangiogenic treatment. The safety profile of CC-11050 has been investigated in healthy
      males and in subjects with cutaneous lupus erythematosus; the most frequently reported
      adverse events were fatigue, headache, upper respiratory infection and pruritus; there were
      no deaths or serious adverse events.

      Inflammation is an important contributor to HIV pathogenesis both prior to and after ART
      initiation. Inflammatory responses can occur abruptly upon ART initiation (known as immune
      reconstitution inflammatory syndrome or IRIS) and can be chronic in persons with suppressed
      plasma HIV viremia who are treated with ART, and has been linked to an excess risk of
      non-AIDS serious events such as cardiovascular, liver and kidney disease and accelerated bone
      loss. Corticosteroids to reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma are a standard
      therapeutic intervention for IRIS, however a more targeted anti-inflammatory and less broadly
      immunosuppressive intervention is desirable.

      We propose a double-blind, randomized trial to assess the safety of CC-11050 in adults with
      HIV infection who have taken ART for at least 1 year and have suppressed plasma viremia.
      Enrolled subjects will be randomized 2:1 to 200 mg CC-11050 or placebo twice daily for 12
      weeks. Participants will be evaluated at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. Changes in in plasma
      HIV-1 RNA levels (by clinical assay), CD4+ T cell counts and percentages, and the effect on
      markers of systemic inflammation (e.g., TNF, IL-6, CRP, IFNg, sCD14, D-dimer) will be
      measured. The effect of CC-11050 on cellular immune activation (T cells and monocytes), and
      on viral reservoirs (cell associated HIV DNA and RNA) will also be assessed.

               9. Under the care of a primary care physician outside of the NIH

        Contraception: The effects of CC-11050 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
        reason, subjects must agree to not become pregnant. Females of childbearing potential must
        have a pregnancy test before initiating the study agent and at each study visit. Because of
        the risk involved, male and female study participants who engage in sexual activities that
        can result in pregnancy must agree to use of a male or female condom at every potentially
        reproductive sexual encounter, AS WELL AS one of the other methods listed below, beginning
        at the baseline visit and continuing until 3 months after discontinuation of the study
        agent. Acceptable methods are as follows:

          -  Hormonal contraception [e.g. consistent use of oral contraceptive pill daily or other
             hormonal method such as contraceptive implant or injection] (must be started 1 month
             prior to receiving the first dose of study agent)

          -  Diaphragm or cervical cap

          -  Intrauterine device (IUD)

          -  Male partner with a vasectomy

        During the study, if a participant becomes pregnant or suspects they are pregnant, they
        should inform the study staff and their primary care physician immediately. The study
        medication will be stopped immediately and if on CC-11050 they will be referred to a high
        risk pregnancy specialist and followed by the study team for the remainder of the pregnancy
        or the rest of the study, whichever occurs later.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Body mass index (BMI) less than or equal to 18.5 kg/m2

          2. Protease inhibitor-based ART regimen

          4. Absence of alternate available ART options in case of virologic failure

          5. Serum ALT or AST value Grade &gt;2 or total bilirubin greater than the ULN unless it is
             indirect due to Gilbert s disease

             depression and are on stable anti-depressants will undergo Psychiatry evaluation and
             clinical assessments to determine eligibility. These assesments will be done by a
             psychiatrist and may include: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Spielberger State-Trait
             Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment(MoCA). The BDI, STAI, and MoCA
             will be administered to patients being considered for study enrollment. The BDI and
             STAI may be repeated at least once during follow-up visits in those deemed eligible to
             participate.

        enrollment on observational studies or those evaluating the use of a licensed medication.
