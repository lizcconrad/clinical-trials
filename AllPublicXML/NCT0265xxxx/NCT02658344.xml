  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of autologous
      transplantation of Adipose Tissue derived Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in patient with Knee
      Osteoarthritis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JOINTSTEM is an OA treatment that uses autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells. As
      it does not use allogenic tissues and is incubated without additional genetic modification or
      mechanical and chemical modification through differentiation, it is classified as 'autologous
      cell therapy' and is completely free of immunologic rejection.

      It primarily aims to improve pain and joint function, and secondary, to regenerate cartilage.
      The intra-articular injection of JOINTSTEM is expected to stimulate the regeneration and
      growth of cartilage, and to innovatively improve pain and joint function with cartilage
      regeneration within six months.

      The subjects of this therapy were regenerative patients with K&amp;L grade 2~4 aged 18 or older.
      JOINTSTEM is expected to be used in patients who have significantly damage cartilage due to
      its cartilage regeneration ability, in addition to its improvement of pain and joint
      performance. A;sp. Patients who had already undergone knee arthroplasty can delay their
      additional surgery with the use of JOINTSTEM. For dose who still have their own cartilage,
      arthroplasty is not an immediate treatment option, and osteoporosis patients who cannot
      undergo arthroplasty due to their advanced age can receive JOINTSTEM.
