  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquiring, processing and utilising &quot;information&quot; is crucial to any mental function
      -including seemingly simple daily functions. Collectively called 'cognitive functions', these
      processes are a result of different regions of the brain acting together.

      Disruption of these cognitive functions increases the risk of development of mental health
      problem. Recently it has been proposed that inflammatory pathways may contribute to disorders
      of cognition and behaviour like depression.

      This is largely due to research showing that those with inflammatory conditions like
      arthritis are more likely to develop mental health problems like depression. Conversely,
      those who suffer from mental health problems (even in the absence of inflammatory conditions)
      have large amounts of inflammatory molecules in the blood. Studies in animals suggest that
      inflammation outside the brain can reach and affect the brain in a number of ways. So, does
      inflammation play a role in the development of cognitive and behavioural symptoms? What are
      the pathways involved?

      The current project tries to address this question. Specifically, the investigators intend to
      use modern scanning techniques to examine the effect of inducing a low grade inflammation
      (using a commonly used typhoid vaccine) to see how the inflammation affects how different
      regions of the act together to perform cognitive functions.
