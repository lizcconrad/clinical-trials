      Biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated
      lipocalin (NGAL) have been used for the early diagnosis of AKI, although with no definitive
      results. The investigators explored the association between plasma aging biomakers such as
      sklotho and contrast induced nephropathy in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) with contrast injection.

    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury represents an important clinical problem in hospitalized patients, with
      persistently high rates of mortality and morbidity. With an ever-increasing number of
      patients receiving intravascular injection of iodinated contrast media worldwide, contrast
      induced nephropathy (CIN) has become the third leading cause of hospital-acquired AKI.
      Approximately half of these cases are in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization
      procedures.

      The prevention and early intervention of CIN has been hampered mainly by the lack of a
      consensus definition and the paucity of early predictive biomarkers to accurately identify
      high-risk patients. CIN is most frequently defined as an increase in serum creatinine (sCr)
      by 25-50% above the baseline, generally occurring within the first 24 h after contrast
      exposure, in the absence of other causes. However, sCr is an unreliable indicator during
      acute changes in kidney function, and alterations in sCr levels are not particularly
      sensitive or specific for small changes in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR)e, gender,
      race and intravascular volume. Biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) and
      neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) have been used for the early diagnosis of
      AKI, although with no definitive results.

    <description>The plasma concentrations human soluble a-Klotho levels were measured by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) (Immuno-Biologic Laboratories Co., Ltd. Japan). This novel method detects sklotho using a monoclonal antibody with high affinity to the human a-Klotho protein.Hs-CRP was tested with a Beckman Coulter Immage immunobiochemistry system (USA) using nephelometry (unit: mg/L). Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was calculated by applying the Cockcroft- Gault formula to the serum creatinine concentration.</description>

    <time_frame>30 days, 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>In-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE):defined as (1) death, (2) nonfatal myocardial infarction, or (3) target vessel revascularization. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed by a rise in the creatine kinase level to more than twice the upper normal limit with an increased creatine kinase-MB. Target lesion revascularization was defined as a repeat intervention (surgical or percutaneous) to treat a luminal stenosis within the stent or in the 5-mm distal or proximal segments adjacent to the stent. Target vessel revascularization was defined as a reintervention driven by any lesion located in the same epicardial vessel. Thrombotic stent occlusion was angiographically documented as a complete occlusion (TIMI flow 0 or 1) or a flow-limiting thrombus (TIMI flow 1 or 2) of a previously successfully treated artery.</description>

      Morning blood samples were received from all volunteers after an 8-h overnight fast. The
      investigators obtained the blood samples used to measure preoperative serum uric acid,
      baseline serum creatinine (SCr) (prior to the pre-procedural hydration), blood urea nitrogen
      (BUN), fasting blood glucose, random blood glucose, electrolytes before PCI, serum lipids,
      albumin, hemoglobin, and other standard clinical parameters. Blood samples were left to clot
      for one hour and then centrifuged at 1500 ×g for 10 min. Plasma samples were accumulated and
      stored at −80 °C until analysis.
