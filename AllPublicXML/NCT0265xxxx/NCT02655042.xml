  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the long-term safety profile of RCT-01
      injections as compared to placebo injections. This study will also measure the long-term
      impact these injections will have on tendon structure and function and the symptoms of
      Achilles tendinosis.

      This is study is designed to follow participants who have completed participation in a
      clinical trial where they received injections of either RCT-01 or placebo in the Achilles
      tendon. No clinical interventions will be performed as part of study procedures.

      The day of study entry (Visit 1) will be coordinated with the participant's final visit in
      the earlier clinical trial. All participants will return to the clinic for repeat assessments
      of their Achilles tendinosis and overall health 6, 12 and 18 months after study entry.
      Furthermore, they will complete 'telephone visits'; during which they will report information
      on their overall health; 3, 9, and 15 months after study entry. Total duration of patient
      participation is approximately 18 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in a clinical trial designed to evaluate RCT-01 treatment for chronic
             Achilles tendinosis. Participants must complete the final study visit in the earlier
             trial prior to participation in this clinical trial.

          -  Willingness to provide written informed consent for participation in the study, attend
             all study visits and complete all procedures required by this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The presence of any condition that, in the investigator's opinion would impact
             participant safety and/or a participant's ability to complete all study related
             procedures. (e.g., psychiatric illness, drug addiction, alcoholism, etc.)

        NOTE: age limits not specifically set in this trial as entry into current trial based on
        qualification/completion of previous clinical trial where age rage of participants was
        explicitly stated.
