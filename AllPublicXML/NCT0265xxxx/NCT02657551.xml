    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a targeted therapy as a possible treatment for thyroid
      cancer. A targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to
      identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.

      - The name of the study intervention involved in this study is regorafenib.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety and effectiveness
      of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved regorafenib as a treatment for
      metastatic colorectal cancer and locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic
      gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Regorafenib has not been approved for treatment against
      thyroid cancer.

      Regorafenib is an oral anti-tumor agent that blocks activity of a specific kind of protein
      involved in normal cellular functions and in pathologic processes such as tumor formation and
      maintenance.
