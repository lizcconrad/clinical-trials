  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to see whether adding bavituximab (an
      investigational drug) to the standard chemotherapy drug taxane, will improve the results of
      the treatment for HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label randomized trial in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast
      cancer. Patients will be treated with either taxane alone (investigator choice of paclitaxel
      or docetaxel) or taxane with bavituximab. Paclitaxel will be given 3 of 4 weeks, docetaxel
      will be given once every 3 weeks, and bavituximab will be given weekly. All therapy will
      continue until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal or consent, investigator decision,
      or study termination. Efficacy (overall response rate) is the primary endpoint while safety
      is the secondary endpoint.

          2. Females or males at least 18 years of age.

          3. Histologically or cytologically documented metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer.

          4. Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 (Phase II); evaluable disease (Phase III)

          5. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          6. Adequate hematologic function: absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 cells/µL; hemoglobin ≥9
             g/dL; platelets ≥100,000/µL.

          7. Adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤1.8 mg/dL or calculated creatinine
             clearance &gt;50 mL/min using the Cockcroft-Gault equation.

          8. Adequate hepatic function: total bilirubin ≤ upper limit of normal (ULN), serum
             albumin ≥3.0 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             ≤1.5 × ULN. ALT and/or AST may be ≤5 × ULN if due to liver metastases. If ALT or AST
             is &gt;1.5 and ≤5 × ULN in patients with liver metastases, alkaline phosphatase must be
             ≤2.5 × ULN. Patients with Gilbert's syndrome are allowed if total bilirubin is ≤2 ×
             ULN and direct bilirubin is ≤ULN.

          9. Prothrombin time (PT) and/or international normalized ratio (INR) ≤1.5 × ULN and
             activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ≤1.5 × ULN if patient is not on
             anticoagulant therapy (a therapeutic PT and/or INR and aPTT is acceptable if the
             patient is on anticoagulants).

         10. Patients must have a negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin test within 1 week of
             Day 1 (pregnancy test not required for patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or
             hysterectomy or for those patients who are &gt;1 year postmenopausal).

         11. All patients of reproductive potential (ie, not surgically sterile or postmenopausal)
