  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm phase II trial of Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) in patients with advanced,
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. The primary objective is to assess its therapeutic
      efficacy in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The primary endpoint
      is disease-control rate (DCR) defined as the proportion of patients achieving a best overall
      response of either a complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)
      (that is maintained for at least 8 weeks).

      Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective
      response rate (ORR), duration of response (DOR), and toxicity profile of Pembrolizumab. The
      investigators will also evaluate the expression levels of Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L-1)
      in tumor tissue, as well as serum titers of hepatitis B or C in patients with hepatitis B or
      C, respectively, for whom specimens are available.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an open-label, single-institution, non-randomized, single-arm, Phase II
      study of pembrolizumab therapy in patients with advanced HCC. Patients will be treated in
      three-week cycles, with intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab on day 1 of each
      3-week cycle. Trial therapy will last until withdrawal of consent, disease progression and/or
      unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first.

      Correlative studies investigating PD-L-1 expression in tumor tissue will be assessed with
      clinical outcome. Peripheral blood will also be drawn to perform immunologic markers and
      hepatitis B or C viral titers. This is to determine if viral titers change with treatment.
      These studies are included for all patients who consent to the correlative studies (See
      Appendix F). There is an additional consent for the correlative studies.

      Up to 35 patients will be enrolled at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC).
      Investigators expect to enroll 10-12 patients per year based on the institution's enrollment
      capacity. Expected time to complete total accrual is approximately 1.5 years. Expected time
      to study completion is 3 years from date open to enrollment to allow for survival data. An
      interim analysis is planned after 14 evaluable patients are assessed for DCR to determine
      whether to continue with an additional 14 more.
