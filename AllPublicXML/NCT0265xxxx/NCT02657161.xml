    <textblock>
      Phase I clinical study for an investigational PIKA (Polyinosinic-Polycytidylic Acid Based
      Adjuvant) rabies vaccine comprising Inactivated and Purified Rabies Virus (IPRV) and the PIKA
      adjuvant. The primary objective of the study was to assess the clinical safety of the vaccine
      composition in healthy adult volunteers. The secondary objective was to evaluate the
      vaccine's efficacy based on an accelerated vaccine regimen.

    <textblock>
      A single-center, open label, randomized phase I study in healthy naïve adult subjects. There
      were three study groups; subjects were randomly assigned to groups A (12), B (12) and C (12).
      Group A, as a control arm of the study, had received a commercially available rabies vaccine,
      RABIPUR® and Group B had received doses of the investigational PIKA rabies vaccine. Group C
      received an accelerated vaccine regimen with the investigational PIKA rabies vaccine. Group A
      and B followed the same vaccine regimen of (1-1-1-1), one injection on days 0, 3, 7 and 14
      was administered respectively. Group C received the accelerated regimen (2-2-1), two
      injections on both days 0 and 3 were administered in different arms; and only one injection
      was administered on day 7.

      Each vaccine dose comprise 1.0 ml of PIKA rabies vaccine for Group B and Group C and 1.0 ml
      of RABIPUR® for Group A after reconstitution. The route of administration is intramuscular
      injection, given in the deltoid region of the arm.
