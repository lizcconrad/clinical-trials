    <textblock>
      Treatment of inflammatory lesions of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in subjects 9 to 45
      years of age with oral sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg/day compared to placebo in the subjects with
      moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris based on Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score
      and inflammatory lesion counts. Safety monitored and evaluated throughout 12-week study.
