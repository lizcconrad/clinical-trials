      Sleep apnea (SA) affects more than 4% from general population and is largely underdiagnosed.
      SA can increase the occurrence of cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic events
      (particularly stroke, diabetes &amp; obesity). CPAP is currently the Gold Standard treatment of
      SA and to prevent these events, with a major clinical benefit, long term adherence to CPAP is
      a significant problem where a significant rate of rejection and abundance after 6 months of

      Sleep apnea (SA) affects more than 4% from general population (20% of people over 65 years)
      and is largely underdiagnosed, it can be rise up by some factors such as: obesity, male
      gender. Sleep Apnea can increase the occurrence of cardiovascular, endocrine and metabolic
      events (particularly stroke, diabetes &amp; obesity). CPAP is currently the Gold Standard
      treatment of SA and to prevent these events, with a major clinical benefit, long term
      adherence to CPAP is a significant problem where a significant rate of rejection and
      abundance after 6 months of treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that an early education and information of SA (in the first 2
      weeks after diagnosis of SA and one telephonic call/month while 5 months) would allow to
      increase significantly the optimal observance of CPAP (&gt; 5 h/night).

      Thus, in this study, we will compare evolution of the observance of CPAP (h/night), of the
      apnea hypopnea index (AHI), patient knowledge of their SA and its deleterious health
      consequences in an early education and information during five months against a control group
      receiving only usual care (standard).
