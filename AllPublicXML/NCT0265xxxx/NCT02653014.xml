    <textblock>
      This multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy subjects and subjects with mild to
      moderate renal impairment will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      KBP-5074. Safety/tolerability data and Pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD) (plasma
      aldosterone, serum potassium, UACR and Blood Pressure) relationships will be explored to
      support the selection of dosing regimens of KBP-5074 that are suitable for the Phase II/III
      study.

      This study consists of two parts: Part 1 is an open-label, multiple ascending dose (MAD)
      study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074 in healthy
      subjects. The safety and tolerability will be assessed at each dose level before progressing
      to the next higher dose. Part 2 is an open label, randomized, parallel study to assess the
      safety and tolerability, the effect of renal dysfunction on the pharmacokinetics of KBP-5074,
      as well as the PK/PD relationship in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment.
