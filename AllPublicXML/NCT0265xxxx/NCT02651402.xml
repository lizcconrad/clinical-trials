      Unresolved psychological problems, such as anxiety, affect a significant number of our
      students and interfere with their ability to attend, actively participate, and prosper in
      school. This project will expand the capacity of selected mental health agencies to provide
      services in the participating schools through school therapeutic services (STS). The project
      will provide enhanced training in evidence-based behavioral health interventions to
      school-based mental health providers. The services will be implemented by STS Bachelor's or
      Master's level therapists supervised by their mental health agency supervisors (Internal
      Support), who are in turn supported by the research team (Train-the-Trainer) or external
      consultants (Train the Trainer+).

      Background/Purpose: This project will expand the capacity of selected mental health agencies
      to provide services in the participating schools through school therapeutic services (STS).
      The project will provide enhanced training in evidence-based behavioral health interventions
      to school-based mental health providers. The services will be implemented by STS Master's
      level therapists supervised by their mental health agency supervisors (Internal Support), who
      are in turn supported by the research team (TT) or external consultants (TT+).

      Population: 18 schools in Philadelphia will be chosen for participation. Students who present
      excessive anxiety in grades 4-8 would be potentially eligible to participate in the
      interventions offered by the agencies' therapists in their school.

      Intervention: This study is designed to test: a) the effectiveness of an adapted version of a
      group cognitive behavioral therapy program (aFRIENDS) compared to the original version of
      this program (FRIENDS), and b) the effectiveness of two implementation support strategies for
      aFRIENDS: Train-the-Trainer and Train-the-Trainer Plus. aFRIENDS is a shorter, more
      culturally sensitive, focused, and feasible CBT for anxiety in children than FRIENDS and
      addresses one of the major barriers to implementation (intervention-context fit).

      Design: Therapists and supervisors will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: a)
      FRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer implementation strategy (i.e., Masters-level supervisors
      receive training by experts on conducting supervision); b) aFRIENDS with Train-the-Trainer
      strategy; c) aFRIENDS using the Train-the-Trainer Plus strategy (i.e., supervisors receive
      training and consultation by experts on conducting supervision).

      Analyses: Effectiveness will be measured by comparing A to B; Implementation will be measured
      by comparing B to C. Agency therapists will conduct all treatment groups in the schools.

    <description>Effectiveness between treatment groups will be assessed by comparing the change in diagnostic status from pre to post intervention. Diagnostic status will be assessed using the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children (ADIS-P) which includes a semi-structured interview used to determine diagnostic status and outcome. Clinical judgement is used to generate a Clinician Severity Rating (CSR). A CSR &gt;4 is a clinical diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, CSR=3 patient at risk for developing a disorder.</description>

    <intervention_name>FRIENDS for Life</intervention_name>
    <description>Friends for Life (FRIENDS): FRIENDS, a GCBT program, is an effective program for the prevention and treatment of anxiety disorders in children evidenced by a meta-analysis on school-based interventions for at-risk and clinically anxious youth. FRIENDS was developed based on the view that anxiety is a tripartite construct involving physiological, cognitive, and behavioral components. Core Intervention components: Experts in CBT for childhood anxiety disorders have identified 5 essential components: psychoeducation, somatic management skills training, cognitive restructuring, exposure methods, and contingency management. The FRIENDS protocol consists of 10 weekly sessions and two booster sessions. We included the booster sessions in the regular protocol for a total of 12 sessions.</description>

    <intervention_name>Adapted FRIENDS</intervention_name>
    <description>Adapted Friends (aFRIENDS): We conducted planned adaptations to the FRIENDS protocol based on our collective experience with the protocol and qualitative data (focus group and interviews). We followed procedures developed by Lee and colleagues, including surveying service providers and trainers regarding the appropriateness of FRIENDS for the target population. Changes were made to the language (idioms, metaphors, words), cultural fit (cultural values), methods (session length, number of sessions), activities (in-session practices), which resulted in additions and substitutions in these areas while maintaining the 5 essential components of the treatment. aFRIENDS is a briefer (8-session) and more engaging and culturally-sensitive protocol than FRIENDS.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Supervisors: Any participating agency clinical supervisor with a Master's degree or
             higher in a mental health field.

          2. Therapists: Any STS therapist with a Bachelor's degree or higher who provides services
             in one of the 18 participating schools.

          3. Students: Any student enrolled in grades 4-8 in one of the participating schools, who
             had been referred to the STS program in their school and who meets study screening and
             diagnostic criteria. The screening criterion is a Total score &gt; 25 on Screen for Child
             Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) completed by a parent or school staff member. This
             student must also present a primary positive or intermediate diagnosis of Separation
             Anxiety Disorder (SAD]) Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), or Social Phobia (SP) on
             the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS); completed by a parent during the
             eligibility evaluation.

          4. If, at the conclusion of the eligibility evaluation, students do not meet diagnostic
             criteria (see above) to participate in the study, but parents and school staff
             continue to express concern about functional impairment, students will be permitted to
             participate in the intervention sessions (with parent permission). We also expect that
             there might be a very small number of eligible children whose parents may not give
             consent, and some of these parents and school personnel might want these children to
             benefit from the intervention. As such, we would like to offer these children the
             opportunity to participate along with the research subjects. This group of students
             will not be identified as &quot;research subjects&quot; and study data will not be collected
             from them. However, parents will be asked to sign a permission form for the video
             recording of the group sessions. This is the procedure we currently follow for our
             National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) funded project, which
             has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of The Children's Hospital
             of Philadelphia and School District of Philadelphia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Supervisors or therapists not involved in STS.

          2. Students with Special Education classification of &quot;Intellectual Disability;&quot; children
             whose primary diagnosis is not SAD, GAS or SP.

          3. Students with a history of psychotic or autistic spectrum disorders according to
             school records.

               -  Students meeting criteria in #2 &amp; #3 above will be excluded from participation
                  because they would be unlikely to benefit from Global Cognitive Behavioral
                  Therapy (GCBTS).

        Subjects that do not meet all of the enrollment criteria may not be enrolled. Any
        violations of these criteria must be reported in accordance with IRB Policies and
        Procedures.
