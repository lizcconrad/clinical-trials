      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of 12 months of treatment with
      enclomiphene 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or placebo capsules on body composition and metabolic parameters
      in overweight men with acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (confirmed morning T≤300 ng/dL)
      following a 6 month diet and 15 month exercise program.

      To compare the effects of 12 months of treatment with enclomiphene 12.5 mg, 25 mg, or placebo
      capsules on body composition and metabolic parameters in overweight men with acquired
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (confirmed morning T≤300 ng/dL) following a 6 month diet and 15
      month exercise program. Subjects must not have been treated with testosterone products in the
      6 months prior to the study and must not ever have used testosterone products for a year or
      longer.
