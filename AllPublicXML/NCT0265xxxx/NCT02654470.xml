      The WATCHMAN™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Technology is intended to prevent thrombus
      embolization from the left atrial appendage and reduce the risk of life-threatening bleeding
      events in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are eligible for anticoagulation
      therapy or who have a contraindication to anticoagulation therapy.
