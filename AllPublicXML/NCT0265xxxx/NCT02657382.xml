    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood flow to the heart during stress and assess
      changes in blood flow after psychological treatment in participants with coronary artery
      disease. The aims of the study are to assess the effects of heart rate variability (HRV)
      biofeedback (versus usual care) on global and regional myocardial blood flow (MBF),
      peripheral vascular function, and autonomic changes during mental stress.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the blood flow to the heart during stress and assess
      changes in blood flow after psychological treatment in participants with coronary artery
      disease. This is a randomized controlled study. The aims of the study are to assess the
      effects of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (versus usual care) on global and
      regional myocardial blood flow (MBF), peripheral vascular function, and autonomic changes
      during mental stress.

      All participants will undergo myocardial flow/perfusion imaging with positron emission
      tomography (PET) imaging at rest and after a standardized arithmetic mental stress test.
      Participants will then undergo repeat testing after 6 weeks. At 12 weeks, participants will
      also undergo a limited examination without myocardial perfusion imaging. The intervention
      group will receive biofeedback after enrollment, and the wait-list control group will receive
      the intervention between week 6 and week 12 study visits (without imaging).

    <description>Heart Rate Variability (HRV) biofeedback involves deep breathing, mindfulness (focusing on one's emotions and thoughts) and cognitive therapy (identifying and changing unhelpful or inaccurate thinking and distressing emotional responses). It is a 6-week training with one hour sessions with a certified biofeedback coach once per week. A handheld personal stress reliever device will be provided to the patients to practice at home for 20 minutes a day.</description>

    <description>Mental stress will consist of a 3-min math serial subtraction paradigm.The participants will be asked to serially subtract 7 from number specified by the researcher. For participants who have difficulty with this task, easier serial subtraction will be provided for. Throughout the task, to increase stressfulness and titrate difficulty, the participant will be prompted for faster performance and the starting number from which they were subtracting will be periodically changed. Finally, to add an evaluation component, participants will be given negative feedback during the test.</description>
