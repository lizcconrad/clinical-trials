      The purpose of the study is to observe/ collect clinical data, subject users' feedback, and
      device data to better understand the real-life usage and acceptance of the 722 Pump in type 1
      diabetes subjects,&lt;18 years of age, and the role of insulin pump therapy in Qingdao,China.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized and noninterventional post-market release
      study. Subjects will participate in 2 phases with each phase requiring the subject to use the
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump over the course of the study. During the
      study, subjects and parent or legal guardian will be trained to wear the glucose sensor in
      the abdominal area for 3 days to transmit real-time (RT) data to the pump. The duration of
      each study phase is approximately 6 months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is age &lt; 18 years at time of screening

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes

          -  Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations

          -  Subject is willing to wear the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm® REAL Time System
             continuously throughout the study

          -  Subject is a participant in the Qingdao project.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device) wherein
             he/she has received diabetes treatment from an investigational study drug or
             investigational study devices in the last 2 weeks

          -  Subject has known hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin infusion set(including tape)

          -  Subject has used the insulin pump and/or real time CGM/sensor within 90 days before
             the screening visit for more than 10 days in the outpatient setting:

               -  For example, subjects who have used insulin pump and/or real time CGM/sensor in
                  the inpatient setting will still be eligible for enrollment.

               -  For example, subjects who have used insulin pump and/or real time CGM/sensor for
                  8 days in the outpatient setting within 90 days before screening visit will still
                  be eligible for enrollment.

               -  For example, subjects who have worn the insulin pump and/or real time CGM/sensor
                  for 3 months in the outpatient setting a year before the screening visit will
                  still be eligible for enrollment

          -  Subject has been treated with drugs with a known effect on BG within 8 weeks before
             enrollment other than diabetes medications such as insulin or oral anti-diabetic
             agents.

          -  Subject has any systemic disease or medical condition found on screening that may
             interfere with the safety of the patient and efficacy of the study treatment, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, may preclude him/her from participating in the study.

          -  Subject is being treated for hyperthyroidism at time of screening

          -  Subject has taken any oral, injectable, or IV steroids within 8 weeks from time of
             screening visit, or plans to take any oral, injectable, or IV steroids during the
             course of the study

          -  Subject is currently abusing alcohol9. Any condition that either the Investigator
             believes would interfere with study participation or evaluation of results.
