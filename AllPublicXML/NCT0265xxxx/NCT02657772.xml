    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy rates of the treatment of
      small intracranial aneurysms with Stryker Neurovascular's Target® 360 Ultra coils which are a
      type of platinum coils used to occlude aneurysms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Prospective single-arm multi-center Registry which aims to collect data to
      determine the safety and efficacy of one of these marketed coils, namely the Target® 360
      Ultra coils. This is not an intervention or treatment study. Up to 100 subjects at up to 6
      sites will be enrolled.

      Study Procedure

        1. Screening and Informed consent: Patients will undergoing endovascular treatment of
           intracranial aneurysm will be screened using the Eligibility criteria checklist, and
           enrolled using approved Institutional Informed Consent process and approved Informed
           Consent form.

        2. Baseline assessment: This involves standard of care history, medical examinations and
           laboratory assessments prior to coiling procedure.

        3. Coiling procedure

        4. One day post procedure assessment

        5. 3- 28 days post procedure assessment

        6. 3-9 months post procedure assessment

        7. 9-18 months post procedure assessment

      The Site investigator and/or co-investigator or their representative(s) will conduct training
      before initiating the study to develop a common understanding of the clinical protocol, Case
      Report Forms, and study procedures among the investigators and site research staff.
      Regulatory binders with study protocol, training documents, and standard operating guidelines
      will be provided for each study site. The Principal investigator and/or co-investigator shall
      confirm data received is accurate by reviewing with the provider collecting the data. The
      principle investigator and/or co-investigator will approve all data received. Additionally,
      OpenClinica, a web-based data capture service, will receive all Case Report Forms.

      Study Monitoring will be electronic requiring upload of de-identified source documents
      through provided secure channels. However on site visits maybe scheduled in advance with the
      site personnel. Audits may be also be performed for quality assurance.

        Patients will be between 18 and 80 years of age (inclusive)and have a documented untreated
        intracranial aneurysm, less than or equal to 5 mm, ruptured or unruptured, for which Ultra®
        coils are treatment options, and for which primary coiling treatment is planned to be
        completed during a single procedure (i.e., no &quot;staged&quot; treatment). Preliminary intracranial
        stent placement and/or use of an intracranial endoluminal balloon device as adjunctive
        therapy is allowed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is between 18 and 80 years of age (inclusive).

          2. Patient has a documented untreated intracranial aneurysm less than or equal to 5.0 mm
             in maximal dimension, ruptured or unruptured, suitable for embolization with coils.

          3. Target® Ultra coils may be used.

          4. Target aneurysm can be completely or nearly completely coiled at index procedure (No
             staged treatment procedures) without anticipated need for any target aneurysm
             reintervention after 72 hours of the index procedure. If a stent is to be placed
             during a separate preliminary procedure, then screening and enrollment for the coiling
             procedure must take place after the stenting procedure is completed.

          5. Target aneurysm morphology allows for adequate retention of coils within the
             aneurysmal sac without occlusion of the parent artery, as determined by the treating
             physician.

          6. Patient (or patient's legally authorized representative) has provided written informed
             consent.

          7. Patient is willing and able to comply with protocol follow-up requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient is &lt;18 or &gt;80 years old.

          2. Target aneurysm is felt by the physician operator to be mycotic or clearly dissecting
             in etiology.

          3. Target aneurysm is &gt;5.0 mm maximum luminal dimension.

          4. Target aneurysm has been previously treated by surgery or endovascular therapy.

          5. Target aneurysm is in the physician's estimation unlikely to be successfully treated
             by endovascular techniques.

          6. Patient presents as Hunt and Hess grade V for a ruptured aneurysm.

          7. Patient has known hypersensitivity to platinum, tungsten, nickel, stainless steel or
             structurally related compounds found in Target® Ultra coils.

          8. Patients who have had or could have a severe reaction to contrast agents that cannot
             be adequately pre-medicated prior to the coiling procedure.

          9. Patients who are unable to complete scheduled follow up assessments at the enrolling
             center due to limited life expectancy (&lt;24 months), comorbidities or geographical
             considerations.

         10. Patients with Moya-Moya disease, brain arteriovenous malformation(s), significant
             atherosclerotic stenosis, tortuousity or other conditions preventing access to the
             target aneurysm.

         11. Target aneurysm with significant thrombosis that may increase the likelihood of
             recanalization at the discretion on the investigator.

         12. Female patient has a positive pregnancy assessment at baseline, breastfeeding patient,
             or patient who plans to become pregnant within the 18 months following coiling.

         13. The following comorbidities that may confound results: (a) organ failure of kidney (b)
             uncorrectable coagulation abnormality.
