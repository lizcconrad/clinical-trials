      This retrospective review presents a comparison of pediatric patients less than 5 years old
      undergoing cardiac surgery with general anesthesia with spinal, caudal epidural, or caudal
      epidural with catheter anesthesia from July 2007 to July 2013 observing differences in time
      to extubation, reintubation, and hypercarbia.

    <textblock>
      Intra-operative anesthesia medical records of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      will be acquired from July 2007 to July 2013. Allocation of regional anesthesia, and the use
      of spinal versus epidural versus epidural with catheter administration will be determined by
      provider preference. Date of surgery, age in months, gender, type of surgery, type of
      anesthesia, regional drugs, PaCO2 upon arrival in the PICU, time to extubation, and
      reintubation if applicable will be recorded. Time to extubation will be categorized into
      within the OR, less than 24 hours, or greater than or equal to 24 hours. PaCO2 levels will be
      categorized into hypercarbia (PaCO2 â‰¥ 50mmHg) and normal (PaCO2 &lt; 50mmHg).
