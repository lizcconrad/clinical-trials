  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national, multicenter, retrospective, observational post-authorization study
      (EPA-OD) study. The study will be conducted by reviewing the medical records of patients up
      to the start of the study. In each case, only data from before the start of the study will be
      obtained in order to ensure they are retrospective in nature, thus reflecting the regular use
      of nab-paclitaxel in clinical practice and avoiding interference with the physician's
      clinical practice.

      To ensure the observational nature of this study, these data will be collected whenever they
      are available in the patient's medical record, and so no diagnostic or therapeutic
      intervention outside regular clinical practice will be used.

      This is a national, multicenter, retrospective, observational post-authorization study
      (EPA-OD) study. Investigators will include all consecutive adult patients diagnosed with
      HER2-negative MBC who have started treatment with nab-paclitaxel monotherapy no further than
      the third line of chemotherapy for metastatic disease during the past 3 years (2012-2014).
      These patients must meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      established in this protocol.

      The primary objective is to describe the effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel in terms of response
      in early lines of chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer in routine clinical practice.

      This study plans to collect data retrospectively, provided they are available in the
      patient's medical record and according to routine clinical practice.

    <measure>Time to disease progression (TTP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Is defined as the time from the start of treatment with nab-paclitaxel to disease progression or death due to progression. TTP will be estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median and confidence interval for the median at 95% reliability (95% CI) will be calculated. In patients who show no disease progression or who have not died, the date of censoring may be the day on which the patient's death is documented, the day of the last follow-up assessment or the day of the last tumor assessment in case the foregoing is not available.</description>

    <description>Is defined as the time from the start of treatment with nab-paclitaxel to disease progression or death from any cause. PFS will be estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients who have shown no disease progression or who have not died at the time of data collection will be censored on the date on which it was last known that no disease progression occurred. The date of censoring may be the day of the last follow-up assessment or the day of the last tumor assessment in case the foregoing is not available.</description>
