    <textblock>
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a method of delivering radiation which can
      target the tumor more precisely and cause less damage to normal tissue. This is a Phase I
      research study looking at the safety of the dose of SBRT in organ confined prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation options for treating early stage prostate cancer can include external radiation
      therapy, which is radiation given outside the body, or prostate seed implant, which is
      placing radioactive seeds directly into the prostate. For external beam radiation therapy,
      treatment can last up to 9 weeks. Treatment is given daily, Monday through Friday. This may
      not be the most convenient option for some patients.

      One way to potentially overcome this challenge is to deliver a more intense dose of radiation
      treatment to the tumor over a shorter amount of time. Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy
      (SBRT) is a technique that treats the prostate with fewer treatments and can decrease the
      effect of radiation to the surrounding tissues. This study is a Phase I research study, which
      means that it will look at the safety of the dose of the SBRT. While SBRT itself is a
      standard of care method to administer radiation therapy, there has not been a specific dose
      outlined in the past. The aim of this study is to determine the dose that will treat the
      prostate cancer but cause the least amount of side effects.

    <description>Patients in each dose cohort will all be treated as a single dose group for dose escalation. Each cohort will have 7-15 patients. The study will be completed when either of the following events occur: 1- The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) for a cohort is reached or 2- when the highest protocol dose level is treated and tolerated (10 Gy/fraction, total 50 Gy) where we consider the therapy likely to be tumoricidal per determination of the investigators. Follow up assessments will be: 1.5 months post treatment, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post treatment, then every 6 months until five years post treatment, then annually for years 5-10. A period of 90 days must pass in order to assess toxicity. If 90 days have transpired without Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in each of the first seven patients enrolled to a specific dose level, then dose escalation to the next level may proceed.</description>

    <measure>Time to Biochemical failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels should be obtained per study calendar. The RTOG-ASTRO definition (also known as the Phoenix definition) of PSA failure will be used. Thus, when the PSA rises by more than 2 ng/ml above the lowest level (nadir) achieved after treatment, biochemical failure has occurred and the date of the failure is recorded at the time the nadir plus 2 ng/ml level is reached.</description>

    <measure>Disease-Free Interval</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The disease-free interval will be measured from the date of accession to the date of documentation of progression or until the date of death (from other causes).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Distant Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The time to distant failure will be measured from the date of study entry to the date of documented regional nodal recurrence or distant disease relapse. Patients with evidence of biochemical failure, but a negative prostate biopsy, will be considered as distant failure only.</description>
