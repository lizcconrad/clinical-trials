      Ongoing safety assessment follow up to Protocol MSB-GVHD 001 of remestemcel-L treatment in
      pediatric subjects with acute Graft versus Host Disease (aGVHD), following allogeneic
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), that have failed to respond to treatment with
      systemic corticosteroid therapy.

    <textblock>
      This is a safety follow-up study through 180 days of remestemcel-L treatment in subjects who
      participated in MSB-GVHD001. This study will also explore duration of response over time.
      Subjects who participated in MSB-GVHD001 and received at least one dose of remestemcel-L as
      outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160
      and 180 for safety endpoints. Subjects who participated in Protocol MSB-GVHD001 and received
      the first 8 doses of remestemcel-L as outlined in that protocol will be evaluated at baseline
      (Day 100) and at Days 120, 140, 160 and 180.
