      This is a Phase IV, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial designed to assess the
      safety of trastuzumab emtansine in Indian patients with HER2-positive unresectable locally

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Prospectively confirmed HER2-positive (i.e., IHC 3+ or IHC 2+ and gene amplified by
             fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] positive) as assessed on primary tumor
             and/or metastatic site

          -  Documented progression of unresectable, locally advanced, or mBC, determined by the
             investigator

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;/= 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1

          -  A negative serum Beta-Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (Beta-HCG) test for women of
             childbearing potential (premenopausal or not meeting the definition of postmenopausal
             i.e. &gt;/= 12 months of amenorrhea), and women who have not undergone surgical
             sterilization (i.e., absence of ovaries and/or uterus)

          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from
             heterosexual intercourse) or use two adequate non-hormonal methods of contraception,
             including at least one method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year, during the
             treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of study drug

          -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use
             contraceptive measures and agreement to refrain from donating sperm. With female
             partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an
             additional contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year
             during the treatment period and for at least 7 months plus 90 days (a spermatogenesis
             cycle) after the last dose of study drug. Men must refrain from donating sperm during
             this same period. With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a
             condom during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last dose of
             study drug.

             with a similar curative outcome as those mentioned above

          -  History of receiving any anti-cancer drug/biologic or investigational treatment within
             21 days prior to enrollment except hormone therapy, which can be given up to 7 days
             prior to enrollment; recovery of treatment-related toxicity consistent with other

             enrollment

          -  History of a decrease in LVEF to &lt; 40% or symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF)
             with previous trastuzumab treatment

          -  History of symptomatic chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA]
             Classes II-IV) or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment

          -  History of myocardial infarction or unstable angina within 6 months of enrollment
