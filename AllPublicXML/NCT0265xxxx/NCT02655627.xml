  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a disease which is characterized with insulin resistance and
      exercise has positive effects on glycemic control and cardiovascular disease (CVD)
      development in these patients. Encouraging physical activity and exercise with using
      internet-based technology provides; potential to reach more people via comparatively low
      cost, 24 hour accessibility to services and for clinician, more frequent communication
      ability with the patient. In literature, there is no study examined exercise training via
      internet in patients with Type 2 DM. For this reason, considering the lack of the literature,
      the investigators aimed to compare the effects of internet based combined exercise training
      on glycemic control, functional capacity and physical activity level with supervised group
      training in patients with Type 2 DM. The purpose of the study is to provide convenience of
      rehabilitation access, glycemic control, offer an alternative physiotherapy and
      rehabilitation service which can help to improve physical activity level and obtain
      quantitative data for the applicability and contribution of internet based exercise training
      in patients with Type 2 DM.
