    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is common in MS and has devastating impact on functional activities.
      There is a great demand for medications that will enhance cognitive capacity in MS patients.
      The effect of teriflunomide on cognition and vocational capacity is unknown. The
      investigators will address these questions in a sample of 30 relapsing MS patients treated
      with teriflunomide. Cognitive impairment will be measured by calculating an information
      processing speed index and a memory composite index from conventional, validated
      neuropsychological tests as recommended by consensus opinion publications. Vocational
      performance will be monitored using a newly developed online survey called the Multiple
      Sclerosis Vocational Monitoring Survey (MSVMS). This study will elucidate the effect of
      teriflunomide on these important outcomes.

      Summary:

      Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to define the effect of teriflunomide (Aubagio®)
      on cognitive abilities in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS). There are two
      secondary objectives, to [a] relate changes in cognition to vocational problems, and [b]
      determine MRI correlates of change in cognition, more specifically gray-matter (GM) volume
      metrics which the investigators believe reflect neurodegeneration.

      Design: This is a prospective, observational, single-blinded, longitudinal study of
      teriflunomide effects on cognitive performance in MS patients over 24 months.
      Neuropsychological status and 3T MRI will be assessed at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.
      Vocational status will be assessed every three months via the internet. Statistical analysis
      will emphasize within-subjects changes in all metrics to maximize statistical power.

      Study Population: Thirty (30) relapsing MS patients and 30 healthy controls (HC) will be
      enrolled in the study.

      Outcomes: An information processing speed index and a memory composite index will be
      calculated from conventional, validated neuropsychological tests as recommended by consensus
      opinion publications. Conventional clinical metrics for overall neurological disability will
      also be assessed. Vocational performance will be monitored using a newly developed online
      survey called the Multiple Sclerosis Vocational Monitoring Survey (MSVMS). Regional GM
      atrophy, as defined by measurement of thalamic and cortical atrophy, will serve as
      neurodegeneration outcomes.

      Significance of the research: The effect of teriflunomide on the development of cognitive
      impairment and vocational capacity is unknown. This study will elucidate the effect of
      teriflunomide on these important outcomes.

    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale will be administered at each time point by a board certified clinical neurologist or study nurse. The clinical status of each patient will be further assessed using validated tools for motor function, mood, fatigue and cognitive capacity. Motor function tests will be the Timed 25 Foot Walk and the Nine-Hole Peg Test. The Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen will be used to measure the degree of depression. The Short Form 36 and the Fatigue Severity Scale will be administered for Quality of Life and fatigue respectively. The neuropsychological tests will include the California Verbal Learning Test, 2nd Edition, Sorting Test from the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System, Brief Visual Memory Test Revised, Symbol Digit Modalities Test, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test. The MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire will again be administered for patient reported neuropsychological symptoms.</description>
