  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study is the first clinical trial proposed with PF-06815345. It is designed to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) following administration of
      single oral doses of PF-06815345 to healthy adult subjects.

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0) up to 28 days after last dose of study medication</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a subject who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 28 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Drug was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Subjects with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>

    <time_frame>0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 14, 24, and 48 hours post dose</time_frame>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes. Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>

    <description>Volume of distribution is defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired plasma concentration of a drug. Apparent volume of distribution after oral dose (Vz/F) is influenced by the fraction absorbed.</description>
