  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy as well as safety of rifaximin combined
      fecal microbiota transplantation(Gut microbiota reconstruction) in the treatment of IBS-D.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective study, there is only one group with no placebo/blank control. All
      qualified IBS-D patients could be admitted to hospital for at least one time of combing
      therapy (taking rifaximin for 3 days and then receiving fecal microbiota transplantation) and
      follow-up until 6 months after the first treatment.
