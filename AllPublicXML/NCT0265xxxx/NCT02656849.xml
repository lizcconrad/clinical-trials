  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying whether a new experimental cancer study drug BAY 1000394 will
      be helpful in treating solid tumor cancer with an abnormality in one of the following genes:
      Mcl-1, Myc or CCNE.

      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
           effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
           specific cancer.

        -  &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that research doctors
           are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the side effects it
           may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different types of cancer.

        -  It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved BAY
           1000394 for use in participants with your type of cancer.

        -  The study drug is a pan-CDK inhibitor targeting the genetic defect in several tumors,
           MCL1, Myc, or CCNE.

          -  Patients must have advanced cancer for which no curative therapy exists and have a
             malignancy which matches one of the following cohorts:

               -  MYC amplification (≥ 6 fold);

               -  CCNE1 amplification (≥ 6 fold).

               -  Molecular abnormalities may be detected by any CLIA-certified test, including
                  Massive Parallel (Next-Generation) sequencing platforms.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 criteria. In selected
             cases patients with evaluable disease may be eligible after discussion between the PI

             be eligible when they have progressed beyond such approved second-line therapy

          -  Age ≥ 18 years. Because there is no data for evaluating these compounds in pediatric
