      The proposed study seeks to test the effect of a plant-based dietary intervention on
      cardiovascular risk factors in police officers.

      This study tests the hypotheses that a low-fat, plant-based (vegan) diet improves body
      weight, plasma lipid concentrations, blood pressure, and, in individuals with type 2
      diabetes, glycemic control, that a low-fat, plant-based diet improves health-related quality
      of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-Item Health Survey (SF-36),
      and that a low-fat, plant-based diet improves mood, as measured by the Center for
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-Revised (CESD-R).
