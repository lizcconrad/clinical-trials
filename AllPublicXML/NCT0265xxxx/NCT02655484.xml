  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether CO2 rebreathing occurs in healthy subjects
      or patients with COPD ventilated during exercise assisted by the single-limb circuit with a
      plateau exhalation valve at a given inspiratory positive airway pressure and a minimal level
      of expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) and whether there is a potential threshold for
      predicting CO2 rebreathing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-invasive ventilation circuit consists of single-limb tubing for inspiration and
      expiration, including a plateau exhalation valve. As exhaled gases was vented out the plateau
      exhalation valve at a constant rate, during exercise, with the increase of exhalation flow,
      single-limb circuit with a plateau exhalation valve might cause carbon dioxide(CO2)
      rebreathing. Therefore, our aim in the present study was to evaluate whether CO2 rebreathing
      occurs in COPD patients ventilated during exercise assisted by the single-limb circuit with a
      plateau exhalation valve and estimate a potential threshold for predicting CO2 rebreathing.

    <description>Oxygen was delivered to the face mask by a tube at a constant rate (5L/min) to keep the fingertip oxygen saturation at 90% or above. Ventilatory assistance was delivered using a BiPAP® Vision® ventilator (Respironics, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA) in BiPAP mode applied via a tightly fitting full face mask (Curative, Suzhou, China). A symptom-limited cycle exercise test was performed while assisted by non-invasive ventilation (NIV). All measurements were recorded at inspiratory pressure of 14 cmH2O, expiratory pressure of 4 cmH2O during rest and exercise. Breathing pattern, mean exhalation flow, mean plateau exhalation valve flow, the mean inspiratory fraction of CO2 (tidal FiCO2) reinsufflated from the circuit between the mask and the exhalation valve was measured for each breath.</description>
