      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose escalation study of REGN2810 and REGN1979 in
      patients with lymphoma. The study treatment period will be from 6 to 12 months, depending on
      how an individual patient responds to treatment. The follow-up period will be 6 months for
      all patients.

        Key Inclusion Criteria [(Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL)]:

          1. Have documented CD20+ B-cell NHL or documented HL, with active disease that is either
             not responsive to or relapsed after prior therapy, for whom no standard of care
             options exists.

          2. Must have at least 1 bi-dimensionally measurable lesion (≥1.5 cm) documented by
             diagnostic imaging (CT, PET-CT or MRI).

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1

          4. Life expectancy of at least 6 months

          5. Adequate bone marrow function

          6. Adequate organ function

          7. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          8. Provide signed informed consent

        Key Exclusion Criteria (NHL and HL):

          3. Ongoing or recent (within 2 years) evidence of significant autoimmune disease that
             required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive treatments, which may suggest risk
             for iAEs

          4. Prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation

          5. Prior treatment with an agent that blocks the programmed death-1/ programmed
             death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1 pathway), unless benefit was demonstrated

          6. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or chronic/active infection with
             hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus

          7. History of hypersensitivity to any compound in the tetracycline antibiotics group

          8. Known hypersensitivity to both allopurinol and rasburicase

          9. Pregnant or breastfeeding women

         10. Continued sexual activity in men or women of childbearing potential who are unwilling
