      This is a Phase III, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel
      group multi-center trial, designed to evaluate the non-inferiority of CAM2038 compared to an
      existing standard of care (SL BPN) in initiation and maintenance treatment with BPN. The
      trial will involve 4 phases: Screening, Phase 1 (weekly visits), Phase 2 (monthly visits),
      and Follow-up.

      Approximately 380 subjects (190 subjects per arm) will be randomized.

    <description>SL BPN: 2 mg/0.5 mg or 8 mg/2 mg BPN/naloxone tablets administered daily, at doses of 8 mg/2 mg to 32 mg/8 mg per day.
CAM2038 placebo: 0.16, 0.32, 0.48 and 0.64 mL SC injection administered once weekly or once monthly (matching volumes for CAM2038 q1w and near-matching volumes for CAM2038 q4w).
Following randomization, subjects will undergo initiation of BPN with either SL BPN or SC CAM2038 q1w and participate in weekly visits for 12 weeks (Phase 1). After Week 12, subjects will be transitioned to Phase 2 with monthly visits. During Phase 2, subjects in Group 1 will continue treatment with monthly dispensing of daily SL BPN treatment and monthly placebo SC injections, and subjects in Group 2 (receiving CAM2038 q1w) will be transferred to monthly injections of CAM2038 q4w and monthly dispensing of daily SL placebo.</description>

          6. Considered by the Investigator to be a good candidate for BPN treatment, based on
             medical and psychosocial history.

          2. Current diagnosis of chronic pain requiring opioids for treatment.

          3. Current DSM-V diagnosis for moderate to severe substance use disorder on any other
