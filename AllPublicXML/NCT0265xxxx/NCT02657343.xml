    <textblock>
      Participants that have breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, is positive
      for a protein called HER2, and has not responded to standard treatment. This research study
      is a way of gaining new knowledge about the combination of Ribociclib with other drugs as a
      possible treatment for this diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase Ib/II clinical trial, which tests the safety of an
      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies.

      Ribociclib is a drug that is designed to block certain proteins called Cyclin-Dependent
      Kinases (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the
      ability of certain cancers to grow.

      In this research study, there will be 3 separate cohorts that are looking for the safe and
      tolerated dose of ribociclib that can be given in combination with other HER2 directed
      therapy. One cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). T-DM1 is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive
      breast cancer. One Cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast
      cancer. The last cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) and fulvestrant (Faslodex) for ER-positive and HER2-positive breast
      cancer. These are both standard treatments for this type of breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ribociclib as a treatment
      for any disease.

             patient is permitted in this study, except as specifically prohibited below.
             Combination administration of study drugs could result in drug-drug interactions (DDI)

          -  The list provided here (and in Tables 1 and 2, Appendix B) is not comprehensive and is
             only meant to be used as a guide. The list is based on the Oncology Clinical
             Pharmacology Drug-Drug Interaction Database (release date: 29 Oct 2012), which was

             untreated or uncontrolled fungal, bacterial or viral infections, etc.).

          -  Participants who have had major surgery within 2 weeks prior to starting study drug or

          -  Participants who have clinically significant, uncontrolled heart disease and/or
             cardiac repolarization abnormalities including any of the following:

             significantly alter the absorption of the study drugs (e.g., uncontrolled ulcerative
             diseases, uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome, or small
             bowel resection).

          -  Concurrent malignancy or a malignancy within 3 years prior to starting study drug,
             with the exception of adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma,
             non-melanomatous skin cancer or curatively resected cervical cancer. Participants with
             malignancies less than 3 years prior to registration may be considered eligible after
             discussion with the principle investigator.

          -  Participants who are currently receiving or have received systemic corticosteroids ≤2
             weeks prior to starting study drug, or who have not fully recovered from side effects
             of such treatment. The following uses of corticosteroids are permitted: single doses,
             topical applications (e.g., for rash), inhaled sprays (e.g., for obstructive airways

          -  Participants who have a history of non-compliance to medical therapies.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because Ribociclib has the potential for
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             Ribociclib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             Ribociclib. These risks also apply to Trasutuzumab used in this study. Pregnancy is
             defined as the state of a female after conception and until the termination of
             gestation, confirmed by a postitive hCG laboratory test (&gt;5 mIU/mL).

          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception
             throughout the study and for 8 weeks after study drug discontinuation. Highly
             effective contraception methods include:

               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of
                  the patient.

               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study treatment.
                  In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
                  been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment

               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female patients on
                  the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                  patient

               -  Combination of the two following

                    -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

                    -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal
                       suppository.

          -  Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods)
             and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception Women are considered
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child
             bearing potential.

          -  Sexually active males unless they use a condom during intercourse while taking the
             drug and for 4 months after stopping treatment and should not father a child in this
             period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent
             delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.
