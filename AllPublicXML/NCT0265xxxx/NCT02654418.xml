      SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift
      of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to
      excision with a snare.

      SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift
      of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to
      excision with a snare.

      The current trial will focus on only colonic polyps ≥20 mm removed by snare EMR technique.

      Patients with lesions not suitable for EMR because of features strongly suggestive of
      sub-mucosal invasion will not be included.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of treatment naïve, laterally spreading sessile, flat polyps or adenomas of
             the colon equal to or greater than 20 mm in largest dimension, assessed by the
             investigator to be suitable for EMR.

          2. The base of the lesion should measure at least 20mm in at least one dimension.

          3. A photograph demonstrating the lesion size ≥20 mm against a stiff Boston Scientific
             Captivator snare of 20 mm must be recorded for each patient prior to randomization.

          4. ASA status: limited anesthesiology risk, with ASA score 1, 2 or 3.

          5. Contraception: women of childbearing potential must use at least one reliable method
             of contraception or be abstinent. Women of non-child-bearing potential or in
             post-menopausal status must have been in that status for at least 1 year. For all
             women of child-bearing potential, serum pregnancy test result must be negative at
             screening.

          6. Full comprehension: ability to comprehend the full nature and purpose of the study,

             and to comply with the requirements of the entire study.

             active diverticulitis.

         17. inflammatory bowel disease e.g ulcerative colitis or Crohn's 's disease

             thrombophilia), known clotting disorder (INR&gt;1.5 that cannot be corrected).

         19. Other medical condition that in the investigator's opinion would make the
             administration of the study IMD or procedures hazardous to the subject.
