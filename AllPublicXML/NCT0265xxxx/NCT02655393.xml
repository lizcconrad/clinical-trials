      Part A:

      The study is a double-blind, randomized, single ascending doses, study in 24 healthy elderly
      male and female volunteers. Each subject will be randomized for two subsequent doses in three
      cohorts.

      Part B:

      The study is a double-blind, randomized, multiple ascending doses study in 36 healthy elderly
      male and female volunteers. Subjects will be randomized to receive study product or placebo
      for 28 days.

      Part A: Single Ascending Dose study of AMAZ-02 with 3 cohorts (each cohort n=8 subjects,
      total n=24 subjects). Cohorts undergo two periods of single dose intervention separated by 3
      week washout. Adverse events, clinical biochemistry for safety assessment and plasma and
      urine collected for pharmacokinetic measurement for parent and metabolite levels in
      circulation.

      Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose study with 3 cohorts (each cohort n=12 subjects, total n=36
      subjects). 28 day administration with AMAZ-02 for safety, PK and PD assessment.
