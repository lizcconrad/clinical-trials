  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from chronic degenerating diseases are often treated by a plethora of
      NSAIDs, DMARDs, Biologicals, as well as combinations of these therapeutics. However, many
      patients are refractory to this treatment and suffer from chronic pain over years, leading to
      a worsening of the quality of live. The mobilization of these patients is one main goal in
      the therapy of these chronic and inflammatory diseases. Low dose radiation therapy (LDRT) is
      applied since more than one century for the local treatment of chronic degenerating joint
      diseases. The success of the treatment was described by many retrospective as well as pattern
      of care studies, respectively.

      Local (only at the painful joint) low dose irradiation of the chronic patients results in
      most patients in a significantly reduced pain, not only direct after the therapy, but also
      lasting for more than 12 month in many cases. The patients experience enhanced mobility and
      increased quality of life. The molecular and cellular processes leading to the pain reduction
      are just fragmentarily analyzed. Our group revealed that macrophages are key players in
      radiation-induced immune modulation. Inflammatory macrophages exposed to low doses of
      radiation showed a reduced inflammatory capacity and attenuated an inflammatory
      microenvironment. Besides macrophages further immune cells are most likely involved in
      reduction of inflammation following LD-RT, as in vitro already shown for neutrophils.

      The IMMO-LDRT01 study aims for the first time to analyze in detail the immune status of
      patients suffering from inflammatory, chronic joint diseases before, during and after LD-RT
      in a longitudinal manner. The multi-color flow cytometry-based assay will allow determining
      over 30 immune cell subsets and additionally their activation status. Further, biodosimetry
      will be performed with the whole-blood samples to get hints about dose that the immune cells
      are exposed to. This will be performed with national and international co-operation partners.

      The IMMO-LDRT01 study is a prospective and observational study not influencing the standard
      therapeutic scheme and will provide hints how the LDRT affects besides local cells in the
      irradiated area also the systemic inflammatory response.

        Patients suffering from chronic inflammatory diseases of the joints, namely painful
        shoulder syndrome (periarthritis humeroscapularis), painful elbow syndrome
        (Epicondylopathia humeri), benign achillodynia, and benign calcaneodynia.

        Patients were attributed to our clinic and the study protocol was explained in detail. The
        patients have to give their informed consent before starting with the LDRT. The
        treatment-plan of the underlying disease remained unchanged. This treatment scheme is
        conducted with 2 irradiations within 7 days for total treatment duration of 3 weeks. The
        single dose is 0.5 Gy and the complete dose of one round of LDRT is 3 Gy.
