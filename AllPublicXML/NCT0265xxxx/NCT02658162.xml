      patients who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor kidney.

    <textblock>
      Sixty (60) adult subjects who will be recipients of a donation after brain death (DBD) donor
      kidney and who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized 1:1 within 48 hours prior to
      transplant surgery to receive: two infusions of SANGUINATE at a dose of 320 mg/kg or placebo
      on the day of surgery and approximately 24 hours after surgery. Patients will be hospitalized
      for up to 5 days and the study duration will be 30 days.
