  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the effectiveness of reactive focal drug administration
      (RFDA) using dihydroartemisinin+piperaquine (DHAP) versus reactive focal test and treat
      (RFTAT) using artemether+lumefantrine (AL) as a routine process for identifying and
      eliminating malaria transmission as measured through achieving zero seropositivity in
      children under five in Southern Province, Zambia. These two strategies are potential
      candidates for expanded malaria operational surveillance and elimination for low malaria
      transmission areas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a cluster randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the impact of RFDA
      intervention against current standard of care for the impact on seropositivity in children
      under five years, passive surveillance for confirmed malaria case incidence, and elimination
      of transmission from hotspots. It will be conducted among a background population of ~130,000
      people in ~30,000 households in 16 health center catchment areas across several districts in
      Southern Province. The government of Zambia is pursuing malaria elimination as a national
      goal on an accelerated timeline and this trial will help evaluate two treatment-based
      strategies for supporting malaria elimination.

      The secondary objectives of the study include: 1). Compare the effectiveness of RFDA using
      DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing rapid diagnostic test (RDT) confirmed malaria incidence
      through passive case detection at health facilities; 2). Compare the effectiveness of RFDA
      using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the prevalence of malaria and preventing
      re-infection in individuals receiving reactive responses; 3). Compare the cost-effectiveness
      of RFDA using DHAP with RFTAT using AL in reducing the burden of malaria in the community;
      4). Measure the proportion of P. falciparum infections likely attributable to importation and
      local transmission using parasite genotyping as well as defining genotype spatial
      distribution; 5). Assess the utility of using serology to measure short term changes in
      malaria transmission and evaluate malaria elimination programs; and 6). Assess the
      feasibility of using remotely sensed malaria risk maps to identify areas with higher
      potential for local malaria transmission.
