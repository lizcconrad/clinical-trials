      The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study is to determine the benefit-risk
      ratio (success rate, complication rate, tolerance) for patients with biliodigestive
      anastomosis by either continuous or interrupted suture. A biliodigestive anastomosis is a
      surgical connection between the common bile duct (ductus choledochus) and the digestive tract
      to prevent interference of bile flow. Indications for a biliodigestive anastomosis include
      total or partial resection of the pancreas and duodenum (PPPD, Whipple procedure) for
      pancreatic tumors, tumors of the biliary tract or duodenum, and biliary tract reconstructions
      during liver transplantation or advanced liver resections. Furthermore a biliodigestive
      anastomosis can be required to manage the injury of the biliary tract and infectious and
      traumatic structures of the biliary tract. Biliodigestive anastomoses can be performed by
      continuous or interrupted suture. The aim of this study is to determine the difference
      between continuous and interrupted suture for biliodigestive anastomoses, as advantages and
      disadvantages of each technique have not been determined. Only patients receiving their first
      biliodigestive anastomosis will be included.
