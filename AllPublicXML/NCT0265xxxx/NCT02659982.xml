  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the relevance of the information as provided by the
      EarlySense Home care Tele-monitoring system can provide relevant flagging information for
      clinicians to identify the patients at higher risk to proactively assess patients' condition

      Study objectives include:

        1. Assess if and to what extent the flags provided by EarlySense Home care tele-monitoring
           provides relevant clinical information that can help case managers / nurses of home care
           agency to detect patients who need further assessment and perhaps early intervention to
           minimize hospitalization (re-admission to hospital).

        2. Use data to further optimize a decision algorithm utilizing changes in physiological
           data over time (i.e., hours to days) which may identify patients at higher risk for poor
           outcomes (flagging algorithm).

        3. Assess the acceptability of the EarlySense Home care device by clinicians

        4. Assess the acceptability of the EarlySense Home care device by patients at home and
           their families, in their own home as determined by a provided questioner
