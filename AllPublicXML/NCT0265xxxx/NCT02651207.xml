      Study to look at the acceptability of local anaesthetic spray versus injection, prior to
      contraceptive implant insertion

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, patients undergoing contraceptive implant insertion are offered local anaesthetic
      with an injection before insertion. This study aims to look at whether patients find using
      the local anaesthetic spray more acceptable or equally acceptable to using local anaesthetic
      injection. Both are currently licensed products for use as skin anaesthesia but the spray is
      potentially quicker and involves less injections. Some areas of sexual health are already
      offering this option but there isn't much evidence as to which patients find more acceptable.

      Patients in this study will be given a choice of anaesthetic asked to complete a short
      questionnaire, giving a pain score , on the pain rating scale of 0 to 10, ( being no pain to
      10 being extremely painful. ) In addition, they will be asked to give the reasons for their
      choice. The questionnaire will be anonymous.

      Average pain scores will be calculated between in group and compared.

          -  Patients will be assessed for medical eligibility for the contraceptive implant have
             no contraindications to either the implant, lidocaine or the ethyl chloride spray.
             However, if they have a known sensitivity to either the spray or the lidocaine
             ejection, they will be offered the other.

          -  Age between 13 and 55

          -  Has capacity to consent

          -  Has read the information sheet and consents to the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has a contraindication to have a contraceptive implant

          -  Doesn't wish to have a implant

          -  Allergy to either the implant, the lidocaine, the ethyl chloride or any of the
             incipient ingredients. Although patients will be given the option, if they have an
             allergy/contraindication to one of the products, they will be offered the other
