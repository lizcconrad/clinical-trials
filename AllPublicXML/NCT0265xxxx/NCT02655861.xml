  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will follow babies with ichthyosis over time in order to better understand the
      natural course of ichthyosis in infants and children and to examine how specific genetic
      mutations affect clinical characteristics.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that early complications and comorbidities in infants with
      congenital ichthyosis are genotype-dependent, such that clinical standards of care can be
      tailored to the genetic diagnoses. Definition of clinical groups based upon phenotype may
      also provide useful predictors of outcome. Information gained from this study will provide
      the basis for the development of rational standards of care for the future management of
      children with congenital ichthyosis.

    <measure>Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess growth, birth weight and all weights (in pounds) obtained during hospitalization and clinic visits will be recorded. The primary outcome of the study will be to determine incidence, timing and severity of &quot;growth failure&quot; in neonates with ichthyosis in relation to genotype at the 3 year pediatric visit. Weight of the child will primarily be used to make this determination.</description>

    <measure>Length (Height)</measure>
    <time_frame>36 Months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess growth, birth length and all subsequent measures (in inches) obtained during hospitalization and clinic visits will be recorded. The primary outcome of the study will be to determine incidence, timing and severity of &quot;growth failure&quot; in neonates with ichthyosis in relation to genotype at the 3 year pediatric visit. Length of the child will primarily be used to make this determination.</description>

    <description>To assess growth, birth weight and all weights (in pounds) obtained during hospitalization and clinic visits will be recorded. Weight of the child will be used to characterize growth over the course of the 3 year follow up time.</description>

    <measure>Electrolyte Disturbance</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth (baseline), 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurements of electrolytes, including calcium, phosphate, magnesium, BUN and creatinine values will be used to evaluate the incidence, timing, and severity of electrolyte disturbances and the management of these disturbances in the neonatal period in relation to phenotypic group and to genotype. This outcome will be captured as a 'yes/no' for any or all of the above.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Systemic Infections</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth (baseline), 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>The incidence, severity timing, and causative organisms of systemic infections during neonatal hospital stays will be reviewed in relation to management, including skin care practices and nursing procedures (e.g., open bed vs. humidified isolette).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complications of Congenital Ichthyosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth (baseline), 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical severity will be rated using a standardized instrument. The evolution of skin phenotype will be documented via serial standardized photography. Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) will be measured in some sites.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Developmental Delays</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth (baseline), 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the incidence and severity of development delays in relation to genotype, a development history will be obtained at each follow-up evaluation, including information regarding relevant interventions such as physical or occupational therapy. Physical examination at each visit will assess range of motion of digital and major limb joints. This outcome will be captured as a 'yes/no' for any or all of the above.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Ear and Eye Conditions</measure>
    <time_frame>Birth (baseline), 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, 36 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the incidence and severity of ear and eye problems in early childhood in relation to genotype, caregivers will be queried regarding buildup of ear debris and palpebral closure during sleep. Physical exams will assess ear canal patency, lid closure, and signs of conjunctival irritation. If participants are evaluated and/or treated by ophthalmology and otolaryngology, these records will be obtained. This outcome will be captured as a 'yes/no' for any or all of the above.</description>
