  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke remains the most dangerous and frightening complication of atrial fibrillation (AF).
      Numerous factors predisposing to peripheral embolism in patients with AF have been well
      defined, documented and included in the CHA2DS2VASC score. Although proper anticoagulation
      minimizes the risk attributable to &quot;known&quot; risk factors, stroke may still occur. Thus,
      &quot;unknown&quot; risk factors may play an important role in stroke risk stratification in patients
      with AF. The investigators assume that one of the important &quot;unknown&quot; risk factor is left
      atrial appendage (LAA) morphology. The ASSAM study is planned to include 100 patients after
      ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and known status of anticoagulation at the
      time of stroke. The control group will consist of 100 patients scheduled for AF ablation
      without a history of stroke or TIA.

    <measure>The LAA morphology in patients with an elevated risk of peripheral thromboembolism defined as CHA2DS2-VAScore &gt;2</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will examine association of specific type of LAA morphology with ischemic stroke taking in to account anticoagulation in the time of stroke/TIA.
The morphology of LAA will be divided into 4 types:
the chicken wing - LAA with only one lobe, its length exceeds 40 mm and its bend angle is less than 100 degrees
the windsock - LAA with one dominant lobe (length &gt; 40 mm) and several secondary, or even tertiary ones, its length exceeds 40 mm and its bend angle exceeds 100 degrees
the cauliflower - LAA with a variable number of lobes with lack of a dominant lobe, its total length is less than 40 mm
the cactus - LAA with a dominant central lobe with several secondary ones, its total length less than 40 mm</description>
