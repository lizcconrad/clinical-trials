      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of BPM31510 administered as a 144-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion as
      a monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients as
      2nd / 3rd line therapy. The study will enroll up to 50 patients in the US and Europe.

      This is a Phase 2 multicenter, open-label, non-randomized study to examine the safety and
      effectiveness of BPM31510 administered as a 144-hour continuous intravenous (IV) infusion as
      a monotherapy or in combination with gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer patients as
      2nd / 3rd line therapy.

      This study will occur in two parts. Part 1 of the study will enroll ten (10) patients in the
      BPM31510 (monotherapy arm) and enroll ten (10) patients in the BPM31510 plus gemcitabine
      (combination therapy arm). If at least one of ten patients treated (in either arm)
      experiences a Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR), based on RECIST 1.1 criteria,
      after 2 cycles of treatment, then Part 2 of the study will enroll an additional 15 patients
      for a total of 25 patients in the arms(s) showing response. In the absence of at least one CR
      or PR, if at least 3 patients experience stable disease in either or both of the treatment
      arms the Sponsor can choose to enroll the additional 15 patients into the applicable
      treatment arm(s) into the expansion stage.

      BPM31510 Nanosuspension Injection (40 mg/mL) will be administered IV over 144 hours. Each
      patient will receive 2 consecutive 72-hour infusions per week (Tuesday-Friday and
      Friday-Monday). Patients enrolled in the monotherapy arm will receive a BPM31510 dose of 171
      mg/Kg. The dose for BPM31510 in the combination arm is 110 mg/Kg. Patients enrolled in the
      combination therapy arm will also be treated with gemcitabine IV once weekly (starting at
      week 3) at a starting dose of 1000 mg/m2.

      Cycle 1 of therapy is either 6 weeks in duration for patients with BPM31510 administered
      twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks (monotherapy) or 6 weeks in duration for
      patients with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 6 weeks plus
      gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 21, 28 and 35 (combination therapy).

      Cycles 2-12 are 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice weekly on Tuesdays and
      Fridays for 4 weeks (monotherapy) or 4 weeks in duration with BPM31510 administered twice
      weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays for 4 weeks plus gemcitabine administered on Mondays, Days 7,
      14 and 21 (combination therapy). Response will be assessed after Cycle 2 (10 weeks) and
      patients who continue onto Cycles 2-12 will be assessed every 2 cycles (8 weeks).

      Toxicity will be graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria
      for Adverse Events (CTCAE v4.02). Assessments of the antitumor activity of the combination
      will be performed at the end of Cycle 2 and every 2 cycles thereafter using standard
      techniques such as computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
      patients with measurable disease. Response will be evaluated using Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. Patients who experience no unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression, may receive additional 28-day cycles for up to 1 year.

      Patients will continue BPM31510 alone, or in combination with gemcitabine, for a maximum of
      12 cycles in the absence of intolerable toxicity and progression. If gemcitabine in the
      combination therapy arm is discontinued due to chemotherapy-related toxicity, patients may
      continue to receive BPM31510 as monotherapy.
