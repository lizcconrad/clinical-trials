      The purpose of this study is to investigate mechanisms responsible for weight change in
      patients who have undergone weight loss surgery. Specifically, we will compare the gut
      microbiota, plasma bile acids, plasma gut peptides (GLP-1, GLP-2, and PYY), and plasma LPS in
      three groups of subjects: 3-5 years post gastric bypass patients who experienced sub-optimal
      weight loss, 3-5 years post gastric bypass patients who had successful weight loss, and a
      control group who has not had a weight loss surgery and are of similar age, gender, body mass
      index as the gastric bypass groups.
