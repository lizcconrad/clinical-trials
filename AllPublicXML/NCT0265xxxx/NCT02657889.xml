        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has histologically proven advanced (unresectable) or metastatic cancer as
             outlined below according to study phase and disease type:

                       HER2-negative, estrogen receptor-negative, and progesterone
                       receptor-negative (ie, TNBC). Patients with advanced or metastatic disease
                       may have up to 4 lines of cytotoxic therapy. Neoadjuvant and adjuvant
                       therapies are not counted towards lines of therapy.

                    -  Patients must have any epithelial (ie, serous, endometroid, mucinous, clear
                       cell) ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients must
                       have experienced a response lasting at least 6 months to first-line
                       platinum-based therapy but currently considered to have platinum-resistant
                       disease per investigator's assessment (e.g, patient is not eligible for
                       further platinum containing treatment). Patients may have received up to 5
                       lines of cytotoxic therapy for advanced or metastatic cancer. Neoadjuvant
                       and adjuvant therapies are not counted towards lines of therapy.

               2. Phase 2 patients (breast or ovarian cancer)

                    -  Patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer must have TNBC. Patients
                       with advanced or metastatic disease may have received up to 2 lines of
                       cytotoxic therapy. Adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapies are not counted in
                       the number of lines of therapy. TNBC patients who have previously received
                       platinum chemotherapy in the metastatic setting are allowed to enroll in the
                       study as long as they did not progress while on or within 8 weeks from the
                       day of the last platinum administration.

                    -  Patients must have with high-grade serous or endometroid ovarian, fallopian
                       tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Patients must have experienced a
                       response lasting at least 6 months to first-line platinum-based therapy but
                       currently considered to have platinum-resistant disease per investigator's
                       assessment (e.g, patient is not eligible for further platinum containing
                       treatment). Patients may have had up to 4 lines of cytotoxic therapy for
                       advanced or metastatic cancer. Neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and the combination of
                       both will be considered as one line of therapy.

             (ie, with use of disease-modifying agents, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg, thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment

          -  Prior treatment with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent

          -  Prior treatment with a known poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor
