    <textblock>
      This study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of oral
      lafutidine tablets and the effect of food on pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese subjects.
      The tolerability and the effect of sex on the pharmacokinetic properties were also evaluated
      to acquire more pharmacokinetic information.

      The study of single-dose was randomized, three-period, crossover. And in this study, 12
      subjects were randomly assigned to 3 dose groups and received a single dose of 10mg, 20mg and
      40mg lafutidine tablets. The washout period was 7 calendar days. In the multiple-dose, 12
      subjects took lafutidine tablets of 10 mg twice a day for 6 consecutive days. In the
      food-effect study, 12 subjects were randomly assigned to 2 groups. One group received a
      single dose of 10mg lafutidine tablets under fasted condition, while the other were in fed
      condition. The drug administrations were separated by a wash-out period of seven calendar
      days. In each study group, the male and the female are both in half of the subjects. Using a
      liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method to determine the plasma
      concentration of lafutidine. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the single
      compartment model.
