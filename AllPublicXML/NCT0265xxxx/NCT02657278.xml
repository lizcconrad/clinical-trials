    <textblock>
      Aim: To determine whether the lactate threshold during CPET is influenced by the presence of
      haemodynamically significant PAD.

      Assumption: Correction of haemodynamically significant PAD results in an increased LT,
      measured by CPET.

      Design: Prospective study Population: Thirty patients scheduled to undergo surgical or
      percutaneous treatment of iliofemoral arterial disease for intermittent claudication.

      Patients scheduled to undergo surgery or angioplasty of the iliofemoral segment for
      intermittent claudication will be screened for inclusion. Consenting patients will undergo
      ABI measurements and CPET before treatment and four weeks after treatment. Study measures
      will be performed in the respiratory physiology laboratory at University Hospital Aintree.
      Demographic and medical details will be recorded including gender, age, smoking history and
      pack years, medical history and treatment and BMI. A record will be made of patuients' latest
      full blood count which will be routinely available in all participants before the procedure.
      Ankle-brachial index will be recorded. The subjects will undergo full CPET. This includes
      recording of baseline spirometry, full ECG monitoring throughout the test, measurement of
      ventilator parameters and recording of Borg breathlessness and leg fatigue score every
      minute. At the end of the test the reason for cessation will be documented. The test will be
      incremental with a 10-20W ramp determined according to baseline MVV aiming for the subject to
      exercise for 10-12 minutes. The test will involve 3 minutes rest, 2 minutes free-pedal
      followed by continuous ramping until volition. Recording will continue for 5 minutes recovery
