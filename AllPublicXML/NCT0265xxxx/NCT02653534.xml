      This study is being conducted to assess the impact of promoting community initiated Kangaroo
      Mother Care (KMC) for low birth weight babies on post enrolment neonatal mortality and
      mortality post enrolment upto 6 months of age. This large individually randomized controlled
      trial will enroll 10500 low birth weight babies. The secondary objectives are examining the
      impact of the intervention on exclusive breast feeding and growth at 1 and 3 months,
      infections and hospitalizations in the neonatal period and from 1 to 5 months of age,
      recognition of illnesses and early care seeking from appropriate sources, motor and mental
      development in a subsample.

      Newborns weighing &gt;=1500 to &lt;=2250gm are being enrolled into the study within 3 days of
      birth. Eligible babies are randomized to intervention or control arms. Mothers in the
      intervention arm are supported for KMC and breastfeeding by study ANM (Auxiliary Nurse
      Midwife) and study ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) like workers . Routine home
      visits are conducted in both intervention and control arms by government workers according to
      the existing government program.

      Survival will be ascertained in all enrolled infants through contacts at 1, 3 and 6 months.
