      The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with
      hypothyroxinemia adjunct to conventional therapies in GBM patients.

    <textblock>
      Since T4 (thyroxine) is a potent growth factor in numerous cancer types, the interventional
      approach will be to achieve thyroxine deprivation (hypothyroxinemia).This can be achieved by
      using a dual approach: T3 and methimazole to provide longer term inhibition of thyroid
      hormone synthesis.

    <description>The primary outcome measure of the study is the ratio of patients who complete their 6-month course of chemotherapy given the IP adjunct treatment. Each patient is treated up to 6 weeks until their FT4 target is reached at which time they enter a 26 week (6 month) treatment phase during which they receive chemotherapy as per common protocol with the IP as adjunct treatment. Patients will be monitored for disease progression as per common oncological protocol (e.g. every 2 months) and those who show progression will be deemed failures. Patients with no disease progression (or partial or complete remission) at the end of the 6 month period will be considered success.</description>
