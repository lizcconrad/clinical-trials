    <textblock>
      Our primary objective in this clinical intervention study, therefore, was to explored the
      effect of residual tissue thickness on the palatal mucosa healing from baseline to 1, 3 and 6
      months after free gingival graft harvesting in order to determine as soon as possible to
      re-harvest gingival graft from same site.

      Forty individuals (19 males and 21 females; age range: 18-35 years) were enrolled in the
      study. Based on the remaining tissue at donor site after free gingival graft harvesting,
      individuals were divided into two groups: 1.0-1.9 millimeter (mm) remaining tissue at donor
      site after harvesting (n = 20), 2-2.9 mm remaining tissue at donor site after harvesting.
      Tissue filling in defect area from three points (mesial, central and distal) was measured at
      various time-points (baseline, post-operative 1, 3, 6 months).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All individuals received oral hygiene instructions and full-mouth scaling was
             performed. -They were instructed to perform a non-traumatic brushing technique (Roll)
             using an ultra-soft toothbrush

          -  Individuals were re-evaluated at 8 weeks after initial therapy, and only full mounth
             plaque score and full mounth bleeding score &lt;15% were enrolled to the surgical
             procedure

          -  mucogingival defects which for soft tissue graft application were indicated

          -  For Less than 2 mm group, between 2.5 and 3.4 mm palatal thickness at each measurement
             points before graft harvesting

          -  For 2 mm or more group, between 3.5 and 4.4 mm palatal thickness at each measurement
             points before graft harvesting.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  periapical or palatal pathologies,

          -  absence teeth from canine to first molar,

          -  excessive forces including mechanical forces from orthodontics and occlusion,

          -  systemic diseases that would contraindicate for periodontal surgery or interfere with
             tissue healing, chronic high-dose steroid therapy, radiation or immunosuppressive
             therapy, pregnancy, lactation, smoking, or allergy or sensitivity to any drug

          -  Study participants had no history of drug therapy known to interfere with healing and
             to cause gingival enlargement

          -  Individuals who had complication such as bleeding, necrosis and delay healing during
             or after surgery were excluded from the study.
