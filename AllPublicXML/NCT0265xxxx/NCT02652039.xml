      The purposes of this study were 1) to delineate any differences in general musical taste
      (trait) and context-specific music preference (state), as well as preferred music
      characteristics in cancer patients, 2) to investigate the contributions of individual
      variabilities, personality, behavioral coping styles, and pain levels in predicting changes
      from trait to state preferences and preferred music characteristics under various pain
      conditions.

      Cancer patients were recruited to fill in questionnaires pertaining to their demographic
      information (age, gender, religious preference, ethnicity, music background and experience),
      personality traits, music preferences, preferences for music characteristics, coping styles,
      and pain experiences.
