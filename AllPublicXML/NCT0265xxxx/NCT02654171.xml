      VICTOR is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 2-part study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antiviral effect
      of single and multiple dosing of AK0529 in infants hospitalized with RSV infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Globally, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is recognized as the leading cause of respiratory
      tract infections in infants and young children and a major cause of hospitalization due to
      severe respiratory infection. Despite four decades of effort, there are still no effective
      methods to control RSV infection. Treatment of RSV has been limited to supportive measures.
      There is an urgent need for safe and effective drugs to treat and prevent RSV disease.

      AK0529 is an investigational antiviral agent that targets the RSV fusion protein on the
      surface of the viral envelope and exerts antiviral activity against RSV by inhibiting viral
      entry into host cells and preventing fusion protein induced cell-cell fusion. AK0529 was
      generally well tolerated in healthy volunteers.

      This study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase
      2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and
      antiviral effect of single and multiple dosing of AK0529 in infants hospitalized with RSV
      infection. It will consist of two parts, Part 1 and Part 2. Each part will consist of three
      phases, a pre-treatment phase, a treatment phase and post-treatment follow-up phase.

             prematurity of ≥1 month and ≤24 months.

          -  Diagnosis of RSV infection by virological means, which may include rapid diagnostic
             point-of-care testing, within 96 hours preceding screening for Part 1 and 72 hours for
             Part 2.

          -  Patient must weigh &gt;3 kg at screening and be within the 10th and 90th percentiles
             (inclusive) for the patient's age, based on the local child growth standards, i.e. the
             Australian Paediatric Endocrine Group Growth Charts.

          -  The parent / legal guardian of the patient must have provided written informed consent
             for the patient to participate.

             vomiting, malabsorption syndrome, a history of necrotising enterocolitis with
             consequent short gut syndrome).

             condition that in the opinion of the investigator renders the patient unsuitable for
             enrolment.

          -  A history of epilepsy or seizures including febrile seizures.

          -  Allergy to test medication or constituents.

             investigator or the study center, with direct involvement in the proposed study or
             other studies under the direction of that investigator of the study center, or any
             family members of the employees or the investigator.
