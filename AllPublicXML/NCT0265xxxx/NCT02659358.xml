  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between wearable biosensor data,
      performance status and patient-reported outcomes in cancer patients. Participants in this
      study will wear a biosensor (Fitbit Charge HR®) for 15 days and respond to questionnaires
      that will assess patient reported outcome measures including physical function, emotional
      distress, pain interference, sleep disturbance and fatigue.

      Eligible patients will have a diagnosis of advanced cancer. Patients must be greater than 18
      years of age and be English speaking due to the questionnaires that will be administered
      during the study. Patients must also be ambulatory (use of walking aids, such as cane and
      rollator, is acceptable) and have access to a smartphone with internet access (IOS or
      Android). It is also necessary for patients to have scheduled oncology clinic visits at least
      once every 2 weeks.

      This study aims to measure association between biosensor data, performance status and
      patient-reported outcomes. This study will also evaluate the feasibility of using Fitbit
      activity monitors in a cancer population to capture objective activity data. The study will
      be recruiting patients with advanced cancer diagnoses (stage 3 or 4) and will be referred by
      the treating oncologist. This is an exploratory study that will follow patients with stage
      3-4 cancer for a period of 15 days. Subjects will be provided with a Fitbt Charge HR®
      activity monitor. They will be requested to wear the Fitbit Charge HR® at all times, except
      for while bathing or performing other activities where the activity monitor can become
      submerged in water. Subjects will be asked to wear the Fitbit Charge HR® for two weeks. They
      will be seen in the clinic at baseline, at the end of week 1 (day 8) and at end of 2 weeks
      (day 15) for physical exam, evaluation of performance status by both treating oncologist and
      practice nurse using standardized scales and administration of PROMIS® questionnaires.
      Patients will be followed up to 6 months after the last clinic visit for adverse events,
      hospitalization and survival. Thirty subjects will be enrolled in this study.

    <measure>Feasibility defined as proportion of time Fitbit is worn during study period (4 of 7 days worn in the study)</measure>
    <time_frame>15 days</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured by using the duration of time that the Fitbit Charge HR is worn and recording data during the study. Recorded data from the device for 4 of each 7 days of the study (at least 16 hrs of each day) will support feasibility of utilizing the Fitbit Charge HR to collect data. Feasibility of collecting PROMIS® tool responses will be determined by percentage of completed PROMIS® tools. PROMIS® tool completion rates of &gt;50% will support the feasibility of current method of utilizing PROMIS® tools to collect PROs.</description>
