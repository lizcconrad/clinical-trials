    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the diagnostic performance of whole body (WB) MR-PET
      for staging rectal cancer, compared with current standard of care (chest/abdominopelvic CT
      and rectal MRI) to investigate clinical feasibility of WB MR-PET as a one-stop preoperative
      imaging modality in patients with rectal cancer.
