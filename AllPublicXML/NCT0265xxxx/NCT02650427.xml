  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boosting of tumor cell killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes may be a promising means to enhance
      anti-tumor immunity. Prior studies demonstrated that tumor infiltration by cytotoxic
      lymphocytes correlates with control of tumor growth and is associated with an improved
      prognosis in cancer patients. Trafficking of activated lymphocytes is a tightly regulated
      mechanism and the specific nature of the chemokine milieu is a crucial determinant for
      permitting T cell entry into the tumor microenvironment. CXCL10 is an interferon-inducible
      chemokine particularly important for the recruitment of activated T, and it has been shown to
      enhance anti-tumor responses through its action on cytotoxic T cells (e.g., glioblastoma,
      colorectal adenocarcinoma and lung carcinoma). Additionally, roles for CXCL10 as an
      anti-tumor effector include its ability to chemo-attract NK cells into sites of inflammation,
      and its ability to inhibit development of new vasculature and induce the regression of newly
      formed vessels. Adding a layer of complexity, the function of CXCL10 can be regulated by
      dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV), leading to the formation of a dominant negative, antagonist
      form of the chemokine. This was initially demonstrated in vitro, and recent work has provided
      convincing in vivo evidence that antagonist forms of CXCL10 regulate lymphocyte trafficking.
      The main goal of this protocol is to evaluate the tolerance of sitagliptin treatment in HCC
      patients, and secondary DPPIV inhibitors as a strategy for protecting CXCL10 chemokine
      agonist activity as a means to enhance tumor regression.

      The study will be conducted in 15 patients. Patient selection will be made based on medical
      records during a weekly staff meeting. After collection of informed consent, the patients
      will undergo a biopsy of the tumor and of the not-tumoral liver and 2-4 weeks later HCC
      resection.

      The study will include a phase of 3 weeks [± 7 days] administration of sitagliptin as
      monotherapy (taken orally) after liver biopsy and before HCC resection. The window of ± 7
      days is deliberately wide to take in account the variable arrangements made for surgical
      resection. Nevertheless we will make our efforts to focus on a three weeks regimen. Three
      doses of sitagliptin will be used: 1) 100mg/day (dose recommended in the SmCP), 2) 200mg/day
      and 3) 600mg/day; with 5 patients in each group. Arrangements will be made for surgical
      resection upon standard care. Blood samples will be obtained for immunology studies at each
      visit. The study will end one week after surgery (or less if the state of health of the
      patient does not require to stay longer in the hospital). Patients will continue their
      treatment for HCC as prescribed by the clinician.
