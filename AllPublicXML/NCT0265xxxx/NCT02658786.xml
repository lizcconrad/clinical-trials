  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases of differing etiologies are among the leading causes of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide [1]. Chronic liver disease progresses through different pathological
      stages that vary from mild hepatic inflammation without fibrosis to advanced hepatic fibrosis
      and cirrhosis [2]. Assessment of the stage of liver disease is important for diagnosis,
      treatment, and follow-up both during treatment and after cessation of treatment. A liver
      biopsy is the oldest and most accurate method used to evaluate liver histology and the
      progression of chronic liver disease. Furthermore, different histological scoring systems
      have been developed and modified [3]. A liver biopsy is considered the gold standard for
      assessing liver histology [4]. During the pathological progression of liver fibrosis,
      excessive amounts of extracellular matrix build up; furthermore, serum levels of various
      biomarkers change, in addition to the appearance of new biomarkers in the serum during the
      different stages of fibrosis [2, 5]. Recently many noninvasive markers (NIMs) for assessing
      liver fibrosis have been developed, and they are frequently used in clinical practice. They
      have been validated in different studies, and some were found to be highly accurate in the
      assessment of liver fibrosis compared with liver biopsies [6-7], which have always been used
      as the standard reference method for evaluating the accuracy of noninvasive methods. There
      are limited studies documenting the cost effectiveness of non invasive markers over invasive
      technique.

      Most people with chronic Hepatitis B or C are unaware of their infection, putting them at
      serious risk of developing cirrhosis or liver cancer which are life threatening. Similarly
      patients with non alcoholic fatty liver diseases are unaware about fibrosis in liver. About
      20-50% of persistent infection ends up into fibrosis and finally cirrhosis. Invasive and non
      invasive diagnostic methods are widely used to detect the fibrosis. Clinicians use different
      drugs and combinations to treat HBV and HCV infections. However, there is scarcity of a
      longitudinal prospective study to assess the cost effectiveness of these diagnostic measures.

      We planned to conduct a retrospective followed by prospective cohort study among all cases
      that underwent biopsy in ILBS or GB Pant Hospital since 2000 till Dec 2020 with HBV
      infection, HCV infection, or non alcoholic fatty liver disease. For retrospective cohort
      study, we will collect data from hospital information system for all patients with HBV
      infection, HCV infection, or non alcoholic fatty liver disease, who underwent biopsy during
      the period of 2000-Dec 2015. The new patients with HBV infection, HCV infection, or non
      alcoholic fatty liver disease who will undergo biopsy during the period Jan 2016- Dec 2020
      will serve as a cohort for prospective design.

      We will collect socio-demographic data, clinical data, family history, personal history,
      medical history, anthropometry, biochemical and radiological data from each patient. We will
      also be conducting a cost effective analysis for various non invasive markers against biopsy
      as a gold standard in predicting fibrosis, both for retrospective and prospective cohorts.

      For prospective cohort study, after evaluation of baseline biopsy results, the cases with
      metavir fibrosis score (F0-3) will be followed for a period of 5 years to document incidence
      of development and progression of fibrosis.

      No additional investigation or test will be asked to the patient for the study. We will also
      develop a predicting model for development and progression of fibrosis.
