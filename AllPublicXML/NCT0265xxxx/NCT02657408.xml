          -  FEV1 (Forced expiratory volume) of &gt;80% and FEV1/FVC (Forced vital capacity) of &gt;70%
             of the predicted normal value at screening

             cigarette per day in the previous year

          -  BMI (Body mass index) range: &gt;18.5 and &lt; 29.9kg/m2.

          -  Negative urine drug screening.

          -  Negative breath alcohol test.

             study start)

          -  Females NOT of childbearing potential are defined as: Women who are postmenopausal (12
             months with no menses without an alternative medical cause; in questionable cases a
             blood sample with simultaneous levels of FSH above 40 U/L and estradiol below 30 ng/L
             is confirmatory) or who are permanently sterilized (defined as hysterectomy, bilateral
             oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy).

             fibrosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), pneumocystis infection, active
             tuberculosis, silicosis or any other lung surfactant overproduction syndromes).

          -  Subjects with clinically relevant abnormal hematology, blood chemistry, or urinalysis
             at the screening visit

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including blood pressure, pulse rate, body
             temperature and ECG) deviating from normal and of clinical relevance.

          -  Subjects with a history of any clinically significant cardiovascular, metabolic, renal
             (including renal stones), hepatic, gastrointestinal, hematological, dermatological,

          -  Subjects with previous surgery of the gastro-intestinal tract likely to affect drug
             absorption.

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts.

             local anesthetics).

          -  Subjects with a marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTcB interval (such as repeated
             demonstration of a QTcB interval &gt;450 ms), or any other relevant ECG finding at
             screening visit (Visit 1) according to the investigator.

          -  Neutrophil blood count indicative of immunosuppression according to the investigator

          -  Subjects with previous surgeries that may have left ferromagnetic material in the
             body, ferromagnetic implants or pacemakers.

          -  Participation in another study with any investigational product within 2 months prior
             to screening or if screening occurs within 6 half-lives of intake of another
             investigational drug (whichever is greater).

          -  Male subjects who do not agree to minimize the risk of female partners becoming
             pregnant from the first dosing day until 3 months after the trial medication treatment
             has finished.

          -  Subjects who are committed to an institution by way of official or juridical order
