      The study is to investigate the anticancer effect and the related immunological mechanism of
      MTX-ATMPs in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural effusion(MPE) as a common complication of advanced lung cancer is lack of
      efficient treatments. The investigators have successfully produced tumor cell-derived
      microparticles packaging chemotherapy drugs and confirmed that this new integrative targeted
      biochemotherapy treatment could effectively restrain tumor growth at cellular and animal
      levels.This new method could control tumor growth in vivo effectively and induced pleural
      adhesion in the early clinical study. So the investigators attempt to explore the anticancer
      effect and related immune regulation mechanism of methotrexate-autologous tumor derived
      microparticles (MTX-ATMPs) in MPE treatment. The tumor cells in the malignant pleural
      effusion are prepared by screening, then MTX-ATMPs are made. Participants enrolled are
      randomly assigned to experimental and control group, each of them is injected with the
      prepared drug once in two days until the malignant pleural effusion are disappeared or the
      treatment cycle has been six times. During or after the whole treatment, reactions to each
      treatment of the participants are carefully followed up.
