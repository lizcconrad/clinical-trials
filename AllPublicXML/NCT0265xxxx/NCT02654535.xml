    <textblock>
      Peanuts and tree nuts (almonds, pistachios, walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, Brazil nuts, cashews,
      hazelnuts, macadamia nuts) (herein referred to as &quot;nuts&quot;) are a good source of unsaturated
      fatty acids, vegetable protein, fibre, and polyphenolics. Nut intake has been associated with
      reduced cardiovascular disease risk and claims for this association have been permitted by
      the FDA; however, intake of tree nuts is low in Canada. One of the barriers to increasing the
      consumption of nuts is the perception that they may contribute to weight gain more than other
      &quot;healthy foods&quot; owing to their high energy density. The evidence supporting this concern,
      however, is lacking. In a series of earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we have
      shown that nuts improve glycemic control and metabolic syndrome criteria, findings which run
      contrary to any expected weight gain. However, it remains unclear whether nuts have an
      increasing, neutral, or even decreasing effect on body weight. To address the uncertainties,
      the investigators propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the
      totality of the evidence from controlled trials and prospective cohort studies to investigate
      the effect of nut consumption on body weight and adiposity. The findings generated by this
      proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of consumers through informing
      evidence-based guidelines and improving health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and
      patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design

    <textblock>
      Background: Peanuts and tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts,
      pecans, pine nuts, pistachios and walnuts) are an important source of unsaturated fatty
      acids, vegetable protein, and fibre, as well as minerals, vitamins, and phytonutrients. The
      FDA has permitted health claims for tree nuts for cardiovascular disease risk reduction and
      the cardiovascular benefits of nuts is acknowledged [FDA, 2015; Bao et al., 2013; Sabate et
      al., 2010]; however, intake of tree nuts is low in Canada. Based on the 2004 Canadian
      Community Health Survey (CCHS), &lt;5% of Canadians consumed nuts on any given day with a mean
      intake of 18 g/day in those consuming nuts [PHAC, 2004]. This intake level is far below the
      42 g/day amount recommended by the FDA for cardiovascular risk reduction. One of the barriers
      to increasing the consumption of nuts is the perception that they may contribute to weight
      gain more than other &quot;healthy foods&quot; owing to their high energy density. With the rise in
      overweight and obesity and its downstream cardiometabolic complications, heart and diabetes
      associations have cautioned against the over consumption of nuts at the same time that they
      recommend them for heart health [Sievenpiper et al., 2013; Evert et al., 2014; Anderson et
      al., 2013]. In a series of earlier systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we have shown that
      nuts improve glycemic control and metabolic syndrome criteria, findings which run contrary to
      any expected weight gain [Viguiliouk et al., 2014; Blanco Mejia et al., 2014]. Although an
      earlier systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials showed a lack of effect of
      nut intake on body weight [Flores-Mateo et al., 2013], it remains unclear whether nuts have
      an increasing, neutral, or even decreasing effect on a broader set of markers of adiposity.

      Need for proposed research:The lack of high quality syntheses and knowledge translation to
      reconcile the benefits of nuts with potential weight gain represents an urgent call for
      stronger evidence. High quality systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled trials and
      prospective cohort studies represent the highest level of evidence to support dietary
      guidelines and public health policy development.

      Objective: The investigators will conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to
      (1) distinguish the effect of peanuts and tree nuts on body weight and markers of adiposity
      in controlled trials and (2) assess peanut and tree nut consumption with incident
      overweight/obesity and changes in weight and markers of adiposity in prospective cohort
      studies.

      Design: Each systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted according to the Cochrane
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [Higgins et al., 2011;
      Moher et al., 2009].

      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by
      hand searches of references of included studies.

      Study selection: The investigators will include either controlled dietary trials or
      prospective cohort studies. Randomized controlled trials that investigate the effect of
      including and/or exchanging nuts for other nutrients on changes in body weight or markers of
      adiposity outcomes in humans will be included. Studies that are &lt;3-weeks diet duration, lack
      a control, or assess intake during wasting conditions/malnourished populations, pregnancy or
      lactation will be excluded. Prospective cohort studies will be included if they are &gt;= 1-year
      duration and assess the relation of tree nuts and/or peanuts with incident overweight/obesity
      or changes in body weight or markers of adiposity.

      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved
      by consensus. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance
      data.

      Outcomes: Three sets of outcomes will be assessed: (1) incidence of overweight/obesity, (2)
      measures of global adiposity (body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat), (3) measures of
      abdominal adiposity (waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, visceral adipose tissue).

      Data synthesis: Mean differences will be pooled for the trials and risk ratios for the
      cohorts using the generic inverse variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in
      the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more
      conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity.
      Fixed-effects models will only be used where there is &lt;5 included studies. Paired analyses
      will be applied for crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be assessed by the Cochran Q
      statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. To explore sources of heterogeneity, the
      investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses, in which each study is systematically
      removed. If there are &gt;=10 studies, then the investigators will also explore sources of
      heterogeneity by a priori subgroup analyses by age (children [=&lt;18 years of age], adults),
      health status (metabolic syndrome/diabetes, overweight, normal weight), comparator
      (carbohydrate, mixed macronutrient, animal protein, other), nut type, nut dose, baseline
      measurements, randomization, study design (parallel, crossover), energy balance (positive,
      neutral, negative), duration of follow-up, and risk of bias. Meta-regression analyses will
      assess the significance of categorical and continuous subgroups analyses. When &gt;=10 studies
      are available, publication bias will be investigated by inspection of funnel plots and formal
      testing using the Egger and Begg tests. If publication bias is suspected, then the
      investigators will attempt to adjust for funnel plot asymmetry by imputing the missing study
      data using the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.

      Evidence Assessment: The strength of the evidence for each outcome will be assessed using the
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) [Guyatt et al.,
      2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d, 2011e, 2011f, 2011g, 2011h, 2011i; Balshem et al., 2011; Brunetti
      et al., 2013; Guyatt et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2013c].

      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in
      high impact factor journals. Target audiences will include the public health and scientific
      communities with interest in nutrition, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
      Feedback will be incorporated and used to improve the public health message and key areas for
      future research will be defined. Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers will network among
      opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly as committee members in the
      development of future guidelines.

      Significance: The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of
      peanuts and tree nuts in relation to body weight, in particular adiposity and the development
      of overweight and obesity, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines and improving
      health outcomes by educating healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry
      innovation, and guiding future research design.
