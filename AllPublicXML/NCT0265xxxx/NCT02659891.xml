  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to rapidly improve clearance of BK viremia with
      Immunoglobulin (Privigen®) thereby decreasing the potential for formation of alloantibodies
      in renal transplant recipients that have had immunosuppression reduction due to BK viremia.
      Our approach is to perform a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial intravenous
      immune globulin (IVIg; Privigen®) plus protocolized immunosuppression reduction versus
      placebo and protocolized immunosuppression reduction in patients with BK viremia post-kidney
      transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Voluntary written informed consent before performance of any study-related procedure
             not part of normal medical care, with the understanding that consent may be withdrawn
             by the subject at any time without prejudice to future medical care.

          -  Female subject is either postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit, is surgically sterilized or if they are of childbearing potential, agree to
             practice effective methods of contraception from the time of signing the informed
             consent form through 30 days after the last dose of intravenous immune globulin, or
             agree to completely abstain from heterosexual intercourse.

          -  Kidney transplant recipients (living and deceased donors) with new onset BK viremia
             (defined as BKV plasma DNA load &gt;1000 copies/mL by real-time PCR within 2 weeks of
             enrollment). For values &gt;5000 copies/mL repeat testing is not required. For values
             ≤5000 copies/mL repeat testing should be performed to confirm viremia before
             enrollment.

          -  Immunosuppression therapy at enrollment with tacrolimus, MPA, +/- prednisone.

          -  Men and Women 18 to 75 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Absence of a DQ mismatch to the donor.

          -  Patient had known HLA antibodies directed to the donor antigens (pre-formed DSA) prior
             to transplant.

             enrollment from the most recently drawn sample. (DSA MFI&gt;1000 is considered positive).
             DSA is detected via center's standard of care testing. If center does not routinely
             screen then patient may still be enrolled.

          -  History of biopsy proven acute rejection (cellular or antibody) at any time prior to
             enrollment.

          -  Patient with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD) ≤ 30 ml/min at time of
             study entry.

          -  Patient with selective IgA deficiency or have known antibodies to IgA.

          -  Patient with history of hyperprolinemia.

             this trial, within 14 days of the start of this trial and throughout the duration of
             this trial.

          -  Inability to perform follow-up or to undergo renal allograft biopsy.

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.
