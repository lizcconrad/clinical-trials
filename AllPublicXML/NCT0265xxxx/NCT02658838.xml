      The purpose of this study is to determine ticagrelor combining with low molecular weight
      heparin is effective and safe during PCI or not.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a new drug compared with clopidogrel. It has a stronger antiplatelet capacity.
      After PCI，whether using low molecular weight heparin can make patients better prognosis or
      not, What's more，full amount or half amount low molecular weight heparin?, also investigators
      want to explore that whether it may lead to more bleeding events.
