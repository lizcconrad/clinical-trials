    <textblock>
      The effect of noise is often underestimated but it is one of the most common occupational
      health hazards. Its health effects include; noise-induced hearing loss, sleep disturbance,
      interference with speech comprehension, complaints, stress, annoyance, and safety concerns
      with regard to workers being able to complete their tasks in a safe manner.

      This pilot aims to measure and analyze noise levels in obstetric ORs at BC Women's Hospital
      during elective and emergency cesarean deliveries.

      This is a pilot study that aims to measure and analyze noise levels in obstetric ORs at BC
      Women's Hospital during elective and emergency cesarean deliveries.

      The investigators want to quantify the amount of noise in BCW ORs in order to create a
      research question for a larger study.
