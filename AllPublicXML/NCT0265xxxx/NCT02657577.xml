    <textblock>
      WIC is a governmental program that provides healthy foods, nutrition education and referrals
      to other health and social services. With the goal of applying for a future grant to expand
      the dissemination of SmartLossÂ® within the WIC program, feedback (via focus groups) from the
      WIC employees and WIC recipients must be solicited to better understand the burden and
      barriers of integrating these kinds of programs and with WIC participants.
