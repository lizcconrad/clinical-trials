    <textblock>
      Study CRB-401 is a 2-part, non-randomized, open label, multi-site Phase 1 study of bb2121 in
      adults with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part A of the study will enroll adults with multiple myeloma using a 3+3 dose escalation
      approach. An expansion cohort will be enrolled following dose selection.

      Following consent, enrolled subjects will undergo a leukapheresis procedure to collect
      autologous mononuclear cells for manufacture of investigational drug product (bb2121).
      Following manufacture of the drug product, subjects will receive lymphodepletion prior to
      bb2121 infusion. All subjects will then be followed for up to 24 months in Study CRB-401.

      All subjects who complete the study, as well as those who withdraw from the study after
      receiving bb2121 for reasons other than death or meeting the early termination criteria, will
      be asked to continue to undergo long-term follow-up in a companion study LTF-305 for up to 15
      years after their last bb2121 infusion, with a focus on long-term safety and efficacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing informed consent

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1

          -  Part A:

        Diagnosis of MM with relapsed or refractory disease and have had at least 3 different prior
        lines of therapy including proteasome inhibitor (e.g., bortezomib or carfilzomib) and
        immunomodulatory therapy (IMiD; e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), or have &quot;double
        refractory&quot; disease to a proteasome inhibitor and IMiD, defined as progression on or within
        60 days of treatment with these agents

        • Part B: Diagnosis of MM with relapsed or refractory disease with previous exposure to PI
        (e.g., bortezomib or carfilzomib), IMiDs (e.g., lenalidomide or pomalidomide), and
        daratumumab, and refractory (based on IMWG criteria) to their last line of therapy

          -  Subjects must have measurable disease

          -  Women of child-bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             prior to treatment. All sexually active WCBP and all sexually active male subjects
             must agree to use effective methods of birth control throughout the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with known central nervous system disease

          -  Inadequate hepatic function

          -  Inadequate renal function

          -  Inadequate bone marrow function

          -  Presence of active infection within 72 hours

          -  Subjects with a history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control

          -  Significant co-morbid condition or disease which in the judgment of the Investigator
             would place the subject at undue risk or interfere with the study; examples include,
             but are not limited to, cirrhotic liver disease, sepsis, recent significant traumatic
             injury, and other conditions

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity

          -  Subjects with a history of stroke, unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or
             ventricular arrhythmia requiring medication or mechanical control

          -  Pregnant or lactating women
