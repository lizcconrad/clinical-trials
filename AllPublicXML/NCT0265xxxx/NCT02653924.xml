  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The final stage of any surgical procedure is suturing. Sutures have a vital rule in wound
      healing- they are responsible for flaps approximation, hemostasis and restoring function and
      esthetics.

      Choosing the right suture is crucial especially in oral sites because of its unique
      anatomical features: the presence of saliva and the patient's everyday function- swallowing,
      talking, eating etc.

      Sutures require certain physical properties such as tensile strength, dimensional stability,
      lack of memory, knot security and elasticity. One highly important quality is the ability to
      prevent or reduce bacterial adhesion and by that to prevent secondary infection. There are
      many kinds of sutures in the market- none of which contains all the ideal features.

      The aim of the study is to compare the amount of bacterial adhesion to different kinds of
      sutures in patients undergoing periodontal surgery.

      The participates in the study are scheduled to go oral surgery: dental implantation, Guided
      bone regeneration, resective periodontal surgery, sinus elevation (both crestal or lateral).

      All participates will sign an informed consent form and under the institutional ethics
      committee approval will go to through the operation.

      Each surgery will include at least 4 Simple Interrupted Suture with even spacing of 5 mm from
      each other in the scheduled for operation and without changing the original treatment plan.
      Incision location is in the area of surgery and not in a distinct location. The four sutures
      that will be used are: silk, vicryl, nylon and polypropylene.

      At suture removal, after 10 days, all sutures will be collected in a sterile tube containing
      PBS solution. Within 3 hours, the samples will be sowed on two blood agar media plates. One
      plate will be aerobic condition and the other in an-aerobic condition. After one week, the
      number of colonies will use to calculate the CFU- colony-forming units.
