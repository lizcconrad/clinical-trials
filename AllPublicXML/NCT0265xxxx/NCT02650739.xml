    <textblock>
      The efficacy of macular hole (MH) surgery with the halting of prone positioning by monitoring
      the MH closure in the swept source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images was compared
      with the surgery by the surgeon's decision. The macular hole closure and visual outcome were
      compared.

    <textblock>
      The efficacy of macular hole (MH) surgery with the halting of prone positioning by monitoring
      the MH closure in the swept source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images was compared
      with the surgery by the surgeon's decision. All eyes were treated by pars plana vitrectomy,
      internal limiting membrane peeling, and gas tamponade. MH closure was defined as a connection
      of the edges of the sensory retina in the SS-OCT images.The macular hole closure and visual
      outcome were compared.

        The efficacy of macular hole (MH) surgery with the halting of prone positioning by
        monitoring the MH closure in the swept source optical coherence tomographic (SS-OCT) images
        in 60 eyes was compared with the 69 eyes with same surgical procedure but the prone
        position determined by the surgeon's decision.
