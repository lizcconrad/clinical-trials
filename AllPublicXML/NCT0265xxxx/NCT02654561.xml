      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the efficacy of unfractionated
      heparin(UFH) on ICU mortality in severe sepsis with suspected DIC.The Second objective is to
      estimate the effect of UFH on 28-day mortality,and the change of the Japanese Association for
      Acute Medicine(JAAM) score and SOFA score. The third one is to evaluate the safety of UFH in
      severe sepsis patients with suspected DIC.

      During the study, the whole process of data validation and registry procedures will be
      implemented by the Principal Investigator of the study, and monitored by the Ethics Committee
      of the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University.There are 2 research
      supervisors(2 ICU doctors) to assess the accuracy,completeness and representativeness of
      registry data, and to report the study process and research results to Principal
      Investigator.Investigators have also edited a data dictionary including each variable used by
      the registry and normal ranges of all detection indexes. The standard operating procedures
      have been formulated to address the registry and data analysis. The feasibility and
      significance have been assessed carefully and funded by the Health and Family Planning
      Commission of Liaoning Province(No.LNCC-B01-2014).The sample size is 700 participants over
      about 1 year through statistic calculation. The plan for missing data and statistical
      analysis will be implemented by specialized statisticians of China Medical University.
