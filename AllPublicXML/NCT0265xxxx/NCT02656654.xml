  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early and adequate fluid resuscitation (&lt; 6 hours) in patients with circulatory failure is
      essential but may exacerbate oedema, which may itself: 1) aggravate pulmonary lesions and
      prolong mechanical ventilation, 2) aggravate organ failure and 3) increase mortality notably
      in patients with acute renal failure. Improving fluid balance is considered crucial in the
      management of patients in septic shock, but the efficacy of the measures currently proposed
      (diuretics associated or not with albumin and/or dialysis) is controversial. The
      investigators hypothesize that a whole-body compression using a body bandage could reduce
      capillary leakage and thus lead to faster restoration of a normal transmural pressure
      gradient in postcapillary venules and improve venous return.

      This is the first study to evaluate mechanical compression using a body bandage to reduce
      oedema in septic shock.

      To do this, a whole-body compression will be set up within the 12 hours following admission.
      Water balance will be monitored daily throughout the duration of the compression and vital
      status of patients will be search at 7 days, 28 days and 90 days.
