    <textblock>
      In this prospective nonrandomized study the investigators are going to investigate whether
      auricular acupuncture with indwelling fixed needles is feasible for treatment of preoperative
      anxiety.

      Patients, scheduled for ambulatory gynecologic surgery, will be asked, if they wish to
      receive auricular acupuncture (AA) against preoperative anxiety. The patients who will not
      wish AA, will be asked to take part in questioning (State-Trait-Anxiety-Inventory (STAI)
      questionnaire) and will form the control group. The preoperative anxiety using STAI, as well
      as the duration and quality of sleep on the night before surgery, the incidence of side
      effects, blood pressure and heart rate will be the outcome measures in this study.
