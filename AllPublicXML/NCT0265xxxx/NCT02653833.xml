  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study tests the hypothesis that the medication nitric oxide extract from beetroot
      juice improves blood flow to the skeletal muscle during exercise. The investigators will use
      cutting edge technology with contrast enhanced ultrasound to visualize the microvascular
      blood supply to the forearm. Animal studies have shown reversal of muscle damage with
      improved delivery of blood to the exercising muscle. This research aims to understand the
      mechanism of action of this medication in a way it has never been studied before. The results
      may help benefit individuals with muscular Dystrophy in the future.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects are asked to perform a graded hand-grip exercise while blood flow to the
      skeletal muscle is visualized by contrast enhanced ultrasound.

      This is done at baseline and after taking the study agent.

    <description>currently taking no medications will be asked to perform graded hand-grip exercise while a contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) probe is placed over their forearm to measure blood flow. Using a lower body negative pressure (LBNP) chamber, the subjects are tested for impaired exercise induced vasodilation to the skeletal muscle or &quot;functional sympatholysis&quot;.
