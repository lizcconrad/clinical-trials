  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) have variable difficulties
      regarding gait, balance, cognition and micturition. A shunt operation will improve these
      difficulties in most cases. Data suggest however, that they do not change their physical
      activity postoperatively. Physical training has been shown to be beneficial in patients with
      similar diseases i.e. Parkinson. The aim of this study is to apply a high intensity physical
      training program after a shunt operation to see if the patients can improve their physical
      capacity and ambulatory activity more than patients who only receive standardized written
      advice about physical training.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with iNPH at the neurological departments of University Hospital of
      Linköping and at Sahlgrenska University Hospital are included and randomized for either
      physical training according to a validated training concept for elderly and cognitive
      impaired patients named HIFE ( High Intensity Functional Exercise) together with a
      standardized written instruction for home training of physical exercises or only a
      standardized written instruction for home training. Goal Attainment Scaling will be used to
      set measurable goals together with the patient. The training will take place in a facility
      where physiotherapists are available either at the two centers or close to the patient´s
      home.Those physiotherapists at the centers responsible for the training will contact and send
      the local physiotherapists a manual and give instructions about the HIFE concept and will
      also stay in contact for the whole intervention i.e. 12 weeks ( one hour two times a week). A
      minimum of 18 out of 24 session will be required.
