  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reflex plus™ is a unique blend of Collagen Hydrolysate with Rosehip extract. The blend
      contains individual ingredients which have been widely studied for its effectiveness in
      osteoarthritis(OA). Collagen hydrolysate is accumulated in the cartilage and helps to repair
      the OA, related cartilaginous changes. Rosehip works in the anti-inflammatory pathway thus
      reducing the pain and inflammation of the joint.

      The two open-label studies have showed the effectiveness of the investigational product on
      OA. The 2 studies did not show any specific safety concern to be considered. The study
      demonstrated the synergistic effect of CH and Rosehip extract from former in-vitro results in
      the formulation.

      The supplement has been manufactured in GMP certified manufacturing units in Germany and
      India under strict quality control check. Hence, quality of the supplement and batch to batch
      consistency is well assured.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of Reflex Plus on osteoarthritis(OA)
      patients. The duration of the study is 12 / 24 weeks excluding the screening period of
      approximate 1 week. The test product being studied is Reflex Plus is composed of Collagen
      hydrolysate and Rosehip extract, it is a health supplement. It is expected to help in the
      building of cartilage for efficient joint functioning and relieving pain associated with
      arthritis It helps in cartilage protection and joint pain management.The primary endpoint of
      the study is the change in knee pain as measured by the WOMAC osteoarthritis (OA) index sum
      score between baseline and last visit in the comparison between IP and placebo.
