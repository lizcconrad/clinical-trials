    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Pilot Study is to investigate the safety, side effects, and benefits of
      tumor- infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) when they are given with the drug nivolumab. Nivolumab
      is a type of immunotherapy - a drug that is used to boost the ability of the immune system to
      fight cancer, infection, and other diseases.

      The primary endpoints of this pilot trial will be the safety and feasibility of the treatment
      regimens.

Nivolumab Treatment: The first 6 participants will not have pre-treatment with nivolumab and instead will be scheduled for the removal of their tumor sample for tumor Infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) growth in the lab. The second 6 participants will receive treatment with nivolumab prior to removal of tumor sample for TIL growth; about 2 weeks after their tumor sample has been taken, these participants may receive additional infusions of nivolumab.
Surgery to remove tumor for growth of TIL followed by: TIL growth process; lymphodepleting chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine; TIL infusion; Interleukin-2 treatment.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have unresectable cutaneous or mucosal metastatic stage III/IV melanoma, and in
             the opinion of the institutional principal investigator (PI) is an acceptable
             candidate for adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with high dose IL-2. Patients with mucosal
             metastatic melanoma may be included, as our prior experience indicates that TIL can be
             successfully propagated from these subtypes of melanoma metastases.

          -  Must have anticipated residual measurable disease after resection of target lesion(s)
             for TIL growth.

          -  Patients who have been previously treated for metastatic melanoma may be included
             (e.g., prior treatment with Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) inhibitors and/or
             ipilimumab will be allowed), provided that they have had a three week 'washout' prior
             to signing consent and have not been treated with a Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) blocking
             antibody.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

          -  Clinical performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 0 - 1.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within seven
             days of screening and within 24 hours prior to the start of each nivolumab dose.

          -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematologic function.

          -  Patients must have a positive screening Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) antibody titer on
             screening test as this is required to protect against EBV infection during the time of
             lymphodepletion.

          -  Patients with antibiotic allergies per se are not excluded; although the production of
             TIL for adoptive transfer includes antibiotics, extensive washing after harvest will
             minimize systemic exposure to antibiotics.

          -  At screening, patients with ≤ 3 untreated central nervous system (CNS) metastases may
             be included provided none of the untreated lesions are &gt; 1 cm in greatest dimension,
             and there is no peri-tumoral edema present on brain imaging (MRI or CT if MRI is
             contraindicated), and if the patients with CNS metastases are not taking prednisone
             &gt;10 mg or equivalent daily.

          -  At screening, patients with ≤ 3 CNS metastases and each ≤ 1 cm size that were treated
             with either surgical resection and/or radiation therapy may be included. Patients may
             be included if the largest lesion is ≤ 1 cm, and there is no evidence of progressive
             CNS disease on brain imaging at least 30 days after definitive treatment, and if the
             patients with CNS metastases are not taking prednisone &gt;10 mg or equivalent daily.

          -  At screening, patients with&gt; 1 cm or &gt; 3 in number treated CNS metastases may be
             included if there is no evidence of progressive CNS disease on brain imaging at least
             90 days after treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, and if the patients
             with CNS metastases are not taking prednisone &gt;10 mg or equivalent daily.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with active systemic infections requiring intravenous antibiotics,
             coagulation disorders, or other major medical illness of the cardiovascular,
             respiratory or immune system, which in the opinion of the PI or treating
             co-investigator is not acceptable risk for ACT, are excluded.

          -  Patients who have received prior immunotherapy whose side effects have resulted in a
             requirement of immunosuppressive medications (&gt;10 mg of prednisone daily or equivalent
             daily steroid daily, or infliximab, cyclosporine or equivalent immunosuppressive
             medication) or who have other autoimmune conditions that require immunosuppressive
             medications as above at the time of screening are excluded.

          -  Patients who test positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B surface
             antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, Hepatitis C antibody, Human T-lymphotropic Virus
             (HTLV) I or II antibody, or are both Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and Fluorescent
             treponemal antibody (FTA) positive are excluded.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or nursing are excluded.

          -  Patients with a significant psychiatric disease, who in the opinion of the principal
             investigator or his designee, would prevent adequate informed consent or render
             immunotherapy unsafe will be excluded.

          -  Patients with &gt; 3 untreated CNS metastases or evidence of peri-tumoral edema will be
             excluded, or patients with CNS metastases of any status who are taking prednisone &gt;10
             mg or equivalent steroid daily will be excluded.

          -  Patients with ≤ 3 untreated CNS metastases but with at least one lesion &gt;1 cm or
             peri-tumoral edema will be excluded, or patients with CNS metastases of any status who
             are taking prednisone &gt;10 mg or equivalent steroid daily will be excluded.

          -  Patients with invasive malignancy other than melanoma at the time of enrollment and
             within 2 years of screening are excluded, except for: adequately treated (i.e. with
             curative intent) basal or squamous cell carcinoma, in situ carcinoma of the cervix, in
             situ ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, in situ prostate cancer, or limited stage
             bladder cancer or other any other cancers from which the patient has been disease-free
             for at least 2 years.

          -  Patients with treated CNS metastases &gt; 1 cm or &gt; 3 in number will be excluded if there
             is evidence of progressive CNS disease on brain imaging at least 90 days after
             treatment with surgery and/or radiation therapy, or patients with CNS metastases of
             any status who are taking prednisone &gt;10 mg or equivalent will be excluded.

          -  Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential who do not agree to use
             two FDA-accepted forms of contraception during sexual intercourse with women of
             child-bearing potential from the start of PD-1 antibody therapy and up to at least 31
             weeks from the last dose of nivolumab are excluded.

          -  Females of childbearing potential who do not agree to use 2 FDA forms of contraception
             according to study guidelines

             of supplemental oxygen, is associated with dyspnea on walking one block or less, or
             requires inhaler therapy more than once per week will be required to undergo pulmonary
             function testing within 6 months of screening and will be excluded if forced
             expiratory volume 1 (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), or diffusion lung capacity
             for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is less than 65% of predicted.
