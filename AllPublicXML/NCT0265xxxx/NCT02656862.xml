  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fever is one of the main reasons for outpatient consultations in sub-saharan Africa.
      Following the introduction of malaria RDTs, clinicians face a high number of malaria-negative
      patients for whom they do not have a clear diagnosis. Through clinical history and
      examination, acute fever patients are categorized into: acute respiratory infections, urinary
      tract infections and other focal infections, diarrheal fevers and undifferentiated fevers.
      The latter being patients where no focal source of infections can be found during the
      consultation visit. In this proposal, the investigators focus on these acute undifferentiated
      fevers in an outpatient clinic.

      These fevers have the challenge of few point-of-care tests (POCT) available for the
      clinicians to identify the etiology of fever and guide treatment in resource-limited
      countries. As a consequence, over-prescription of antibiotics has increased. In order to
      improve patient outcomes while supporting judicious use of antimicrobials, there is an urgent
      need to change the management of febrile patients in low-income countries. This can only be
      achieved by providing evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of these acute
      febrile patients. To develop such guidelines, epidemiological data on etiologies of
      undifferentiated fever need to be generated. The investigators will evaluate pathogen
      infection (such as dengue, chikungunya and others) in 640 patients ≥ 2 years old with acute
      undifferentiated fever. To evaluate the existence of aspecific and subclinical infections and
      co-infections, the investigators will also test a subsample of 200 patients with ARI, UTI,
      diarrheal fever and malaria. The investigators expect to have as main results: proportions of
      each syndrome among fever patients, key pathogens associated with undifferentiated fever and
      their clinical presentation and demographic characteristics.

        The study will take place in the Lisungi Health centre, Pumbu. Pumbu is a health area of
        about 14 000 inhabitants, belonging to the municipality of peri-urban Mont Ngafula 1, at
        the southern side of Kinshasa. The Lisungi health centre is the only public health facility
        in the health area, with on average 250 consultations/week. About 70% of attending patients
        have fever as reason for consultation.
