  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular disease is a major cause of disability worldwide. The catastrophic burden of
      stroke is more dramatic in low- and middle- income countries, and the scarcity of
      evidence-based rehabilitation interventions represents a major challenge to global health
      care. Upper limb weakness is frequent after stroke, but there is no universally accepted
      treatment to effectively improve hand function in patients with moderate and severe motor
      impairment. These are the patients in deepest need of rehabilitative interventions. This
      project addresses this important issue, by testing effects of a novel approach. The
      investigators will non-invasively stimulate peripheral nerves in order to enhance effects of
      motor training aided by an electrical stimulation device in patients with moderate to severe
      hand weakness. Our hypothesis is that peripheral nerve stimulation will enhance effects of
      motor training in patients in the chronic stage after stroke.

      The objective of this protocol is to determine whether a neuromodulation intervention
      associated with functional electrical stimulation, when combined with task-specific training
      over several sessions, decreases upper limb motor disability, motor impairment, overall
      disability and improves quality of life compared to the sham intervention and functional
      electrical stimulation.

      The interventions will consist of three sessions per week, over six weeks, of outpatient
      functional electrical stimulation of the paretic wrist and task-specific training. In each
      session, either active peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) or sham PNS will be applied. Before
      the first session, patients will be familiarized with the procedures.
