    <textblock>
      Kinesia 360 is an ambulatory symptom monitoring device for Parkinson's Disease (PD). The aim
      of this study is to investigate the impact, validation, and usability of the Kinesia 360
      system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a five-month study of 45 subjects (approximately 15 subjects per site), consisting of
      adult volunteers that have been clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Subjects will
      have a confirmed history of motor fluctuation with a variety of Parkinson's disease symptom
      severities. All subjects will user the Kinesia 360 system and complete motor diaries several
      times per month during the study period. Symptom reports will be provided to the treating
      clinical team. Motor function, quality of life, engagement, and satisfaction with care will
      be tracked throughout the study.

    <description>Kinesia 360 includes a mobile app and wireless motion sensors worn on the patient's wrist and ankle to quantify tremor, dyskinesias, and mobility throughout the day as he or she goes about normal activities. The app includes electronic diaries enable patients to rate their symptoms and log when medications are taken. Data is transferred to a cloud server where motor symptom reports are generated for clinician review.</description>
