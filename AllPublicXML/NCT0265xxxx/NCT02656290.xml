      The objective of this trial is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards
      Pericardial Aortic Bioprosthesis Model 11000A in the pulmonary position in subjects five
      years or older requiring replacement of their native or prosthetic pulmonary valve.

      This is a prospective, Non-Randomized, Single Arm, Multicenter study. Up to one hundred (100)
      pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) subjects at up to ten (10) clinical sites will be enrolled
      to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Edwards Peri-cardial Aortic Bioprosthesis Model
      11000A in the pulmonary position. The trial will include male and female subjects five year
      and older requiring pulmonary valve replacement of their native or prosthetic valve. Subjects
      will be followed for and assessed after implant for up to 5 years.
