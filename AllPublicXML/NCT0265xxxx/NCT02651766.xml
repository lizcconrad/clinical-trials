    <textblock>
      The study aims to investigate the influence of 5 cupping massage treatments on chronic non
      specific neck pain. 50 patients with neck pain are randomised into cupping treatment and
      waiting list control group. Before and after the intervention the investigators evaluate the
      neck pain (VAS), the neck related disability (NDI), pain on movement (POM) and the quality of
      life (SF36) and safety. To investigate neurophysiological effects of cupping the
      investigators also measure mechanical detection threshold (MDT), vibration detection
      threshold (VDT) and pressure pain threshold (PPT) and the two point discrimination threshold
      at pain related and control areas.

      The treatment group receives 5 cupping treatments over a period of 3 weeks.
