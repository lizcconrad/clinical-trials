    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that otolith dysfunction is a common finding in individuals with a
      history of head trauma/blast exposure and/or noise-induced hearing loss. Therefore, otolith
      dysfunction may be a significant health concern for the Veteran population, and determining
      optimal intervention strategies for otolith dysfunction is important for VA healthcare. The
      purpose of this project is to compare the effectiveness of standard vestibular rehabilitation
      compared to a novel treatment approach, centrifugation, in the treatment of individuals with
      otolith dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary function of the vestibular (inner ear balance) system is to maintain gaze and
      postural stability. The vestibular system is comprised of two types of sensory organs
      (semicircular canals and otolith organs) each with unique contributions to balance.

      Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR) is the treatment of choice for patients experiencing
      dizziness, imbalance, and mobility impairments related to vestibular dysfunction. VR
      typically includes gaze stability exercises, gait and balance training, and general
      conditioning. Gaze stability exercises were developed based on the concepts of adaptation and
      substitution with the goal of improving gaze stability by facilitating vestibular
      compensation of the semicircular canal-mediated vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).

      Many factors that might influence recovery, such as the involvement of different vestibular
      sensory organs (semicircular canals versus otolith organs) have not been examined to
      determine their impact on recovery. Most studies examining the effectiveness of VR have used
      only tests of VOR function (caloric and rotational tests) that measure hSCC to determine
      vestibular loss. Thus, little is known about interventions to facilitate vestibular
      compensation of the otolith organs.

      Recent studies have demonstrated adaptation following otolith organ stimulation using
      centrifugation (or linear acceleration). The concept of using centrifugation for otolith
      adaptation may be similar to using gaze stability exercises for VOR adaptation. Participants
      with dizziness/imbalance related to otolith dysfunction will be randomized to receive a
      staged intervention of either gaze stability exercises (n=14) or centrifugation (n=14)
      followed by balance rehabilitation. Providing the intervention in stages allows isolation of
      key components of vestibular rehabilitation.

    <description>Gaze stability exercises include adaptation and substitution exercises. Adaptation exercises involve head movement while maintaining focus on a target, which may be stationary or moving. Substitution exercises specifically attempt to facilitate use of alternative strategies, rather than teaching the specific strategies. Participants will perform brief periods of gaze stability exercises 3 times daily.
In addition, participants will perform balance and gait exercises to improve postural stability and mobility and will be provided a written home exercise program.</description>

    <description>Gaze stability exercises include adaptation and substitution exercises. Adaptation exercises involve head movement while maintaining focus on a target, which may be stationary or moving. Substitution exercises specifically attempt to facilitate use of alternative strategies, rather than teaching the specific strategies. For example, during active eye-head exercise, a large eye movement to a target is made prior to the head moving to the target, potentially facilitating preprogrammed eye movements.</description>
