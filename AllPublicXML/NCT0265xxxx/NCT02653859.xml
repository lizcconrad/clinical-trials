  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By testing the CTC number of new solitary pulmonary nodule patient, evaluating the
      correlation of CTC number and benign and malignant lung nodules auxiliary diagnosis, the
      correlation of CTC number and the size of lung nodules of the malignant patients, the
      correlation between the CTC number and subtypes of malignant lung nodules patients.The CTC
      and tumor markers will be detected before the patient received treatment. Tumor markers
      include Pro-GRP, NSE, CEA, CYFRA211, SCC.
