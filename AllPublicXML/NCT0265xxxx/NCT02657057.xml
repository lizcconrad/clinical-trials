  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if Transcutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (TENS)
      is as effective as Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) as therapeutic option for
      subjects with Idiopathic Overactive Bladder (OAB) who have failed conventional therapy.

      Both therapies have been proven to be effective, but very few times have been compared. PTNS
      and TENS SNS have been proven effective modifying bladder diary scores (change in the
      frequency of day and night urination, and urge incontinence), and improving subject's quality
      of life. Only PTNS has shown changes in urodynamic data while undergoing therapy.

      The investigators hypothesize that short-term effectiveness and benefit reported, is not
      lower in the TENS group, if we compare both therapies in a randomized control trial.

      Secondary goals are to evaluate changes in bladder diary scores (frequency of urination,
      nocturia, number of urgency and leakage episodes ), participants quality of life improvement
      scores and treatment benefit score at TBS scale, while undergoing these therapies.

    <description>TENS SNS therapy is performed as follows; patient is asked to sit with legs slightly bent and an adhesive electrode is attached transcutaneously 5cm cephalic to either the right or left medial malleolus (subject choice). A surface electrode is placed on the medial surface of the ipsilateral calcaneum and both electrodes are connected to a low voltage electronic stimulator. The current is then set to the highest level tolerable to the subject (0-20 mA) and subject undergoes therapy for 30 minutes and 12 weeks (once-a-week session). Data are completed at baseline, after half therapy and after 12 weeks therapy.</description>

    <description>PTNS therapy is performed as follows; patient is asked to sit with legs slightly bent. The area where the needle will be placed is cleaned with an alcohol swab. A 34 gauge needle (equivalent to an acupuncture needle) is inserted percutaneously approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus of the right or left ankle (subject choice) at a 60 degree angle. A surface electrode is placed on the medial surface of the ipsilateral calcaneous. The needle and electrode are connected to a low voltage electrical stimulator. The current is then set to the highest level tolerable to the subject (0-20 mA) and the subject undergoes therapy for 30 minutes and 12 weeks (once-a-week session). Data are completed at baseline, after half therapy and after 12 weeks therapy.</description>
