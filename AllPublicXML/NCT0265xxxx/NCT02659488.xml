      12-week, open-label LDX trial for BED including fMRI assessments to test the following
      specific predictions:

        1. At baseline, patients with BED will show greater ventral prefrontal, striatal, and
           amygdala brain activation to high-calorie food pictures (reward) than matched healthy
           comparison subjects.

        2. After 12 weeks of LDX treatment, BED will exhibit reduced ventral prefrontal, striatal
           and amygdala brain activation to food cues compared to baseline.

        3. BED patients who display cessation of binge eating and those who demonstrate clinical
           improvement after 12 weeks of LDX treatment will show greater reductions in ventral
           prefrontal, striatal, and amygdala brain activation to food pictures than patients who
           do not stop binge eating and those who do not improve, respectively.

    <description>During the Treatment Phase, subjects will be evaluated after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks (see Figure 2). The morning after completing the first fMRI scan, LDX will be started at 30 mg q AM (Baseline). After 1 week, LDX will then be increased to 50 mg q AM (Visit 1); after another week, LDX will be increased to 70 mg q AM (Visit 2). A single downward dose titration to 50 mg is allowed during week 3 if 70 mg/d is not tolerated. LDX dose at week 4 (50 or 70 mg/d) will be maintained for the next 8 weeks. Patients who do not tolerate 50 or 70 mg/day will be terminated. For patients who complete the 12-week treatment phase, LDX will be stopped at week 12 visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria: Criteria for entering this study will include all of the following:

          1. Subjects will meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for a diagnosis of binge eating disorder
             (BED) for at least the last 6 months.

          2. Subjects will report at least 3 binge eating (BE) days per week for the two weeks
             prior to LDX initiation prospectively documented in take-home binge diaries.

          3. Women, through the ages of 18 and 55 years, inclusive.

          4. Willingness to receive open-label LDX treatment for 12 weeks.

          5. Willingness to receive an fMRI before and after 12 weeks of LDX treatment.
