      Aims:

        -  evaluate the hydric status through bioimpedance spectroscopy in consecutive acute
           myocardial infarction patients referred for primary PCI;

        -  assessment of renal artery stenosis incidence through renal angiography in consecutive
           STEMI patients;

        -  fully characterize the complex hydration, metabolic and endothelial profile of these
           patients in the attempt to define the role played by dehydration in the complex dynamics
           of acute myocardial infarction.

      Gathered data:

        -  descriptive general demographic data;

        -  previous pathologies (ischemic heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, heart
           failure, previous percutaneous coronary interventions, coronary artery bypass grafting -
           CABG, known renal disease);

        -  cardiovascular risk factors (age, weight, height, abdominal perimeter, body mass index,
           smoking, sedentariness, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia);

        -  routine biological data;

        -  metabolic data (obtained from two body composition monitoring evaluations - before and
           12 hours after coronary intervention) - body water, body fat tissue;

        -  information regarding primary PCI (less than 12 hours of ischemic symptoms);

        -  coronarographic details, type of used stent, periprocedural specific complications,
           final TIMI - thrombolysis in myocardial infarction - flow);

        -  echocardiography at admission (LVEF);

        -  renal arteries angiographic details performed in the same time with PCI (two independent
           operators evaluate stenosis based on a predefined scale);

        -  renal diameters;

        -  measurement of arterial stiffness through Sphigmocore pulsed-wave-velocity (24 hrs
           post-procedural, 2 velocities: carotid - femoral and carotid - radial);

        -  in-hospital and one month follow-up MACE.

    <description>Preprocedural coronary arteriography is obtained after sterile preparation and draping of the patient, conscious sedation, infiltration of local anesthetic (lidocaine solution) at the femoral access site, placement of an arterial sheath in the femoral artery, and advancement of the renal guide catheter over a 0.035-in guidewire under fluoroscopic guidance. After the tip of the guide catheter is positioned at the ostium of the left coronary stem, an angiogram is obtained. After the guidewire is removed, the proximal end of the catheter is connected to a manifold, and 4-8 mL of contrast is manually injected during cineangiographic recording.</description>
