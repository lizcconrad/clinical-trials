      Background

      The negative effects of perinatal depression on mother and child start early and persist
      throughout the life-course. Given that 10-35% of children worldwide are exposed to perinatal
      depression in their first year of life, 16 mitigating this intergenerational risk is a global
      public health priority. However, there is a dearth of studies on whether a maternal
      depression intervention can have long-term benefits for either the mother or her child. This
      is a study of the effectiveness of an extended 36-month peer-delivered depression
      intervention, the Thinking Healthy Programme PLUS (THPP+) for women and their children in
      rural Pakistan.

      Study Design

      The THPP+ study aims to evaluate the effects of an extended 36-month perinatal depression
      intervention on mother and child outcomes using a cluster randomized controlled trial (c-RCT)
      design. The trial will recruit 560 pregnant women who screened positive for perinatal
      depression (PHQ-9 &gt;=10) from 40 village clusters, of which 20 clusters will receive the THPP+
      intervention delivered by trained peers. These women will have already been participating in
      the trial of the shorter, 6 month long, version of the intervention. Women in the THPP+
      intervention arm will receive bimonthly group-based sessions. Primary outcomes are 3-year
      maternal depression and 3-year child socio-emotional and cognitive development. All primary
      analyses will be intention-to-treat and will account for the clustered study design.

      Discussion

      This trial has the potential to further significantly our understanding of whether
      intervening on women's perinatal depression can mitigate the negative effects of maternal
      depression on 36-month child development.

    <description>As part of THPP+, the intervention will continue from the 6th month postnatal through 36 months postnatal and so will consist of an additional 30 months of lower intensity services that are unique to THPP+. The THPP+ will also include additional group sessions to be held every other month for a total of 18 over the intervention duration. The content will be a continuation of the previous THPP sessions with continuing emphasis on self-care as well as the baby's health and development.</description>

    <description>Women in the control clusters who were depressed prenatally have been receiving Enhanced Usual Care (EUC). At the time of the screening, women, their Lady Health Workers, and their local primary health care facility were informed of the diagnosis, and women were given an information sheet about depression and how to access care. There are no new EUC protocols put in place post-partum as part of the THPP+.</description>
