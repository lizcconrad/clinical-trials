      A Double-Blind, Randomized, Vehicle-Controlled, Multicenter Study to Evaluate the Efficacy
      and Safety of NAFT-900 in Children Aged 6 to &lt; 13 Years with Tinea Capitis
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an 8-week double-blind, randomized, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study of NAFT-900
      compared to vehicle in the treatment of tinea capitis in children ≥6 years to &lt;13 years of
      age.

      There will be approximately 60 subjects enrolled. Qualifying subjects with clinical evidence
      of a tinea capitis infection involving ≤ 15% of the scalp, confirmed by positive culture,
      will be randomized 2:1 to one of the following treatments:

        -  NAFT-900 (Naftifine hydrochloride foam, 3%)

        -  Vehicle Foam The study will consist of up to 6 visits. Subjects will apply the assigned
           study product twice daily to the affected area(s) for 4 weeks

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with clinical diagnosis of tinea capitis with ≤15% involvement of the scalp.

          2. Subjects with positive KOH microscopy and culture [for dermatophytes].

          3. Male or female subjects ≥6 years and &lt;13 years of age on the date of the Baseline
             Visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject with acute inflammatory fungal infection of the scalp (kerion)

          2. Subjects with skin disease on the scalp, or any other condition or prior/present
             treatment which in the opinion of the investigator would interfere with the study
             drug's effect or assessments (e.g., psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis).

          3. Subjects who received immunosuppressant therapy, cytostatic therapy or radiation
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to the baseline.

             weeks prior to study entry (or during study).

          5. Subjects who have used systemic antifungal treatment within 4 weeks prior to the
             baseline.

          6. Subjects who have used antifungal agents, corticosteroid preparations, ketoconazole,
             ciclopirox, salicylic acid, terbinafine, amorolfine, butenafine, clotrimazole,
             econazole, oxiconazole, sertaconazole, sulconazole, luliconazole, fluconazole, benzoic
             acid, griseofulvin, undecylenic acid, zinc pyrithione or selenium sulfide, or tar
