      This diagnostic clinical trial will be conducted according to a randomized, prospective,
      controlled, double-arm, single-centre design. The control will be implemented by comparing
      the PET/MRI results with the histopathological finding after radical prostatectomy (positive
      state), the assumed absence of a relevant prostate cancer focus if PET/MRI guided biopsy and
      standard biopsy are negative (negative state) and/or the detection of a biochemical tumor
      relapse (rising PSA after PSA nadir; secondary objective).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last years magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as positron emission tomography
      (PET) of the prostate have emerged as promising imaging tools. MRI provides mainly
      morphologic information and, to an increasing degree, functional information on the tumor
      microenvironment by using multiparametric approaches leading to an increase in diagnostic
      accuracy. Transition and periurethral zone cancers and the identification of patients'
      individual risk (e.g. for the development of a metastatic disease after primary treatment) is
      still a limitation of this method. PET, concerning radiolabelled choline, provides functional
      and predicting data on tumor metabolism and aggressiveness and has been found to be of
      complimentary value to morphologic imaging but still with the caveat of false positive and
      false negative findings. To overcome these limitations of morphological and functional
      imaging techniques, hybrid imaging systems have been developed and introduced into clinical
      routine. Additionally, the recently developed 68Ga-labeled Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen
      (PSMA) provides a highly specific information on a possible metastatic spread of prostate
      cancer. Thus the combined use of PET-MRI has wide spread applications in prostate cancer
      diagnosis, staging and treatment planning.

      The potentials of this novel technique in general and its impact on assessing patients'
      individual risk to support a therapy or active surveillance decision in a future modified
      urological patient management were not yet explored in detail, but an initial prospective
      clinical trial in 38 patients with a sequential PET/MRI technique demonstrated the ability of
      a significant improvement of the individual methods. This registered prospective, randomized
      clinical trial is intended to proof, in a first step, the superiority of PET/MRI vs. the
      actual clinical standard procedures by applying a stable multiparametric metabolic hybrid
      imaging protocol. The aim of this study is to reduce the number of unnecessary invasive
      procedures to a minimum (image guided biopsy) and to enable superior image guided risk
      stratification.

      In this prospective, randomized, multi-arm, multi-treatment clinical trial 220 subjects will
      be included at 1 site within 3 years. With a maximum follow-up for an early biochemical
      relapse of 2 years the planned duration should not exceed 5 years. The primary objective will
      be answered after 36 months.

    <measure>Superiority of image guided biopsy using multiparametric metabolic hybrid imaging with FEC/PSMA-PET/MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>36 months</time_frame>
    <description>We hypothesize that the image guided biopsy using multiparametric metabolic hybrid imaging with FEC/PSMA-PET/MRI is superior in the detection of primary localized prostate cancer than the conventional biopsy approach with transrectal ultrasound in patients with suspected prostate cancer (according to the inclusion criteria) and could therefore significantly improve the detection rate of the dominant intraprostatic tumor lesion and reduce the number of biopsies needed for a correct histopathological diagnosis to a minimum in the future (PET/MRI guided biopsy).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>tumor characterization</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This method should enable improved tumor characterization. A diagnostic accuracy of &gt;80% is assumed in lesions &gt;5mm (in axial, sagittal and coronal extension) for the ability of the multiparametric metabolic method to differentiate between Gleason ≤3+4=7 (7a) tumors and ≥4+3=7 (7b) tumors (as compared to histological whole mount tumor mapping) and to identify patients with a high risk of developing metastatic disease (as compared to the loss of the transcription factor STAT3(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) and cell cycle regulator p14 in a molecular pathological workout of the radical prostatectomy specimen).</description>

    <description>All enrolled patients are examined by means of dual tracer PET / MRI. Images will be interpreted by 4 designated readers. The readers are blinded of the respective results among each other. A consensus of the two principal readers of nuclear medicine and radiology will serve as reference for the guided needle biopsy. Additionally the readers are blinded to any result of the pathological workout until the recruitment of the last patient is finished.
According to the randomization, the standardized 12 core TRUS-guided biopsy is performed without knowledge of imaging findings by the urologist. If the biopsy is negative patients will have an additional image-guided biopsy with 4 more cores samples. After a positive biopsy the subjects be treated according to normal clinical practice.</description>
