  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity plays an adverse role at every stage of conception and pregnancy and mounting
      evidence implicates relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and reduced menstrual cycle
      hormone secretion as likely contributors to the subfertility phenotype and possible
      contributors to complications of pregnancy and the developmental origin of adult diseases
      such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This study will be the first comprehensive
      investigation to tie together the patterns of hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia and
      inflammation, characteristic of obesity and obesity-caused relative hypogonadotropic
      hypogonadotropism and its potential adverse reproductive outcomes. The investigators findings
      will be used to inform a subsequent clinical intervention to optimize reproductive outcomes
      for obese women and their offspring.

    <description>Reproduction of the reproductive phenotype of obesity in Normal Weight Women (NWW) by:
infusing insulin and free fatty acids (FFAs) in short term experiments and measuring gonadotropin pulsatility and pituitary GnRH response; and
inducing a chronic model of the reprometabolic syndrome by administering a eucaloric diet that is relatively high in pro-inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids and low in anti-inflammatory omega-3 fatty acids (high fat diet; HFD) for one month while monitoring gonadotropin pulsatility and daily urinary reproductive hormone excretion.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) at least 18 but less than 25 kg/m2

          -  No history of chronic disease affecting hormone production, metabolism, or clearance

          -  No use of medications known to alter or interact with reproductive hormones or insulin
             metabolism (e.g. thiazolidinediones, metformin)

          -  No use of reproductive hormones within 3 months of enrollment

          -  Normal prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone levels at screening

          -  History of regular menstrual cycles every 25-35 days

          -  Use of a reliable method of contraception (female or male partner sterilization; intra
             uterine device (IUD); abstinence; diaphragm)

          -  Normal hemoglobin A1c

          -  Screening hemoglobin &gt;11gm/dl

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women with a baseline dietary assessment indicative of &gt;35% daily calorie consumption
             from fat (as calculated based upon initial screening survey) will be excluded, as the
             impact of increasing their dietary fat intake may be minimal.

          -  Women with fasting triglycerides &gt;300mg/dl at screening will be excluded, as they
             might be at risk for acute elevation of triglycerides and even pancreatitis if placed
             on a high fat diet

          -  Inability to comply with the protocol. Individuals who travel frequently, or who eat
             most of their meals outside of their home will be excluded, as it will be difficult to
             impossible for them to comply with the diet, to pick up the food cartons, etc.

          -  Because high proportions of dairy fat will be needed to attain 48% calories from fat
             in the diet, vegans and lactose intolerant individuals will be excluded.

          -  Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant will be excluded.
