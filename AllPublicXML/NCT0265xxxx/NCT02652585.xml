      in a laboratory experiment.

      Objective of this study is to show that a laboratory alcohol self-administration method can
      predict the therapeutic potential of new compounds to reduce relapse in alcohol-dependent
      patients.

      The 'TEMA&quot; translates several animal behavioral paradigms of alcohol self-administration into
      corresponding human experiments.

      We will investigate the opiate antagonist Naltrexone, whose anti-relapse effect is well
      documented, as a reference drug for validation.

      Main objective:

      With TEMA (test system for development of medications for alcoholism ) it can be shown, that
      naltrexone administration reduces the willingness to perform work for alcohol infusion in a
      laboratory experiment.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to a reduction of alcohol
           craving and real-life drinking

        -  administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to reduction of the
           CDT-Level

        -  administration of naltrexone in comparison to placebo leads to a change in perception of
           subjective alcohol effects

        -  the effectiveness of naltrexone can be predicted by the A118G polymorphism of the OPRM1

        -  administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced ability of motor
           inhibition

        -  administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced regional cerebral
           perfusion

        -  administration of naltrexone changes the baseline and alcohol-induced cerebral resting
           state activity

        -  changes of alcohol effects to the brain activity induced by naltrexone in comparison to
           placebo correlate with effects of naltrexone on the willingness to work for alcohol
           self-administration
