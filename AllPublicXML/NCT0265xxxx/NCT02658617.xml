      The findings may guide future investigations on novel therapeutic targets in depressive
      subjects. Based on the depicted link between personality traits and altered brain metabolism
      and function, the latter might be used as supporting objective measures and possible
      biomarkers for increased depression risk.

      Interoceptive awareness (IA) is the awareness of bodily signals and has been highlighted as
      important in many early theories of emotion. William James was one of the first to present a
      psychological theory linking viscero-afferent feedback to emotional experience. The
      processing of bodily and thus interoceptive stimuli may be a crucial component in yielding
      empathy, since affective states are often assumed to involve awareness of one´s own bodily
      state. The assumption of a close relationship between interceptive awareness and empathy is
      further supported when considering the regions recruited during both processes, like the
      insula and the anterior cingulate cortex. Although especially the affective component may
      implicate interoception and interoceptive awareness, the impact of interoception on empathy
      has never been evaluated behaviorally or neurophysiologically.

      Also associated with altered insula and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) function is
      Alexithymia. Alexithymia, a personality trait, is marked by cognitive and affective features
      including difficulties in identifying and describing feelings as well as in distinguishing
      feelings from bodily sensations of emotional arousal. Recent studies found a negative
      correlation between prefrontal glutamate (Glu) and mental perspective taking as well as
      extraversion. Even though several functional imaging studies investigated the neuronal
      signatures of interoceptive awareness and the personality trait alexithymia, little is known
      about the functional relevance of neurotransmitter concentrations

    <description>20 patients were enrolled. Subjects were investigated with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and also underwent a psychodiagnostic assessment (evaluating the severity of depression: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Depression Inventory; measuring hopelessness: Beck Hopelessness Scale; measuring Alexithymia: Toronto Alexithymia Scale; measuring self-perception: Body Perception Questionnaire). 1-2 days after the imaging patients started the treatment with duloxetine: 30mg for the first three days, then 60-90mg.</description>

        Subjects with an acute depressive episode (n = 20; 10 females; mean age ± SD age, 32.2 ±
        10.3 years; number of episodes 2.7 ± 1.9; age of onset 26.7 ± 9.1 years) were recruited
        from the inpatient department of psychiatry at the University of Zurich. All patients were
        either medication naïve or not on any psychotropic medication for at least 6 weeks prior to
        study enrollment. Participants were entered into the study after a full explanation of the
        purpose of the study and the study procedures and after written consent was obtained as
        approved by the University of Zurich's institutional review board.
