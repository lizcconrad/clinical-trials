  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to perform a set of pressure and flow rate measurements
      in order to quantitatively characterize safe irrigation or &quot;flushing&quot; of a ventricular shunt
      catheter, a routine maneuver performed by a neurosurgeon during a shunt revision surgery.
      This maneuver involves injecting saline with a syringe to clear plugged shunt catheters.
      Based on data obtained in Stage I of the study, a device has been fabricated which provides
      the same small-volume pulse of fluid used by surgeons. In Stage II of the study, pressure and
      flow rate measurements generated by this specialized flusher device will be collected and
      measured.

      Primary Objective: To collect pressure and flow rate measurements during shunt revision
      surgeries in human patients.

      Pressure recordings of the injected fluid will be obtained using disposable off-the-shelf
      sterile pressure transducers (which are typically used for intracranial and arterial
      pressures monitoring) readily available in the operating room. First, the surgeon will
      attempt to flush the catheter using the Alcyone in-line Flusher device. If this fails, the
      surgeon may elect to attempt to flush using a standard syringe attached to the catheter. The
      flow rates will be measured by video, recording the syringe during the flushing maneuver, and
      then extracting plunger motion information by applying image processing on the acquired
      videos. In the event the recording equipment is not available (in that these operations are
      usually unscheduled and sometimes urgent), the same irrigation techniques may be used without
      the pressure recordings.

      Secondary Objective: To analyze the collected data and establish maximal allowable injection
      pressure and flow rate. The collected data segments for each patient will be analyzed and
      maximal values for pressure and the saline injection rate will be recorded in a spreadsheet.
      Inter-patient variation in the results, presumably due to different degrees of occlusion,
      will be statistically evaluated. We will also determine if any of the catheters which appear
      occluded in the operating room resume flow with the flushing maneuvers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects must be 30 days to 35 years of age, of any race or gender.

          2. Subjects must be scheduled to undergo a neurosurgical procedure potentially requiring
             a revision of neurosurgical catheters.

          3. Subjects aged &gt;18 years of age must be willing and able to provide written informed
             consent. Parental consent will be required for minors.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Inability or unwillingness of subject or parent/guardian to give informed
             consent/assent.

          2. Judgment of the investigator, surgeon, or any member of the care team (including
             anesthesiology or operating room nursing staff) that participation in the study will
             interfere with, or be detrimental to, administration of optimal healthcare of the
             subject.

          3. Inability or unwillingness of subject to endure the test or any other condition that
             would preclude or bias the results of the study according to the judgment of the
             investigator.
