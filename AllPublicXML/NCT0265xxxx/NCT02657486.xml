        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Recurrent high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer after prior intravesical BCG
             therapy meeting all of the following criteria:

          -  Histologically documented diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma confirmed by the
             Department of Pathology at MSKCC.

          -  Documentation of activating FGFR3 mutation or gene fusion on an assay performed in a
             CLIA-certified laboratory.

          -  History of high-grade, stage pTa non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC).

          -  Clinical evidence of high-grade, stage pTa NMIBC.

          -  Prior intravesical therapy with at least one induction course of BCG

          -  Multiple papillary lesions with at least one amenable to marker tumor study (≤1 cm,
             non-invasive) OR solitary papillary lesion amenable to marker tumor study (≤1 cm,
             non-invasive)

          -  Patient must be willing to consent to MSKCC protocol 12-245 (&quot;Tumor Genomic Profiling
             in Patients Evaluated for Targeted Cancer Therapy&quot;

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Patient must be willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, and
             laboratory tests.

          -  Patient must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  Karnofsky performance status of ≥80.

          -  Recovery from adverse events of previous systemic anti-cancer therapies to baseline or
             grade 1, except for:

               -  Alopecia

               -  Stable neuropathy of ≤ grade 2 due to prior cancer therapy

          -  Women of childbearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
             becoming pregnant, must agree to use highly effective methods of contraception during
             dosing and for 3 months following the discontinuation of study treatment.

        Highly effective contraception methods include:

          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the
             subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without
             hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before study treatment. In case of
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed
             by follow-up hormone level assessment.

          -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). For female subjects the
             vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner.

          -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b, a+c, or b+c):

               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or other
                  forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%);
                  for example, hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository.

        Oral contraceptives (OC), injected or implanted hormonal methods are not allowed as the
        sole method of contraception because BGJ398 has not been characterized with respect to the
        potential to interfere with PK and/or the effectiveness of OCs.

          -  If a woman is of non-childbearing potential, she must either:

               -  Be post-menopausal as defined by 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea
                  with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                  symptoms), OR

               -  Have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, the
                  reproductive status of the woman must be confirmed by follow-up hormone level
                  assessment.

          -  Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking drug and for
             three months after the last dose of the study drug. They should not father a child
             during this period. Men who have undergone vasectomy are also required to use a condom
             during intercourse to prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical suspicion of active CIS.

                  of the study.

          -  Patients who received prior treatment with a selective FGFR inhibitor.
