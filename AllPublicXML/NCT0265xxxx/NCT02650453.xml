      Ongoing registration of deep venous obstructive disease patients treated by means of
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting with or without endophlebectomy
      (surgical desobstruction, also termed endovenectomy) of the common femoral vein and/or
      arteriovenous fistula creation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature has shown endovenous reconstructions to be safe en effective in treating deep
      venous obstructive disease. Deep venous obstruction can develop in cases of (iliac) vein
      compression syndromes (e.g. May-Thurner syndrome) or in cases of post-thrombotic syndrome. In
      patients with both significant complaints (objectively measured) and venous obstruction
      objectified on imaging (duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance venography, CT-venography)
      stenting is indicated.

      In cases of extensive post-thrombotic damage to the veins of the lower extremity
      endophlebectomy (surgical desobstruction) of the common femoral vein can be warranted. This
      operation is generally combined with the creation of an arteriovenous fistula.

      Data of patients treated in our tertiary medical centre are entered in a prospective digital
      database, and continuously updated.

    <measure>Change in patency (primary, assisted primary and secondary) of the treated vein tracts assessed by duplex ultrasonography at regular time intervals.</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 6, 12, 23, 52 weeks post-intervention and yearly afterwards</time_frame>
    <description>Patency is defined as the presence of bloodflow as imaged by use of duplex ultrasonography. Patency will be divided in 3 subgroups; primary patency, assisted primary patency and secondary patency.
Primary patency is defined as presence of bloodflow during follow-up without any interventions undertaken to preserve or reclaim the openness of the treated vein segments.
Assisted primary patency is defined as the presence of bloodflow during follow-up after use of an intervention to preserve the openness of the treated vein segments.
Secondary patency is defined as the presence of bloodflow during follow-up after use of an intervention to reclaim the openness of the treated vein segments.</description>

    <measure>Change in QoL, assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire.</measure>

    <description>The VEINES-QoL/sym is a disease-specific QoL questionnaire aimed at venous disease.</description>

    <measure>Change in Villalta scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 6, 12, 23, 52 weeks post-intervention and yearly afterwards</time_frame>
    <description>The Villalta scale is a validated scoring system for assessing signs, symptoms and complaints of the post-thrombotic syndrome.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Venous claudication; number of patients with presence or absence of venous claudication pre-intervention and post-intervention during follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 6, 12, 23, 52 weeks post-intervention and yearly afterwards</time_frame>
    <description>Venous claudication is the pain which develops in patients with obstructive-type venous disease during ambulation and other types of exercise, and which typically subsides when the patient rests in a lying down position or when sitting with elevation of the lower extremity. It is one of the clinically most important symptoms of (obstructive) venous disease. There is currently no validated or internationally accepted scoring system available. We will therefore note the presence of this typical symptom before treatment, and at regular intervals post-intervention (i.e. 2, 6, 12, 23, 52 weeks post-intervention and yearly afterwards).</description>
