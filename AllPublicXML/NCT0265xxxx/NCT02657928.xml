    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well ribociclib and letrozole work in treating patients with
      estrogen receptor (ER) positive ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial
      cancer that has returned (come back) after a period of improvement. Ribociclib may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some enzymes needed for cell growth. Cancer cells that are
      estrogen receptor positive may need estrogen to grow. Letrozole lowers the amount of estrogen
      made by the body and this may stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow.
      Giving ribociclib together with letrozole may be an effective treatment in patients with
      ovarian, fallopian tube, primary peritoneal, or endometrial cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher
      percentage of patients who are progression free at 12 weeks (PFS 12) as compared with that
      observed in prior studies with single agent letrozole.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate if the combination of letrozole and ribociclib (LEE011) leads to a higher
      cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) response rate in patients with relapsed ER positive ovarian
      cancers and endometrial cancers as compared to that observed in previously reported single
      agent letrozole studies.

      II. Median progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), the confirmed response
      rate, and adverse events.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identify molecular biomarkers associated with a response to treatment with letrozole and
      ribociclib (LEE011) (in patients with relapsed ovarian carcinomas and endometrial cancers).

      II. Develop patient derived xenograft (PDX) avatars on tumors from participants for possible
      future translational study evaluating a potential correlation between responses in the PDX
      model to patients' responses.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ribociclib orally (PO) daily and letrozole PO daily on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 2 years.
