  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with complex congenital heart disease have impaired muscle function compared both to
      health controls and patients with lesions classified as simple. There is only one study
      assessing the effects of resistance training in patients palliated with Fontan procedure. The
      hypotheses of the present study is that home based resistance training will improve muscle
      function in adults with different complex congenital hear diseases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of adults with complex congenital heart disease is increasing and today they
      outnumber the children with corresponding lesions. However, the longterm prognosis is still
      unknown and continuously changing as new therapeutic options are introduced.

      Patients with complex congenital heart disease have reduced muscle function compared to
      healthy controls as well as patients with lesions classified as simple. Furthermore, men with
      congenital heart disease are more commonly underweight and less commonly overweight obese
      compared to the general population. In addition, men with complex lesions are shorter in
      comparison to controls. This indicates an altered body composition i.e. muscle mass, fat mass
      and bone density in this population. Moreover, impaired muscle metabolism has been reported
      in patients palliated with Fontan procedure.

      Adult patients with complex congenital heart disease will be recruited based on defined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Muscle function, muscle strength, muscle metabolism and
      body composition will be evaluated before randomisation and at follow-up after twelve weeks.
      The patients will be randomised to twelve weeks of home based resistance training or to a
      control group. The randomisation ratio will be 1:1 ( intervention:control). The control group
      will be instructed to continue with their habitual physical activities. The resistance
      training protocol will be individualised based on the results of the muscle function and
      muscle strength tests.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of resistance training on muscle
      function, muscle strength, body composition and muscle metabolism in adults with complex
      congenital heart disease.
