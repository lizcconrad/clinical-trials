  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of our study was to identify early predictors of non-invasive ventilation failure,
      so as to alert clinicians early that endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation might
      be appropriate.

    <description>The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification provides a simple way of classifying the extent of heart failure.
Class I: Cardiac disease, but no symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity, e.g. no shortness of breath when walking, climbing stairs etc.
Class II: Mild symptoms (mild shortness of breath and/or angina) and slight limitation during ordinary activity.
Class III: Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short distances (20-100 m). Comfortable only at rest.
Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound patients.</description>

    <description>The Killip classification is a system used in individuals with an acute myocardial infarction, in order to risk stratify them. Patients were ranked by Killip class in the following way:
Killip class I includes individuals with no clinical signs of heart failure. Killip class II includes individuals with rales or crackles in the lungs, an S3, and elevated jugular venous pressure.
Killip class III describes individuals with frank acute pulmonary edema. Killip class IV describes individuals in cardiogenic shock or hypotension (measured as systolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg), and evidence of peripheral vasoconstriction (oliguria, cyanosis or sweating).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of ACPE diagnosed based on SpO2 below 90% with &gt;5 L/ min oxygen via reservoir
             face mask

          -  Acute respiratory distress as evidenced by severe dyspnea

          -  Breathing frequency of &gt;30 breaths/min, and use of accessory respiratory muscles or
             paradoxical abdominal motion in association with tachycardia

          -  Cardiac gallops, bilateral rales, and typical findings of congestion on chest
             radiography, without a history suggesting pulmonary aspiration or evidence of
             pneumonia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if they were intubated before ICU admission, or
             required immediate intubation without prior NIV, or presented a respiratory or cardiac
             arrest

          -  Severe hemodynamic instability (systolic arterial pressure &lt;70 mmHg despite adequate
             fluid repletion and use of vasoactive agents) or life-threatening ventricular
             arrhythmias.

          -  Patients were also excluded if they were unresponsive, agitated, and unable to
             cooperate; or if they had any condition that precluded application of a face mask
             including upper airway obstruction

          -  Recent oral or facial trauma or surgery

          -  Recent gastric or esophageal surgery

          -  Inability to clear respiratory secretions or high risk for aspiration.

          -  In addition, patients were excluded if they had a &quot;do not intubate&quot; order or refused
             research authorization.
