      The purpose of the study is the identification and quantification of protein expression level
      in breast cancer tissues.

      The imaging system is intended for diagnostic use as an aid to the pathologist in the
      detection, counting and classifying her2 immunohistochemical (IHC) stained samples.

      The anti Her2/neu Kit is a semi-quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) assay to identify the
      Human Epithelial growth factor receptor (Her2/neu) expression in formalin-fixed,
      paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue specimens. Results from the Her-2 test is
      indicated as an aid in the assessment of patients for whom HERCEPTINÂ® (Trastuzumab) treatment
      is being considered. While the Her-2 kit provides the antibodies that offer direct
      visualization and semi-quantification of the HER2 protein expression through a brightfield
      microscope, the GenASIs GoPath system is designed to complement the routine workflow of the
      pathologist in the review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides.

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison tests (accuracy) between manual and automatic analysis of antibody expressions. The results from the automatic counting from the clinical studies will be compared to the manual counting analysis.
The study is declared Success if the lower limit of two-sided 95% exact Binomial confidence interval for I. Positive, Negative and Overall agreement with manual count will be at least 85% II. Equivocal agreement with manual count will be at least 80%</description>

    <time_frame>1 Day</time_frame>
    <description>Repeatability &amp; Reproducibility tests of system analysis of antibody expressions. R&amp;R acceptance criteria of HER2 are related to the average agreement for between runs, between days and between systems The R&amp;R part of the study will be declared &quot;Success&quot; based on the two-level HER2/neu outcome (negative=0 &amp; 1+, positive=2+ &amp; 3+), if positive and negative average agreements will be at least 85%</description>
