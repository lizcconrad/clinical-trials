  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present randomized, controlled, parallel-grouped trial included twenty patients (aged 20
      to 54 years) suffering from Miller's class I or II gingival recession. Patients were randomly
      assigned into two equal groups; control group; the coronally advanced flap with the
      subepithelial connective tissue graft (CAF+SCTG) or the test group; coronally advanced flap
      with amnion chorion allograft membrane (CAF+AC).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The participants were randomly assigned to receive coronally advanced flap (CAF) with amnion
      chorion membrane or CAF with subepithelial connective tissue graft using a simple
      randomization procedure with a 1:1 allocation ratio. A computer generated randomization list
      was drawn up by a faculty member who was not involved in the recruitment. Allocation
      concealment was achieved by sealed coded opaque envelopes that contained the treatment to be
      performed to the enrolled subjects based on the randomized numbers. Consequently, patients
      were allocated to either AC membrane (intervention) or SCTG (control) groups. The sealed
      envelope containing treatment assignment was opened at time of the surgery and the number was
      picked by another person other than the operator.
