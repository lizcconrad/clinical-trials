    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies known as GO-203-2C and
      bortezomib as a possible treatment for multiple myeloma that has either progressed or not
      responded to treatment.

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is
      being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved GO-203-2C as a treatment for
      any disease.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved bortezomib as a treatment option
      for your disease.

      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of GO-203-2C with bortezomib.
      GO-203-2C is a newly discovered compound that binds to an oncoprotein (a cancer causing
      protein) called MUC1. Myeloma cells harbor an increased amount of MUC1 on its cell surface.
      By binding to MUC1, GO-203-2C has been shown to cause tumor cell death in laboratory studies.

      Bortezomib is an intravenously or subcutaneously administered medication that belongs to a
      class of drugs called proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors disrupt the normal action
      of cells that breakdown proteins in both normal and cancer cells. This disruption can stall
      tumor growth and cause cancer cells to die. Bortezomib is currently approved for the
      treatment of multiple myeloma.

      The Investigators want to find the highest dose of GO-203-2C given in combination with
      bortezomib that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects.

After the screening procedures confirm participation in the research study:
The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the combination of study drugs that can be administered safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple myeloma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and how well the dose was tolerated.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with multiple myeloma who experienced disease progression after the most
             recent treatment regimen. Patients must have had prior treatment with a proteasome
             inhibitor, immunomodulatory drug, and if eligible for transplant an autologous
             transplant.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as 1 or more of the following:

               -  serum M-protein &gt; 0.5 g/dL. For patients with IgA myeloma where the M-protein
                  cannot be quantified on SPEP, total IgA &gt; 0.5 g/dL.

               -  Urine M-protein &gt; 200mg/24h

               -  serum FLC assay: involved FLC level &gt; 10 mg/dL with abnormal FLC ratio

          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes ≥2,000/mcL

               -  platelets ≥50,000/mcL

               -  total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL (patients with Gilbert syndrome and Bilirubin ≤ 3.5
                  mg/dL are eligible)

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 × institutional upper limit of normal

               -  creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dL

                  --- OR

               -  creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy test.

          -  The effects of GO-203-2c on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for
             the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is
             pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform
             her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also
             agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study
             participation, and 4 months after completion of GO-203-2c administration.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 14 days (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 14 days earlier.
             The use of steroids up the equivalent of 160 mg of dexamethasone is allowed within 14
             days of screening, but the last dose has to be given at least 1 day prior to
             initiation of treatment.

          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension. This is defined as sustained blood pressure elevation &gt;
             140/90 despite antihypertensive therapy. Patients are allowed to start
             antihypertensive therapy to meet eligibility criteria; however they have to be on a
             stable antihypertensive regimen for at least 7 days.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GO-203-2c is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the
             mother with GO_203-2c, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with GO-203-2c. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this
             study.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

          -  Hypersensitivity to bortezomib, boron or mannitol.

          -  Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy.

          -  Prior discontinuation of a bortezomib-based therapy due to toxicity attributed to
             bortezomib.

          -  Use of G-CSF administration within 7 days of screening

          -  Platelet transfusion within 7 days of screening
