  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a pilot randomized trial of 160 obese participants, investigators will test the
      feasibility of a behavioral weight loss program delivered entirely via Facebook. Participants
      will be randomized to a condition in which they will be able to invite their friends, or a
      condition with study participants only. All participants will receive behavioral counseling
      via the private Facebook group from the coaches who are present on the network daily.
      Participants will track their diet and exercise via a free commercial mobile app.

      The overarching goal of the research plan is to test ways to leverage mobile technologies and
      social media to increase the impact, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and dissemination
      potential of lifestyle interventions that reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Mobile
      technology and social media have the potential to reduce the intensity of traditional
      prevention interventions and enhance outcome by delivering behavioral strategies
      in-the-moment and by connecting patients other patients to generate better communication and
      a social support system for lifestyle changes.

      This study includes a behavioral weight loss program delivered entirely via on online social
      network. The weight loss intervention is based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), an
      evidence-based weight loss program focused on lifestyle changes. The goals for the
      intervention are 175 minutes of moderate physical activity per week and an overall weight
      loss of 7%. Each participant will get an individualized calorie goal that would facilitate a
      1-2 lbs. weight loss weekly. Participants will be connected to one another via Facebook and
      receive behavioral counseling via posts from coaches who are present on the network daily.
      Participants will track their diet and exercise via a free commercial mobile app.
      Participants will be assigned to either a Facebook group allowing the invite of friends or a
      Facebook group including only study participants. If they are assigned to the group including
      their friends, they have the opportunity to invite their friends to participate in the weight
      loss group if they are interested in losing weight as well. Friends of friends may also be
      invited. They will not have a limit as to how many friends they can invite. Facebook has a
      feature which will allow anyone to invite friends into a group. The friends that are invited
      will not undergo the same procedures as the FB+friends study participants, but we will
      provide them with a factsheet and collect minimal information from them. Feasibility outcomes
      include engagement (frequency of posts, likes, and comments and number of completed days of
      tracking posted) retention, acceptability, and weight loss. Post intervention focus groups
      will gather feedback on the program.
