        included with ± 2% tolerated around).

        A re-screening can occur from 2 months after the exit of study for failure to comply with
        the one or more of the eligibility criteria listed above.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             the current recommendations (AFSSAPS 2005).

          -  Under lipid-lowering treatment (e.g. statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, bile acid
             sequestrants, niacin, etc.) or stopped less than 4 months before the randomization.

          -  Under medication which could affect blood lipid parameters (e.g. long-term
             corticosteroid systemic drug, systemic antibodies, androgens or phenytoin, etc.) or
