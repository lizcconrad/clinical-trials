        AECOPD-IRS plans to enroll 7600 hospitalized patients (≥ 18 years old with main diagnosis
        as AECOPD). Sample size estimation is based on estimated mortality of AECOPD hospitalized
        patients (~5%). Study patients will be recruited from 40-60 hospitals across China,each
        hospital will recruit 152-190 patients. Hospital selection follows a multi-stage sampling
        strategy.
