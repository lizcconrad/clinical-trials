  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a worldwide chronic inflammatory disease of
      the airways linked to environmental exposure. The chronic course of COPD is often interrupted
      by acute exacerbations which have a major impact on the morbidity and mortality of COPD
      patients. A bacterial etiology for these exacerbations is common (almost 50%). Moreover,
      airway bacterial colonization linked to an increased susceptibility is observed in COPD
      patients. Effective Th17 immune response is needed to develop a good response against
      bacteria. Thus, this study aims to demonstrate that there is a defective IL-17/ IL-22
      response to bacteria in COPD leading to airway bacterial colonization and infection.
