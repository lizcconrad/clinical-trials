  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2 study of newly diagnosed patients with high grade glioma (HGG) undergoing
      standard radiation therapy and temozolomide treatment. BMX-001 added to radiation therapy and
      temozolomide has the potential not only to benefit the survival of high grade glioma patients
      but also to protect against deterioration of cognition and impairment of quality of life. In
      Phase 1 safety and tolerability of BMX-001 will be assessed using a two-stage Continual
      Reassessment Method (CRM). BMX-001 will be given subcutaneously first with a loading dose
      zero to four days prior to the start of chemoradiation and followed by twice a week doses at
      one-half of the loading dose for the duration of radiation therapy plus two weeks. In Phase 2
      both safety and efficacy of BMX-001 will be evaluated. Impact on cognition will also be
      assessed. Twenty-four patients will be randomized to the treatment arm that will receive
      BMX-001 while undergoing chemoradiation and 24 patients randomized to receive chemoradiation
      alone. The investigators hypothesize that BMX-001 when added to standard radiation therapy
      and temozolomide will be safe at pharmacologically relevant doses in patients with newly
      diagnosed high grade glioma. The investigators also hypothesize that in Phase 2 of this
      study, the addition of BMX-001 will positively impact the overall survival and improve
      objective measures of cognition in newly diagnosed high grade glioma patients.

    <description>Phase 1 increasing dose safety study using 3x3 design. BMX-001 will be given by subcutaneous injection with a loading dose given within 4 days prior to initiation of radiation therapy and followed by biweekly maintenance doses at half the loading dose for a total of 10 weeks. The loading dose for the first 3 subjects will be 7 mg per subject. Subsequent groups of 3 subjects will receive loading doses of 14 mg per subject, 28 mg per subject and 42 mg per subject with the increasing doses for groups of 3 subjects following the standard 3x3 safety design. This study arm will involve 12 subjects if no drug-related adverse events are found and a maximum of 18 subjects to define the maximum tolerated level should there be drug-related adverse events.</description>
