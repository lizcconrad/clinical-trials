      The proposed study will investigate the effects of intranasal oxytocin administration on
      neural activity associated with social and non-social motivation.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oxytocin is a well-known social and reproductive hormone demonstrated to have a variety of
      prosocial effects in humans including enhancing trust and generosity, improving positive
      communication, increasing eye gaze, and reducing anxiety. Oxytocin is hypothesized to
      facilitate social behaviors via its modulation of motivational networks. With this study, the
      investigators will characterize oxytocin's effects on the neural processing of salient
      stimuli. The investigators will utilize a noninvasive brain imaging technique, functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess brain activity while participants perform tests
      designed to engage neural circuits associated with the processing of social and non-social
      stimuli.

      Ongoing clinical trials are examining the use of intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of
      multiple psychiatric disorders including substance dependence, depression, and schizophrenia;
      disorders which reward system dysfunction appears to play a significant role. As such, it is
      important that we obtain a better understanding of the neurobiological effects this drug may
      have on reward circuitry functioning. To this end, in this study, we will examine healthy
      control participants and participants diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD).

             Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Participants unable to tolerate the scanning procedures or would be unfit for scanning
             purposes (e.g. metal implants, claustrophobic, unable to lie still for the duration of
             the scan)

          3. Psychiatric Illness Criteria:

               1. Controls: No current or past history of psychiatric illness, including substance
                  use disorder (except nicotine)
