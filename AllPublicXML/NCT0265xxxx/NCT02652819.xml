      This is a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the treatment of
      anemia in subjects with CKD not on dialysis.

      Eligible subjects are randomized to FG-4592 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1. The primary
      endpoint is change in Hb from baseline to the average level during Weeks 7 to 9 inclusive.
