  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis (MS) progressively leads to an increasing level of disability. That's why
      individuals faced with this chronic disease whose progression is unpredictable have to
      mobilize all their available resources. As a result, management of interpersonal
      relationships appears to be a key issue in adjustment to situations.

      Although knowledge on cognitive abnormalities in MS has been growing in recent years, there
      is a lack of research about social behaviour regulation skills. The few studies conducted in
      this field are mainly interested in emotional processing (emotional facial recognition and
      empathy) and skills mentalizing (theory of mind) that appear disturbed in MS.

      While some recent studies touch on the issue of the contextual analysis of language (that is
      to say, the social use of language) in MS, their assessment on a wide range of pragamtic
      skills has never been studied. However, the pragmatic aspects of language are known to play a
      major role in social adjustment.

      This project has three main objectives : (1) to increase general knowledge of deficits in
      communication and in social cognition in patients with MS, (2) to propose new leads for the
      evaluation of these disorders and (3) to contribute to increasing knowledge of neural basis
      of communication and social cognition.

      In order to address those objectives, the assessment will be focused on many various
      pragmatics skills : conversation, indirect language comprehension (indirect questions,
      idiomatic expressions, sarcasm) and metapragmatic knowledge in a population of 40 RR-MS
      patients. Those patients' performances will be compared to a group of healthy matched control
      subjects, potential relationships between pragmatic abilities, other aspects of social
      cognition (theory of mind and processing of emotional stimuli), cognitive functioning,
      psycho-behavioural aspects and the characteristics of the disease will be explore.

      Social cognition tasks have been selected for their dynamic and ecologic aspects in order to
      match natural social interaction.

      Finally, communication consideration, cognitive and cerebral skills of patients with MS will
      contribute to increasing knowledge of the neural basis of social cognition.

    <description>The objective of this task is to assess the verbal communication skills of MS patients in a 10-minute natural conversation (various conversation topics appropriated to the participant's age will be inserted in the conversation). Different performance indexes will be analyzed in this task: amount of verbal exchanges between both interlocutors (number of turn-taking and statements), adjustment to the examiner's requests, topic changes and topic continuity. With the use of the validated observation grid (&quot;protocole Montréal d'évaluation de la Communication&quot;), it will be possible to measure the frequency of occurrence or intensity of communicative behaviours</description>

    <measure>indirect langage comprehension</measure>
    <time_frame>second day of the assesment</time_frame>
    <description>This computer-based task assesses the MS patients' ability to understand indirect statements. Three forms of indirect language will be tested in this protocol: indirect requests, idiomatic expressions and sarcasms (12 items per language forms). Each item consists of a story (3 pictures with an audio-recorded text) where at least 2 characters appear in everyday life situations. The participant has to choose the end of the story from the four options (pragmatic evaluation) and to justify his/her answer (metapragmatic evaluation). The performance indexes used are the total number of correct answers, the total number of correct answers by linguistic form and the number of central justifications by correct answer, showing metapragmatic knowledge.</description>
