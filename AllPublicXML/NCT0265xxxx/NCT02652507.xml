  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to examine the effects of two commonly used anesthetic
      drugs, dexmedetomidine and ketamine, have on the shape and muscle tone of the upper airway in
      children, adolescents, and young adults.

      The results of this study will help in making the best decisions regarding the anesthesia
      medications used for sedation outside of the operating room.

    <textblock>
      Upper airway obstruction is a common problem in spontaneously breathing patients under
      anesthesia. This study is examining the effects of combining dexmedetomidine and ketamine on
      the muscle tone and airway configuration in children under anesthesia. The hypothesis is
      adding ketamine to dexmedetomidine will not significantly reduce airway caliber or morphology
      when compared to previously collected data using dexmedetomidine alone.
