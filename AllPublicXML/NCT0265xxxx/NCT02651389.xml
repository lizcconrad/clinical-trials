    <textblock>
      The demography of ophthalmologists is becoming weaker, many tasks are now performed by
      orthoptists. To optimize the achievement of orthoptic exams and thus make reliable screening
      in a shorter time, digital tools are developed. They attempt to renew the orthoptic screening
      equipment that is still made up of numerous tests, often with old designs that must be
      handled and adapted to each patient which constitutes a significant loss of time.

      It therefore appeared necessary for us to develop a platform of digital tools that integrates
      major tests used for diagnostic purposes, especially a visual acuity test, a stereoscopic
      vision test, a fusion test and a digital synoptophore enabling a detailed analysis of
      disorders of binocular vision.

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate this new tool, avoiding the mobilization of patients
      , and quantify whether this platform is precise, reliable, fast, comfortable and allow the
      realization of a safe examination for the patient and for orthoptics.
