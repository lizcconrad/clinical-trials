      This prospective randomized double-blind control trial is carrying out in the neonatal unit
      of Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College Hospital, Sylhet between July 2012 to December 2015 with
      the diagnosis of preterm (&lt;33 weeks gestation) VLBW (birth weight &lt;1500g) and fulfilling the
      inclusion criteria (able to tolerate oral feed and survive beyond 48h of life) were included
      in this study. Babies with suspicion of clinical sepsis, presence of perinatal asphyxia,
      major congenital anomaly and babies who expired due to other neonatal illness were excluded.
      Gestation was assessed from history of last menstrual period and after birth by new Ballard
      scores. A study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Sylhet M.A.G
      Osmani Medical College, Sylhet.

      Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common acquired disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract in preterm very low birth weight infants and associated with increased
      morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic enteral probiotic supplementation may play a role in
      reducing NEC and potentially provide benefits to preterm very low birth weight neonates. The
      objective was to evaluate the efficacy of orally administered probiotics in preventing
      necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in preterm very low birth weight (VLBW) infants.

      This prospective, randomized double blind controlled trial is undergoing in 102 preterm
      (28-33 weeks gestation) VLBW (birth weight 1000-1499g) neonates fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria. The study group was fed with probiotics once daily with breast milk from first
      feeding and the control group only breast milk without the addition of probiotics. The
      primary outcome was the development of NEC (stage II and III). NEC is categorized by modified
      Bell's classification.

      Probiotic supplementation reduces the frequency of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm
      neonates with very low birth weight. It is also associated with faster achievement of full
      enteral feeding and shorter duration of hospital stay.
