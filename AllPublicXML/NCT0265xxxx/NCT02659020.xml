    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two anti-cancer
      drugs (gemcitabine and docetaxel) with and without the study drug known as olaratumab in
      participants with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (STS) or STS that has spread to another
      part(s) of the body.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant may have no more than 2 prior lines of systemic therapies (neoadjuvant
             and adjuvant therapies will not be considered as a prior line of therapy) for advanced
             or metastatic disease and is suitable to receive gemcitabine and docetaxel therapy.
             All previous therapies must have completed ≥ 3 weeks (21 days) prior to first dose of
             study drug.

          -  In the Phase 2 part, prior olaratumab/doxorubicin combination therapy in 1 prior
             treatment line is allowed.

               -  Prior olaratumab therapy must have been received with doxorubicin as indicated on
                  the olaratumab label.

               -  Prior olaratumab therapy must have included at least 2 full cycles of
                  olaratumab/doxorubicin (that is, a minimum of 4 doses of olaratumab).

               -  Participants, who completed at least 2 cycles of combination
                  olaratumab/doxorubicin therapy then discontinued doxorubicin due to toxicity or
                  maximum dosing and proceeded to olaratumab monotherapy, are eligible.

               -  The most recent dose of olaratumab must have been received within 180 days of
                  randomization in this study.

          -  Availability of tumor tissue is mandatory for study eligibility. The participant must
             have consented to provide archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue or be
             subject to a pre-treatment re-biopsy of primary or metastatic tumor tissue for future
             central pathology review and translational research (if archived tissue is
             unavailable).

          -  The participant has adequate hematologic, organ, and coagulation function within 2
             weeks (14 days) prior to enrollment (Phase 1b) or randomization (Phase 2).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The participant is diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) or Kaposi
             sarcoma.

          -  The participant has active central nervous system (CNS) or leptomeningeal metastasis
             (brain metastasis) at the time of enrollment (Phase 1b) or randomization (Phase 2).
             Participants with a history of a CNS metastasis previously treated with curative
             intent (for example, stereotactic radiation or surgery) that have not progressed on
             follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at least 60 days, and are not receiving
             systemic corticosteroids and or/anticonvulsants, are eligible. Participants with signs
             or symptoms of neurological compromise should have appropriate radiographic imaging
             performed before enrollment (Phase 1b) /randomization (Phase 2) to rule out brain
             metastasis.

          -  The participant has received prior treatment with gemcitabine or docetaxel. Note:
             Participants previously enrolled in the I5B-MC-JGDJ (NCT02451943) or any other blinded
             study with olaratumab are not eligible to participate in this trial.

          -  The participant has electively planned or will require major surgery during the course
             of the study.

          -  Females who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  The participant has an active fungal, bacterial, and/or known viral infection
             including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or viral (A, B, or C) hepatitis
             (screening is not required).
