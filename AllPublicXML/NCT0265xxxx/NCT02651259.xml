  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of
      once-weekly doses of rifapentine (RPT) and isoniazid (INH) in HIV-1-infected and
      HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent tuberculosis (TB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TB is a major cause of illness and death in women of reproductive age. Pregnant and
      postpartum women with latent TB are at higher risk of developing active TB. This study will
      evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of 12 once-weekly doses of RPT and
      INH in HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant and postpartum women with latent TB.

      This study will enroll HIV-1-infected and HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women with latent TB and
      their infants into two cohorts based on gestation. Cohort 1 participants will be enrolled in
      their second trimester (greater than or equal to 14 to less than 28 weeks), and Cohort 2
      participants will be enrolled in their third trimester (greater than or equal to 28 to less
      than or equal to 34 weeks). All participants will receive 12 directly observed once-weekly
      doses of RPT, INH, and pyridoxine (vitamin B6) at study entry and at 11 weekly follow-up
      visits. Study researchers will perform an interim analysis during the study, and a dose
      adjustment may be recommended based on this analysis.

      Study visits will occur at days 0-3, once a week through week 11, and once a month until 24
      weeks after delivery. Visits will include physical examinations, obstetrical exams, and blood
      collection. Infants will be followed monthly until 24 weeks after birth.

             points. All samples tested must be whole blood, serum, or plasma. As this study is
             being conducted under an IND, all test methods should be FDA-approved, if available.
             If FDA-approved methods are not available, test methods should be verified according

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than or equal to 750 cells/mm^3

               -  Platelet count greater than or equal to 100,000/mm^3

          -  Per participant report at screening, intent to remain in the current geographical area
             of residence for the duration of the study

          -  Per participant report at screening, able to swallow whole tablets

          -  Per participant report, intention to keep the pregnancy

          -  Per participant report, willingness to permit infant to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of confirmed or probable active TB disease per World Health Organization
             (WHO) symptom screen and confirmation by Gene Xpert, shielded chest x-ray, or sputum
             sample

          -  Participant report of personal history of INH- or rifampin-resistant, multi-drug
             resistant (MDR), or extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB

          -  Participant report of previous treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI)

          -  Known major fetal abnormality as detected on ultrasound

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity or any hypersensitivity to components of study drugs or
             their formulation

          -  Known history of liver cirrhosis at any time prior to study entry

          -  Per participant report and/or medical records, evidence of acute clinical hepatitis,
             such as a combination of abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and/or light stools

          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator of record (IoR)/designee,
             would preclude informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate
             interpretation of study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study
             objectives, including taking the study medication

          -  Planned or current participation in an interventional drug study

          -  Current use of any prohibited or precautionary medications (see protocol for more
