  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of induction with sevoflurane, along with its ability to generate optimal
      conditions for Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) insertion without supplemental opioids or muscle
      relaxants, has also been well documented. An ideal inhalation induction technique besides
      being rapid and comfortable for the patient should be economical. To achieve rapidity, use of
      vital capacity breaths with 8% sevoflurane is a more popular method of induction compared
      with the conventional incremental induction.

      100 pediatric patients (age range, 1 to 8 years) scheduled for lower abdominal surgery under
      anesthesia will be included. All children in both groups will be premedicated with midazolam,
      0.5 mg/kg orally, about 30 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. A parent or guardian
      accompanied the child into the operating room to allow the child to remain calm and
      cooperative for inhalation induction. Before induction, pulse oximetry and electrocardiogram
      monitoring will be attached. For each group, inhalation induction was initiated using a face
      mask using &quot;tidal volume&quot; and &quot;vital capacity&quot; breathing in high sevoflurane concentration
      (8%).
