  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized phase II study, aimed at evaluating the efficacy (through progression
      free survival at 6 months) and safety of 5 different treatments involving atezolizumab,
      bevacizumab and/or acetylsalicylic acid in advanced recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian
      cancer patients in order to select the optimal treatments for further development in Phase
      III.

        Recurrent, histologically proven, platinum-resistant, epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube
        and primary peritoneal cancer in advanced or metastatic stage. Histological diagnosis by
        image guided biopsy, laparoscopy or laparotomy. Tumors diagnosed on cytology only and
        borderline tumors are excluded.

        At least one lesion accessible to biopsy without putting patient at risk

        WHO PS: 0-2 for patients having received no more than two previous lines of therapy. WHO
        PS: 0-1 for patients having received &gt;2 previous lines of therapy

        Prior chemotherapy or bevacizumab:

        Any number of platinum-based chemotherapy lines are allowed but a maximum of 2 previous
        non-platinum containing lines

        Prior treatment with bevacizumab or other targeted agents against Vascular Endothelial
        Growth Factor (VEGF) or VEGF receptor is allowed, but at least 18 weeks must have elapsed
        since their last administration

        Eligible patients with ≤ 2 previous treatment lines must have been previously exposed to
        bevacizumab or other targeted agents against VEGF or VEGF receptor

        Patients may have had prior therapy providing the following conditions are met:

        Radiation therapy: wash-out period of 14 days prior to the first study treatment;
        exception: single fraction radiotherapy with the indication of pain control

        Systemic anti-tumor therapy: wash-out period of 21 days prior to the first study treatment

        Recovery from any toxic effects of prior therapy to ≤ Grade 1 per the National Cancer
        Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.03) except fatigue
        or alopecia.

        Exclusion criteria:

        Age &lt;18 years

        Life expectancy of &lt; 12 weeks

        No adequate hematologic and end organ function

        Use of acetylsalicylic acid, NSAIDs or other COX-2 inhibitors that cannot be stopped at
        baseline and for the whole duration of the study.
