  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing complications and readmission after ostomy surgery will decrease the cost of
      healthcare, improve patient safety, reduce the cost of durable medical equipment required by
      ostomates, ensure continued specialized care is available, and potentially improve both short
      and long-term quality of life (QOL) for patients by reducing morbidity and mortality
      associated with ostomy surgery. The purpose of this study is to measure the effectiveness of
      patient centered interventions/care pathways and to determine the impact on healthcare
      utilization, 30-day hospital readmissions, and QOL.
