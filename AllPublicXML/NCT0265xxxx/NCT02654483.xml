  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to determine whether daily oral administration of VPD-737 (5 mg) is effective and
      safe in adolescents and adults with Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Itch is the most common complaint reported by patients with EB of all subtypes, and there is
      no current effective treatment. Itch often triggers scratching that creates new wounds and
      increases EB disease severity. This study aims to target the physiological mechanisms of
      pruritus (itch) in patients with EB .

      Substance P is a major mediator of pruritus and binds to the receptor neurokinin-1 (NK1),
      which is expressed in the central nervous system and the skin.

      VPD-737 (serlopitant), a novel drug that inhibits the NK1 receptor, has been shown to reduce
      severe itch in a previous study of 257 adult patients with chronic pruritus.

      The investigators are now testing VPD-737 in 14 patients with EB in a Phase II randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trial.
