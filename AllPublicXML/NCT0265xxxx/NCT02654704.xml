      To follow longitudinally healthy and immune-compromised responses to pneumococcal
      vaccination, in 60+ individuals towards the development of personalized medicine
      implementation (minimum enrollments in 2 age categories: young adults[18-25], older adults
      [55+], within each category: 10+ healthy, 10+ asthma, 10+ immune-compromised [e.g. leukemia
      or autoimmune disorders]). The approach will profile thousands of molecular components
      utilizing high-throughput technologies and integrate these data to obtain personalized immune
      response to vaccination. The study will provide insights into immune response mechanisms
      specific to asthmatics, immune compromised and healthy individuals, as well as in response to
      vaccination. Additionally the differences in dynamic response across the two age groups will
      be investigated.

      The primary investigation involves integrative multi-omics monitoring of individuals
      following their pneumonia vaccination over twelve time points. Genomic sequencing will be
      used to evaluate the volunteer's genomic risks based on variants with known disease
      association. Full transcriptome (via RNA-Sequencing), proteome and metabolome profiling (via
      mass spectrometry) will be performed per time-point. This will allow the dynamic monitoring
      of thousands of molecular components and their responses to vaccination, capturing both the
      initial innate response reaction in addition to the adaptive response and return to baseline.
      This study involves a simple blood draw, saliva collection, standard FDA-approved
      pneumococcal vaccine administration and Spirometry.

    <description>The study will construct RNA-expression, protein profiles and small molecule profiles on immune cells as these change over time prior to and following immune activation by the vaccine. The collective temporal patterns will be used to classify immune response. The outcome measured is an updated integrative Personal Omics Profile as reported at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3341616/ . This is observational in nature to assess personalized medicine methodology for following immune response.</description>

        The initial target enrollment is 60+ individuals in three group classifications [healthy,
        asthmatic, immune-compromised (e.g. Leukemia patients)], with each group further subdivided
        into two age groups [Young adults (aged 18-25) or Older adults (aged 55+)], without gender
        or ethnicity restrictions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants ages 18 to 25 years old, or 55 and older, who have been diagnosed with
             asthma, other immune-compromising condition (e.g. Leukemia treated, Pulmonary
             disorders) or are healthy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may not participate in this study if any of the following applies:

        The potential subjects have already been vaccinated with PPSV23. Subjects have special
        risks attendant to venipuncture. Existence of any medical conditions that study
        investigators believe will interfere with the study participation or evaluation of results.
        This includes subjects on immunosuppressive medications and/or glucocorticoids.

        Mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment that would preclude adequate understanding
        of, or cooperation with, the study protocol.

        For female participants: subjects will be excluded if pregnant. There are no known risks to
        pregnant women from the PPSV23 vaccine (also indicated in the Vaccine Information Statement
        (VIS) attachment provided to participants), and there is no additional risk associated with
        becoming pregnant during the study. However, as pregnancy affects immune system responses,
        this may affect the molecular readout in this study and introduce confounding factors in
        the analysis by the investigators. If a participant is already enrolled and becomes
        pregnant during this study, the investigators will temporarily withdraw them from the study
        from the day the participants become pregnant. If the participants would like to stay in
        the study, the investigators may continue their participation after their delivery.

        If a participant has any severe allergies (life-threatening) or a participant has ever had
        a life-threatening allergic reaction after a dose of pneumococcal vaccine, or have a known
        severe allergy to any part of this vaccine, the participants will be advised not
        participate.

        If a participant is not feeling well on the scheduled day of vaccination, the study
        coordinators will suggest waiting until the participants feel better. If the participant
        agrees, the vaccination will be rescheduled for a later date.
