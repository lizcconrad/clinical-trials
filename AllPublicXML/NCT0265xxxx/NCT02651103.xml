  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research aims to investigate how different ventilation strategies may affect
      cerebral tissue oxygenation in the pediatric population. It will contribute to the literature
      exploring the NIRS monitoring device which is becoming increasingly utilized in a variety of
      anesthetic and critical care settings. It may help to guide clinical practice regarding
      optimal ventilation strategies, and how ventilation may be altered to correct suboptimal
      cerebral tissue oxygenation.

      This prospective study will include 50 patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion that
      requires placement of an arterial cannulation. There will be no change in the anesthetic or
      perioperative care of these patients. Tissue and cerebral oxygenation will be monitored using
      near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).
