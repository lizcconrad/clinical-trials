  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted to determine whether the test product (GW483100 10 mg containing
      montelukast sodium equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast) is bioequivalent to the reference
      montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets (innovator product) in healthy adult volunteers under
      fasting conditions. This is an open-label, balanced, randomized, single dose, two-way
      crossover study, enrolling 32 healthy human subjects to ensure at least 28 subjects complete
      the study. Each subject enrolled will participate in two treatment periods separated by a
      washout period of at least 7 days and no more than 14 days between dosing occasions. Total
      duration in the study for each subject will be approximately 7 weeks from screening to the
      subject's last visit.

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent as described in protocol which includes
             compliance with the requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form and in
             the protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin &gt;1.5xupper limit of normal (ULN)
             (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct
             bilirubin &lt;35%).

          -  Corrected QT (QTc) &gt; 450 millisecond (msec) NOTES: The QTc is the QT interval
             corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read; The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
             individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
             subject from the trial; For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT

             Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), positive hepatitis C antibody test
             result at screening or within 3 months prior to first dose of study treatment.

             investigational product (whichever is longer).

          -  Exposure to more than four new chemical entities within 12 months prior to the first
             dosing day.
