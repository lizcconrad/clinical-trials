  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open, pilot study using the oral ORMD-0801 insulin formulation in patients with
      NASH and confirmed type 2 DM or pre-diabetes. The study will consist of a Screening, placebo
      run-in, treatment phase and end-of-study phase.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory study will first enroll 10 patients with NASH and type 2 DM, to evaluate the
      safety of oral insulin and to measure the change in liver fat content.

      At the completion of their 4-week follow-up period, results will be presented to the Helsinki
      Committee. Following approval, an additional 20 patients will be enrolled. The size of the
      study population was determined by the investigator (with literature review) to be sufficient
      to show trends of reducing liver fat content by analysis of MRI PDFF (MRI-Proton Density Fat
      Fraction) images, the FibroMax™ Test and Fibroscan® including Controlled Attenuation
      Parameter (CAP™). CAP™ is a measure of the ultrasound attenuation to quantify steatosis in
      the liver.
