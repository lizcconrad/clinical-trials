  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine engraftment of neutrophils and platelets at 28 days following alpha/beta T-cell
      and CD19 cell depletion using HLA haploidentical donors for peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant in relapsed lymphoma.

      Assess incidence of acute GVHD (Graft versus Host Disease), chronic GVHD, graft failure rate,
      treatment related mortality rate, progression free survival and overall survival of patients.

      The stem cell product will be processed using an investigational Miltenyi cell selection
      device/system that removes the alpha/beta T-cells and CD19+ cells, immune system cells that
      are more likely to cause GVHD.

             registration. Salvage therapy is allowed between the patient meeting one of the below
             criterion and registration. Patients will be considered eligible regardless of their
             current disease status (i.e. complete remission, partial remission, stable disease,
             progressive disease) unless otherwise noted below as long as one of the below
             criterion has been met within the previous 24 months:

               -  Relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma, deemed ineligible for autologous stem cell
                  transplantation due to refractory disease

               -  Relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma after autologous stem cell
                  transplantation (history of transformed lymphoma is acceptable). Disease must be
                  in at least complete remission or partial remission with the use of salvage
                  therapy before study treatment commences.

                  autologous stem cell transplantation due to refractory disease (history of
                  transformed lymphoma is acceptable). Disease must be in at least complete
                  remission or partial remission with the use of salvage therapy before study
                  treatment commences.

               -  Relapsed/refractory T cell lymphoma relapsed after at least 1 prior line of
                  therapy

          -  Cardiac: EF ≥ 50%. No uncontrolled angina or active cardiac symptoms consistent with
             congestive heart failure (class III or IV), by the New York Heart Association
             criteria. No symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias or ECG evidence of active ischemia.

          -  Voluntary written consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active CNS lymphoma within two weeks of registration. Patients with a history of CNS
             involvement must have adequate treatment as defined by at least two negative spinal
             fluid assessments separated by at least one week. (Otherwise LP is not required if no
             clinical suspicion or evidence of CNS involvement.) Patients who have received cranial
             radiation therapy must still be eligible to receive total lymphoid irradiation to 7
             Gy.

          -  New or active infection as determined by fever, unexplained pulmonary infiltrate or
             sinusitis on radiographic assessment. Infections diagnosed within 4 weeks of
             registration must be determined to be controlled or resolving prior to treatment.

          -  Presence of HIV, or active hepatitis A, B, or C infection

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to agents used within the treatment protocol.

          -  For an indolent lymphoma histology (follicular lymphoma, SLL/CLL) or mantle cell
             lymphoma, the patient should not have an HLA-matched sibling, who would be an eligible
             donor, available.

          -  History of prior mediastinal radiation

          -  Reported illicit drug use
