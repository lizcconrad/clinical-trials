    <textblock>
      Single center, phase I/II trial of pembrolizumab after CTL019 for CD19+ lymphomas. Patients
      will have CD19+ diffuse large B-cell, follicular, or mantle cell lymphomas
      relapsed/refractory after CTL019. 12 total patients will be enrolled. Safety of pembrolizumab
      (primary endpoint) will be determined using a Bayesian monitoring rule for treatment-related
      adverse events causing drug discontinuation. Secondary efficacy endpoints include overall
      response rate and progression-free survival.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a study
             of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an investigational
             device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment. An exception will be made for
             patients who have received CTL019/CTL119 on experimental protocol; these patients will
             be eligible to enroll once progression of disease or failure to respond is documented
             by clinical or radiologic assessment.

          2. Patient has received intervening therapy for lymphoma after CTL019/CTL119 infusion.

          3. Has active cytokine release syndrome from CTL019/CTL119 infusion.

          4. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis).

          5. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.

          6. Has had a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibody (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study
             Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events
             due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier. Toxicities that are disease
             related will not exclude patients.

          7. Has had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy
             within 2 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at
             baseline) from adverse events due to a previously administered agent.

               -  Note: Subjects with ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this criterion and
                  may qualify for the study.

               -  Note: If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from
                  the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention in the opinion of the
                  Principal Investigator prior to starting therapy.

          8. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the

             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.

         10. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years
             (i.e. use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs).
             Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a
             form of systemic treatment.

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         14. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.

         15. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit
             through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.

         16. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.

         17. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).

         18. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA
             [qualitative] is detected).

         19. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and
             are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live
             attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.

         20. Has a history of (non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or has current
             pneumonitis.
