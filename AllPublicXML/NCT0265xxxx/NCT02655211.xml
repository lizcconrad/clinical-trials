  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of pulsed dye laser (PDL) and carbon dioxide (CO2)
      laser in conjunction with usual care (MED) for the treatment of hypertrophic burn scars and
      will determine the optimal sequence and timing of lasers and usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigator will compare usual care (MED), which will be offered to all patients, to two
      types of laser treatment (PDL and CO2), which the investigators hypothesize to be beneficial.
      The timing and sequence of therapy will be randomized, but all patients will receive some
      form of laser treatment. If the investigators simply stopped at the end of Aim 1, the
      investigators would complete a traditional randomized control trial (RCT), with some patients
      potentially receiving laser treatment. However, the investigators are interested in
      determining whether the sequence of laser treatments is beneficial; therefore, the
      investigators will be employing a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART)
      design. Because of the nature of the study and SMART design, the investigators will offer all
      patients some form of laser therapy.

          -  desire laser treatment,

          -  be at least 6 months of age at the time of treatment,

          -  agree to have no aesthetic treatments for their burn scars, such as peels or fillers,

          -  be able and willing to follow the protocol requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  be women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study,

          -  have had any previous laser treatment of their burn scars,

          -  have open wounds that are not re-epithelialized in the areas of proposed study
             treatment,

          -  be taking systemic steroids or immunosuppression medication,

          -  have a connective tissue disorder,

          -  be receiving or planning to receive chemotherapy or radiation during the study,

          -  be medically unable to tolerate anesthesia, or

          -  have other conditions that in the opinion of the investigators or clinicians may
             affect participant safety or compromise study objectives.
