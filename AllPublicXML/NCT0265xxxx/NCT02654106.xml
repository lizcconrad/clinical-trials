  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was designed to investigate the efficiency and toxicity of fractionated
      stereotactic radiotherapy(FSRT) combined with Temozolomide(TMZ) for refractory brain
      metastases.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single center, phase II trial to investigate the feasibility and
      toxicity of FSRT plus TMZ for refractory brain metastases, which are defined as A: multiple
      brain metastases(≥3 lesions); B: large brain metastases(with one lesion's volume is no
      smaller than 6cc or the longest diameter is no shorter than 3cm); C: meningeal metastases.
