      Prospective, observational study aimed to investigate the specific hemostatic alterations in
      patients undergoing glial tumor resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain parenchyma express tissue factor and other coagulation factors in high concentrations.
      In addition, neuro critical patients (NCP) may present platelet dysfunction,
      hyperfibrinolysis, hypo coagulation and / or hyper coagulation status, early after the
      injury. It is not known whether these alterations of hemostasis are due to a specific brain
      response to aggression, or they are included into a systemic response. This prospective,
      observational study is aimed to investigate the coagulation disorders specifically associated
      with cerebral aggression.

      This is a prospective, cohort study including (calculated sample size) a study group of
      patients undergoing elective surgery (glial tumors) and other one undergoing colo rectal
      surgery. Alterations of the hemostasis will be evaluated by clotting tests,
      thromboelastometry and tests for platelet function. Samples will be drawn before and after
      surgical procedures. Multiple statistical comparisons intra and inter groups will be
      performed.
