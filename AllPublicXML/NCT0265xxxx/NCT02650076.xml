      The primary objective is to confirm the target receptor occupancy of SK-1405 and to correlate
      receptor occupancy with SK-1405 dose and plasma concentration.

      The secondary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of SK-1405 in healthy,
      Caucasian, male subjects.
