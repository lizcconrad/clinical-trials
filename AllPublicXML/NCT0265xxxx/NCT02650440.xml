  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of novel versus standard locomotor
      training using a robotic gait orthosis (LT-RGO) after stroke. The hypothesis is that the
      novel LT-RGO protocol, by establishing a progressive decrease in gait velocity and guidance
      force, may facilitate greater motor recovery compared to the use of a standard protocol.

      Standard (rhythmic) robot-assisted locomotor training on a bodyweight-supported treadmill
      (LT-BWST) used progressively increased speed each week. Novel (discrete) robot-assisted
      LT-BWST used progressive decrease in speed. The novel approach of slowing down the treadmill
      reduced momentum. If speed had been increased (standard approach), momentum would have
      increased (momentum = mass * velocity); and the resulting, passive propulsion of momentum
      would have diminished the role of cortical skills needed to plan, initiate, and overtly
      control gait. In sum, the novel protocol used a slower-than-standard treadmill speed in order
      to provide a window of time sufficient for the corticomotor system to process information,
      learn, and adjust its response to internal and external feedback (eg, proprioceptive input;
      therapist input) during robot-assisted LT-BWST.

    <measure>Functional Ambulation Scale (FAC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Ambulation Scale (FAC) assesses an individual's independence during gait and follows a six-level scale: 0 - Patient can not walk or ask for help from two or more people; 1 - Patient requires continuous support from a person who assists with weight and balance; 2 - Patient needs continuous or intermittent support from a person to help with balance and coordination; 3 - Patient required for a person without physical contact; 4 - Patient can walk independently on the floor, but requires help on stairs and ramps; 5 - Patient can walk independently.
This study compared the gait independence by the FAC between the two Arms, after intervention as compared to baseline.</description>

    <measure>Lower Limbs Fugl-Meyer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl Meyer Scale is a cumulative numerical scoring system that is assessed by an individual: range of motion, pain, tenderness, upper and lower extremity motor function and balance, plus coordination and speed of movement, with total 226 points. A three-point ordinal scale is applied to each item: 0 - can not be performed, 1-performed partially and 2-performed completely. For this study it was only an evaluation of motor function of the extremity of lower limbs with a total score of 0 to 34 points. The lower score indicates greater motor impairment.
This study compared the change in motor function of lower limbs applied scale after intervention as compared to baseline</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Scale is a functional scale of equilibrium performance, based on 14 common everyday items that evaluate the static and dynamic balance. The maximum scale score is 56 and each scale item has five alternatives ranging from 0 to 4 points. A score below 45 is considered a fall risk. This study comparede the change in the balance control applied scale after intervention as compared to baseline.</description>

    <description>All subjects performed robot-assissted LT-BWST 5 times a week for 6 weeks (30 minutes of training and 15 minutes of setup). Novel (discrete) robot-assisted LT-BWST used progressive decrease in speed. Both groups started the robot-assisted LT-BWST at the same speed of 1.4km/h. The body weight support started approximately at 40% of body weight for both groups and rapidly decreased each week. The guidance force was also progressively decreased for both groups so that the exoskeleton provided the least possible assistance to the subject.</description>

        <title>Functional Ambulation Scale (FAC)</title>
        <description>The Functional Ambulation Scale (FAC) assesses an individual's independence during gait and follows a six-level scale: 0 - Patient can not walk or ask for help from two or more people; 1 - Patient requires continuous support from a person who assists with weight and balance; 2 - Patient needs continuous or intermittent support from a person to help with balance and coordination; 3 - Patient required for a person without physical contact; 4 - Patient can walk independently on the floor, but requires help on stairs and ramps; 5 - Patient can walk independently.
This study compared the gait independence by the FAC between the two Arms, after intervention as compared to baseline.</description>

Novel Protocol: All subjects performed robot-assissted LT-BWST 5 times a week for 6 weeks (30 minutes of training and 15 minutes of setup). Novel (discrete) robot-assisted LT-BWST used progressive decrease in speed. Both groups started the robot-assisted LT-BWST at the same speed of 1.4km/h. The body weight support started approximately at 40% of body weight for both groups and rapidly decreased each week.

        <description>The Fugl Meyer Scale is a cumulative numerical scoring system that is assessed by an individual: range of motion, pain, tenderness, upper and lower extremity motor function and balance, plus coordination and speed of movement, with total 226 points. A three-point ordinal scale is applied to each item: 0 - can not be performed, 1-performed partially and 2-performed completely. For this study it was only an evaluation of motor function of the extremity of lower limbs with a total score of 0 to 34 points. The lower score indicates greater motor impairment.

        <title>Berg Scale</title>
        <description>Berg Scale is a functional scale of equilibrium performance, based on 14 common everyday items that evaluate the static and dynamic balance. The maximum scale score is 56 and each scale item has five alternatives ranging from 0 to 4 points. A score below 45 is considered a fall risk. This study comparede the change in the balance control applied scale after intervention as compared to baseline.</description>

            <description>Progressive decrease of speed and guidance force on robotic gait training. Initial speed is 1.4 km/h and final speed is 1.0 km/h.
Novel Protocol: All subjects performed robot-assissted LT-BWST 5 times a week for 6 weeks (30 minutes of training and 15 minutes of setup). Novel (discrete) robot-assisted LT-BWST used progressive decrease in speed. Both groups started the robot-assisted LT-BWST at the same speed of 1.4km/h. The body weight support started approximately at 40% of body weight for both groups and rapidly decreased each week. The guidance force was also progressively decreased for both groups so that the exoskeleton provided the least possible assistance to the subject.</description>
