      This study evaluates the performance of objective psoriasis severity assessment tool compared
      with a subjective assessment tool for the assessment of the improvement of psoriasis after
      oral cyclosporine A or methotrexate treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis were randomly assigned to treatment for 16 weeks
      with either cyclosporine A (20 patients; male 200 mg/day, female 150 mg/day) or methotrexate
      (20 patients; initial dose with 10 mg/week, increased up to 15 mg/week). The primary outcome
      was to compare the difference between the conventional subjective Psoriasis Area and Severity
      Index (PASI) and the objective PASI by using Colorimeter at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of
      treatment. The secondary outcome was differences between cyclosporine and methotrexate for
      treatment of psoriasis, evaluating clinical efficacy and side effects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and Objective PASI (oPASI) change over time</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI scores and oPASI scores are carried out on every visit. One dermatologist rates a PASI score. A oPASI score is obtained from oPASI formula using Colorimeter parameters L*, a* and b* values.
oPASI = 0.1×oPSI (head)×Area (head) + 0.3×oPSI (trunk)×Area (trunk) +0.2×oPSI (arm)×Area (arm) + 0.4×oPSI (leg)×Area (leg)
oPSI = 0.05 x L* - 2.5 x tan−1 (b*/a*) + 5
PASI range is 0 to 72 score. oPSI range is 1.073 to 10 score.</description>

    <measure>Number of participants with abnormal laboratory values and/or adverse events that are related to treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening, 4, and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory tests are performed at screening, 4, and 12 weeks. Patients are checked hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell, platelet, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, c-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation. All patients are asked treatment-related adverse events on every visit.</description>
