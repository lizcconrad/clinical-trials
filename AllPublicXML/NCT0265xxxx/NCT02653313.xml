    <textblock>
      Investigation on safety, tolerability and efficacy of parvovirus H-1 (ParvOryx) in subjects
      suffering from metastatic, inoperable pancreatic cancer with at least one hepatic metastasis.

      Initially four equal doses of ParvOryx will be administered intravenously on four consecutive
      days. Seven to fourteen days after the first intravenous administration the drug will be
      injected directly in a hepatic metastasis of the pancreatic cancer.
