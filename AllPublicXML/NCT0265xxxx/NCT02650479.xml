      This single-center Phase I study will consist of 2 parts, a Pilot Part and a Core Part.

      The Pilot Part of the study will be an open-label, non-randomized, single-treatment design in
      10 healthy male and female subjects to determine if an infusion regimen of a 6-h continuous
      IV infusion of exenatide will lead to a mean plasma steady state concentration of 500 pg/mL.

      The Core part of the study will be a double-blind (except for the use of open label active
      control moxifloxacin), randomized, placebo-controlled,3 period, 6-sequence, cross-over design
      in 72 healthy male and female subjects to evaluate whether exenatide at therapeutic and
      supra-therapeutic concentrations has a pharmacological effect on cardiac repolarization
      (threshold value &gt;10 msec).
