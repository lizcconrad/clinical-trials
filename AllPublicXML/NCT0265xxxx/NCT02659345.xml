  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this research study are asked to tell about their experience with art
      therapy. Participants in this research study are currently receiving chemotherapy treatment
      for cancer. The purpose of this study is to learn how art therapy affects mood, anxiety,
      pain, and emotions of individuals with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      In this single-center single-arm non-controlled descriptive study, we aim to describe the
      effects of a single art therapy session on a cancer patient's mood, pain, anxiety level.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's mood

        -  To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's anxiety

        -  To assess the effect of art therapy on the cancer patient's pain

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To explore differences in response to art therapy by ethnic group, race, age, sex,
           caregiver support, cancer diagnosis, reason for visit, and marital status

        -  To explore differences in response to art therapy by primary concern expressed by
           patients during art therapy sessions

    <description>The primary endpoint of the trial is to access the effect of an art therapy session on the patients' mood, anxiety level, and pain. To accomplish this, patients will complete four visual analog scales (VAS) prior to and after the session. The primary end points are the pre-and post session changes in the VAS.</description>

    <description>The art therapy intervention will be executed by an art therapist at the Cancer Center. The same art therapy practices that are utilized in daily practice will be employed in this study. The intervention will include assessment of patient's needs and goals in addition to utilization of various art modalities. Sessions will conclude with processing of the art and supportive counseling as appropriate. Pilot testing of the intervention has been performed informally at Maroone Cancer Center with positive feedback provided by patients and their support systems to the physicians, nurses, and art therapist. Change in pain, emotional distress, depression, adn anxiety will be measured by the emotions thermometer.</description>

    <description>The Emotions Thermometer, was chosen to assess patients' mood, anxiety level, and pain scale for this study. For patient ease, the study team chose to utilize a scale of 1-10 for all subjective measurements to be obtained from patients (mood and anxiety level). The study team included the thermometer image to mirror the NCCN Guidelines Version Distress Management Screening tool, for measuring distress and mood level. This screening tool has been shown to be effective in assessing patient distress and mood in oncology patients with ease of use in patients and utility in providers.</description>
