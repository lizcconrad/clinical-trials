      Brief Summary: In schizophrenia, dislocation of psychic functions involving a loss of contact
      with reality is frequently found. A fragmentation of motor and sensory perceptions could be
      held responsible. However, automatic integration between perception and action is the
      necessary condition to be in &quot;relationship with the world.&quot; Affordance is the experimental
      link between object perception and potentially associated actions (Gibson, 1977, 1979)
      explored by Stimulus Response Compatibility (SRC) paradigm. With Tucker &amp; Ellis sensory motor
      compatibility task (1998), with a modified response device (responses given with grasp), we
      study the impact of motor activation on these affordance effects. In this study, a group of
      controls will also be included in order to understand, as precisely as possible, the
      mechanisms involved (i.e., interference between the perception of the object and the response
      gesture).

      Schizophrenic patients will perform: Alert TEA, (Zimmermann and Fimm, 2005), Edinburgh
      laterality questionnaire (Oldfield, 1971), IQ test (IQ: PM38, Raven, 1960), and the PANSS
      (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Kay et al., 1987). Controls will only perform the
      laterality questionnaire. Then all will perform the affordance task, in which photographs of
      20 objects of everyday life, typically graspable with one hand, are presented in 4
      orientations. Participants have to respond in a graspable device, as quickly as possible, if
      the object is presented upright or inverted.
