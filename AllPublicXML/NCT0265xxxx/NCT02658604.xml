      RATIONALE:

      Several examples in the literature describe the types of medication management issues
      uncovered during the course of home-based medication reviews. For example, the investigators
      previously reported the outcomes of home medication reviews of 43 homebound community
      pharmacy patients, finding that 58% of patients were keeping medications in the home that
      were expired, duplicates of other current medications, or no longer therapeutically
      appropriate.

      Many of these issues, due to their nature, could be considered to be &quot;hidden&quot;, i.e. issues
      that are unlikely to be adequately detected or resolved during the course of routine
      interactions between patients and pharmacists in the community pharmacy setting. Currently,
      only homebound patients in Ontario are eligible to receive government-funded home medication
      review services from pharmacists. This limitation in funding eligibility is problematic as it
      reduces the likelihood that non-homebound patients will receive home medication reviews, even
      though this population may also benefit from these services. Indeed, evidence in the
      literature is not limited exclusively to homebound patients, and suggests that non-homebound
      patients are also at risk from home-centered medication management issues and may also
      benefit from home medication reviews.

      PURPOSE:

      Our study aims to characterize the prevalence and nature of &quot;hidden in the home&quot; medication
      management issues in non-homebound patients. To our knowledge, this study would be the first
      of its kind to focus specifically on this patient population and lend direct evidence in
      support of expanding funding of home medication review services in Ontario to include
      non-homebound patients.

      HYPOTHESIS:

      A subset of ambulatory, non-homebound patients who regularly attend community pharmacies are
      affected by medication management issues that cannot be adequately identified and resolved
      during the course of a typical medication review taking place within the pharmacy. These
      patients would benefit from a full medication review taking place in their own homes, similar
      to what is presently provided under Ontario's MedsCheck at Home program, for which only
      homebound patients in Ontario are eligible.

      RESEARCH QUESTIONS/OBJECTIVES:

        1. What is the frequency of, and what type(s) and severity of, drug-related problems are
           detected during pharmacist visits to patients' homes who would not otherwise qualify for
           a MedsCheck at Home service?

        2. Based on the findings from this study, which criteria would best assist community
           pharmacists in identifying ambulatory patients who may stand to benefit most from a
           home-based medication review?

    <description>Patients will receive a home visit from a pharmacist, including a medication review and the identification and addressing of drug therapy problems through patient education, the provision of pharmacologic and/or non-pharmacologic advice, or the adaptation of therapy or communication of recommendations to prescribers. All activities are within the current scope of practice for pharmacists in Ontario. A detailed assessment of the patient's medication inventory and organization/storage practices will be conducted, followed by a medication cabinet cleanup to help the patient organize their medications and discard any expired or discontinued medications. A list of inappropriate medications found in the home will be documented, detailing the reasons why they are inappropriate and if/how the patient is currently using these medications. With patient consent, inappropriate medications will be removed from the home and returned to the pharmacy for safe disposal.</description>
