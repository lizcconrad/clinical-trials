    <textblock>
      This proposed study will examine feasibility and implement therapeutic bright light that is
      tailored to the individual's circadian typology to estimate its therapeutic effects on
      sleep/wake patterns and fatigue in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

    <description>Complete the MEQ at screening, the day before 2nd cycle of chemo, and on the day of 3rd cycle of chemo, -21 day light intervention at home for 30 min once a day during 2nd cycle of chemo, Scores of ≤41 (evening types) on MEQ will have light delivered within 30 minutes of waking for 21 consecutive mornings. Score of ≥59 (morning types) on MEQ will have light delivered between 1900-2000 hours for 21 consecutive evenings. Light therapy will be self-administered using a light visor cap. On 2 randomly selected days ambient light will be recorded continuously during waking hours using a digital foot candle datalogging light meter, Continuous ambulatory PSG for 24 hours at the participant's home before and after the light intervention, Complete the fatigue and sleep log on a daily basis and two visual analog scales (VAS) (diurnal fatigue and daytime sleepiness) within half an hour upon awakening, at 1200 hours, 1600 hours, 2000 hours, and within half an hour before going to bed</description>
