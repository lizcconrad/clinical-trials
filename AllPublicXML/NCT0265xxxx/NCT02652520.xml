  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for end stage renal diseases, increasing
      life expectancy and quality of life. Improvement in organ preservation is a critical issue in
      this context.

      This is a safety study evaluating the use of an oxygen carrier HEMO2Life® as an additive in
      organ preservation solution in kidney transplantation.

      Security of the use of HEMO2Life® will be analyzed by collecting all events within the first
      3 months in terms of :

        1. HEMO2Life® adverse effects

        2. graft safety

        3. recipient safety (any adverse event) Accountability search will be achieved for each of
           these events.

    <description>Results will be compared with patients from a case control group of grafts transplanted at the same time in the 4 transplant centers from the Spiesser group (Tours, Poitiers, Brest, Limoges). Groups will be formed after matching on sex, age and cold ischemia time thanks to the Astre database regrouping the data of all the transplant teams from the Spiesser group.</description>

    <description>The surgeon decides whether the local transplant kidney may be part of the study and whether it should be stored in static cold storage or machine perfusion. The transplant kidney will be perfused in situ before procurement with the Belzer UW® cold storage solution furnish by the BridgetoLife company. HEMO2Life® will then be added to preservation solution.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For Kidney :

        The first ten local kidneys in each participating centers that do not meet the exclusion
        criteria.

          -  Graft retrieved in an adult donor

          -  Graft from a deceased donor after brain death (DBD)

          -  Graft locally transplanted in one of the 6 kidney transplant centers participating in
             the study

          -  Graft stored in preservation solution containing HEMO2Life®

        For Patient :

        Patient who signed an inform consent form In case of patient unable to signed an inform
        consent form for patient under judicial protection (supervision, guardianship) the inform
        consent form will be obtain from the patient himself and from the
        supervisor/guardianshiper/parents, they will signed together the patient inform consent
        form.

        The probability of the inclusion of a patient unable to signed an inform consent form is
        low but we can't know the receiver before conditioning the graft.

        Patient &gt; 18 years old

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Graft from a living donor

          -  Graft from a donor after cardiovascular death (DCD)

          -  Graft dedicated to a multi-organ transplantation
