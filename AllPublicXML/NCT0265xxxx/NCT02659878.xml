      Pupose:

      Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare and not well-known complication of the subarachnoid
      hemorrhage.

      This form of heart failure, called as &quot;broke heart&quot; or &quot;apical ballooning syndrome&quot;, was
      first described by Japanese authors at the beginning of 1990's.

      1.5-2.2% of acute coronary syndrome is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Its predisposing factors,
      hypothetical parthenogenesis, diagnostic criteria and therapeutic methods are already known
      from the literature.

      The study intends to include all patients over 18 years of age who were admitted to our
      clinic within 48 hours after the bleeding regardless of gender, neurological status or age.

      Data to be registered within 24 hours after admittance:

      Instruments:

        -  Intracranial blood flow characteristics:TCCD - using Transcranial Color Doppler;
           systolic, diastolic and mean blood flow velocity, Systolic / Diastolic ratio,
           pulsatility index

        -  ECG abnormalities: Corrected QT Interval (QTc), T wave, ST segment, arrhythmia

        -  Echocardiography (Ejection fraction%, exact location and degree of cardiac wall motion
           abnormalities) - documented with video recording

      Hypothesis:

      The risk of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TS) is increased if SAH is associated with more severe
      state, a greater degree of bleeding, intraventricular and/ or intracerebral hemorrhage.

      The definitive care of patients is postponed due to the appearance of TS, which could affect
      the final outcome.

      Data to be registered within 24 hours after admittance:

        -  Age of the patient

        -  Gender

        -  Comorbidities

        -  Currently taken medications

        -  The exact time point of bleeding

        -  Additional circumstances of the bleeding

        -  Physical stress factors

        -  Psychological stress factors

        -  Significant blood pressure elevation, and its assumed reason

        -  Severity of bleeding:Fisher's Grade; Neurological status; Hunt-Hess scale;GCS (Glasgow
           Coma Scale)

        -  Intracranial blood flow characteristics:TCCD - using Transcranial Color Doppler;
           systolic, diastolic and mean blood flow velocity, Systolic / Diastolic ratio,
           pulsatility index

        -  Cardiac status:Chest pain, Shortness of breath, Pulmonary edema

        -  ECG abnormalities: Corrected QT Interval (QTc), T wave, ST segment, arrhythmia

        -  Enzyme level associated with myocardial tissue necrosis: Cardiac troponin I (cTnI),
           creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal prohormone of
           brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)

        -  The amount of urine collected in 24 hours and determination of urine metanephrine,
           normetanephrine levels

        -  Chest X-ray

        -  Echocardiography (Ejection fraction%, exact location and degree of cardiac wall motion
           abnormalities) - documented with video recording

        -  Medication: Nimodipine, simvastatin, keeping Mg levels in the normal range, ulcer
           prophylaxis, painkillers

        -  Fluid therapy: ensuring normovolaemia

      Data to be recorded during hospital stay:

        -  Localization of the bleeding (is there an aneurysm present, if yes what is its location,
           size)

        -  Is ventricular drain necessary?

        -  Treatment methods of the aneurysm:Endovascular, aneurysm clipping

        -  Time passed between bleeding and treatment (in hours)

      The following investigations are repeated daily:

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  Myocardial necrotic enzymes (checked daily over 1 week even if no ECG abnormalities are
           present) : cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, Brain natriuretic
           peptide (BNP), N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)

        -  In case of ECG abnormalities echocardiography should take place on the same day (with
           video recording)

        -  If there are no ECG abnormalities echocardiography should be controlled once within the
           first week (with video recording)

        -  Transcranial Color Doppler (TCCD)

        -  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

        -  Recording the currently used medicines with accurate doses (with special attention to
           the positive inotropic agents and drugs with vasoconstrictor properties)

        -  In case of mechanical ventilation:Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2), Positive end
           expiratory pressure (PEEP), Blood gas analysis (PaO 2, PaCO 2), Peak pressure (PPeak)

        -  Noting the presence of pulmonary edema (auscultation, blood gas analysis) If Takotsubo
           cardiomyopathy is diagnosed, the 24-hour urine collection test should be repeated
           (measure the quantity of collected urine, determine urine metanephrine and
           normetanephrine levels)

      The following diagnostic steps should be repeated after 1 month:

        -  Echocardiography

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  New York Heart Association scores (NYHA scores)

        -  Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) - survival index

        -  Bartel Index, Karnofsky score - index of life quality

        -  The amount of urine collected in 24 hours and determination of urine metanephrine,
           normetanephrine levels

      If echocardiography shows cardiac wall motion abnormality, cardiac examination should be
      carried out as the following:

        -  Cardiac stress test if necessary

        -  CT coronary angiogram if necessary

        -  Coronary angiography if necessary

      The following examinations should be carried out after 6 months:

        -  Echocardiography

        -  12-lead ECG

        -  New York Heart Association scores (NYHA scores)

        -  Glasgow outcome scale (GOS) - survival index

        -  Bartel Index

        -  The amount of urine collected in 24 hours and determination of urine metanephrine,
           normetanephrine levels

      Comments:

      The level of metanephrine and normetanephrine from 24-hour collected urine should be measured
      again after 1 and 6 months in case of patients where TS was diagnosed.

      The urine of patients who have no diagnosed TS will be solely collected and serve as a
      control. Only 15 of these urine samples will be randomly measured to metanephrine /
      normetanephrine.

      Patient's age, sex, comorbidities, medications, the exact time point of bleeding, the
      circumstances of bleeding neurological and cardiological status are recorded, laboratory
      tests, Transcranial Color Doppler (TCCD), echocardiography and chest X-ray examinations are
      carried out within 24 hours after the patient is being admitted to the ICU.

      The medication to prevent vasospasm (Nimodipine, Simvastatin, sustained physiological Mg
      level) and ulcers, just like the drugs to relief pain are the same in case of all patients.

      The goal of fluid therapy is to maintain normovolaemia. The location of the bleeding is
      recorded (is there any aneurysm, its size is measured; if ventricular drainage is necessary,
      the method that used to treat aneurysm: endovascular, clipping; time elapsed between bleeding
      and therapy) 12-lead ECG, cardiac enzymes, TCCD measurement, neurological state, medications
      and its doses, blood gas analysis in case of mechanical ventilation and ventilation
      parameters are carried out and recorded on a daily basis.

      Cardiac ultrasound and 12-lead ECG examinations are carried out, NYHA scores, clinical
      outcome (GOS), quality of life (Bartel Index) and Karnofsky scores are recorded after 1
      month.

      If echocardiography shows cardiac wall motion abnormality, cardiac examination should be
      carried out as following: cardiac stress test, coronary CT angiogram and coronary angiography
      if necessary.

      Echocardiography, 12-lead ECG examinations are repeated and NYHA scores, clinical outcome
      (GOS), quality of life (Bartel Index) and Karnofsky scores are recorded after 6 months.
