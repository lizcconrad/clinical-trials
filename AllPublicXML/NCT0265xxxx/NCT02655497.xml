  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of cognitive strategies in
      improving participation in daily activities within older adults who report subjective
      cognitive decline.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The planned project explores the effects of several interventions designed to promote
      independence in everyday life, with older adults who identify cognitive complaints. Evidence
      suggests that 25-50% of community dwelling older adults report cognitive difficulties, such
      as reduced memory or concentration, in the absence of any diagnosed condition. Cognitive
      skills are crucial to living independently. The investigators plan to examine two approaches
      in a randomized controlled trial. Based on our successful pilot study, the investigators
      hypothesize that this training which combines education on healthy lifestyles and problem
      solving training to address everyday life difficulties, will be effective in maximizing and
      maintaining independence of older adults.

    <description>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) is the primary outcome measure. All participants will identify five everyday life activities that they need to or want to do using the COPM. The primary outcome will be (a) the number of goals improved by two points.</description>

    <description>Cognitive training intervention. The intervention includes seven 2-hour group sessions interspersed with four individual 45-minute sessions for a total of 17 hours of intervention over an 8-week period. The experimental group will receive real-world strategy training, a cognitive strategy based approach that trains people to improve their level of independence on meaningful activities of daily life with which they are having difficulty.</description>
