  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate use of regorafenib in clinical practice in Hungary. The study
      should provide information about clinical characteristics of Hungarian regorafenib patients
      as well as information about safety and efficacy of regorafenib in Hungarian patients with
      metastatic colorectal cancer. This much needed data is required by the National Health
      Insurance Fund in order to accept regorafenib into the regular reimbursement system. This
      study is proposed to be based on patient data from the Hungarian National Health Insurance
      Fund's Database. Data to be analyzed includes patient demography and baseline tumor
      characteristics, overall survival, time to treatment failure, duration of treatment, average
      dose and dose modifications, and adverse events. Further, treatment costs will be estimated.
