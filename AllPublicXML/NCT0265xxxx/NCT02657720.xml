  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiration rate is a critical vital sign that provides early detection of respiratory
      compromise and patient distress. Continuous monitoring of respiration rate is performed in
      patients under different clinical conditions, including post-surgery or different respiratory
      diseases. Clinician observation, pulse oximetry, and capnography are used individually or in
      combination to monitor ventilation during sedation and on post-surgical patients. The
      American Society of Anesthesiologists mandates the monitoring of respiration by measuring end
      tidal carbon dioxide (RRetco2) during procedural sedation and anesthesia. Other techniques
      for respiration rate measurement include different technologies such as acoustic respiratory
      rate (RRa). The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy of RRetco2 and RRa under certain
      respiratory conditions.

    <measure>The influence of different breathing rates.on the accuracy of respiratory rates in breaths per minute as measured by the tested devices compared to the reference device.</measure>
    <time_frame>six months</time_frame>
    <description>Respiratory rate will be measured with the monitors Radical 7 device, Capnostream20p and PTAF2 (flow meter), the latter as a reference device and recorded in the following units: breaths per minute. Differences in accuracy as compared to the reference device and differences in percentage of time in which the device was accurate will be analyzed offline.</description>
