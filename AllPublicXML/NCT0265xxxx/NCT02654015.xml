      Objective: The primary objective of this multicenter single arm feasibility study is to
      provide an assessment of enrollment and follow up feasibility for this patient population
      being treated with the Apollo Minimally Invasive Surgical Treatment (MIES). Patients who do
      not qualify for the INVEST Feasibility Study will be referred to the INVEST Registry study.

      Study Design: This study will be a prospective, multi-centered trial that will enroll 50
      patients at up to 10 United States (US) centers.

      Patient Population: Patients with moderate-large volume (20-80 cc) supratentorial
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) who present within 24 hours of symptom onset. Enrolled
      patients will receive minimally invasive endoscopic evacuation with the Apollo system.

      Indication: : The Apollo system has been cleared for the controlled aspiration of soft tissue
      and/or fluid during endoscopically guided neurosurgery of the ventricular system or cerebrum.
      In the present study, the researchers propose to investigate the feasibility of studying this
      patient population for eventual implementation of efficacy trials.
