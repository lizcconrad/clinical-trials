    <textblock>
      Background: High blood pressure (BP) is the leading attributable risk for cardiovascular
      disease (CVD). In rural South Asia, hypertension remains to be a significant public health
      issue with sub-optimal rates of case finding and management. The goal of the full-scale study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of multicomponent primary care
      strategies on lowering blood pressure among adults with hypertension in rural communities in
      Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

      Methods/Design: The mixed-methods, stratified cluster randomized controlled trial

      Intervention: The multi-component interventions (MCI) is comprised of all the following five
      components: 1) home health education (HHE) by government community health workers (CHWs),
      plus 2) blood pressure (BP) monitoring and stepped-up referral to a trained general
      practitioner (GP) using a checklist, plus 3) training public and private providers in
      management of hypertension and using a checklist, plus 4) designating hypertension triage
      counter and hypertension care coordinators in government clinics, plus 5) a financing model
      to compensate for additional health services and provide subsides to low income individuals
      with poorly controlled hypertension.

      Usual care: Will comprise existing services in the community without any additional training.

      Participants: The trial will be conducted on 2550 individuals aged 40 years or older with
      hypertension (systolic BP ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic BP≥ 90 mm Hg, or on antihypertensive
      therapy) in 30 rural communities of Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Out of the 2550
      individuals, 420 with poorly controlled BP (Systolic BP≥160 mmHg or Diastolic BP≥100 mmHg)
      will be selected, 14 from each community, to investigate the effect of MCI on results from
      ambulatory BP monitoring.

      Qualitative component: Stakeholders including policymakers, district managers, and community
      health workers, GPs, hypertensive individuals and family members in the identified clusters
      will be surveyed.

      Outcome: The primary outcome will be change in systolic BP from baseline to follow-up at 24
      months post randomization. The cost effectiveness outcome is the incremental cost of MCI per
      unit reduction in BP over the two year time period and in terms of incremental cost per CVD
      DALYs averted.
