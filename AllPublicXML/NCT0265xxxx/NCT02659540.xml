    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter pilot Phase 1 study of the checkpoint antibodies
      ipilimumab and nivolumab in combination with radiotherapy (RT) in 18 subjects with
      unresectable stage IV melanoma. All subjects will receive concurrent ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) and
      nivolumab (1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for 4 doses, followed by nivolumab monotherapy (240 mg)
      every 2 weeks. Radiotherapy will be initiated after the first dose and before the second dose
      of immunotherapy.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic diagnosis of stage IV metastatic melanoma, with 1 melanoma lesion that can
             be safely irradiated in the opinion of the radiation oncologist (note: subjects with
             primary ocular and mucosal melanoma are permitted). Lesions may include, but are not
             limited to:

               -  Symptomatic lymphadenopathy

               -  Bothersome cutaneous disease

               -  Hepatic metastases

               -  Pulmonary metastases

          2. Excluding the lesion intended to undergo radiation, subjects must have at least 1
             unresectable, non-bony lesion that is measurable radio-graphically (based on RECIST
             1.1).

          3. Any number of prior therapies (including none). For subjects who have received prior
             systemic treatment with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4),
             Programmed death 1 (PD-1) and/or Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy, the last
             monoclonal antibody administration should be no less than 6 weeks prior to start of
             this protocol therapy and all prior side effects must have resolved to grade 1 or less
             by the time of the start of this protocol therapy.

          4. Subjects must have completed chemotherapy, targeted therapy, investigational therapy,
             other immunotherapy, prior radiotherapy, or major surgery (requiring general
             anesthesia) at least 28 days before administration of the first dose of study drug(s).
             Subjects undergoing minor surgical procedures and biopsies that do not require general
             anesthesia may begin receiving study therapy if sufficiently recovered as determined
             by the treating investigator. Clinically significant toxicity experienced during any
             prior therapy must be resolved or stabilized before the first dose of study drug(s).

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          6. Life expectancy ≥ 4 months.

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/μL

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × (&lt; 3 mg/dL for subjects with Gilbert's disease)

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit of Normal or creatinine clearance ≥ 40
                  mL/min (if using the Cockcroft-Gault formula below):

             Female Creatinine Clearance = [(140 - age in years) x weight in kg x 0.85] / [72 x
             serum creatinine in mg/dL] Male Creatinine Clearance = [(140 - age in years) x weight
             in kg x 1.00] / [72 x serum creatinine in mg/dL]

          8. Age ≥ 18 years.

          9. Able and willing to give valid written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             package inserts.

          2. Unresolved immune-related adverse events following prior biological therapy. Subjects
             with asymptomatic endocrinopathy may enroll.

          3. Active autoimmune disease or any condition requiring systemic treatment with either
             corticosteroids (&gt;10 mg daily of prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive
             medications within 14 days of study drug administration. Inhaled or topical steroids
             and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalents are permitted in
             the absence of active autoimmune disease.

          4. History of motor neuropathy considered to be of autoimmune origin (e.g.,
             Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis).

          5. Other active, concurrent malignancy that requires ongoing systemic treatment or
             interferes with radiographic assessment of melanoma response as determined by the
             investigator.

          6. Active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases. Subjects with brain metastases
             are eligible if metastases have been treated and there is no magnetic resonance
             imaging (MRI) evidence of progression for 4 weeks or more after treatment is complete
             and within 28 days prior to the first dose of nivolumab administration. There must
             also be no requirement for immunosuppressive doses of systemic corticosteroids (&gt; 10
             mg/day prednisone equivalents) for at least 2 weeks prior to study drug
             administration.

          7. Known immunodeficiency or HIV, Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C positivity. Antibody to
             Hepatitis B or C without evidence of active infection may be allowed.

          8. History of severe allergic reactions to any unknown allergens or any components of the
             study drugs.

          9. Other serious illnesses (e.g., serious infections requiring antibiotics, bleeding
             disorders).

         10. Requirement of radiotherapy to treat brain metastases or receipt of any non-study
             systemic therapy for cancer or any other experimental/investigational treatment.

         11. Mental impairment that may compromise the ability to give informed consent and comply
             with the requirements of the study.

         12. Lack of availability for immunological and clinical assessments or post-study
             follow-up contact to determine relapse and survival.

         13. Women who are breastfeeding or who are pregnant as evidenced by a positive serum
             pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) performed
             within 14 days of the first dose of study drug and by a urine pregnancy test (minimum
             sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of HCG) within 24 hours of the first dose of
             study drug(s).

         14. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use 2 methods of effective contraception.

         15. Any condition that, in the clinical judgment of the treating physician, is likely to
             prevent the subject from complying with any aspect of the protocol or that may put the
             subject at unacceptable risk.
