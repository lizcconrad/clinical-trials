  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a new therapy option for chronic wounds with yet unproven
      therapeutic efficacy. This randomised controlled trial aims to provide evidence of the
      efficacy of PRF as monotherapy as well as a growth promoting carrier matrix for antimicrobial
      compounds. The investigators therefore designed a four armed trial with three PRF arms which
      are compared to each other as well as to an active comparator. The treatment arms are as
      follows:

      Study arm 1: PRF with amikacin and teicoplanin Study arm 2: PRF with placebo (0.9% sodium
      chloride) Study arm 3: PRF with PHMB (polyhexanid) plus Macrogolol (Lavasorb®) Study arm 4:
      Acticoat 7® wound dressing as active control Patients with infected chronic wounds may be
      included in this trial. Infection shall be diagnosed by an experienced senior infectious
      diseases specialist. Patients with untreated peripheral vascular occlusive disease as defined
      by an ABI (ancle brachial index) of &lt; 0,7 are excluded from the trial as are patients with an
      uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or patients who have not received sufficient treatment for a
      diabetic foot syndrome. Any underlying illness will be treated following standard of care. In
      case of chronic venous insufficiency four-layered compression bandages will be applied each
      visit if tolerated by the patient. Alternatively compression stockings (Class III) are
      permitted. This is mentioned as &quot;Disease specific treatment&quot; in the protocol.

      Patients will receive treatment for 56 days. After 28 and 56 days the wound surface will be
      compared to the baseline. Infection parameters (c-reactive protein and leucocyte count) will
      be measured weekly. Evaluation of systemic antimicrobial therapy will be performed at each
      visit. Systemic antimicrobial therapy is started at the discretion of a senior infectious
      diseases specialist.
