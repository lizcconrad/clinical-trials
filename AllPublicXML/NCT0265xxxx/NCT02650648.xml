  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study. The purpose of this study is to see if it is safe and feasible to
      give the participant cyclophosphamide (a type of chemotherapy), natural killer (NK) cells,
      and an antibody called Hu3F8 as a treatment for neuroblastoma. NK cells are a type of white
      blood cell.

Very good partial response/remission (VGPR): &gt;90% decrease in all disease parameters, except bone scan unchanged or improved; bone marrow must be free of disease. Partial response/remission: &gt;50% decrease in all disease parameters, except bone scan unchanged or improved; no more than 1 positive bone marrow site. Mixed response: &gt;50% decrease in &gt;1 but not all disease markers. Stable disease: &lt;50% decrease in all tumor markers. Progressive disease: new lesion, or &gt;25 % increase in any disease marker.</description>

    <description>This is a phase I study to assess the safety and feasibility of combining HLA-mismatched (KIR ligand incompatible) NK cells with hu3F8 in high-risk NB patients. Following chemotherapy, patients will be treated in sequential groups with a minimum of 3 patients/ dose of NK cells. Three dose levels of NK cells, starting at dose level 1, will be evaluated in this treatment protocol. The goal dose for each dose level is the high boundary (e.g. 9.9x10^6/kg in level 1; 14.9x10^6/kg in level 2, etc), but a range is provided to allow for cases where the goal dose cannot be achieved.</description>

    <description>Day 0: NK cell infusion. NK cells are resuspended in Normasol at a concentration no less than 5 x 10^6cells/mL. The patient is pre-medicated as per standard cell product infusion. The cell product is infused through a central venous catheter. Patients will be evaluated clinically by vital signs pre- and approximately 30 minutes post infusion of NK cells and thereafter at approximately 1 hour intervals for 4 hours.</description>
