      The investigators aimed to investigate the vessel heterogeneity of Thrombolysis in Myocardial
      Infarction frame count (TFC) in the three coronary arteries, and its relation to P-wave
      dispersion, in patients with coronary slow flow and otherwise normal coronary arteries.

    <textblock>
      Coronary slow flow (CSF) phenomenon, which is characterized by delayed coronary opacification
      in the absence of obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease, is a relatively common
      finding in patients undergoing routine coronary angiography and is often associated with
      chest pain. In some patients with CSF, blood flow may be heterogeneously distributed in the
      three coronary arteries, suggesting the heterogeneously distributed microvascular dysfunction
      in the myocardium. However, the vessel heterogeneity of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction
      (TIMI) frame count (TFC) has not been fully elucidated.

      P-wave dispersion (PWD) is defined as the difference between the longest and the shortest
      P-wave duration recorded from multiple different surface electrocardiogram (ECG) leads, and
      it has been reported to be associated with inhomogeneous and discontinuous propagation of
      sinus impulses5, which are well known electrophysiologic characteristics of the atrium prone
      to fibrillation. Although it is plausible to hypothesize that PWD might be associated with
      the heterogeneously distributed microvascular dysfunction, and previous studies have
      demonstrated the abnormal PWD in patients with CSF, the correlation between TFC heterogeneity
      and PWD has never been evaluated.

      In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the vessel heterogeneity of TFC in the
      three coronary arteries, and its relation to PWD, in patients with CSF and otherwise normal
      coronary arteries.

    <measure>Average thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) frame count (TFC) in the three coronary arteries and its relation to P waves parameters on ECG in patients with CSF and otherwise normal coronary arteries</measure>
    <time_frame>24-72 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The first frame was defined as the frame in which concentrated dye occupies the full width of the proximal coronary artery lumen, touching both borders of the lumen, and indicates forward motion down the artery. The final frame counted is that in which the contrast first reaches the distal predefined landmark branch without the necessity for full opacification. The difference between maximum and minimum P wave duration (Pmax and Pmin) was calculated from the 12-lead ECG and defined as PWD.</description>

    <measure>maximum and minimum P wave duration (Pmax and Pmin) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in patients with CSF and otherwise normal coronary arteries</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours-30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as (1) death, (2) nonfatal myocardial infarction, or (3) target vessel revascularization. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed by a rise in the creatine kinase level to more than twice the upper normal limit with an increased creatine kinase-MB. Target lesion revascularization was defined as a repeat intervention (surgical or percutaneous) to treat a luminal stenosis within the stent or in the 5-mm distal or proximal segments adjacent to the stent. Target vessel revascularization was defined as a reintervention driven by any lesion located in the same epicardial vessel. Thrombotic stent occlusion was angiographically documented as a complete occlusion (TIMI flow 0 or 1) or a flow-limiting thrombus (TIMI flow 1 or 2) of a previously successfully treated artery.</description>

    <description>angiography or arteriography is a medical imaging technique used to visualize the inside, or lumen, of blood vessels and organs of the body, with particular interest in the arteries, veins, and the heart chambers. This is traditionally done by injecting a radio-opaque contrast agent into the blood vessel and imaging using X-ray based techniques such as fluoroscopy.</description>
