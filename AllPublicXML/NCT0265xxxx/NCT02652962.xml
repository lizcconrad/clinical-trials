      This is a cross-over within parallel design. Parallel groups will receive Gelesis200 either 2
      times or 3 times in one day before meals. Within the parallel groups, subjects will
      cross-over to 4 arms: A) Gelesis200 10 min before meals, B) Gelesis200 30 min before meals,
      C) Placebo 10 min before meals, D) Placebo 30 min before meals. Postprandial glucose, insulin
      and subjective appetite ratings will also be measured.

                  at the discretion of the Qualified Investigator.

               2. the absence of clinically significant history of neurological, endocrine,
                  cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematological, immunologic, psychiatric,
                  gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and metabolic disease, including, but not
                  limited to pancreatitis, hepatitis B or C, HIV, swallowing disorders, and
                  gastroesophageal reflux disease (at least 1 episode per week).

               3. the absence of clinically significant history of gastric or peptic ulcer, small
                  bowel resection (except if related to appendectomy), intestinal stricture (e.g.,
                  Crohn's disease), intestinal obstruction or high risk of intestinal obstruction
                  including suspected small bowel adhesions.

               4. the absence of clinically significant history or known presence of esophageal
                  anatomic abnormalities (e.g., webs, diverticuli, rings), gastroparesis, and
                  malabsorption.

               5. the absence of history of gastric bypass, any other gastric surgery and
                  intragastric balloon.

               6. the absence of history of angina, coronary bypass, and myocardial infarction
                  within 6 months prior to administration.

               7. the absence of history of abdominal radiation treatment.

               8. the absence of history of cancer within the past 5 years, except
                  adequately-treated localized basal cell skin cancer.

          3. Capable of consent.

          4. Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 90 and &lt;126 mg/dL (equivalent to ≥ 5.0 and &lt; 7.0 mmol/L) at
             screening.

        Notwithstanding the lower limit of 90 mg/dL (equivalent to 5.0 mmol/L), subjects with
        higher fasting plasma glucose will be prioritized, and efforts will be made to include
        subjects with fasting plasma glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL (equivalent to ≥ 5.6 mmol/L) in both
        cohorts.

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Any clinically significant abnormality or abnormal laboratory test results found
             during medical screening or positive test for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV found
             during medical screening.

          2. Positive urine drug screen at screening.

          3. History of allergic reactions to carboxymethylcellulose, citric acid, modified
             cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, maltodextrin, gelatin, titanium dioxide, or
             other related substances.

          4. Any reason which, in the opinion of the Qualified Investigator, would prevent the
             subject from participating in the study.

          5. Clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities or vital sign
             abnormalities (systolic blood pressure lower than 90 or over 140 mmHg, diastolic blood
             pressure lower than 50 or over 90 mmHg, or heart rate less than 50 or over 100 bpm) at
             screening.

          6. History of significant alcohol abuse within one year prior to screening or regular use
             of alcohol within six months prior to the screening visit (more than fourteen units of
             alcohol per week [1 unit = 150 mL of wine, 360 mL of beer, or 45 mL of 40% alcohol]).

          7. History of significant drug abuse within one year prior to screening or use of soft
             drugs (such as marijuana) within 3 months prior to the screening visit or hard drugs
             (such as cocaine, phencyclidine [PCP], and crack) within 1 year prior to screening.

          8. Participation in a clinical trial involving the administration of an investigational
             or marketed drug or device within 30 days (90 days for biologics) prior to the first
             administration or concomitant participation in an investigational study involving no
             drug or device.

                  supplements and herbal supplements) within 7 days prior to the first
                  administration, with the exception of the occasional use of acetaminophen (up to
                  2 g daily);

               3. a depot injection or an implant of any drug within 3 months prior to the first
                  administration.

         10. Donation of plasma within 7 days prior to the first administration. Donation or loss
             of blood (excluding volume drawn at screening) of 50 mL to 499 mL of blood within 30
             days, or more than 499 mL within 56 days prior to the first administration.

         13. Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.93 mmol/L).

         14. Serum triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL (≥ 5.65 mmol/L).
