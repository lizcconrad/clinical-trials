  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the improvement in nutritional status, especially
      in the level of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its relationship with changes in the
      circulating cytokine levels, after providing extra protein and energy contents to
      community-dwelling older adults at risk of undernutrition.

    <textblock>
      Sixty of aged over 65 years, living independently in the community for elderly people,
      nondiabetic subjects with serum prealbumin of under 30 mg/dL and BMI under 25 kg/m2 were
      recruited. The subjects were followed for a 2-week pre-intervention period, followed by an
      intervention period, which they received 2 cartons of liquid oral nutritional supplementation
      daily for 2 weeks.

    <description>In this study, the subjects served as their own controls. Subjects who were eligible based on inclusion criteria first entered into a 2-week pre-intervention period, during which they received nutrition counseling to keep their routine dietary habits. This was followed by an intervention period, during which an oral nutritional supplement was used over a period of 2 weeks.</description>
