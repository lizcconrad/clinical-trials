  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether skeletal muscle mitochondrial function is
      altered in patients with head and neck cancer compared to healthy controls.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      20 men and women, 30-60 years, equally divided between patients diagnosed with advanced
      (stages III or IV), persistent (recurrence within 6 months) or recurrent head and neck
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (n=10) and healthy age matched control subjects (n=10) will
      be studied.

      Muscle biopsies will be collected from cancer patients before and after a 4 week standard of
      care (SOC) treatment. Muscle biopsies from healthy control subjects will be collected at
      baseline only.

      Lean body mass and fat mass will be determined by a DEXA scan before and after 4 week SOC
      treatment (cancer patients) to document any change in body composition (cachexia), and at
      baseline only in the age-matched healthy controls.

      Blood will be collected from both cancer patients and healthy subjects to examine hormone
      levels at the time of biopsy.
