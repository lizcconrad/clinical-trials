      Study design In Phase I of this study, a large scale cross-sectional survey will be sent to
      3000 corporations in Hong Kong. The questionnaire will examine the employers' knowledge,
      attitudes and practices in promoting smoking cessation in the workplace.

      In Phase II, a longitudinal study will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      smoking cessation intervention offered by the Department of Psychology, the University of
      Hong Kong. A total of 600 smokers from corporations will be recruited and interviewed before
      the intervention at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and at 1-, 4-, 12-, 26- and
      52-week post-intervention follow-ups, in an attempt to evaluate their smoking behaviours,
      knowledge on smoking and satisfaction of the smoking cessation services. Self-reported
      quitters (did not smoke in the past 7 days) will be invited to participate in the
      bio-chemical validation by assessing their exhaled carbon monoxide level and the saliva
      cotinine level.

      Process evaluation: Qualitative interviews, including in-depth interviews and/or focus group
      will be conducted within 1 month after 12-month follow-up.
