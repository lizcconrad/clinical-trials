  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effects of client feedback, using the Patient Health Questionnaire
      - 9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale, on depression and anxiety in individuals
      undergoing brief psychotherapy. Client feedback allows therapists to monitor treatment
      progress in real time. Identifying an easily accessible treatment intervention, which
      utilizes commonly used scales, that potentially enhances the effect of brief psychotherapy
      and improves treatment outcomes is a valuable endeavor with clear implications for therapy
      practices. It is hypothesized that clients who complete these scales each session will show
      greater symptom improvement than clients who do not complete the scales.
