      The purpose of this study is to investigate if MOBIGAME (an innovative, mobile phone-based
      game application) is suitable to increase daily physical activity and physical activity
      adherence as well as health parameters such as cardiorespiratory fitness, leg strength,
      glucose metabolism, vascular health and self-determination as well as health related quality
      of life in the course of a 24-week intervention in comparison to the control group receiving
      one-time lifestyle counseling.

    <textblock>
      In recent years, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has grown into an emerging pandemic that is
      a key determinant of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries
      worldwide. The successful treatment and prevention of T2DM is one of the biggest future
      health care challenges and most important to manage the enormous socio-economic burden that
      is associated with T2DM and its various comorbidities. Physical inactivity is known to be one
      of the most important risk factors for the development of obesity and T2DM. In contrast,
      increases in physical activity (PA) and fitness can lower the T2DM incidence, improve the
      patient's glucose metabolism and reduce morbidity and (premature) mortality, independent of
      body mass index (BMI) or other risk factors. Despite the obvious benefits of regular PA in
      the treatment and prevention of T2DM, most activity-promoting programs targeting T2DM
      patients are seldom successful in the long term due to diminishing patient motivation. A
      novel approach to motivate those individuals that are the least likely to engage in regular
      PA to be more physically active and adhere to regular PA are active video games or
      &quot;exergames&quot; that combine PA and video gaming. However, existing exergames do not offer
      fitness-level adjusted, individualized workouts and are normally stationary and bound to a
      TV, thus not enabling PA anywhere and at any time. To address these shortcomings, the
      investigators used sports scientific expertise to develop a smartphone-based, mobile
      gardening simulation game application, specifically designed for middle-aged T2DM patients,
      to induce a healthier, more active lifestyle as part of a successful T2DM treatment and
      management.
