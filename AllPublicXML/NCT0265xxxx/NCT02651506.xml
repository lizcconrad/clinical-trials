  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of computed tomography (CT) screening has allowed for early detection of lung cancers
      as small as 5mm in diameter. Early stage cancers are highly curable with a reported survival
      of greater than 90% over 5 years after surgical resection. Before a patient can have surgery,
      a biopsy must be performed. One common method is a transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB). In
      this procedure, a CT-image is used to locate the area for biopsy. Once identified, the
      radiologist applies a local anesthetic and inserts an aspiration needle through the ribs, and
      into the lung tissue. The sampled lung tissue is then sent to pathology. Although this
      procedure has a diagnostic yield ranging between 70% and 85%, it is associated with serious
      complications such as pneumothorax, hemoptysis, infection, hemothorax, air embolism and there
      is about a 20% (range 9%-54%) incidence of pneumothorax, or air leak from the lung, requiring
      chest tube drainage. Additionally, about 5-15% of cases experience hemoptysis, or coughing
      blood, although significant life-threatening hemoptysis is only present in less than 1% of
      patients. When these complications occur, hospitalization as inpatients is required, with an
      average length of stay of 1-3 days.

      A new form of technology to localize and biopsy peripheral lung lesions is believed to
      significantly reduce the amount of complications that can occur during a biopsy. This
      technology is known as Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (ENB). ENB uses
      electromagnetic tracking and CT-generated virtual bronchoscopy to create a three-dimensional
      &quot;GPS map&quot; of the lung, guiding the surgeon directly to the tumor. The surgeon is then able to
      perform bronchoscopy and biopsy the tumor from inside the bronchus. A recent systematic
      review and meta-analysis of 15 trials reports a pneumothorax rate of 3.1%, with only 1.6% of
      patients requiring chest tube drainage. Initial studies demonstrate a slightly lower
      diagnostic yield for ENB as compared to TTNB; however, a systematic exploration of study
      heterogeneity reveal that lung nodules included in TTNB studies are larger than those
      included in the meta-analysis of ENB yield. The review further identified six variables
      associated with increased diagnostic yields for ENB, including &quot;combined use of an ultrasonic
      radial probe and catheter suctioning as a sampling technique&quot;. The superDimension® InReach™
      System was granted Health Canada approval on July 23, 2009.

      There have been no studies directly comparing ENB to TTNB, either retrospectively or
      prospectively. Initial systematic reviews demonstrate that ENB may have a slightly lower
      diagnostic yield relative to TTNB. Selection bias and low study quality may have resulted in
      an underestimation of the true diagnostic yield associated with ENB. The literature also
      confirms that ENB has a significantly better safety profile as compared to TTNB. As such, a
      prospective comparison between the two techniques is mandated. This Phase II pilot
      feasibility trial will utilize randomized methodology to gather the preliminary data that is
      required for the successful completion of a Phase III randomized controlled trial to compare
      lung biopsy with ENB verses TTNB. This study will also be the first time ENB lung biopsy is
      documented in Canada.

    <description>• Patients randomized to the control arm (TTNB) will undergo lung biopsy using standard transthoracic needle biopsy technique. The procedure will be performed under local anesthesia with computed tomography guidance by an interventional radiologist. In this procedure, a CT-image is used to locate the area for biopsy. Once identified, the radiologist applies a local anesthetic and inserts an aspiration needle between the ribs, through normal lung tissue, leading into the biopsy area. The sampled lung tissue is then sent for pathological analysis.</description>
