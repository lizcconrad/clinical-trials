  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver diseases are common and the two main causes in France are NAFLD (No Alcoholic
      Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease).

      Because of the importance of the current global obesity, NAFLD has become very common and it
      is estimated that its prevalence in the general population reaches 20-30%.

      NAFLD (No Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic) and ALD (alcoholic liver disease)
      includes a broad spectrum of liver damage, ranging from simple steatosis isolated
      (infiltration of fat in the liver), in hepatic inflammation, fibrosis (abnormally high
      accumulation of extracellular components in the functional liver tissue) and finally
      cirrhosis and its complications.

      Choline deficiency (essential nutrient generally classified as Class B vitamins) has been
      associated with liver damage each characterizing NAFLD and ALD. The amount of choline in the
      body depends in particular on food intake and degradation of choline by the intestinal
      microbiota.

      NAFLD and ALD are complex pathologies resulting from the interaction of environmental /
      nutritional factors and a genetic background. It therefore appears now necessary to study the
      influence of the relationship between genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and gut
      microbiota metabolism of choline on the severity of liver injury observed in NAFLD and ALD.

      If the interaction of these three elements (the host genetics - environmental factors - and
      intestinal microbiota metabolic choline) has an influence on the severity of the lesions of
      NAFLD and ALD direct application may be of bring a food supplement choline in patients at
      risk (mutation of the PEMT gene (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase),
      postmenopausal women, microbiota profile for increased degradation of dietary choline) to
      restore the amount of choline in the body and thus to avoid a worsening of the ALD or NAFLD
      and progression to cirrhosis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  NAFLD (No alcoholic liver disease) and / or ALD (alcoholic liver disease)

          -  Liver biopsy scheduled

          -  NAFLD is defined by the presence of hepatic steatosis (ultrasound or retrospectively
             confirmed histologically) without concomitant treatment responsible for steatosis
             (corticosteroids, amiodarone, methotrexate, tamoxifen) without risk drinking of
             alcoholic beverages (&gt; 210 g / week in men or&gt; 140 g / week in women), and no other
             cause of chronic liver disease.

          -  ALD will be defined by the presence of chronic liver disease in a patient with a risk
             of alcohol consumption (&gt; 210 g / week in men or&gt; 140 g / week in women).

          -  Obtaining the opposition not to participate in the study

          -  Obtaining the signature of consent on the collection of biological samples of each
             participating centers

          -  Affiliation to the social security system

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cause concomitant chronic liver disease other than NAFLD or ALD

          -  concomitant treatment responsible for steatosis (steroids, amiodarone, methotrexate,
             tamoxifen)

          -  Previous history of bariatric surgery

          -  Antibiotic treatment in the two months prior to inclusion

          -  Refusal to participate and / or Non-obtaining consent for collection of biological
             samples

          -  Pregnant woman, parturient or nursing mothers. The absence of pregnancy will be
             provided on condition of effective contraception or after control negativity
             biological markers of pregnancy (b-HCG)

          -  Minor Person

          -  Major Persons subject to enhanced protection, deprived of their liberty by judicial or
             administrative decision, without consent hospitalized or admitted to a health or
             social establishment for purposes other than research
