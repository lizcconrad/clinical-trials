      A study to determine the safety of CSC/ HTS-based combination drug therapy in subjects who
      have GBM that has recurred or progressed following prior radiation therapy and TMZ.

      This protocol describes a prospective single-center Phase 0/1 open-label study to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of a high-throughput drug sensitivity assay to predict targeted
      therapies for patients who have GBM that has recurred or progressed following prior radiation
      therapy and TMZ. The underlying hypothesis is that treatment of patients with up to 3 lead
      candidates identified from individualized CSC/ HTS assays will safely (1) delay disease
      progression, and (2) increase survival. There is an abundance of literature strongly
      supporting the importance of a regimen for targeting CSCs and preventing tumor recurrence, as
      an additional strategy to improve the overall prognosis of cancer patients.

    <description>A Drug Combination Treatment will be determined through High Throughput Screening. The classes of drugs this combination therapy will be comprised from are:
Antineoplastic Anti-infective Antiemetic Antihyperlipidemic Anti-inflammatory Antihistamine Antihypertensive Antidepressant Cardiotonic Alcohol antagonist Diuretic Antipsychotic NMDA receptor antagonist Antidiabetic Immunosuppressant Anticonvulsant Antimethemoglobinemic Sclerosing agent</description>

    <intervention_name>Combination Drug Therapy</intervention_name>
    <description>Up to 3 of 73 possible interventions from the drug classes listed below will be selected based on their potency against CSCs, potential for synergy without cross-reactive toxicities, drug safety profiles, pharmacokinetics, and drug-drug interactions. Those patients that have GBM that has recurred (as defined by RANO (45)), and for whom HTS was successfully completed, will be eligible to continue to the treatment component of the study to receive the drug cocktail comprised from the following drug classes:
Antineoplastic Anti-infective Antiemetic Antihyperlipidemic Anti-inflammatory Antihistamine Antihypertensive Antidepressant Cardiotonic Alcohol antagonist Diuretic Antipsychotic NMDA receptor antagonist Antidiabetic Immunosuppressant Anticonvulsant Antimethemoglobinemic Sclerosing agent</description>
