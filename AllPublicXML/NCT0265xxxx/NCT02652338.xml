  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study, which was carried out in two parallel groups, is testing the
      efficacy of a specific micronutrients combination in adults with heart rhythm disturbances
      and accompanying symptoms.

      It is therefore the investigators hypothesis that daily oral administration of the specific
      micronutrients combination will lead to a decrease of symptoms awareness and to a reduction
      of heart rhythm disturbances in adults with or without structural heart disease. The
      principal endpoints will be a decrease in the total score of symptoms awareness.
