  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no consensus about the best treatment for patients with displaced complete articular
      distal radius fractures (AO type C fractures). Despite this lack of consensus and the lack of
      available literature on comparative data to guide treatment for this patient population,
      operative treatment with plate fixation has gained popularity. The aim of this study is to
      compare the functional outcome of open reduction and plate fixation with closed reduction and
      plaster immobilisation in adult patients (18-75 years) with displaced complete articular
      distal radius fractures.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures account for 17% of all fractures diagnosed. Two third of those
      fractures are displaced and need to be reduced.

      According to the Dutch National Guidelines, displaced distal radius fractures, after adequate
      reduction confirmed on X-ray, are best treated nonoperatively with cast immobilization.
      Moreover, the AAOS Clinical Practice Guideline only suggest surgical fixation when the
      articular step, after reduction, exceeds 2mm. However, both recommendations are based on
      studies who did not differentiate between intra- and extra-articular distal radius fractures.
      So, no clear consensus about the best treatment for patients with displaced intra-articular
      distal radius fractures can be made. Despite this lack of consensus and the lack of available
      literature on comparative data to guide treatment for this patient population, a rise in use
      of volar plating has been observed.

      The goal of open reduction and plate fixation is to restore articular congruity and axial
      alignment, and to enable early post-operative movement. Several studies show good
      radiological and functional results using the volar locking plate in unstable displaced
      distal radius fractures.

      No studies have been carried out to assess whether operative treatment with plate fixation is
      superior in displaced complete articular distal radius fractures to nonoperative treatment in
      patients with these fracture type. Therefore, with this randomized controlled trial the
      investigators wish to determine the difference in functional outcome, assessed with the
      Patient Related Wrist Evaluation (PRWE), after open reduction and plate fixation compared to
      nonoperative treatment with closed reduction and cast immobilization.

    <description>Quality of Life assessed using the Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire. The SF-36 is a validated multipurpose, short form health survey which contains 36 questions representing eight different health domains. These domains are combined into a mental and physical component scale. From each domain, scores ranging from 0 to 100 points are derived, with lower scores indicating poorer quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>1, 3 and 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Radiographs will be performed to ensure that loss of reduction has not occurred. Loss of reduction is defined as &lt;15° radial inclination, &gt;15° of dorsal angulation or &gt;20° of volar angulation, &gt;3 mm shortening of ulnar variance or &gt;2 mm of articular step-off or gap. Radial inclination, volar/dorsal tilt, ulnar variance and radial length will be measured digitally in the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) on standard posterior anterior (PA), lateral carporadial and lateral X-rays of the wrist. If loss of reduction occured, operative treatment will be considered, but will be at discretion of the treating surgeon.</description>

    <description>The control group will be treated with closed reduction and cast immobilization. This will take place under local anaesthesia by means of a haematoma block with 20 cc Lidocaine 1%. Closed reduction will be preferably performed according to the Robert-Jones method. This involves increasing the deformity first, then applying continuous traction and immobilizing wrist and hand in the reduced position. Additional radiographs will be performed to verify the success of the reduction. After this has been confirmed, the wrist will be immobilized initially in a split plaster and later changed into a circular cast for five to six weeks immobilization in total.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The surgery will be performed by a certified trauma surgeon. According to the current standard treatment protocol, antibiotic prophylaxis will be administered thirty minutes preoperatively. The distal radius will be approached according to Henry, which beholds an incision between the tendon of the flexor carpi radialis muscle and the radial artery. After the fracture site is exposed, the fracture will be reduced and provisionally fixed under fluoroscopy with K-Wires/reduction forceps. An appropriate volar locking plate which best suits the anatomy of the wrist and the fracture type will be selected. Fracture reduction and screw placement will be confirmed by radiographic images. Additionally, fixation can be supported by a dorsal plate or radial column plate. This will be at discretion of the surgeon and depends on the fracture configuration and the position of the fragments. Wound closure will be performed at the discretion of the surgeon using standard techniques.</description>
