      Patients will be randomized to receive either real or sham-tDCS as well as anti-depressant
      drugs. tDCS will be applied over the left (anode) and right (cathode) dorsolateral prefrontal
      cortex (DLPFC). Patients will visit the hospital to get tDCS administrations 5 days a week
      for 2 weeks. They will be evaluated every 2 weeks.
