      The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the effectiveness of GS010, a gene therapy, in
      improving the visual outcome in patients with LHON due to the G11778A ND4 mitochondrial
      mutation when vision loss is present for six months or less.

The subjects' LogMAR scores, which are derived from the number of letters they read on the ETDRS chart, will be used for statistical analysis purposes. The change from baseline in each eye will be the primary response of interest.</description>

    <measure>Better-Seeing Eye Comparison</measure>
    <time_frame>48 and 96 weeks after GS010/sham injection</time_frame>
    <description>The better seeing-eye of each patient will be determined at visit 1, prior to randomization. A pre-determined algorithm of criteria in a hierarchy will be used to determine the better seeing-eye based on vision testing results (e.g. visual acuity, SD-OCT, contrast sensitivity). A minimization method will be employed in the randomization process to ensure, as best as possible, an even distribution of better seeing-eyes to receipt of GS010 and sham. Better-seeing eyes that received GS010 will be compared to better-seeing eyes that received sham. A similar analysis will be done for worse-seeing eyes.</description>
