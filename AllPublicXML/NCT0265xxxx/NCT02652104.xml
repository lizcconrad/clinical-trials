      This study reviews the outcome of deep brain stimulation treated patients in Helsinki and
      Uusimaa University Hospital between 2006 and 2014. The aim of the study is to investigate the
      outcome and possible side effects of deep brain stimulation treatment.

      Deep brain stimulation is a FDA approved method in treating patients with advanced
      Parkinson's disease when the best medical treatment is insufficient. In this study the aim is
      to investigate the outcome of deep brain stimulation treated patients in Helsinki and Uusimaa
      University hospital between 2006 and 2014. This study is a retrospective study based on
      existing patients' medical records and does not include an intervention in the treatment of
      an individual patient.

      Deep brain stimulation carries the risks of major surgery. A complication risk for a
      hemorrhage is 1-2 % and for an infection is 3-10%. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
      complications that have occurred and the possible benefit of deep brain stimulation in deep
      brain stimulation treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

      The gathered data will be processed anonymously and an individual patient cannot be
      identified. The data will be processed with an appropriate statistical program (SPSS). No
      data will be given to external parties.

          -  The normal exclusion criteria for deep brain stimulation which are dementia, a
             significant vascular atrophy seen in brain CAT scan or MRI, Parkinson's disease with
             non-levodopa response with less than 30 % improvement in levodopa challenge test,
