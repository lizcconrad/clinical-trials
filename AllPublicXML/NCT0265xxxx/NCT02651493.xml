  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators propose a novel method to detect Down syndrome using
      photography for facial dysmorphology, a tool called computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). After
      validating the method, this technology will be expanded to perform similar functions to
      assist in the detection of other dysmorphic syndromes.

      By using photography and image analysis this automated assessment tool would have the
      potential to improve the diagnosis rate and allow for remote, non-invasive diagnostic
      evaluation for dysmorphologists in a timely manner.

      In this study, investigators propose a novel method to detect Down syndrome using photography
      for facial dysmorphology, a tool called computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) . Local texture
      features based on Contourlet transform and local binary pattern are investigated to represent
      the facial characteristics. A support vector machine classifier is then used to discriminate
      between normal and abnormal cases. Accuracy, precision and recall are used to evaluate the
      method. After validating the method, this technology will then be expanded to perform similar
      functions to assist in the detection of other dysmorphic syndromes.
