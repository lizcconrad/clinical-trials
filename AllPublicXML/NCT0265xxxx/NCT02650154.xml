  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the emergency department (ED), ketamine is a popular anesthetic agent during sedation of
      children for painful and other short procedures. Sedation for procedures is more commonly
      used in children than adults, to achieve motion control and cooperation. In children,
      ketamine offers an ideal choice due to the fact that it is short acting, a highly effective
      sedative, and preserves cardio-respiratory stability. In the United States, more than one
      million children per year up to four years of age undergo short procedures requiring
      anesthestic agents, including ketamine. However, there is mounting concern from animal
      studies and retrospective human research regarding the safety of ketamine when administered
      to infants and young children with respect to its potential toxic effects on the developing .
      Conversely, ketamine has also been suggested as a neuroprotective agent. Prompt investigation
      and resolution of this issue is urgently required.

      The objectives of this study are:

      Primary Objective: In otherwise healthy children between 3 and 48 months of age who present
      to a tertiary care emergency department and receive procedural sedation with ketamine, to
      determine if there is at least a 50% increase, compared to baseline in the serum
      concentration of any of the neurotoxicity biomarkers S100B, glial fibrillary acidic protein
      (GFAP) or neuronal-specific enolase (NSE), 1 to 3 hours after intravenous ketamine
      administration. The cut-off of 50% is a benchmark value routinely quoted in both animal and
      human studies, which correlated neurotoxicity biomarker levels with functional outcomes.

      Secondary Objectives: In the aforementioned population:

        1. To determine if at least a 50% increase in the serum concentration of S100B, GFAP or NSE
           compared to baseline at 6 to 12 hours after intravenous ketamine administration.

        2. To explore if genotypes relevant to ketamine metabolism and disposition are associated
           with increased vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of ketamine.

        3. To determine the toxic effect of ketamine administration at the cellular level (evidence
           of sustainable cellular damage and mitochondrial DNA changes).

Isolated lymphocytes from pre- and post-ketamine exposure blood samples from each patient will be split into two pools analysed for changes to mitochondrial content and mtDNA damage. The first pool will be stained with mitochondrial membrane potential-specific dye (TMRM) and imaged to reveal changes in mitochondrial morphology and function. DNA will be isolated from the second pool and probed for both cellular mitochondrial content and mtDNA damage using quantitative PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. All children between the ages of 3 and 48 months who receive intravenous ketamine for
        procedural sedation in the ED during study enrolment hours will be eligible for
        recruitment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Children with contraindications to procedural sedation in the ED according to SickKids
             (the Hospital for Sick Children) practice guidelines or to ketamine administration
             will not be considered.

          2. Parents with an insurmountable language barrier (i.e. does not speak English and are
             not accompanied by another adult who cannot translate for the parent/caregiver), which
             prevents informed consent.

          3. Child who has received procedural sedation/ or surgery under general anesthesia in the
             past 30 days.

          4. A child who has received any central nervous system drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants,
             benzodiazepines) or a known neurotoxic drug (e.g., methotrexate, corticosteroids)
             concomitantly or in the 30 days preceding the sedation.

          5. A child who has suffered traumatic head injury concomitantly or in the previous 30
             days

          6. A child who has CNS (Central Nervous System) illnesses or pathologies (e.g.,
             meningitis, near drowning, hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, seizure disorder) in the 30
             days prior to sedation, potentially leading to elevated baseline serum biomarkers.

          7. A child whose parents are considered to be in emotional distress due to the injury or
             illness of the child by the attending ED physician or where the attending ED physician
             does not believe it is appropriate to ask the parents for consent.
