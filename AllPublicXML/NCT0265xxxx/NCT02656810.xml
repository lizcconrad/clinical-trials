  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of two
      teriparatide products, PF708 and Forteo, in healthy subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-masked, randomized, two-treatment cross-over study in healthy adult
      subjects. Half of the subjects will be randomized to receive PF708 first and Forteo second
      (Sequence A), and the other half will be randomized to receive the drugs in reverse sequence
      (Sequence B),
