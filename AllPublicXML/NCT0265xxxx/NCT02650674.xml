      This study aimed at determining the Glycaemic Index and Insulinaemic Index Values of Five
      Cereal Products in two different ethnic groups. It is a laboratory-based research study,
      conducted in two different ethnic groups, with an open cross-over design, including 24
      healthy non-smoking voluntary subjects, aged from 18 to 45 years. 12 subjects will be
      Caucasian and 12 subjects will be Asian. 8 test sessions per subject are included in the
      study. Foods are consumed in a random order according to a randomisation list. The impact of
      the ethnic group and the products will be determined.
