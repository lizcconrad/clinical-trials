  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In France, about 1 million people 65 and older are diagnosed with dementia syndrome
      characterized by cognitive decline and impairment of functional capacity. The assessment of
      the level of functional autonomy is therefore an essential step in monitoring patients in
      Memory Clinic and can be estimated by the Lawton IADL questionnaire, assessing the patients'
      ability to perform daily tasks.

      In the Memory Clinic, the first estimate of the level of patient autonomy is achieved during
      a face-to-face interview between their primary caregiver and a nurse, using the IADL
      questionnaire. This assessment should be renewed every year. The IADL questionnaire is part
      of the information that the memories consultations shall transmit to the Alzheimer's National
      Bank (BNA).

      However, current practice has shown that the systematic collection is problematic in the
      organization of Memory Clinic. It is thus expected to collect this questionnaire by phone in
      order to measure changes in the level of autonomy during the disease, and improve the
      completeness of this collection. A study is conducted with the main objective to measure the
      reliability of the assessment of IADL questionnaires conducted during a telephone interview
      with the caregiver of the patient, in comparison to the reference mode: the face-to-face
      interview with the caregiver.

      Materials and methods The experimental design of the study will be a randomized crossover
      trial (crossover), including 394 patients divided into two branches. In the first part, the
      collection of the IADL questionnaire will be performed according to the reference method in
      the consultation (face-to-face interview with the nurse), the measurement will be repeated at
      1 month intervals by phone. In the second part the sequence of execution modes will be
      reversed. The reliability of the measurement of the level of autonomy will be studied by
      comparing repeated measurements based on handover modes. The correspondence between the
      repeated measures will also be considered in terms of patient characteristics. The
      feasibility of administration of the questionnaire by phone mode will be evaluated.

      Expected results The mode of administration by phone should allow to obtain a reliable
      measurement of the level of patient autonomy when the administration is carried out in a
      standardized way. The study should also identify patients and situations for which this
      method of administration by phone may be appropriate.

    <description>The degree of agreement (concordance) of the overall level of autonomy will be measured between the two modes administration of the IADL questionnaire.
The level of independence (or dependence) will be evaluated from the scale of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL Lawton). From 8 issues, it allows to study the ability of the person to perform common activities: Ability to use the phone to go shopping, preparing food, do its housekeeping, to its activities bleaching, to use the means of transport, to ensure accountability in respect of salary and handle money.</description>

    <description>To assess the reliability of the collection of the questionnaire by phone (agreement answers to each question on the IADL), the secondary endpoint will be considered:
- The consistency of the answers to each question of the IADL questionnaires between the two methods of administration: during the face-to-face interview, and by phone.</description>

    <description>The administration of IADL questionnaire by phone consists of a collection of answers given by the caregiver during the interview with the research nurse, trained for this procedure. This method of procurement will be standardized with a listing support for the phone interview to obtain the same conditions for collection of data from a caregiver to another. Questions will be asked in the same order than the questionnaire collected with the reference procedure i.e. face-to-face interview at the Memory Clinic. The IADL questionnaires in paper format used during the ace-to-face interview and by phone will be identical.</description>
