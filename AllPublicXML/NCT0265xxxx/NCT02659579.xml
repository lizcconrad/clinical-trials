      The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of a parent-child shared reading
      intervention run by The Reader Organisation. The investigators will be asking parents and
      children across Liverpool to either (i) attend a weekly shared reading programme or (b) to
      attend a weekly children's reading group at a library. The investigators will look at how the
      reading groups affect children's language development, by comparing children's language
      development before having gone to these groups and after they have attended these groups.

      This is a Randomised Control Trial to test whether The Reader Organisation's Shared Reading
      Programme is more effective at improving the language development of children than a free
      library reading group. Intervention group: Fifty parents of children (3 to 4-years of age)
      will be recruited to take part in a 8 weeks long shared reading programme. The shared reading
      programme is comprised of two different modules: a) 'Magical Storytimes', in which a
      collection of shared book reading sessions are led by a project worker and b) 'Stories for
      You and Yours', in which parents will be taught how to choose books and read interactively
      with their child. Control group: Fifty further families, matched for age and background will
      be recruited to a reading control group and asked to attend a weekly shared reading group at
      a library where parents/children will read in a shared pre-school library reading group,
      coordinated by a group facilitator. Location: The Shared Reading Programme will take place in
      the child's nursery (in nurseries across Liverpool). Control group parents and children will
      attend a weekly reading group at a library. All standardised tests, for all children, will
      take place in the child's nursery. Language gains from pre- to post- intervention will be
      measured.

    <measure>Change in baseline language skills: British Picture Vocabulary Scale: Third edition</measure>

    <description>The British Picture Vocabulary Scale: Third edition (BPVS3) will be administered to children baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months after intervention. The BPVS3 assesses a child's receptive vocabulary; for each question, the researcher says a word and the child responds by selecting a picture from four options that best illustrates the word's meaning.</description>

    <measure>Change in baseline language skills: Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - Preschool 2 UK.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4 weeks after intervention and 6 months after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals - Preschool 2 UK (CELF Preschool-2) will be administered to children at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks after intervention.The CELF Preschool-2 is a published measure of linguistic knowledge of individual children which measures a broad range of language skills in young children. Specifically, we will use three subset tests from the CELF Preschool-2. The &quot;sentence structure&quot; subset will measure the children's understanding of simple and complex sentence structures. A sentence is read to the child and the child chooses, from a set of pictures, which picture ''goes with'' that sentence.The &quot;word structure&quot; subset measures the children's understanding of simple and complex word structures. A sentence is read about a particular picture and the child is asked to finish the sentence.The &quot;expressive vocabulary&quot; subset evaluate a child's ability to label pictures of people, objects, and actions.</description>

    <measure>Parent Child Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Parent Child Questionnaire contains 78 items and assesses: satisfaction with parenting, parent's interaction with and knowledge of his or her child, parent's perception of how he/she communicates with a child, parents' experience of disciplining their child, parent's ability to promote a child's independence and parents' attitudes about gender roles in parenting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Questionnaire records relevant demographic information (e.g. socio-economic status, parents' education, family language use, ethnicity, children's medical history) that was devised for the Economic Social Research Council funded United Kingdom Communicative Development Inventory study. This allows us to create a composite individual socio-economic background variable using maternal education and household income in order to identify high and low socio-economic status families and to confirm that the participant children are typically developing monolinguals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family Reading Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Reading Questionnaire examines frequency of storybook reading, reading requests and child library visits, number of books and children's books in the home, parental reading habits, reading onset, and frequency of parent teaching behaviours about reading, such as teaching about print knowledge (e.g. how often do you teach your child how to print words/read words?) questions about book choice (e.g. books read in the last week, child's favourite book).</description>

    <measure>Children's Title Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Children's Title Checklist indirectly measure a child's storybook exposure by assessing the parent's knowledge of children's book titles (Children's Title Checklist). The Children's Title Checklist consists of 40 titles of popular children's books and 20 foils.</description>

    <description>The Children's Author Checklist indirectly measures a child's storybook exposure by assessing the parent's knowledge of authors. The Children's Author Checklist consists of 40 names of authors of popular children's books and 20 foils.</description>

    <measure>Leuven Scale during Dyadic Videoed Book-Reading Sessions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Leuven scale will be used to assess the child's active engagement during videoed dyadic book-reading sessions. There are 5 levels of engagements: extremely low (e.g. the child shows hardly any activity), low (e.g. the child shows some degree of activity which is often interrupted), moderate (e.g. the child is busy the whole time, but without real concentration), high (e.g. there are clear signs of involvement, but these are not always present to their full extent) and extremely high (e.g. during the observation of learning the child is continually engaged in the activity and completely absorbed in it).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        All families will be included unless they fit the exclusion criteria below.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        This is a study of typically developing English-learning children. The following exclusion
        criteria are designed to exclude families in which the target child is at risk of atypical
        or delayed language acquisition:

          -  Children born before 37 weeks gestation (premature)

          -  Children who weighed less than 5lb 9oz at birth (low birth weight)

          -  Children who have had an ear infection/glue ear for longer than 3 months, 4-6 ear
             infections within a 6 month period or another identified hearing problem (e.g. at
             newborn hearing screening)

          -  Children with an identified developmental disability (e.g. Cerebral Palsy, Autism
             Spectrum Disorder, Fragile X syndrome, Muscular dystrophy, Di George syndrome, Down's
             syndrome, Williams syndrome)

          -  Children with a hearing or visual impairment

          -  Children who hear another language (not English) for 1 day or more in a typical week
             (please note that this also excludes children of parents who do not speak English)

          -  Children whose parents have a learning disability which puts their children at risk of
             language delay and excludes the parents from giving informed consent on their own and
             on their children's behalf.
