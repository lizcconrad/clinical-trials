      The Soberlink Cellular device, in its original packaging, along with the QuickStart guide
      will be provided to the end user in a simulated home use environment or by Rx in clinic. The
      patient labeling will be in the format intended for distribution.

      Ten (10) Rx subjects will be provided instruction for use in clinic for the Soberlink
      Cellular device while an additional ten (10) Rx subjects will be provided instruction for use
      in clinic for the Soberlink Cellular device and Sober Sky web portal. An additional ten (10)
      simulated home use subjects will be provided instruction for use for the Soberlink Cellular
      device while an additional ten (10) simulated home use subjects will be provided instruction
      for use in clinic for the Soberlink Cellular device and Sober Sky web portal. All subjects
      will be provided with a post-test questionnaire on how to operate the device.

      The post-test questionnaire will collect information regarding device use. The device's use
      will be compared with identified risks to determine if the percentage of failures is within
      the study protocol success criteria. Additionally, measurable usability criteria for
      specific, critical steps will be evaluated.

      Forty (40) subjects identified as potential end users of the device will be recruited to the
      study and screened according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects will be
      asked to sign informed consent. The Soberlink Cellular device, in its original packaging,
      along with the QuickStart guide will be provided to the patient in a simulated home-use
      environment and Rx clinical setting. The patient labeling will be in the format intended for
      distribution.

      Ten (10) Rx subjects will be provided instruction for use in clinic for the Soberlink

    <description>Using the device with the Quick Start Guide, all 40 subjects tested are expected to be able to complete device related tasks, including starting the application, operating the Soberlink Cellular device and obtaining a breath reading and recording the results, in a timeframe of up to 30 minutes and with minimal attempts to ask for assistance; and using the device and the Quick Start Guide. Considering that the Soberlink Cellular device is a low risk device, and the probability of an occurrence and the severity of a failure are low, a success rate of 100% potential end user subjects passing may be considered acceptable for the over the counter use of the device. Any failures to complete the device related tasks and/or self-exclude from use of the device must be explained.</description>
