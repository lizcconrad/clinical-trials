      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if certain characteristics of DNA (the
      genetic material in cells) affects how ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
      carcinomas respond to therapy with AZD1775. Researchers also want to learn if treatment with
      AZD1775 affects the DNA in cancer cells.

      Study Drug Administration:

      A study cycle is 28 days.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin taking AZD1775 on
      the day of your laparoscopy. You will first take AZD1775 tablets 2 times each day on Days
      1-3. Depending on when your tumor reduction surgery is scheduled, you may continue taking the
      study drug on Days 8-10, 15-17, and 22-24. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      Before every time you take AZD1775 tablets, you will take ondansetron (Zofran). Before your
      first dose of AZD1775 each week, you will take dexamethasone. You may also receive
      dexamethasone before additional doses of AZD1775. Ondansetron and dexamethasone are standard
      drugs given to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the study staff for
      information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Your daily doses of AZD1775 should be taken about 12 hours apart, about 2 hours before or
      after eating. If you vomit after taking your dose of AZD1775, you should not retake the dose.
      Wait until your next scheduled dose.

      Your first dose of AZD1775 on Day 1 should be taken at least 1 hour after your laparoscopy.
      The second dose of that day may be skipped if the first dose cannot be taken until after 12
      PM.

      You will need to record when you take each dose in a study drug diary. The study staff will
      give you the study drug diary and show you how to fill it out.

      You will stop taking AZD1775 tablets about 1-4 days before your tumor reduction surgery.
      After you have recovered from surgery (about 3-6 weeks later), you will receive standard
      chemotherapy treatment. The chemotherapy is part of your standard of care treatment and is
      not part of this research study. The type of chemotherapy you receive will be up to your
      doctor.

      Study Visits:

      On the day of your laparoscopy:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  Tumor tissue will be collected during your laparoscopy procedure for biomarker and
           genetic testing. All samples will be stored at the MD Anderson Gynecologic Oncology
           Tumor Bank for an unlimited amount of time for testing related to this study. Your
           samples will be given a code number. No identifying information will be directly linked
           to your samples. Only the researcher in charge of the bank will have access to the code
           numbers and be able to link the samples to you. This is to allow medical data related to
           the samples to be updated as needed.

      While you are taking the AZD1775, you will have weekly visits. At each visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

      If you do not have tumor reduction surgery, you will stop having study visits after your last
      dose of AZD1775 and continue on to the follow-up part of the study (described below). If you
      do go on to have tumor reduction surgery, you will have the below study visits.

      You will be asked to sign a separate consent document for your tumor reduction surgery that
      will explain the procedure and its risks.

      On the day of your pre-operative visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic, and biomarker testing.

        -  You will have an EKG.

      On the day of your surgery:

        -  Tumor tissue will be collected for genetic and biomarker testing during your already
           scheduled tumor reduction surgery. All samples will be stored at the MD Anderson
           Gynecologic Oncology Tumor Bank for an unlimited amount of time for testing related to
           this study.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      On the day of your post-operative visit:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1-2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may take the study drug up to 24 days (including the rest days in between your doses).
      You will no longer be able to take the study drug if intolerable side effects occur, you are
      not eligible for treatment or surgery, or you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after follow-up.

      Follow-Up:

      Within 30 days after your surgery:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic, and biomarker testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an EKG.

      Standard Follow-Up:

      You will continue to have follow-up visits every 3 months as part of your standard care.

      This is an investigational study. AZD1775 is not FDA approved or commercially available. It
      is currently being used for research purposes only. The study doctor can explain how the
      study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

          1. Patients with presumed advanced-stage high grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or
             primary peritoneal carcinoma, based on the presence of carcinomatosis, and/or elevated
             CA125, and/or ovarian mass(es), or at the discretion of the treating physician.

          2. Medically able to undergo primary cytoreductive surgery, at least 14 days and up to 28
             days after starting study drug, as determined by treating physician.

          3. No prior therapy for high-grade serous ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal
             carcinoma.

          4. Patients must be able to swallow and tolerate oral medications and not have
             gastrointestinal illnesses that would preclude absorption of AZD1775 (e.g.
             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; malabsorption syndrome; ulcerative
             disease). Note: Patient may not have a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube
             or be receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).

          5. Patients must have normal organ and marrow function (measured within 7 days prior to
             the initiation of therapy) as defined below: a. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/=
             1,500/mcL; b. Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9gm/dL; c. Platelets &gt;/= 100,000/mcL; d. Total Bilirubin
             &lt;/= 1.5X ULN; e. AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5x upper limit of normal unless the liver is
             involved with tumor, in that case, AST and ALT must be &lt;/= 5x upper limit of normal;
             f. Creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min (assessed by Cockcroft Gault estimation) and
             creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN.

          6. Patients must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          7. Women of childbearing potential (WoCBP) may be included only if acceptable
             contraception is in place for two weeks before study entry, for the duration of the
             study and for 90 days after the last dose of AZD1775. WoCBP are defined as those who
             are not surgically sterile (ie, bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             complete hysterectomy) or postmenopausal (defined as 12 months with no menses without
             an alternative medical cause). Acceptable methods of contraception include true
             abstinence in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle choice of the patient, tubal
             ligation, vasectomised partner, barrier methods (eg, cap plus spermicide, sponge plus
             spermicide, diaphragm plus spermicide, or male condom plus a spermicide), intrauterine
             device methods (eg, Copper T or Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system), or
             hormonal methods (eg, any registered and marketed contraceptive agent that contains an
             oestrogen and/or a progestational agent

          8. (Continued from previous criterion) and that is administered via the oral,
             subcutaneous, transdermal, intrauterine, or intramuscular route as an implant, hormone
             shot or injection, combined pill, minipill or patch. All methods of contraception
             (with the exception of total abstinence) should be used in combination with the use of
             a condom by their male sexual partner for intercourse. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm
             method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. All
             WoCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 3 days prior to study the initiation
             of therapy.. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          9. It is unknown if AZD1775 will be present in human breast milk. For this reason, women
             must not breast-feed while taking the study medications.

         10. Patients must be able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent.

         11. Patients must be at least 18 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Prior treatment for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer

          2. Current receipt of any other investigational agents or any additional anti-cancer
             agents for this or any other disease

          3. Known central nervous system (CNS) disease other than neurologically stable, treated
             brain metastases -- defined as metastasis having no evidence of progression or
             haemorrhage after treatment for at least 2 weeks

          4. Presence of other active cancers. Patients with Stage I cancer who have received
             definitive local treatment within the last 3 years, and whom are considered unlikely
             to recur, are eligible. All patients with previously treated in-situ carcinoma (i.e.,
             non-invasive) are eligible, as are patients with prior non-melanoma skin cancers.

          5. Major surgical procedures &lt;/=28 days of beginning study treatment, or minor surgical
             procedures &lt;/= 7 days (minor procedures done at time of laparoscopy are allowed). No
             waiting required following port-a-cath placement.

          6. Significant symptom burden from presumed diagnosis including large volume ascites,
             pain requiring narcotic medication, or shortness of breath on exertion

          7. Myocardial infarction within 6 months before starting therapy, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure (New York Heart Association &gt; class II), unstable angina, or unstable
             cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication

          8. Corrected QT interval (QTc) &gt;470 msec (as calculated by Fridericia correction formula)
             at study entry or congenital long QT syndrome

          9. Caution should be exercised when inhibitors or substrates of P-gP, substrates of
             CYP1A2 with a narrow therapeutic range, sensitive substrates of CYP2C19 or CYP2C19
             substrates with a narrow therapeutic range are administered with AZD1775.

         10. Herbal preparations are not allowed throughout the study. These herbal medications
             include, but are not limited to: St. John's wort, kava, ephedra (ma huang), gingko
             biloba, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), yohimbe, saw palmetto, and ginseng. Not willing
             to avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juices, grapefruit hybrids, Seville oranges, pummelos,
             and exotic citrus fruits from 14 days prior to the dose of study medication and during
             the entire study due to potential CYP3A4 interaction with the study medication. Orange
             juice is allowed.

         11. Any known hypersensitivity or contraindication to the components of study treatment

         12. Pregnant or breast-feeding

         13. As judged by the Investigator, any evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic
             diseases (e.g., severe hepatic impairment, interstitial lung disease [bilateral,
             diffuse, parenchymal lung disease], uncontrolled chronic renal diseases
             [glomerulonephritis, nephritic syndrome, Fanconi Syndrome or Renal tubular acidosis]),
             serious active infection or current unstable or uncompensated respiratory or cardiac
             conditions, or uncontrolled hypertension (blood pressure &gt;/= 140/90), active bleeding
             diatheses or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human
             immunodeficiency virus. Screening for chronic conditions and infectious diseases is
             not required.

         14. As judged by the Investigator, the patient is unsuitable to participate in the study
             and the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and
             requirements.

         15. Subject has had prescription or non-prescription drugs or other products known to be
             sensitive CYP3A4 substrates or CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, or
             to be moderate to strong inhibitors / inducers of CYP3A4 which cannot be discontinued
             two weeks prior to Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study until 2 weeks
             after the last dose of study drug. Co-administration of aprepitant or fosaprepitant
             during this study is prohibited.

         16. AZD1775 is an inhibitor of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). The use of statins
             including Atorvastatin which are substrates for BCRP are therefore prohibited and
             patients should be moved on to non-BCRP alternatives.
