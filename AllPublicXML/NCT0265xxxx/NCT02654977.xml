    <textblock>
      The study investigators' aim is to determine the long term safety and efficacy of Metreleptin
      (Myalept,) in promoting amelioration of metabolic abnormalities in patients with all forms of
      partial lipodystrophy. Patients will be offered this protocol under the following condition:
      Subjects have completed University of Michigan research protocol MB002-014 and have shown
      improved clinical benefit as judged by clinical criteria set forth in this protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Leptin is now an approved therapeutic in the form of Myalept in patients with generalized
      forms of lipodystrophy. However, it is still under investigation for patients with partial
      forms of the disease based on FDA decision on February 24, 2014. The study investigators have
      been carrying out a protocol in patients with partial lipodystrophy, specifically familial
      partial lipodystrophy. There have been a number of patients who have been treated under this
      protocol who are not covered by the currently approved label, but who have experienced
      significant clinical benefit.

      This study would allow continued treatment of patients with partial forms of lipodystrophy
      who volunteered and completed treatment under the investigators' ongoing protocol (MB002-014)
      and who have derived significant clinical benefit as judged by an amelioration of their
      HbA1c, triglyceride levels, and/or reduction in their baseline diabetes or lipid therapies
      that affect quality of life.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously completed study protocol:

             o CLINICAL PROTOCOL to investigate the efficacy of recombinant human leptin
             (METRELEPTIN) in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or nonalcoholic fatty liver
             disease (NAFLD) associated with lipodystrophy, MB002-014 (IRMBED: HUM00058708)

          -  Demonstrates clinical benefit as defined by meeting at least one of the following
             criteria upon completion of the above stated protocols:

               -  Reduction of HbA1c ≥ 1.0% or,

               -  Reduction of triglycerides ≥ 30% of baseline or,

               -  Decrease in insulin requirements ≥ 40% or,

               -  Reduction in total NASH score by ≥ 2 points,

               -  Significant worsening of metabolic parameters after discontinuation of
                  Metreleptin if discontinuation has been undertaken.
