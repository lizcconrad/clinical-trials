  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to employ diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and tractography
      to investigate differences in connectivity in the rostral dorsal cingulum bundle (CB) in
      patients with bipolar disorder type I (BDI) or bipolar type II (BDII) compared to matched
      controls, and to utilize this information to determine if high-frequency deep brain
      stimulation (DBS) of the rostral dorsal CB has realistic potential as a therapy for producing
      mood stabilization in patients with BDI or BDII.
