  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The total knee replacement has become a routine procedure. Survival rate of over 90% after 10
      years are generally reported. However, complications and reoperation may still occur for many
      reasons, and some of them may be related to component design: loosening (tibial above),
      polyethylene wear, knee stiffness, ligamentous instability, etc ... . Therefore, new designs
      can, at least in theory, improve the results of conventional models.

      In this study, the investigators want to compare retrospectively data concerning survival
      rates of patients wearing total knee prosthesis with mobile plate for over 10 years, with the
      ones published in the literature for conventional fixed-bearing prostheses.
