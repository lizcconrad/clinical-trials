  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop a health related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome
      (PRO) for patients receiving immune checkpoint modulator (ICM) therapy. This instrument could
      be used to in clinical trials to evaluate HRQOL for patients treated with novel ICMs and ICM
      combinations that might ultimately influence decisions about regulatory approval, as well as
      improved understanding of chronic treatment effects on patient well-being, understanding
      reasons for treatment non-adherence, and developing strategies to improve adherence and
      evaluating clinical outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune Checkpoint Modulators (ICMs) are associated with significant adverse events. Currently
      there are no validated patient reported outcome (PRO) tools to assess health related quality
      of life (HRQOL) specifically in patients receiving ICMs. HRQOL is a multidimensional concept
      of a patient's perceived well-being that can be affected by disease and treatment. There is
      an urgent need to assess the impact of ICMs on HRQOL, to better understand the balance
      between efficacy and toxicity with these agents.

      This study aims to develop a health related quality of life (HRQOL) patient reported outcome
      (PRO) for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICM) therapy (FACT-ICM). The core
      domains of the FACT-ICM will include physical, emotional, family and social, and functional
      well being. In addition, the proposed study will develop a toxicity sub-scale related to
      resultant toxicities from ICM therapy.

      The HRQOL will be developed through focus groups and interviews with patients treated with
      ICMs, and clinicians treating patients with ICMs, to understand how treatment with ICMs
      impacts HRQOL, as well as explore general experiences, insights and concerns of those
      receiving ICM therapies.

    <description>Up to 4 focus groups of 6-10 cancer patients each will be conducted each lasting approximately 90 mins. An additional 10 to 15 patients will undergo individual semi-structured interviews each lasting around 60 minutes.
10-12 expert clinicians experienced in treating patients with ICMs or managing ICM toxicities will participate in a survey, and group or individual interviews.</description>

MCID testing: In addition to the FACT-ICM score, patients undergoing serial assessment for responsiveness will also indicate how much better or worse they are using a 5-point rating scale.</description>
