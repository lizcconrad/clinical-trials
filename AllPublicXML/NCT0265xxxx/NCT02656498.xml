                  the informed consent form, and possess the ability to respond verbally to
                  questions, follow instructions, and complete questionnaires and detailed
                  neuropsychological test.

               -  Have results of clinical laboratory tests/physical examination, vital signs, and
                  ECG within normal limits (at 90 days prior to [18F]THK-5351 positron emission
                  computed tomography) or clinically acceptable to the investigator at screening.

               -  Be able to possess the ability to respond verbally to questions, follow
                  instructions, and underwent research assessment, including brain images based on

             years before screening.

          -  The patient has contraindications to undergo positron emission computed tomography or
             MRI, which include but are not restricted to the examples below: claustrophobia,
             cardiac pacemaker, metal devices around the eye or spinal cord, cochlear implant,
             etc.) at the screening visit.

          -  The patient has been treated with any investigational medicinal product (IMP) within
             30 days prior to the screening visit.

          -  The patient has been tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg),
             hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV), HIV Antibody, or syphilis serum test at the
             screening visit.

          -  The patient has been receiving an anti-cholinergic drug in a regular basis within 3
             months prior to the screening visit.

          -  The patient has evidence of a clinically relevant neurological disorders other than
             the disease being studied (i.e., prodromal AD) at screening, including but not limited
             to: territorial cerebral infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, multiple sclerosis,
             neurosyphilis, mental retardation, hypoxic encephalopathy, major head trauma with loss
             of consciousness that led to persistent cognitive deficits.
