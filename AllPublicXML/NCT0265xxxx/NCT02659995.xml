      Our multicenter prospective observational study aims to show the relationship between blood
      glucose levels and glycemic variability and the development of infections during the ICU stay
      and with outcome. Within the secondary endpoints, we will evaluate if a blood glucose range
      between 70 and 140 mg/dl is associated with an increasing surviving rate in non-diabetic
      critically ill patients.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS Multicenter study (ICUs of some Italian University Hospitals). Written
      informed consent will be request before the inclusion of each patient in the study; if it
      will not be possible, an informing module will be given to the patient's family and the
      informed consent will be request to the patients as soon as possible.

      Inclusion criteria: 300 patients consecutively admitted in each ICU from January 2016 and not
      later than 31/12/2018.

      INTRODUCTION High blood glucose levels and insulin resistance are frequently registered in
      critically ill patients. In the past, hyperglycemia due to stress was considered as an
      adaptive body reaction to satisfy higher energetic requests. This theory has been
      re-discussed after Leuven's study in 2001, which demonstrated that a strict glycemic control,
      by means of intensive insulin administration, may reduce mortality in critically ill
      patients. However, more recent randomized controlled studies cannot confirm these results,
      showing how an intensive insulinic therapy can be associated to an higher risk of
      hypoglycemia and death.

      Recently, the attention has been shifted on the issue of glycemic variability in the
      Intensive Care Units (ICU), that seems to be a better mortality predictor than the simple
      blood glucose level. A relationship between lower glycemic variability, normal glucose levels
      (range 72-125 mg/dl) and outcome improving has been investigated. An high glycemic
      variability it's been associated to an increased in-hospital mortality, also in patients
      having total parenteral nutrition (TPN) independently from the presence of episodes of hypo
      or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, an intensive insulinic therapy itself may lead to excessive
      blood glucose levels fluctuations as it brings to an increased risk of hypoglycemia, usually
      treated in an &quot;aggressive&quot; way. A recent retrospective study has evaluated the impact of
      glycemic variability and hypoglycemia on outcome in non critically ill patients (undergone
      insulin administration during the hospitalization), showing a strong correlation between
      hypoglycemia and an increasing of mortality rate. A recent work of Arnold and coll. showed
      that the application of a treatment protocol for hypoglycemia (using administration of 50%
      dextrose) in critically ill patients was able to obtain a reduction of glycemic variability,
      remaining safe in avoiding dangerous hypoglycemia.

      However, the real causal relationship between glycemic variability and mortality has not yet
      been demonstrated. The increased oxydative stress due to wide glycemic fluctuations seems to
      play a leading role.

      The altered glucidic homeostasis in the critically ill patient may also cause a disfunction
      of immune cells with an increased risk of infections: Hirshberg et al. have found an
      association between glycemic variability an the risk of nosocomial infections development in
      a population of pediatric critically ill patients, studied retrospectively. A correlation
      between high glycemic variability, development of sepsis and risk of nosocomial infections in
      burn patients has also been demonstrated. Recently, a study by Krinsley and Preiser has
      highlighted how keeping blood glucose levels in a range between 70 and 140 mg/dl is strongly
      associated with an increased surviving rate in non diabetic patients, independently from ICU
      length of stay and from the severity of the clinical conditions. Donati et al. have
      demonstrated, in a retrospective study, the relationship between glycemic variability and
      infections; however, it's not yet clear if the glycemic variability is a cause of an effect
      of infections. Indeed, &quot;relationship&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;causality&quot; and it's yet to be
      elucidated if an higher glycemic variability just represents a sign of a worse clinical
      condition or, conversely, really leads to an increased risk of nosocomial infections. In this
      last case, dedicated protocols should be mandatory, not only to normalize blood glucose
      levels but also to minimize excessive glycemic fluctuations.

      STUDY PURPOSE Primary endpoint of this multicenter prospective observational study is to
      evaluate the relationship between blood glucose levels and glycemic variability and the
      development of nosocomial infection during ICU stay.

      Secondary endpoints are:

      To confirm the correlation between blood glucose levels and outcome (ICU mortality and
      hospital mortality).

      To evaluate if keeping the blood glucose level in a range between 70 and 140 mg/dl is
      associated with an increasing of surviving rate in non diabetic critically ill patients.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINT:

      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of Glycemic Lability Index (GLI) on infections
      development with AUC (ROC curve).

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:

      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of other indexes of glycemic variability on infections
      development.

      Evaluation of the discriminatory power of all the glycemic variability indexes on mortality.

      Evaluation of the eventual differences between diabetic and non diabetic patients about
      infections development.

      Evaluation of the impact of the caloric intake on glycemic variability, infections
      development and mortality.

      MATHERIALS AND METHODS The study will take place in ICUs of the participating centers.
      Written formal informed consent will be request before the inclusion of each patient in the
      study; if it won't be possible because of particular neurologic conditions of the patient, an
      informing module will be provided to the patient's family and the informed consent will be
      request to the patients as soon as possible.

      Inclusion criteria: 300 patients consecutively admitted in the participating ICUs from
      January 2016 and not later than 31/12/2018.

      Exclusion criteria: age &lt; 18, patients with end-stage disease with life expectancy shorter
      than 24 hours.

      Data collection An Excel database will be edited, collecting these data about each patient:
      age, sex, presence of type I or II diabetes, glycate haemoglobin (if present), at-home
      antidiabetic therapy (including oral antidiabetics and their dose and insulin); admission
      diagnosis, admission SAPS II score; for every day during the ICU stay will be registered:
      insulin administration (if &quot;one-shot&quot; administration, dose and route of administration, if in
      infusion, time of start, dose at the moment of glycemic measurement and min-max daily range);
      steroid therapy (molecule, daily dose, date of start and stop); antibiotic therapy (molecule,
      daily dose, date of start and stop); daily caloric and proteic intake specifying if via
      enteral or parenteral nutrition of both; other therapies included glucose and propofol;
      mechanical ventilation (yes/no, date of start and stop); blood lactates (worst daily value);
      daily leucocytes and differential white cells count; daily SOFA score; presence of infections
      (suspected or confirmed; if confirmed, site and microorganism and eventual Multidrug
      Resistance pattern); presence of sepsis (following SCCM criteria); length of ICU and hospital
      stay; outcome (ICU and hospital mortality).

      Every blood glucose level measurement obtained from laboratory analysis, bloodgas analysis
      and Glucostix, will be registered with date and time (hours and minutes).

      Glycemic variability will be evaluated in terms of these four indexes:

      Standard deviation (SD) Mean Amplitude of Glycemic excursions - MAGE, calculated as the mean
      of differences between consecutive values of blood glucose (absolute values) &gt; 1 SD of the
      global values; Coefficient of Variation (CV) calculated as SD/mean. Glycemic Lability Index
      (GLI) calculated following formule (where Gluc n is the number of the values registered on
      the time H n e N is the total numbers of values registered in a week; measurements with an
      interval between 1 and 12 hours will be registered; the mean of the GLI in the different
      weeks will be calculated).

      GLI ((mmol⁄l^2 )⁄h*〖week〗^(-1) )=∑_(n=1)^N▒〖(〖Gluc〗_n-〖Gluc〗_(n+1))〗^2⁄((h_(n+1)-h_n))

      STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS All patients with an ICU length of stay shorter than 72 hours will be
      excluded from the statistical analysis for the primary endpoint.

      Based on an earlier study, about the 40% of the admitted patients have a length of stay
      shorter than 3 days and the incidence of infections was 30%. For this reason it's calculate
      to be necessary to include 2928 patients to have an alpha error &lt; 0,01 and a beta error &lt;
      0,01, excluding every patient with an ICU stay shorter than 72 hours. Considering the
      variability in the length of ICU stay in the single ICUs and the possibility that on the date
      of 31/03/2017 some ICUs could not reach the possibility of admitting 300 patients, the
      theorical sample size is expanded to 3300 patients in total (20% of the theorical sample).

      The variables distribution will be evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; parametric and non
      parametric statistical tests will be applicated where appropriate.

      T-Test (or Mann-Whitney test) will be used for the variables comparison between the groups
      &quot;infections/no infections&quot;, &quot;sepsis/no sepsis&quot;, &quot;survivors/non survivors&quot;. ROC curves
      (Receiver Operating Characteristics) will be made to evaluate the discriminatory power of
      blood glucose levels, SD, MAGE, CV and GLI for the infections development, sepsis and
      outcome. Binary logistic regression will be applicated for analyzing the correlation between
      glycemic variability, infections development, sepsis and outcome, including APACHE II, SOFA,
      age, sex, presence of diabetes, blood lactates (at the admission and mean value), insulin
      administration, type of nutrition, mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay as
      covariates.

      Subgroups analysis will be performed based on admission diagnosis, presence of diabetes,
      insulin administration on ICU, type of nutrition. Statistical significance will be considered
      with a p value &lt; 0,05.
