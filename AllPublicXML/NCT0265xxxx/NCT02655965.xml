  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aims of this study is to compare the effectiveness of pecs block associated to a general
      anesthesia in terms of Piritramide consumption compared with a general anaesthesia alone and
      the chronic pain incidence in patients that undergoing either a lumpectomy or a mastectomy
      associated with axillary dissection This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study that
      will randomise breast cancer subjects in 1:1 ratio to receive a &quot;pecs block&quot; of Ropivacaine
      3.5 mg/ml and Clonidine 5 µg/ml (arm A) versus placebo (arm B).

      This is a double-blind study that will randomise breast cancer subjects in 1:1 ratio to
      receive a &quot;pecs block&quot; of 10 ml of Ropivacaine 3.5 mg/ml and Clonidine 5 µg/ml injected
      between pectoral muscles and 20 ml between the muscles pectoralis minor and serratus anterior
      (arm A) versus 10 ml of placebo (NaCl 0.9%) injected between pectoral muscles and 20 ml
      between the muscles pectoralis minor and serratus anterior (arm B). The pecs block will
      inject just before the surgery.

      Subjects will receive a nausea and vomiting prophylaxy depending on Apfel score After
      surgery, the two intervention groups will receive before waking a dose of Paracetamol (1 g)
      and Diclofenac (75 mg), if they present no contraindications and a dose of 0.05 mg/kg
      Piritramide .

      In the recovery room the two groups will benefit from a Patient Controlled Intravenous
      Analgesia (PCIA) pump - Piritramide allowing them to control their analgesia, which will be
      stopped at 24 hours postoperatively.
