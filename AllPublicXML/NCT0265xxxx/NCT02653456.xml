  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an excimer laser in the
      treatment of patients with lower extremity vascular disease with chronic total occlusions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study conducted at a
      minimum of one investigational center. 50 subjects can be enrolled. Follow-up occurs at the
      end of the procedure in the form of an angiogram to determine if the lesion was crossed.
      Additional follow-up may not necessary because of the binary nature of the crossing, and also
      because any future follow-up would be assessing the effectiveness of adjunct therapy, e.g.
      balloon angioplasty. Long term results are entirely dependent on this subsequent treatment.
      Because the DABRA crosser only allows adjunct devices to be used, 30-day follow-up measuring
      the performance of the adjunct therapy might affect the physician's choice of therapy, and
      compromise the patient's treatment. Therefore, 30-day follow-up, which evaluates the
      effectiveness of the adjunct therapy, might raise ethical concerns. However, the follow-up
      can be done by Ankle-Brachial Index, Doppler ultrasound, auscultation, or by discussion of
      the level of claudication and motion pain with the patient. To evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the RA-308 Excimer Laser System and DABRA Catheter for treating subjects with
      symptomatic infrainguinal lower extremity vascular disease with chronic total occlusions that
      cannot be crossed with standard guide wires, or lesions where an attempt to cross would, in
      the opinion of the interventionalist, result in either a subintimal path or a perforation.
