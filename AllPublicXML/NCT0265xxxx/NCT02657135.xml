      TEAM-TBI (Targeted Evaluation, Action, and Monitoring of Traumatic Brain Injury) is a
      research study that brings together TBI patients, advanced evaluation methods, and experts in
      a multi-faceted study to address the heterogeneity of TBI and to evaluate the effects
      self-help strategies might have on TBI outcomes.

      TEAM-TBI (Targeted Evaluation, Action, and Monitoring of Traumatic Brain Injury) proposes a
      new approach to clinical trials in TBI that will:

        -  Evolve diagnostic technology &amp; treatment

        -  Improve self-help strategies

        -  Lower cost and speed for delivery of effective strategies

      The TEAM-TBI program proposes an innovative new approach to TBI clinical trials to overcome
      the limitations of past efforts and achieve long-awaited breakthroughs for TBI survivors. The
      study will involve a comprehensive 3-4 day intake evaluation, followed by a variety of
      remotely performed tasks during a 1-6 month follow-up period.
