    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is defined by presence of hepatic steatosis (fat
      accumulation in liver cells), either by imaging or by biopsy and absence of causes for
      secondary hepatic fat accumulation such as significant alcohol consumption, medications, or
      hereditary disorders. In the majority of patients, NAFLD is associated with risk factors for
      cardiovascular disease such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and high cholesterol, and may lead
      to irreversible liver damage. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of
      NAFLD and is present in up to 30% of obese adults. NASH is defined by hepatic steatosis and
      inflammation with hepatocyte injury with or without fibrosis (hardening of the liver).

      The prevalence, morbidity and mortality of NAFLD is increasing, particularly in the
      Asia-Pacific region where there will be an estimated 300 million obese people by 2030. Weight
      loss is the first-line treatment for NAFLD in obese individuals, but the utility of lifestyle
      modification with diet and exercise is limited by difficulties in sustaining compliance and
      by eventual weight regain. Bariatric (weight loss) surgery produces the greatest amount of
      weight loss but is limited by cost, patient acceptance, and complications. The efficacy of
      drugs for NASH, such as vitamin E and medication to lower cholesterol and glucose, remains
      unclear. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) analogue, is an injectable medication
      which has been shown to induce weight loss and lower glucose in obese adults. There is little
      information on the effects of GLP-1 analogues on NASH, particularly in comparison to other
      modalities of weight loss such as surgery. This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety
      of lifestyle modification, liraglutide and surgery, for weight loss in conjunction with
      reducing severity of NASH, and for insulin resistance, high cholesterol and other
      cardiovascular risk factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The morbidity and mortality from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common
      liver disease worldwide, are rapidly increasing as a result of the global explosion in
      obesity, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region where there will be an estimated 300 million
      obese people by 20302. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of NAFLD, which is
      present in up to 30% of obese adults, leads to irreversible liver cirrhosis, and is
      associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and increased morbidity and
      mortality. Weight loss has established efficacy on NASH-associated cardiometabolic
      abnormalities and disease activity and severity. Diet and exercise produce a modest effect on
      NASH which is limited by weight regain, even with intensive lifestyle modification. Bariatric
      surgery produces the greatest amount of weight loss, but is less acceptable to many patients
      than lifestyle modification or medical therapy, and is limited by cost and complications,
      particularly post-surgical malabsorption and potential psychological complications. The
      efficacy of previously-studied medications on NASH, such as statins, insulin sensitizers and
      ursodeoxycholic acid, remains unclear.

      This study therefore aims to compare the efficacy and safety of a medication which induces
      weight loss and reduces insulin resistance, with that of lifestyle modification (diet and
      exercise), and bariatric surgery, for improvement in NASH severity, insulin resistance and
      other markers of cardiovascular risk. Liraglutide is an injectable glucagon-like peptide-1
      (GLP-1) analogue which is indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults. It has been
      shown to induce weight loss and reduction in insulin resistance in type 2 diabetic and obese
      patients. Treatment with clinically relevant doses of liraglutide for at least 20 weeks leads
      to weight loss in obese patients with or without type 2 diabetes. However, there is little
      information on the effects of GLP-1 analogues on NASH, particularly in comparison to other
      modalities of weight loss such as surgery.

      Our study will also compare the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the current
      noninvasive reference standard method for measuring hepatic fat content, with liver biopsy
      for staging of NASH. Biopsy is the current gold standard, but carries higher procedural
      risks, and is less convenient and acceptable to patients than non-invasive methods of
      evaluating severity and activity of NASH. Hence liver biopsy for week 0, 26 and week 52 is
      optional based on patient consent. We will also measure biomarkers for altered hepatic lipid
      partitioning and adipokine action, increased oxidative stress and free fatty acid
      lipotoxicity, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, and which may be
      useful non-invasive methods for evaluating the severity of NASH and the efficacy of
      treatment.

Each subject will follow an aerobic exercise prescription of moderate intensity (60-75% maximum heart rate) to expend 2000-3000 kcal/week, lasting 30-60 minutes each session (over 5-7 sessions). Subjects will be instructed by sports trainers, compliance reviewed and adjusted if necessary to maintain the targeted total energy expenditure to produce weight loss of at least 7% over 26 weeks.</description>
