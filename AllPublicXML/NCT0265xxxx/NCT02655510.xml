  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcoholic hepatitis is a syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with
      long-term heavy intake of ethanol. The pathogenesis is not completely understood. Patients
      who are severely affected present with subacute onset of fever, hepatomegaly, leukocytosis,
      marked impairment of liver function (e.g., jaundice, coagulopathy), and manifestations of
      portal hypertension (e.g., ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal hemorrhage). However,
      milder forms of alcoholic hepatitis often do not cause any symptoms.

      Alcoholic hepatitis usually persists and progresses to cirrhosis if heavy alcohol use
      continues. If alcohol use ceases, alcoholic hepatitis resolves slowly over weeks to months,
      sometimes without permanent sequelae but often with residual cirrhosis.

      F-652 is a recombinant fusion protein containing human interleukin 22 (IL-22) and human
      Immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2)-Fc produced in CHO cells in serum-free culture. F-652 under
      development is intended to treat patients with graft vs host disease (GvHD) after bone marrow
      transplantation, and acute alcoholic hepatitis (AAH), a severe form of alcoholic liver
      disease (ALD). Both GvHD and AAH are diseases with unmet medical need. The current
      investigational new drug (IND) application is to conduct a phase Ia clinical study in GvHD
      patients to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile, and biomarkers of F-652
      treatment by intravenous infusion (IV).

      IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 family of cytokines which control bacterial infection,
      homeostasis, and tissue repair. IL-22 may be used to treat patients with ALD because of its
      antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-steatotic, anti-microbial, and proliferative effect that
      have been demonstrated in various experimental systems.

      The sponsor has developed F-652, a recombinant human IL-22 IgG2 Fc fusion protein produced in
      serum-free culture of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. F-652 is able to protect tissue from
      damage and enhance tissue repair during the inflammation process and infection by activation
      of STAT3 mediated by the interleukin-22 receptor subunit 1 (IL-22R1) expressed on epithelial
      cells such as hepatocytes.
