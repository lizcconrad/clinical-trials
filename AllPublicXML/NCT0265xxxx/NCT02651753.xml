      This study is a randomized, open-label, single oral dose, 2-way crossover clinical trial to
      compare safety and pharmacokinetics of CKD-337 in healthy male volunteers.

      Subjects will receive either a single oral dose of the test formulation(CKD-337) or a oral
      dose of the reference formulation(Lipitor+Lipidil supra).

      Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 7 days.
