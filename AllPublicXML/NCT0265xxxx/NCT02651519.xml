  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stellate-ganglion block have been done safely for more than 60 years. It has proved to
      provide survivors of breast cancer with relief from hot flushes and sleep dysfunction with
      few or no side-effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate postoperative sleep
      quality of patients undergoing breast cancer surgery with Stellate-ganglion block performed
      in the operation.

      This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled (randomized, parallel group, concealed
      allocation), double-blinded trial. All patients undergoing breast cancer operation will be
      randomized 1:1 to the treatment intervention with general anesthesia as an adjunct to
      Stellate-ganglion block with 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride or saline. The objective of the
      trial is to evaluate the postoperative sleep quality of patients undergoing breast cancer
      operation with Stellate-ganglion block 0.25% ropivacaine hydrochloride or saline.

    <description>physiological parameter of regional cerebral oxygen saturation of all patients during the operation will be recorded.Regional cerebral oxygen saturation measured by near-infrared spectroscopy in the frontal lobe has been used previously to evaluate overall cerebral blood flow. The normal range of cerebral oxygen saturation is 55-80%.</description>
