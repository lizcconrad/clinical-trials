      The primary objective of this prospective, post-market study is to collect data to assess the
      long term outcome of a broad contact modular interbody device in the form of the InterFuse S™
      or InterFuse T™ device in patients undergoing long construct fusion for degenerative disc
      disease and/or scoliosis. Comparisons will be made with published historical data..

      The primary objective of this prospective, post-market study is to collect data to assess the
      long term outcome of a broad contact modular interbody device in the form of the InterFuse S™
      or InterFuse T™ device in patients undergoing long construct fusion for degenerative disc
      disease and/or scoliosis. While there is no concurrent control population, there is ample
      historical control data to be used for comparison.

      The study will include up to two hundred (200) patients, up to 10 centers, and provide a
      prospective evaluation of the InterFuse &quot;T&quot; and/or InterFuse &quot;S&quot; Interbody Fusion System.
      Primary endpoints will be assessed at twelve months post-surgery. All patients enrolled in
      the study will be followed for at least 24 months.

        The protocol includes skeletally mature patients both male and female, 18 to 89 years old,
        with degenerative disc disease (DDD) and/or scoliosis and a planned fusion of at least five
        levels.. DDD is defined as discogenic back pain with degeneration of the disc confirmed by
        patient history and radiographic studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The patients has a planned fusion construct of at least five levels and will have
             the InterFuse (S) or (T) planned for L5-S1 and/or L4-L5.

             2. The patient has documented conservative (non-operative) treatment for at least 6
             months.

             3. The patient has a VAS score of ≥ 60 mm for Back and/or Leg. 4. The patient has an
             ODI ≥ 40%. 5. The general condition of the patient is appropriate for surgery, as
             evaluated by the Investigator.

             6. The patient is willing and able to comply with study requirements. 7. The patient
             has agreed to participate in the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  1. The patient has undergone any prior spinal fusion surgery at the proposed treatment
             level(s). Previous non-fusion surgery at the proposed treatment level(s) is
             acceptable.

             2. The patient has osteoporosis or severe osteopenia as determined by the

             becoming pregnant in the next two years.

             8. The patient is mentally ill or has a history of drug abuse or severe depression/

             9. The patient has a known allergy to polyether ether ketone (PEEK), stainless steel
             or tantalum.

             10. The patient is currently enrolled in an investigational spine study. 11. The
             patient has rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other autoimmune disease.

             12. The patient has symptomatic fibrous arachroiditis.
