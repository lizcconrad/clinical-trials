    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) anatomical lung resection provides an effective
      minimally invasive treatment strategy for stage I and II lung cancer. VATS lobectomy is
      associated with significantly less postoperative atrial fibrillation, blood transfusion,
      renal failure, and other complications when compared with lobectomy via thoracotomy.

      Although VATS lobectomy has been proven to be effective and safe in experienced hands, it is
      not devoid of risk. Intra-operative surgical complications can be at times catastrophic.
      Complications include: pulmonary vascular injuries (Pulmonary artery (PA), pulmonary vein)
      necessitating urgent conversion to open thoracotomy and even death. Causes of conversion
      included PA injury, difficult anatomy, bulky/calcified lymph nodes, and technical problems
      including stapler misfire. PA injury alone constituted 37.5% of all conversions. Proper
      dissection of all tissue around PA branches is sometime difficult especially in the presence
      of adhesions or large, calcified lymph nodes and may increase the risk of vascular injury.

      Currently, in spite of being a safe and effective technique in experienced hands, a minority
      of anatomical pulmonary resections are being performed by VATS. In an analysis utilizing the
      Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database in the United States, only 15% of anatomical lung
      resections were performed by VATS.

      The technical difficulty and danger of VATS lobectomy is directly related to PA branch
      manipulation, stapling and division. PA manipulation is the main hesitation of many thoracic
      surgeons regarding the adoption of VATS lobectomy. We believe that if we can decrease the
      manipulation and dissection required by the surgeon on the PA branches, we can make these
      procedures safe and therefore more prevalent for anatomical pulmonary resections.

      This study consists of evaluating the safety and efficacy of energy sealing lobar PA branches
      for lobectomy in humans. All patients planned to undergo a lobectomy by VATS at the CHUM -
      Hôpital Notre-Dame will be approached. In our institution, lobectomies are either done open
      (thoracotomy) or by minimally invasive approach, known as VATS (video assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery). This decision is based on the surgeon, tumor size, tumor localization and patient
      characteristics. Only patients already planned for a VATS lobectomy will be approached.
      Potential patients will be selected by going over the operation request forms. Patients
      booked for a VATS lobectomy will be approached either in the preoperative clinic or the day
      before surgery, when admitted. Aim is to recruit 20 patients.

    <measure>All patients will be assessed for effective intra-operative pulmonary arterial branch vessel sealing. It will be measured visually by the presence or lack of vessel sealing failure</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>All cases will be videotaped with a thoracosocpic 10 mm, 30 degree camera placed through the chest tube insertion site in order to evaluate the problems in cases of seal failure. All patients will have 4-0 prolene with SH needle ready for use on the sterile field in case there is a sealing failure that needs to be fixed.
Additionally, all patients are routinely crossmatched for 2 units of packed red blood cells (as per standard pre-operative orders).</description>
