    <textblock>
      Sentinel lymph node biopsy（SLNB） is an established way of predicting axillary nodal
      metastasis in early breast cancer. We aim to determinethe，in a prospective randomized,
      controlled trial, effect of sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node(SLN)
      dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node dissection on
      outcomes after breast surgery.

      Aim: Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of breast cancer
      patients who are randomized to receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph
      node dissection group vs. those receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel
      lymph node dissection

      Outline:

      Patients are randomized assigned to the following one of two groups and are followed
      annually.

      Arm I: Patients receive sentinel lymph node biopsy with para-sentinel lymph node dissection
      Arm II: Patients receive only sentinel lymph node biopsy without para-sentinel lymph node
      dissection
