  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized controlled trial that compares the conventional stepwise
      approach with a new sequential substrate ablation approach for persistent atrial
      fibrillation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total number of 100 patients with persistent AF were randomized to receive either
      conventional stepwise ablation (conventional group) or a sequential substrate ablation
      (substrate group), both with the endpoint of AF termination. All patients were in AF before
      the procedure. The sequential substrate ablation consisted of pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)
      followed by cardioversion and linear ablation at the mitral isthmus, left atrial roof and
      cavotricuspid isthmus in order to modify the AF substrate. After achievement of bidirectional
      block, AF was re-induced and electrogram-based ablation was performed to achieve AF
      termination to sinus rhythm (SR). Endpoints are single-procedure outcome and total amount of
      RF ablation time required to terminate AF by electrogram-guided ablation.
