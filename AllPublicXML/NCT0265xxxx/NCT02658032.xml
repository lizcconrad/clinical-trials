  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of two separate, sequential interventions
      to promote tobacco cessation/reduction in patients who are screened for lung cancer or are
      eligible for lung cancer screening. Each intervention will be compared to standard of care.
      The first intervention will be a personalized message intervention, the second intervention
      will consist of a biofeedback-based intervention.

      The primary aims of this study are to test the efficacy two types of smoking cessation
      methods (compared to standard care).

      The aim of the first intervention is to evaluate the efficacy of a personalized message
      intervention in improving tobacco quit rates above and beyond standard care smoking cessation
      treatment in patients at risk for lung cancer. Messages will be designed specifically for
      patients at risk for lung cancer, personalized and presented in a gain-framed manner, taking
      into account demographics and smoking history.

      The aim of the second intervention is to evaluate the efficacy of a novel, biofeedback-based
      intervention that provides personalized individual-level feedback on biomarkers of lung
      cancer risk and how they improve in response to cessation, delivered in a gain-framed way.
      The biomarkers include skin carotenoid status, spirometry, and plasma bilirubin, all of which
      improve with cessation. The study team will examine whether the biofeedback prevents relapse
      in those who quit and leads to reductions in smoking in lung nodule patients who failed to
      quit.

      Additionally, this study will attempt to evaluate the impact of smoking cessation on miRNA
      profiles in human serum, especially miRNAs in the let-7 family, which are known to have tumor
      suppressor function, and which we hypothesize increase in response to cessation.

    <measure>Skin Carotenoids</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (1 week prior to baseline), Baseline, 6 Weeks, 8 Weeks, 3 Months, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Skin carotenoids are measured with a 30-second scan of the skin with visible light can be used to quantify skin carotenoids rapidly and non-invasively. This study's method sufficiently measures carotenoid status in skin as a biomarker of response to a smoking cessation intervention.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Plasma Bilirubin</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening (1 week prior to baseline), 6 Weeks, 8 Weeks, 3 Months, 6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>3 mls of blood will be drawn into heparinized tubes, centrifuged, and plasma transferred to opaque tubes and analyzed on the Roche DPP Modular automated chemistry analyzer at the clinical lab, using the method of Jendrassik and Grof. While indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is likely more relevant for health effects, it is very highly correlated with total bilirubin, which is more common for physicians to test and thus more relevant for translational purposes. Thus, total bilirubin will be used for feedback.</description>
