      Study Drug:

      TAS-102 (trifluridine and tipiracil hydrocholoride) and bevacizumab

      Dosing Details:

      Starting dose of TAS-102 is 35 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily, after meals, for 5 days
      a week with 2 days rest for 14 days, followed by 14 days rest (1 treatment cycle).

      Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg intravenously every 14 days. The treatment cycle repeats every 28 days.
