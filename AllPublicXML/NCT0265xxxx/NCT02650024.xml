    <textblock>
      This partially blinded placebo-controlled trial will determine the impact of curing Hepatitis
      C Virus (HCV) with an oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA), ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in a
      single pill, on central nervous system (CNS) outcomes in mono- or Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV) co-infected individuals.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic HCV infection frequently causes neurocognitive (NC) and mood disorders but whether
      these disorders are caused by HCV or by the concomitant substance use and liver disease is
      unclear. Response to treatment has been obscured by the neurotoxicity of interferon-based HCV
      therapies. Newer DAAs are not neurotoxic and are expected to treat HCV-induced brain injury.
      However, clinical trials have yet to be performed to determine their CNS benefits. This
      presents a critical barrier to progress in the field that the proposed clinical trial will
      directly address. The specific aims will be to:

      AIM 1: To determine whether curing HCV, as indexed by 12-week sustained virologic response,
      results in improvement in NC performance, neuroimaging, and measures of daily functioning;

      AIM 2: To determine the viral, host, and pharmacologic correlates of neurocognitive and
      neuroimaging outcomes; and

      AIM 3: To explore how HIV alters the relationships observed in Aims 1 and 2.

      The proposed, innovative clinical trial will improve scientific knowledge by determining the
      biological and imaging correlates of the CNS and systemic effects of DAAs as well as the
      distribution of these drugs into the CNS. The investigators' findings will also inform
      clinical guidelines and practice about the safety and benefits of treating HCV in substance
      using populations. In people who have HIV-associated NC disorder and HCV infection, treatment
      with DAAs may prove to be a critical adjunct to antiretroviral for improving cognition and
      returning patients to more functional lives.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult (≥ 18 years old) subjects with chronic genotype 1 HCV and NCI with a GDS greater
             than or equal to 0.5 (n=60).

          2. Presence of chronic HCV infection based on chart review will be defined as positive
             for anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA at least 6 months before screening.

             obtained through self report. Self report will be confirmed at screening using a HIV-1
             point of care test. In the event that point of care test and self-report are
             discordant, then HIV status will be confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second
             antibody test.

          4. HIV/HCV co-infected subjects (n=12) must also have a HIV RNA measurement &lt;50 copies/mL

             contraindicate lumbar puncture.

         11. Uncontrolled or active depression or other psychiatric disorder that in the opinion of
             the site investigator might preclude adherence to study requirements or impact NC
             functioning and assessments.

         12. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
             investigator, would interfere with adherence to study requirements.
