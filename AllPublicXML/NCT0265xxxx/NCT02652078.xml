  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral arterial disease is a common condition affecting approximately 64% of 56-77 year
      olds. This condition restricts bloody supply to calf muscles. Pain occurs after walking a
      short distance and increases in intensity until the person stops, where the pain then
      gradually subsides. It can be limiting or occasionally debilitating and has been shown to
      have considerable deleterious effects of patients quality of life. Shock wave therapy has
      been shown to promote new blood vessel formation and improved healing amongst other findings.
      This study aims to identify whether shock wave therapy that is applied to the calf muscles
      causes such an effect to improve the blood supply to the calf muscles, reduce pain, improve
      walking ability and quality of life.

      This study aims to compare the effects of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) to placebo
      with use of a sham control group on walking distances in subjects with lower limb
      intermittent calf claudication. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy will be applied using the
      PiezoWave2 shockwave system. All applications will be in adherence to the manufacturer's
      instructions and provided by trained staff. The device will be targeted at the gastrocnemius
      muscles of the affected lower leg for several minutes at each treatment session. Participants
      in control group will undergo the identical process as if treatment were being given but with
      the shockwaves not being administered and a sham device alternatively used. Participants will
      have several assessments prior to and after the shockwave treatment in order to quantify the
      effect. Assessments will include Maximum Walking Distance (MWD), Claudication Distance (CD)
      and Quality of life questionnaires.
