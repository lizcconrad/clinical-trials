  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Looking at individual total fluid volume and alveolar-arterial gradient with 5% human albumin
      and Lactated Ringer's in the perioperative cardiac surgical patient.

      Our hypothesis is that the individual total fluid volume and alveolar-arterial gradient will
      be less with 5% human albumin compared to Lactated Ringer's in the perioperative cardiac
      surgical patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following IRB approval and written informed patient consent, 40 elective, cardiac surgical
      patients will be randomized to two different fluid therapy regimens, 5% human albumin only or
      Lactated Ringer's only, beginning in the intraoperative period and up to 6 hours in the
      intensive care unit. Providers and patients will be blinded to the fluid administered in the
      operating room and intensive care unit. The primary outcome measure will be the total volume
      of 5% human albumin or Lactated Ringer's given during the study period to maintain specified
      hemodynamic guidelines. Hemodynamic instability will be defined according to each patient's
      stipulated baseline parameters. Fluid will be administered at the request of providers in the
      operating room and intensive care unit in compliance with a perioperative fluid algorithm.
      Outcome measures of hemodynamic instability will include systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures; mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, cardiac index, urine output, and
      vasopressor use. Alveolar-arterial gradient will be assessed between the two choices of fluid
      to determine any relationship with fluid choice and duration of intubation in the intensive
      care unit. Blinding of the fluid therapy has not been done in this group of patients so
      detection of bias towards one of the fluids may be appreciated.
