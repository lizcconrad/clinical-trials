      This study seeks to to study the effects of buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, on
      depressed mood in a healthy young adults with a range of depressive symptomatology.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that opioid analgesics, particularly the mu-opioid partial agonist
      buprenorphine, have anti-depressant properties in laboratory animal models. In humans, rates
      of prescription opioid abuse are significantly higher in patients with depression. This
      suggests that individuals with negative mood states (e.g., depressive states) may respond
      more positively to opioid drugs. A handful of small studies in in humans have suggested that
      buprenorphine reduces symptoms of depression in patients who did not respond to standard
      anti-depressants, and laboratory studies have shown buprenorphine may reduce responses to
      some types of negative stimuli and enhance responses to positive stimuli. However, a
      controlled laboratory study assessing potential anti-depressant effects of an opioid
      medication has never been conducted. In this project, the investigators propose to examine
      depressive symptomatology as a predictor of subjective mood responses to buprenorphine, using
      two measures; i) self-reported depressive symptomatology as measured by the Beck Depression
      Inventory (BDI-II), and ii) physiological indices of depressive symptomatology as measured by
      heart rate variability. Reduced heart rate variability has been shown to be associated with
      depression, and such a physiological measure may allow for the detection of more subtle
      effects than would a self-report questionnaire alone. Healthy volunteers (N=60) will first
      complete the BDI and provide baseline measures of heart rate variability. Then they will
      attend two laboratory sessions, at which they will receive placebo, 0.2mg buprenorphine, or
      0.4mg buprenorphine in counterbalanced order. The investigators have tested these low doses
      of buprenorphine in previous studies, and they produce measurable changes in mood and
      behavior in healthy volunteers. The investigators will collect measures of mood and
      physiological drug response (pupillometry, heart rate, and blood pressure) at regular
      intervals throughout each session, and will then examine their baseline indices of depressive
      symptomatology in relation to responses to the drug. The central hypothesis is that
      individuals with greater self-reported depressive symptoms and lower heart rate variability
      will experience the greatest enhancement of mood in response to buprenorphine. It is expected
      that this work will provide a better understanding of which individuals are most likely to
      experience positive mood effects in response to opioid drugs, and may therefore be at-risk
      for developing an opioid use disorder. Furthermore, it may lay the foundation for future
      research in the development of novel opioid-based treatments for depression.

      Design: The study will use a 3-session within-subjects double-blind design in which
      participants will receive single doses of buprenorphine (0, 0.2, 0.4 mg sublingual) in
      randomized order. All screening, orientation, and study session procedures will take place in
      the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory suite in the L4 wing of 5841 S. Maryland Ave.

      Drug and Doses: Investigators will administer placebo, 0.2 mg and 0.4 mg buprenorphine
      (Temgesic) via sublingual tablet in counterbalanced order under double-blind conditions.
      These tablets dissolve within 5-8 minutes. This drug has been approved for treatment of
      severe pain. The onset of action after sublingual administration is 30 minutes, with a peak
      plasma concentration at 1/5-2 hours and a half-life of 5 hours. These doses of buprenorphine
      are very low, and the average maintenance dose for opioid abusers is 8 mg. The 0.2-mg dose
      will help establish a dose-response curve for any effects. Doses will be separated by at
      least 72 hours.
