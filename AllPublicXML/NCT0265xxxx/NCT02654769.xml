      The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and therapeutic equivalence of generic
      ingenol mebutate gel, 0.05% to Picato gel, 0.05% and to establish the superiority of the
      efficacy of these two products over the vehicle gel in the treatment of Actinic Keratosis
      (AK) on the trunk or extremities.

      Picato® (ingenol mebutate) gel is the first and only ingenol mebutate product approved by the
      FDA in 2012 for the topical treatment of AK(s) on the face and scalp (0.015% formulation) and
      on the trunk and extremities (0.05% formulation). A generic ingenol mebutate gel, 0.05% has
      been developed for the topical treatment of clinically typical, visible, and discrete
      non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic AK lesions of the trunk or extremities.
