  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, open-label trial focused on assessing the safety and
      tolerability of ExpressGraft-C9T1 skin tissue in the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers (DFU).
      Because the focus is on safety rather than efficacy, a standard of care comparator is not
      included in this first-in-human study. Targeted enrollment for this study is up to 6 subjects
      with a confirmed diagnosis of diabetes and who have foot ulcers. Subjects will each receive a
      single application of ExpressGraft-C9T1 skin tissue on a single identified study DFU
      following a 10-14 day run-in period. Any subjects requiring additional treatment will receive
      protocol-defined dressings through Study Treatment Week 12 as necessary. Enrollment will
      occur with a minimum of one week between each subject.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        SUBJECT-SPECIFIC CRITERIA

          2. Female subjects of childbearing potential must agree to practice birth control for the
             duration of the study

          3. Documented Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

          4. HgbA1C ≤ 10.0%

          5. Ankle:brachial blood pressure index (ABI) of 0.7 to 1.3

               -  If ABI is &gt; 1.3 (i.e., non-compressible ankle vessels) or cannot be measured,
                  then Toe brachial index (TBI) of ≥ 0.5, or

               -  Doppler arterial waveforms that are triphasic or biphasic at the ankle of
                  affected leg

               -  If ABI and TBI cannot be measured, then Transcutaneous pressure (TcpO2) of ≥ 40
                  around ulcer site, or

               -  Skin perfusion pressure &gt; 30 if neither ABI, TBI, nor TcpO2 can be measured near
                  ulcer

          6. Stable medications for 2 weeks prior to Study Treatment Day 0

               -  Sliding scale insulin permitted
