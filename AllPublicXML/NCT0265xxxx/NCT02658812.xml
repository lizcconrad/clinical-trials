  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if talimogene laherparepvec can help to
      control recurrent (has come back after treatment) breast cancer. The safety of this drug will
      also be studied.

      This is an investigational study. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of melanoma. It is considered investigational to use
      T-VEC to treat breast cancer. The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to
      work.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      You will receive the study drug in cycles. Cycle 1 will be 3 weeks and every cycle after that
      will be 2 weeks.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive talimogene
      laherparepvec as an injection into the tumor on Day 1 of each cycle. If the doctor thinks it
      is in your best interest, you may also receive injections into areas of the skin to which the
      disease has spread.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 2:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, if this has not been done
           in the last 7 days.

        -  At Cycle 2, photographs will be taken of lesions on your chest.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 5:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 7 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check the immune system,
           and for tumor marker testing.

        -  You will have a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. You may have a
           bone scan, if PET/CT is not available.

        -  Photographs will be taken of any lesions on your chest.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a biopsy (core, skin punch, or FNA) to
           check the immune system and to check the status of the disease.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 7 and then every odd numbered cycle after that (Cycles 9, 11, 13, and so
      on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Photographs will be taken of any lesions on your chest.

      On Day 1 of Cycle 9 and then every 4 cycles after that (Cycles 13, 17, 21, and so on):

      Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and tumor marker testing.

      You will have a CT or PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. You may have a bone
      scan, if PET/CT is not available.

      Length of Treatment:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      After your last dose of study drug but before the start of any new treatments, blood (about 2
      tablespoons) will be drawn to check your immune system, if possible.

      Follow-Up Visits:

      About 30 days after the end-of-treatment visit and then every 3 months after that for up to 1
      year, you will have a follow-up visit or phone call to learn how you are doing. After 30
      days, instead of having a clinic visit, the study staff will review your medical records. If
      you are called, it should take about 2 minutes.
