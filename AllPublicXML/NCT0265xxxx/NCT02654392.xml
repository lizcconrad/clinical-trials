  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many studies in the past three decades have examined the beneficial effects of omega-3
      polyunsaturated fatty acids in diet and supplementation. The effect of polyunsaturated fatty
      acids, specifically omega-3 and omega-6, on health have been well-studied but most of the
      study to date has been on animal not plant sources and much less is know about their effects
      on exercise performance. Additionally, while positive effects have been detected for
      sedentary populations or those that are at risk, well-trained athletes generally have not had
      established advantages in taking supplements for omega-3 and omega-6 oils. There is evidence
      that a specific ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is most beneficial for the human body with
      regards to cardiovascular and mental health. In this study, participants randomized to either
      a plant supplement group (pureform omega; containing Flax, Evening Primrose, Sunflower,
      Coconut &amp; Pumpkin oils; Natural Product Number = 80050660) or placebo (isoenergetic sugar
      pills) will be subjected to both a time trial and a high intensity interval bout, where their
      performance and power output will be analyzed. Blood lactate and glucose concentration, as
      well as oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production will also be examined to determine
      if there is a change in on fat oxidation after supplementation.

      Double-blind placebo controlled study with two groups: a PUFA supplemented group (over 5
      weeks) and a placebo (corn syrup) group. Participants are matched for initial exercise
      performance and assigned to each of the two groups systematically so the initial group means
      are similar. This is done by ranking all individuals from highest to lowest and assigning the
      participant with the highest score randomly to the treatment group and the other to the
      placebo group. Then, for the next two individuals in ranking, the highest of the two is
      assigned to the placebo group and the other to the treatment group. This procedure is
      repeated for all participant pairs. Of course, this is done separately for men and women
      because on average the men have greater exercise performance scores.

      Dosage is 3.8 capsules/70kg body mass (rounded to the nearest capsule; 1 capsule contains
      369mg PUFA from Flax, Evening Primrose, Pumpkin, Sunflower, and Coconut oil; &lt;4 Calories) or
      isoenergetic placebo capsules (containing corn syrup) plus 2 capsules 20 minutes prior to
      exercise workouts. Eighteen recreationally active student volunteers (18-35 years old) will
      be recruited to complete 4 exercise tests: a cycle time trial (~15 minutes), a cycle maximal
      power test (30 second Wingate test), a maximal aerobic power test (running treadmill test)
      plus a strength/endurance test (number of bench presses with 60 kg load) pre- and post 5
      weeks of daily supplementation. There will an accommodation day pre-study where each
      participant is familiarized with the tests to be used. Each exercise test will be completed
      on a separate day with at least 48 hours between each test day due to the fatiguing nature of
      the testing.
