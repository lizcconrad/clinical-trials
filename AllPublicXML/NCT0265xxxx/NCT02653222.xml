  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators are going to assess the feasibility of this innovate
      technique of renal sympathetic denervation by translumbar access under ct-guidance.

      To limit the potential impact on the kidney, the investigators chose a population of chronic
      renal failure patients on dialysis or renal transplant (with native kidneys still present)
      and having resistant treatment hypertension despite antihypertensive combination therapy well
      conducted.

      The investigators expect to obtain a decrease of the blood pressure at the 24-hours
      ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) one month after the sympathetic denervation.
