      The purpose of this study is determine safety and effectiveness of Neutrolin, a catheter lock
      solution, for prevention of central venous catheter associated bloodstream infection in
      hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Neutrolin® as a
      catheter lock solution (CLS) on prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI),
      and the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events in subjects receiving hemodialysis
      (HD) for the treatment of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) when compared with heparin 4,000 USP
      Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL).

      This is a randomized, double-blind, active control, parallel-arm, multicenter study. Six
      hundred and thirty two subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either
      Neutrolin® or the active control heparin (Heparin sodium USP 1,000 units/mL, Benzyl alcohol
      9.45 mg/mL and Sodium chloride 9.0 mg/mL) as a CLS.

      Approximately 632 randomized subjects are planned for this trial. In this study, one-half of
      the subjects (316 subjects) will receive Neutrolin as a study drug and the other half will
      receive heparin 4,000 USP Units/4mL (1,000 USP Units/mL) with benzyl alcohol preservative as
      a comparator. Subjects will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio using permuted blocks without
      additional stratification for both groups.

      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Neutrolin® as a
      CLS in ESRD subjects undergoing HD treatment using a permanent, cuffed, tunneled silicone or
      polyurethane HD catheter. The study will evaluate whether Neutrolin® is superior to the
      active control heparin by documenting the time to CRBSI and consequently delaying the time
      until the occurrence of CRBSI.
