  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate a switch from fixed dose combination (FDC) treatment with
      ATRIPLA^TM for 12 weeks prior to screening to FDC treatment with MK-1439A in
      virologically-suppressed, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected participants.
      The primary hypothesis is that switching from ATRIPLA^TM to MK-1439A results in a lower
      proportion of participants with at least one CNS toxicity of at least Grade 2 intensity at
      Week 12 than continuation of ATRIPLA^TM treatment.
