      This study protocol will evaluate the efficacy of Bovie Medical's J-Plasma® helium based
      plasma technology in the reduction of lymphoceles following pelvic lymph node dissection
      (PLND) during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The J-Plasma® handpiece will be
      used during the PLND by dissecting the lymph nodes and sealing the lymphatic channels to
      prevent lymph leakage.

      Participants evaluated and scheduled for a PLND during Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy
      who have met the study inclusion criteria and who have also given informed consent will be
      enrolled. Enrolled participants will have their PLND performed using J-Plasma® for dissection
      and sealing of lymphatic channels. An abdominal-pelvic ultrasound will be completed at a
      follow-up period ranging from 4-12 weeks post operatively to determine if a lymphocele is
      present. The occurrence rate of lymphoceles in this trial group will be compared to
      retrospective data from the principal investigator's practice and other published data to
      determine if the occurrence rate has been reduced.
