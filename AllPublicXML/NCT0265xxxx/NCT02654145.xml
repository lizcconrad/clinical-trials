  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 ( IL-5) monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-5 and
      reduces eosinophil counts in both sputum and blood. Omalizumab an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE)
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) is effective in the treatment of moderate to severe allergic
      asthma. The aim of this study is to investigate whether subjects not optimally controlled on
      their current omalizumab treatment, who are eligible for therapy with mepolizumab can be
      effectively and safely switched to treatment with mepolizumab to improve asthma control. The
      study will provide data on the efficacy, safety, immunogenicity, and tolerability of
      mepolizumab when switched directly from omalizumab without any wash-out. The learnings from
      this study may help guide physicians when substituting one biologic with another for the
      treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.

      The study will be a multi-centre, open-label single arm trial. Patients with severe
      eosinophilic asthma who are receiving omalizumab, but are not optimally controlled will be
      eligible to participate. Subjects will remain on their current maintenance therapy including
      omalizumab throughout the run-in period for a minimum of one week and up to 4 weeks. At Visit
      2 (week 0) subjects will discontinue their omalizumab treatment and be switched to
      mepolizumab 100 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 4 weeks for 28 weeks. The treatment period is 32
      weeks, including an Exit Visit/Early Withdrawal Visit, 4 weeks following the subject's last
      dose of mepolizumab.

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) Score at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which is used as a measure of asthma control of a participant. The five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score range from 0 to 6. Higher scores indicates worsening of condition. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline at Week 32 was calculated as Week 32 value of ACQ-5 score minus Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as ordinal variable) and visit.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Score at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ Questionnaire is a well-established, self-completed tool, comprising of 50 questions with 76 weighted responses designed to measure Quality of Life in participants with diseases of airway obstruction. It consists of two parts; Part 1 produces the symptom score and Part 2 produces the activity and impact score. A Total score is also calculated which summarizes the impact of the disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and zero indicates best possible health status. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline at Week 32 was calculated as Week 32 value of SGRQ score minus Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and visit.</description>

    <measure>The Rate of Clinically Significant Asthma Exacerbations Over 32 Weeks' Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Clinically significant exacerbations of asthma were defined as worsening of asthma which requires use of systemic corticosteroids and/or hospitalization and/or Emergency Department (ED) visits. The frequency of clinically significant asthma exacerbations over 32 weeks' treatment was analyzed using Negative Binomial Regression via generalized estimating equations with a covariate of time period (pre-treatment versus on- and off treatment).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ratio to Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Count at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and at Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure blood eosinophils level for evaluation of pharmacodynamic effects in participants with a severe eosinophilic asthma phenotype when they were directly switched to mepolizumab. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab and ratio to Baseline at Week 32 was defined as Week 32 value divided by Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, Baseline maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and visit. The log transformation was applied to blood eosinophil counts prior to analysis. If a blood eosinophil count of zero was reported, it was imputed with half of the lowest possible blood eosinophil count, where applicable, prior to log transforming the data. The dispersion measure used was log standard error.</description>

             corrected for heart rate according to Bazett's formula (QTcB), Fridericia's formula
             (QTcF), and/or another method, machine-read or manually over-read. The specific
             formula that will be used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an
             individual subject should be determined prior to initiation of the study. In other
             words, several different formulae cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an
             individual subject and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the
             subject from the trial.For purposes of data analysis, QTcB, QTcF, another QT
             correction formula, or a composite of available values of QTc will be used.

             Subjects with a known, pre-existing parasitic infestation within 6 months prior to
             Visit 1 are also to be excluded.

          -  Immunodeficiency: A known immunodeficiency (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]),
             other than that explained by the use of corticosteroids taken as therapy for asthma.

          -  Other Monoclonal Antibodies: Subjects who have received any monoclonal antibody (other
             than omalizumab) to treat inflammatory disease within 5 half-lives of Visit 1.

          -  Smoking history: Current smokers or former smokers with a smoking history of &gt;=10 pack
             years (number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day / 20) x number of years
             smoked). A former smoker is defined as a subject who quit smoking at least 6 months
             prior to Screening Visit 1.

          -  Alcohol/Substance Abuse: A history (or suspected history) of alcohol misuse or

             or Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation.

          -  Investigator opinion: Omalizumab treatment has provided significant clinical benefit
             despite experiencing 2 exacerbations in the past 12 months, and potential benefit from
             a switch to mepolizumab would not outweigh the potential harm after omalizumab
             withdrawal for the subject.

          -  Previous participation: Previously participated in any study with mepolizumab and
             received investigational product (including placebo).

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) Score at Week 32</title>
        <description>The ACQ-5 is a five-item, self-completed questionnaire, which is used as a measure of asthma control of a participant. The five questions (concerning nocturnal awakening, waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath and wheeze) enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms over the previous week. The response options for all these questions range from zero (no impairment/limitation) to six (total impairment/ limitation) scale. ACQ-5 score range from 0 to 6. Higher scores indicates worsening of condition. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline at Week 32 was calculated as Week 32 value of ACQ-5 score minus Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as ordinal variable) and visit.</description>

        <description>The SGRQ Questionnaire is a well-established, self-completed tool, comprising of 50 questions with 76 weighted responses designed to measure Quality of Life in participants with diseases of airway obstruction. It consists of two parts; Part 1 produces the symptom score and Part 2 produces the activity and impact score. A Total score is also calculated which summarizes the impact of the disease on overall health status. Scores are expressed as a percentage of overall impairment where 100 represents worst possible health status and zero indicates best possible health status. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab. Change from Baseline at Week 32 was calculated as Week 32 value of SGRQ score minus Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, baseline maintenance OCS therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and visit.</description>

        <title>Ratio to Baseline in Blood Eosinophil Count at Week 32</title>
        <description>Blood samples were collected at specific time points to measure blood eosinophils level for evaluation of pharmacodynamic effects in participants with a severe eosinophilic asthma phenotype when they were directly switched to mepolizumab. Baseline was defined as the latest available assessment prior to first dose of mepolizumab and ratio to Baseline at Week 32 was defined as Week 32 value divided by Baseline value and was analyzed using Mixed Model Repeated Measures allowing for covariates of region, Baseline maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy, exacerbations in the year prior to the study (as an ordinal variable) and visit. The log transformation was applied to blood eosinophil counts prior to analysis. If a blood eosinophil count of zero was reported, it was imputed with half of the lowest possible blood eosinophil count, where applicable, prior to log transforming the data. The dispersion measure used was log standard error.</description>
