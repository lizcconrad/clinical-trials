      The aim of our study is to investigate the effects of a combined treatment of alpha-lipoic
      acid and myoinositol on clinical, endocrine and metabolic features of women affected by PCOS.
      The study Group included 40 patients treated with a combined therapy of alpha-lipoic acid
      (800 mg), myoinositol (2000 mg) and folic acid (400 mcg) daily for six months. The
      investigation includes menstrual pattern, hirsutism score, hormonal assays, oral glucose
      tolerance test, lipidic profile at baseline and after six months of treatment.
