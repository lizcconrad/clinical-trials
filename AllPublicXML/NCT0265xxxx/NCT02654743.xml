  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 4-month study examining the effects of Sulforaphane (SF) on behavior
      in children with ASD and the correlation between behavior change and urinary metabolites. The
      goal is to determine a potential mechanism of action of SF in this population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sulforaphane (SF) is an isothiocyanate found in high levels in crucifers belonging to the
      family Brassicaceae (including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Chinese
      cabbage and turnips). Many previous studies have documented that consumption of these
      vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cancer (lung, breast, colon, rectum, and
      prostate).(Juge et al. 2007) The mechanism of action of these beneficial effects is believed
      to be due to the ability of SF to up-regulate genes that improve cellular response to
      oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA-damaging electrophiles, and radiation.(Singh et al. 2014)
      In a recent small, randomized controlled trial in children with autism, SF was shown to have
      beneficial effects on aberrant and social behavior.(Singh et al. 2014) The mechanism of
      action of this beneficial effect has not been established in children with ASD. Our primary
      goal is to examine changes in urinary metabolites in children with autism who receive SF to
      determine if changes in behavior are associated with changes in urinary metabolites.

    <description>Sulforaphane (SF) will be administered in an approximate dosage of 1 µmol SF/lb (2.2 kg µmol/kg) body weight. This dosage roughly approximates the dosage that was used in the Singh et al, (2014; PNAS) clinical trial of sulforaphane in male adolescents and adults with autism. The sulforaphane will be supplied as glucoraphanin (GR)-enriched broccoli seed extract tablets (manufacturing details follow). Each active tablet will contain 125 mg broccoli seed extract (containing 37 µmol GR, which is equivalent to about 15 µmol SF), 50 mg dried broccoli sprouts (a source of myrosinase, the enzyme that converts GR to SF), 15 mg ascorbic acid, 55.90 mg microcrystalline cellulose, and other minor GRAS excipients used for tablet forming.
The total dose per day will depend of study participants' body weight.</description>
