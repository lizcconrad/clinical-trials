    <textblock>
      This is a controlled clinical trials about traditional Chinese medicine named Qufeng Shengshi
      Fang，which consisted of cicada slough，bombyx batryticatus，radix angelicae，radix
      sileris，honeysuckle flower，forsythia，lithospermum and radix glycyrrhizae，and Loratadine on

    <description>Cytokines is a kind of low-molecular-weight soluble protein, which has function of regulating inherent immunity and adaptive immunity, erythropoiesis, cell growth and injured tissue repair and others.In the study FlowCellect™ Mouse Th2 Intracellular Cytokine Kit (FCIM025124) and Th17 Intracellular Cytokine Kit (FCIM025125) will be used to compare the change on cytokine before and after treatment. This FlowCellect Mouse Cytokine Th2 Identification Kit for flow cytometry is designed to enable a researcher a quick &amp; easy way to detect IL-4 expression in mouse Th2 CD4+ T-cells. This FlowCellect Mouse Cytokine Th17 Identification Kit for flow cytometry is designed to enable a researcher a quick &amp; easy way to detect IL-17 expression in mouse Th17 CD4+ T-cells.</description>

    <measure>Test of Metabonomics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Metabolomics is the scientific study of chemical processes involving metabolites. Specifically, metabolomics is the &quot;systematic study of the unique chemical fingerprints that specific cellular processes leave behind&quot;, the study of their small-molecule metabolite profiles. The metabolome represents the collection of all metabolites in a biological cell, tissue, organ or organism, which are the end products of cellular processes. Small molecules are the objects in Metabonomics which relative molecular mass is less than 1000.In the study NMR will be used as a way to assess the change on Metabonomics before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Test of Proteomics</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The proteome is the entire set of proteins expressed by a genome, cell, tissue or organism at a certain time. More specifically, it is the set of expressed proteins in a given type of cell or organism, at a given time, under defined conditions. The term is a portmanteau of proteins and genome. Proteomics is the study of the proteome.In the study Mass Spectrometry will be used to compare the change on proteome before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change of Exosomes</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Exosomes as a utricle bubble structure are widely distributed in the peripheral blood, urine, saliva, ascites, amniotic fluid, and other body fluids. Exosomes carry different components, which are secreted by different cells, and these components give exosomes a variety in biological functions, such as potential biomarkers of immune cells, cancer, etc.In the study Ribo™ Exosome Isolation Reagent (for plasma or serum) will be used to compare the change on exosomes before and after treatment.</description>

    <measure>IncRNA Sequencing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Long non-coding RNAs (lnc RNAs) are non-protein coding RNA molecules with the sequence longer than 200 nucleotides. They are four times amount as protein coding transcripts and play important roles in diverse cellular regulations. Function identification of these lncRNAs remains challenging although abundant efforts were put in this field. In the study gene expression profile , named RiboArrayTM lncDETECTTM Human Array, will be used which are provided by RiboBio Co., Ltd.</description>

    <description>Qufeng Shengshi Fang is a traditional Chinese medicine form 8 kinds of herbs. Loratadine is the second generation antihistamines, after converted into its active metabolite Carrie period (carebastine), its antihistamines and allergy effect has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo tests, also received data from clinical trials.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Loratadine (INN) is a second-generation H1 histamine antagonist drug used to treat allergies. In structure, it is closely related to tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, and is distantly related to the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine.Loratadine is marketed by Schering-Plough[needs update] under several trade names (e.g., Claritin) and also by Shionogi in Japan. It is available as a generic drug and is marketed for its nonsedating properties. In a version named Claritin-D or Clarinase, it is combined with pseudoephedrine, a decongestant; this makes it useful for colds, as well as allergies but adds potential side effects of insomnia, anxiety, and nervousness.</description>
