    <textblock>
      This phase 1 first-in-human study evaluates safety and tolerability of SBP-101 in subjects
      with previously treated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and will identify the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). In addition, this study will also assess the pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile and preliminary efficacy of SBP-101.

    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study of SBP-101 will be conducted in two phases: dose escalation and
      expansion. The dose escalation phase of the study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      PK profile of SBP-101 in subjects with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic
      pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Up to 48 subjects may be enrolled in dose escalation. The
      expansion phase of the study will consist of 24 additional subjects who will receive the
      maximum tolerated dose of SBP-101 based on data from the dose escalation phase of the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
             ductal adenocarcinoma. Patients with acinar cell carcinoma may also be included.

          -  Measurable disease on CT or MRI scan by RECIST criteria (required for Phase 1b only).

          -  ECOG Performance Status 0 or 1.

          -  Received and failed, or were intolerant to, at least 1 prior systemic therapy for
             locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

          -  Adult, at least 18 years of age, male or female

          -  Females of child-bearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 14

          -  Known, existing coagulopathy or receiving anticoagulants

          -  Pregnant or lactating

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete
