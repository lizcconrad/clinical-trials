  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bicortical screws have been widely used for mandibular osteosynthesis during orthognathic
      surgery.Transoral placement of bicortical screws is a rigid fixation method in orthognathic
      surgery, which is less often used.

      The aim of this study was to compare postoperative outcome of transoral versus transbuccal
      bicortical screw placement during orthognathic surgery.

      This study comprises an academic, retrospective, monocentric study in which the charts of
      orthognathic patients operated between January 2010 and December 2012 were retrospectively
      reviewed. Postoperative complications were registered. Demographic, dental and surgical
      parameters are examined as potential risk factors for the occurence of postoperative
      complications.
