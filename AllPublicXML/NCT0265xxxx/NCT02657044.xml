  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic resection of adenomas in the colon is the cornerstone of effective colorectal
      cancer prevention. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is currently the most used technique
      for resection of large distal colorectal adenomas, however, maintains some important
      limitations. In large lesions, EMR can often only be performed in a piecemeal fashion
      resulting in relatively low R0-resection rates and high recurrence rates. Endoscopic
      submucosal dissection (ESD) is a newer procedure that is more difficult resulting in a longer
      procedural time, but is promising due to the high en-bloc resection rates and the very low
      recurrence rates. The aim of this multicenter randomized study is to compare EMR and ESD with
      regard to recurrence rates and radical (R0) resection rates, and to put this into perspective
      against the costs and complication rates of both strategies and the burden perceived by
      patients on the long term-term.
