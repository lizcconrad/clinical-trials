      The goal of this clinical trial is to study how approaches for manufacturing chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR)-modified T (CAR-T) cells affect their in vivo persistence and therapeutic
      efficacy against B lymphoma. Recently, cancer immunotherapy, treatments aiming to arm
      patients with immunity specifically against cancer cells, has emerged as a promising
      therapeutic strategy. Among the many emerging immunotherapeutic approaches, clinical trials
      utilizing CARs against B cell malignancies have demonstrated remarkable potential. CARs
      combine the variable region of an antibody with T-cell signaling moieties to confer T-cell
      activation with the targeting specificity of an antibody. Thus, CARs are not MHC-restricted
      so they are not vulnerable to MHC down regulation by tumors. However, defined by the
      activation and contraction program of their mother cells, the persistency and function of
      CAR-T cells are also restricted by the protocol of manufacturing. Previous clinical studies
      largely utilized interleukin-2 (IL-2) for the ex vivo expansion of CAR-T cells, which
      preferentially generate CAR-T cells with characteristics of terminally differentiated
      effector cells. Our preliminary data indicated that two common gamma chain cytokines, IL-7
      and IL-15, can help to selectively expand CAR-T cells with various memory phenotypes. CAR-T
      Cells prepared under this condition resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy in preclinical
      animal models. This clinical investigation is to test a hypothesis whether
      IL-7/IL-15-programmed anti-CD19 CAR-T cells persist longer in lymphoma patients after
      infusion and whether the persistency of CAR-T cells can lead to improved anti-lymphoma
      efficacy.

      Primary Objectives

        1. To determine the safety and feasibility of CD19.CAR-T cells manufactured through
           IL-7/IL-15-mediated expansion or IL-2-mediated expansion

        2. To determine in vivo dynamics and persistency of IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells.

        3. To determine the efficacy of IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells in treating patients
           with CD19-positive lymphoma

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To determine whether the IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells are superior to the IL-2
           programmed cells as measured by their in vivo persistence post infusion

        2. To determine whether the IL-7/IL-15 programmed CD19.CAR-T cells are superior to the IL-2
           programmed cells as measured by their efficacy in lymphoma therapy

        3. To assess the dynamics of intratumoral infiltration of CD19.CAR-T cells.

        4. To correlate the subsets and differentiation of CD19.CAR-T cells to observed anti-tumor
           efficacy
