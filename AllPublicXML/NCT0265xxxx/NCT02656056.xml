  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The consumption of fermented soy foods can alter the human microbiome and may confer health
      benefits. Researchers propose a line of inquiry to assess the effects of Q-Can Plus (&quot;QC&quot;)
      fermented soy beverage in humans, assessing immunological, microbiological, and clinical
      parameters.

      The study will start with a detailed testing of the microorganisms present in the QC
      fermented soy liquid, using deep sequencing. Subsequently, the researchers will determine the
      effect of the QC fermented soy product on the microbiome and inflammation in lean and obese
      individuals, as obese individuals are known to have dysbiosis. The work on inflammatory
      changes will be supplemented by studies to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanistic
      pathways responsible for the biological action of QC fermented soy liquid.
