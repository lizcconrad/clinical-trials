Participants will be administered RO6958688 weekly (QW) or every 3 weeks (Q3W) at escalated doses in combination with a fixed dose of atezolizumab Q3W until recommended dose and schedule for RO6958688 is determined. On Day 1 of each cycle, when both atezolizumab and RO6958688 are administered, atezolizumab will be administered first, followed by RO6958688 at least half an hour after the end of the atezolizumab infusion.</description>

For the step up dosing schedule, the late cycle Maximum-Tolerated Dose (MTD) will be estimated by an intra-patient dose escalation design cohort B. In this cohort, the RO6958688 dose will be escalated up to 275% of the previous dose until the Dose-Limiting Toxicities (DLT) criteria for that dose level are met. also explore two additional RO6958688 step-up dose regimens (cohort C1 and C2) in combination with atezolizumab Q3W, in a randomized schedule comparison expansion.
