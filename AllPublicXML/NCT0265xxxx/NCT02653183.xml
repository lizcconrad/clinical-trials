      The primary objective of this investigation is to evaluate if complications related to
      surgical wound are more common in the treatment group compared to the control group starting
      from operation day until last visit.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

        -  the performance of the dressing

        -  the comfort, conformability and the acceptability of the dressing

        -  pain before and during dressing removal on the last visit

      A prospective, randomized clinical investigation will be conducted at two to three sites in
      Belgium and Sweden.

      Male or female, 18 years and older undergoing primary hip or knee arthroplasty with an
      expected hospital stay of 4 days or longer will be included in to the clinical investigation.

      100 evaluable patients (i.e. 50 subjects per arm). The treatment arm (either Mepilex Border
      Post-Op or Aquacel Surgical) Patient eligibility will be established before treatment
      randomization. Patients will be randomized using optimal allocation (minimization) balancing
      for the following baseline variables type of surgery (hip or knee), age and skin status.
      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive Mepilex Border Post-Op or Aquacel surgical in
      a ratio of 1:1 provided.
