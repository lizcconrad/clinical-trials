  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) represents the gold standard in the operative
      management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and the transurethral resection of bladder
      tumor (TURBT) is the first-line surgical treatment for bladder tumors. One of the most
      important complications of urological endoscopic resections is intraoperative and
      postoperative bleeding requiring blood transfusion. Allogeneic blood transfusion is not free
      of risks, like infection transmission, hemolytic reactions, transfusion-related lung injury,
      fluid overload, increased costs and hospital length of stay.

      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic analog of serin than reversibly inhibits fibrinolysis by
      blocking lysine union sites in the plasmin and plasminogen activator molecules. TXA has been
      used to reduce blood loss and the need for allogeneic blood transfusion in cardiac surgery
      and orthopedic surgical procedures but few studies have assessed the efficacy of this
      antifibrinolytic agent in urological endoscopic procedures.

      The investigators designed this double-blind, placebo controlled study evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid in reducing blood transfusion in
      patients undergoing endoscopic surgery in urology.

      Participants will be randomized into one of two study groups: Group TXA: intravenous
      tranexamic acid: bolus of 10 mg/kg thirty minutes before resection followed by infusion of 1
      mg/kg/h intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Control Group C: an equal volume of
      saline. The study drug was prepared by an anesthesiologist not involved in the patient
      management and data collection. The anesthetic technique will be standardized. Serum
      hemoglobin was measured before and after surgery. The volume of the irrigation fluid,
      resected prostate weight and duration of resection were recorded.
