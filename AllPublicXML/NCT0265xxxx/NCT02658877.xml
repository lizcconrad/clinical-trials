  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to identify additional mechanisms of action of
      omalizumab that will lead to improved stratification of patients for treatment. Understanding
      the response of specific innate immune effector cells in the lung can provide clues to these
      questions. Investigators will use non-invasive measures of a discrete cell population to
      examine the downstream effects of omalizumab treatment in the lung. Information derived from
      these studies will help clarify mechanisms of action of omalizumab and help identify
      potential tools for patient endotyping and stratification for therapeutic interventions.

      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, 16-week intervention study to show
      feasibility and proof of concept. Analysis of whole induced sputum is under development for
      endotyping for asthma, allowing sampling of rare cells from conducting airways, repeated
      sampling, and cell-specific detailed genomic evaluation. Investigators have developed a novel
      technique to simultaneously enrich innate immune cells from sputum. This technique allows for
      in situ analyses of sputum-derived human bronchial epithelial cells (sHBEC). The non-invasive
      nature of the technique provides a unique tool for in vivo human studies.

    <description>Omalizumab will be dosed according to dosing and U.S. administration guidelines for omalizumab. Omalizumab will be dosed every 2-4 weeks based on the patient's pre treatment serum IgE level (IU/mL) and initial visit body weight (kg). Omalizumab will be delivered as a subcutaneous injection. Standard safety precautions for dosing will be observed, including clinical observation after dosing, and provision of an epinephrine pen. Maintenance asthma treatment will remain unchanged.</description>
