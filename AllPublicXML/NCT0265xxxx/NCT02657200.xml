      The study will be conducted using a self designed questionnaire administered in midwives who
      are employed within a Flemish hospital in one of the following departments: maternity,
      maternal intensive care, (intensive) neonatology, reproductive medicine, gynaecology,
      delivery and prenatal care. The questionnaire assesses the knowledge, attitude and practices

    <description>Based on previous published KAP-studies, a questionnaire was designed and tested using a single Delphi procedure with experts and lay persons. The knowledge items include questions on the definition, treatment, side effects, risk factors and legal aspects of spontaneous abortion. The attitude items include questions about the attitude of midwives when confronted with women with spontaneous abortion, and how they perceive the role of midwives in delivering various aspects of care to women with spontaneous abortion. The practices items include questions about the extent to which midwives are confronted with women with spontaneous abortion, and about the characteristics of these cases. In addition, midwives are asked about the availability of training and protocols to deliver care to women with spontaneous abortion. Each item will be treated as a categorical variable. A sum score will be calculated counting the correct answers of the knowledge questions.</description>
