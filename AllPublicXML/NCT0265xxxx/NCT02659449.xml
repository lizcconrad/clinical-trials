  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of compressing therapy on the dexterity
      of burned hands using evaluating hand function tests (Box and block / Purdue Peg Board /
      Jamar's test)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with burned hands will realise prehension test to explore dexterity of hand when
      they wear compressive's treatments and with free hands.

      Each patient will realise each test with all conditions (free hands/ made to measure gloves/
      compressive bandaging).

      Running order of test and condition is randomly defined. Each patient realized this tests
      under the care and devices used at usual care. Realisation of this tests are not influenced
      by the study. Patient realised this tests during reeducation.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Box and Block test</measure>
    <time_frame>mesure will be realised three time : 48h - 96h -144 hours after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>A rectangular box that is divided into two square compartments of equal dimension by means of a partition. One hundred and fifty, wooden cubes are placed in one compartment or the other. The individual move as many blocks as possible, one at a time, from one compartment to the other for a period of 60 seconds.
The BBT is scored by counting the number of blocks carried over the partition from one compartment to the other during the one-minute trial period.
The measure will be implemented for each compressive medical device and free hand (three time for each patient). Interval of 24h between each compressive.
Measure will be realised at end of test when hand's cicatrisation will be obtained and after a time lag of 7 days after receipt of definitive compressive gloves.
The measure will be realised every two days during one week (duration of study after inclusion of patient) after hand's evaluation by the investigator.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Purdue Pegboard test</measure>
    <time_frame>mesure will be realised three time: 48h - 96h -144 hours after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Purdue Pegboard Test is a rectangular board with 2 sets of 25 holes running vertically and 4 concave cups at the top. Small metal pegs are placed in the cup on the side being tested, with subjects asked to remove the pegs and place them vertically in the holes as rapidly as possible. The number of pegs placed in 30 seconds is scored.
The measure will be implemented for each compressive medical device and free hand (three time for each patient). Interval of 24h between each compressive.
Measure will be realised at end of test when hand's cicatrisation will be obtained and after a time lag of 7 days after receipt of definitive compressive gloves.
the measure will be realised every two days during one week (duration of study) after hand's evaluation by the investigator</description>

    <measure>Jamar's Test</measure>
    <time_frame>mesure will be realised three time :48h - 96h -144 hours after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>A Hand Dynamometer is used for testing hand grip strength. The measure will be implemented for each compressive medical device and free hand (three time for each patient). Interval of 24h between each compressive.
Measure will be realised at the hand of the test when hand's cicatrisation will be obtained and after a time lag of 7 days after receipt of definitive compressive gloves.
the measure will be realised every two days during one week (duration of study) after hand's evaluation by the investigator</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quick DASH test</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire asks about your symptoms as well as your ability to perform certain activities.
Quick DASH test is realised 1st day after inclusion of patient on EvICoMaB clinical study and one day before realisation of hand's tests (second day of study) . The measure is obtained at end of questionaire</description>
