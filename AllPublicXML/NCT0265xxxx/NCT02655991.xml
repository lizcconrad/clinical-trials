  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether telephone support improves clinical outcomes of veterans
      who begin outpatient treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder. Participants will be
      randomly assigned to receive either usual care or usual care supplemented by biweekly
      monitoring and support by telephone during the first 3 months of treatment. Patients in both
      conditions will be compared on PTSD symptoms, engagement in treatment, violence and drinking
      at 4 months and 12 months after entering treatment.

    <textblock>
      This multisite randomized controlled trial will test whether a 3-month period of providing
      telephone monitoring to PTSD patients as a supplement to usual specialty mental health care
      improves 12-month clinical outcomes (a reduction in PTSD symptoms, violence, and substance
      use). Secondarily, this study will determine whether telephone monitoring promotes better
      engagement in outpatient treatment (Number of mental health and psychotherapy visits during
      the 3-month intervention period).

      Demand for VA PTSD treatment is increasing as troops return from combat deployments in
      Afghanistan and Iraq. Telemedicine is likely to be an important component in developing more
      effective and efficient models of PTSD care that improves patient functioning and treatment
      utilization. It is hoped that using telephone case monitoring as an inexpensive adjunct to
      standard care may improve clinical outcomes and reduce hospitalization among veterans with
      PTSD.
