      Single-Center, Exploratory Study of EndoChoice's Upper and Lower Gastrointestinal Endoscopic
      Systems Utilizing EndoChoice's Full Spectrum Optical Technology
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational devices are EndoChoice gastrointestinal endoscopic systems that are
      similar in their fit, form, and functions to the corresponding commercially available models
      with the exception of the EndoChoice's proprietary Optical system that enhances their field
      of view.
