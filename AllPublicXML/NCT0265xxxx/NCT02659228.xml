  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators explore anesthesia as a tool for providing further insight
      into the level of consciousness of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of unresponsive
      wakefulness syndrome (UWS), but who possess some neurophysiological signatures of conscious
      awareness. This group, who could potentially be conscious, will herein be referred to as the
      target population. Our goal is to assess whether or not neurological patterns of
      consciousness in the target population respond to anesthesia in a similar manner to
      neurologically compromised individuals with known consciousness (e.g. those in minimally
      conscious state (MCS). In healthy controls, propofol-induced unconsciousness results in an
      elimination of the mismatch negativity event-related brain potential (ERP) and a diminished
      directed connectivity. The investigators hypothesize that at doses well below those required
      for surgery, anesthesia will have similar effects on these neural patterns in neurologically
      compromised patients with the potential for conscious awareness, but will not affect these
      patterns in those who lack consciousness.

    <description>EEG networks will be monitored pre, during and post anesthesia. Directed connectivity will be calculated using phase lag index (PLI) and symbolic transfer entropy (STE) between all combinations of EEG sensors. Average values of feedback connectivity (e.g. from the frontal regions to parietal and occipital regions) will be compared to average values of feedforward connectivity (e.g. from parietal and occipital regions to frontal regions). Positive asymmetry will be correlated to the presence of conscious awareness and negative asymmetry will be correlated to the absence of conscious awareness.</description>

    <measure>Presence of P300 and N400 event-related potentials</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>EEG signals will be processed to extract the event-related EEG reactions to the auditory stimulation paradigm. Signals will be average 300 ms post-stimuli and 400 ms post-stimuli to assess the presence of the P300 and N400 event-related potentials. Presence of these event-related potentials will be correlated to the presence of conscious awareness and absence of these event-related potentials will be correlated to the absence of conscious awareness.</description>
