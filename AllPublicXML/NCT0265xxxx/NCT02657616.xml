  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central questions of the study can be summarized as follows:

      What stroke / death rates are the result of the use of the following treatment strategies: no
      anticoagulation with vitamin-k-antagonists (VKAs) or novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs),
      anticoagulation with VKAs and anticoagulation with NOACs (all). What other thromboembolic
      complication rates resulting from the use of these treatment strategies? What heavy bleeding
      rates resulting from the defined management strategies? The analysis is based on a data set
      of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)(01/01/2010 - 30/06/2014). 2010 is used as the
      reference period and 01/01/2011-30/06/2013 as the inclusion period. The minimum observation
      time per patient is 12 months.

      Used is a data base of the AOK PLUS as well as the AOK Baden-Württemberg and AOK Bayern.

      The aim of the study is to compare clinical outcomes between the different treatment
      strategies (frequency of events and time to first event). The influence of alternative
      treatment strategies is measured on the basis of three different methodological approaches:
      unadjusted comparison of event council and time to first event between the defined patient
      groups; matched-pair comparison (propensity score matching) between the different groups of
      patients (treatment strategies) and multivariate analysis using time to event (Cox
      proportional hazards model) as the dependent variable.
