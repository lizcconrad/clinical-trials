    <textblock>
      This study will test to see if metformin is safe and if it is tolerated compared to placebo
      in adult Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) patients with beginning stages
      of chronic kidney disease. We will also measure its effect on progression of kidney disease
      as reflected in the kidney size and the kidney function, along with its effect on kidney pain
      and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is growing evidence that metformin, a drug widely used for the treatment of type 2
      diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome, may serve as a novel therapy for individuals in the
      early stages of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ADPKD by activating the
      metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is activated under conditions of
      metabolic and other cellular stresses. Through its actions on downstream mediators, AMPK
      activation during low energy states decreases cellular energy consumption while stimulating
      energy generating pathways. It has been shown that AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits cystic
      fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), thus suppressing epithelial fluid and
      electrolyte secretion. Similarly, AMPK phosphorylates the tuberin protein, leading to
      indirect inhibition of the mTOR pathway. Thus, AMPK inhibits both CFTR and mTOR, suggesting
      that targeted activation of this kinase by metformin may provide a therapeutic benefit in
      ADPKD. It has been shown that metformin treatment of kidney epithelial cells leads to
      stimulation of AMPK and subsequent inhibition of both mTOR and CFTR activity. It has also
      been shown that metformin slows cystogenesis in animal models of PKD, supporting the
      potential of this drug in ADPKD treatment.
