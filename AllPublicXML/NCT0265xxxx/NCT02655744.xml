  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon disease.
      Conventional treatment has consisted of either whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) or
      methotrexate (MTX)-based combined modality therapy combining chemotherapy and cranial
      irradiation. The treatment principles at our institute have been quite consistent in the
      past, sticking to the treatment protocol reported by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
      in 1990s. No matter what the dosage of MTX is, it is well-established that the addition of
      chemotherapy to cranial RT significantly improved survival outcomes. However, it was found
      that delayed treatment-related cognitive sequelae emerged as a significant debilitating
      complication of combined modality treatment in patients with PCNSL, especially when effective
      treatment can achieve disease control and better survival rates. Furthermore, the specific
      contribution of the disease per se and various treatment modalities to cognitive impairment
      remains to be clarified because the neurotoxic potential of combined modality treatments is
      difficult to differentiate when each can result in cognitive dysfunctions respectively.

      Treatment-related neurotoxicity could be demonstrated by virtue of several meaningful
      indicators, including neurobehavioral assessments, neuroimaging outcomes, and even measures
      of quality-of-life (QoL).

      Methods. Therefore, this one-year individual research will be a prospective observational
      cohort study with a longitudinal assessment of neurobehavioral functions, neuroimaging, and
      quality of life for newly-diagnosed patients with primary CNS lymphoma at our institute.
      According to our cancer center, it is estimated that there would be around 25 cases of
      newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma at our institute every year. By virtue of
      multidisciplinary management and teamwork consisting of neurosurgery, hematology, radiation
      oncology, neuroimaging expertise, and surgical pathology, investigators will attempt to
      recruit all potentially eligible patients with newly-diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma. Most
      importantly, the neuropsychologists will participate in our research project, in an effort to
      integrate the neurobehavioral outcomes into this prospective study. Accordingly, a battery of
      neuropsychological measures is used to evaluate neurobehavioral functions for the studied
      patients. The battery is composed of ten standardized neuropsychological tests, covering four
      domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (executive function, attention, verbal
      memory, psychomotor speed), and QoL questionnaires.

      Expected results. This prospective cohort study aims to explore and evaluate patients with
      PCNSL who are newly-diagnosed by using a standard battery of neurobehavioral functions plus
      neuroimaging studies. It is anticipated investigators will investigate and correlate
      neurotoxicity indicators in newly-diagnosed patients with PCNSL who are treated with cranial
      radiotherapy combined with or without MTX-based chemotherapy according to the
      multidisciplinary treatment guidelines implemented at a single institute.
