  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open nephrectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures in urologic practice. Pain
      after surgery remains a significant clinical problem as it impairs recovery adversely and may
      lead to the transition to chronic pain. The open approach represents a major physical trauma
      including postoperative pain and discomfort in the convalescence period. Adequate control of
      postoperative pain facilitates earlier mobilization and rehabilitation. Patient-controlled
      analgesia (PCA) is effective to treat pain at rest, but seems to be inadequate for dynamic
      analgesia and may also elicit side effects that may delay hospital discharge. Preventing
      early and late postsurgical pain is an important challenge for anesthesiologists and
      surgeons.

      Ketamine (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor antagonist) and lidocaine (sodium channel blocker)
      are popular analgesic adjuvants for improving perioperative pain management. The
      investigators designed this double-blind, placebo controlled study to test and compare the
      preventive effects of perioperative intravenous ketamine and lidocaine on early and chronic
      pain after elective open nephrectomy.

      The investigators propose a double-blind placebo-controlled study of patients undergoing
      elective open nephrectomy. All patients will receive normal &quot;patient-controlled analgesia
      morphine&quot; in addition to study drugs or placebo. Research will be conducted at Charles
      Nicolle teaching hospital.

      Participants will be randomized into one of three study groups: Group L: intravenous
      lidocaine: bolus of 1.5 mg/kg at induction of anesthesia followed by infusion of 1 mg/kg/h
      intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Group K: Ketamine: bolus of 0.15 mg/kg
      followed by infusion of 0.1 mg/kg/h intraoperatively and for 24 h postoperatively. Control
      Group C: an equal volume of saline. The anesthetic technique will be standardized, and the
      postoperative assessments included pain scores, opioid consumption, recovery of bowel
      function and 6-minute walk distance (6-MWD) on the fourth postoperative morning. At 3 months,
      patients will be questioned for chronic postoperative pain using the Neuropathic Pain 4
      questionnaire.
