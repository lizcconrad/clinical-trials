  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, non-interventional time and motion study will evaluate the costs of
      healthcare resource utilization associated with the administration of trastuzumab (Herceptin)
      SC and IV formulations in HER2-positive EBC. This is a sub-study of the clinical study
      MO22982 (NCT01401166/PrefHer).

    <measure>Monetary Cost of Health Care Resources Used Per Episode of Care in Administration of Trastuzumab Single-Use Injection Device</measure>
    <time_frame>Data collection up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. HCP time was estimated using hourly salary data from National Health Service (NHS) reference costs. Consumable supplies were costed using hospital pharmacy data and online sources. Analysis was limited to only those items with an individual cost of £0.05 or more. Monetary cost of health care resources was determined by adding the costs of consumable supplies and HCP time spent in the administration of trastuzumab single-use injection device during a single episode of care. The average monetary cost per episode was calculated and expressed in pounds.</description>

    <description>Trastuzumab will be given on Day 1 of each 3-week cycle for a total of 18 cycles. Dosage will be according to the local labeling: 600 milligrams (mg) SC or 6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) via IV infusion. For those assigned to the IV arm or if IV treatment is delayed &gt;1 week, an initial loading/reloading dose of 8 mg/kg will be given instead. Due to the observational nature of this study, trastuzumab is not an investigational product but will be supplied in the MO22982 trial. Each route/device (SC single-use injection device, SC vial/syringe, IV infusion) will be observed in at least 12 episodes of care.</description>

      <recruitment_details>Eligible participants from the MO22982 (NCT01401166) trial were observed for this time and motion study of trastuzumab. The focus of the observation in this study was the HCP rather than the person being treated, so number of observations is reported everywhere instead of number of participants. Number of participants was not collected.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Each arm included 12 observations of an episode of care independent of the person being treated. By design of the study, some individuals may have been observed more than once and there may have been fewer than 12 actual participants in each arm. As only a single observation was required to participate, there was no &quot;disposition&quot; recorded.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Monetary Cost of Health Care Resources Used Per Episode of Care in Administration of Trastuzumab Single-Use Injection Device</title>
        <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. HCP time was estimated using hourly salary data from National Health Service (NHS) reference costs. Consumable supplies were costed using hospital pharmacy data and online sources. Analysis was limited to only those items with an individual cost of £0.05 or more. Monetary cost of health care resources was determined by adding the costs of consumable supplies and HCP time spent in the administration of trastuzumab single-use injection device during a single episode of care. The average monetary cost per episode was calculated and expressed in pounds.</description>

        <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. HCP time spent on each pre-specified task in the administration of trastuzumab SC injection was recorded during each episode of care. The average task-specific HCP time per episode was calculated and expressed in minutes.</description>

        <title>Total HCP Time Required Per Episode of Care in the Administration of Trastuzumab Single-Use Injection Device</title>
        <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. HCP time spent on each pre-specified task in the administration of trastuzumab single-use injection device was recorded during each episode of care. Total HCP time was determined by adding together the time spent on all tasks. The average total HCP time per episode was calculated and expressed in minutes.</description>

        <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. Consumable medical supplies used in the preparation of trastuzumab IV infusion were counted during a single episode of care. The average number of each type of consumable used per episode was calculated.</description>

        <description>The study observed 36 episodes of care (12 per study arm) to collect data on infusion/injection-related tasks. Arrival and discharge times were recorded to determine the total time spent in the care unit during a single episode of care. The average time spent in the care unit per episode was calculated and expressed in minutes.</description>
