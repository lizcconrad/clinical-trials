  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the decrease in thoracopulmonary compliance after cardiac surgery is well known . The
      investigators hypothesize that the major factor determining pulmonary outcome after cardiac
      surgery is the alteration of pulmonary compliance during cardiopulmonary bypass(CBP) and that
      this alteration is due to CBP itself through pulmonary blood emptying.

      compliance is the compliance calculate when thorax is closed, the pulmonary compliance is the
      compliance calculated when thorax is opened After operation chest X-ray are daily done and
      blood samples as needed. Were recorded death, time of extubation,duration of non invasive
      ventilation,of Intensive Care Unit stay and of total hospital stay, troponin peak, lactates,
      blood gases, ionogram and count.Variations of compliance is analyzed through one factor
      paired Anova or Wilcoxon paired test. Decrease of compliance and respiratory complications
      are analyzed through binomial logistic regression.
