    <textblock>
      This is a sample made up of ninety-six adult individuals of both sexes to be divided into
      three groups: the experimental group of thirty-two patients with OCD who will be undergone
      Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy; the gold standard, with thirty-two people with OCD subject
      Exposure and Response Prevention and the control group of thirty-two healthy individuals.
      Interviews and therapeutic intervention occur in private practices researchers or medical
      schools accredited by UESPI.

      Experimental group: Will be eligible adults of both sexes with educational level equal to or
      higher education complete primary, aged between 18 and 60 years with OCD diagnosis confirmed
      according to criteria DSM-IV (APA, 1994). It is going to be excluded patients who had
      previously undergone treatment behavioral psychotherapy or cognitive-behavioral approach.

      OBJECTIVES

      Evaluate the effectiveness of Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy (TBCT) compared to Exposure and
      Response Prevention (ERP) in the treatment of OCD patients, by neuroimaging tests such as
      MRI.

        1. Describe the neuroanatomical profile of the sample participants before and after the
           psychotherapeutic intervention by MRI;

        2. Compare the profile neuroanatomical between the experimental group and the control group
           by MRI;

        3. Identify possible neuroanatomical differences in the participating sample of pre and
           post-treatment, both among individuals and among psychotherapeutic intervention groups;

        4. To investigate associations between the results of MRI scans and indexes the scales
           currently used to assess severity of OCD.

    <description>Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy (TBCT) is a three-level, three-phase, case formulation approach, based on the work of Franz Kafka &quot;The Trial&quot; and developed by Professor Irismar Reis de Oliveira at Federal University of Bahia, Brazil. TBCT's foundation is in cognitive therapy (CT); however, it has a unique approach to conceptualization and techniques that make it a distinct intervention in modifying patients' core beliefs, especially those about the self. All individuals in the group will be submitted to MRI</description>

    <description>The Behavioral Therapy is an intervention of first choice for treatment of OCD , which employs the technique of Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) , considered the gold standard to the disorder. The technique involves directly exposing patients to recall stimulation of obsessive thoughts and prevent them from performing the compulsive rituals.
