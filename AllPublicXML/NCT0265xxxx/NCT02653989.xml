    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MDV9300 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that have achieved either stable
      disease or a partial remission following definitive salvage therapy.

      Two cohorts of patients will be enrolled: a cohort treated with salvage chemotherapy but
      considered ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), and a cohort of patients
      who have received ASCT following salvage chemotherapy.
