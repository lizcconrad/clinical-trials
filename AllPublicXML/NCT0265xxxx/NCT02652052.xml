      The investigators hope to find the proof of principle concept from this pilot study so that
      the investigators can design a clinical trial based on the results of the explanatory
      hypothesis.

      HSCT survivors are at an increased risk for premature aging. No one has evaluated the
      biologic markers of premature aging and senescence in HSCT survivors and their correlation
      with clinical outcomes, lifestyle, and nutrition. The investigators will evaluate age-related
      changes in HSCT survivors, with specified measures of premature aging, and employ therapeutic
      opportunities based on targeting senescent cells by conducting the first in-human pilot study
      of senolytic drugs (in HSCT survivors utilizing a combination of senolytics).

          -  Age ≥ 18 years

          -  Adequate blood counts i.e. platelets&gt;50,000 per microliter; HB&gt;9/dL, and ANC&gt; 1000 per
             microliter

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  HSCT survivor with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection

          -  HSCT survivor with active hepatitis B or C HSCT survivor on any TKI for either
             Philadelphia chromosome positive cancers or for GVHD treatments or for any other
             indication (e.g., imatinib for GIST, sorafenib for FLT3+ AML etc)

          -  HSCT survivor with any post-transplant maintenance chemotherapy

          -  Post-transplant relapse of cancer

          -  Active progressive CHRONIC chronic or overlap GVHD (per the NIH chronic GVHD criteria)

             physician)

          -  HSCT survivors with confirmed drug addiction

             congestive heart failure (CHF)

             inducers of CYP3A4(e.g. cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus). If antifungals are
             absolutely necessary from infectious disease perspective, then they will be allowed
             only if the levels are therapeutic. Levels will be checked at baseline and also at day
             +4 post intervention.

          -  Patients taking H2-antagonists or proton pump inhibitors.

          -  Patients on therapeutic doses of anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin, heparin, low molecular
             weight heparin, factor Xa inhibitors etc).

          -  On antiplatelet agents (e.g. full dose aspirin, clopidogrel etc.). Baby aspirin if
             absolutely necessary from cardiac perspective will be allowed.

          -  On any quinolone antibiotic therapy for treatment or for prevention of infections.

          -  QTc&gt;450 msec. Common drugs that are well known in prolonging QTc include azithromycin,
             citalopram, escitalopram, fluconazole, and pentamidine. Baselines EKG will be obtained
             in each patient and if QTc &gt;450 msec, then they will be excluded from the trial.
