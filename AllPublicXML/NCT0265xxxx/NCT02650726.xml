  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HDL function is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Anthocyanin, a
      water-soluble compounds,is beneficial for vascular function by increasing nitric oxide (NO)
      bioavailability and decreasing oxidative stress. This study was designed to evaluate whether
      anthocyanin supplementation might improve cardiovascular function in diabetic patients.

      The study is designed as a randomized, double-blind label, interventional study on patients
      with T2DM. The eligible participants are randomly assigned to control and anthocyanins group.
      During the 24 weeks trial period, the participants are instructed to consume two anthocyanin
      capsules or placebo capsules twice daily (30 minutes after breakfast and supper).

    <measure>anti-inflammatory ability of HDL</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ability of anti-inflammatory ability of HDL is showed as HDL inflammatory index (HII).HII means the ability of apolipoprotein (apo)B-depleted serum to inhibit or enhance the oxidation of LDL in the presence of a fluorescent organic phospholipid 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) fluoresces substrate.</description>

    <description>Endothelial function as determined by the flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and endothelium-independent glyceryltrinitrate-induced dilation (GTND) were measured noninvasively in the right brachial artery by use of a high-resolution ultrasound scanning echo-tracking angiometer.</description>
