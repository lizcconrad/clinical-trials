  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is one of the main treatments for advanced NSCLC. However, chemotherapy induced
      thrombocytopenia (CIT) is one of the most important limitations for subsequent chemotherapy
      of cancer.

      At present, although platelet transfusion is the gold standard to treat severe CIT, its
      clinical application is limited due to many disadvantages, such as short time for storage,
      not easy to save, the risk of infection and immunological diseases. What's more, other
      cytokines including IL-11 and rhTPO, are not so useful in clinical work. It is necessary to
      explore a new therapeutic method to treat CIT.

      Researches show that spleen resection could improve the count of PLT. In this clinical trial,
      we design chemotherapy plus spleen radiotherapy to the subjects with advanced NSCLC,
      simultaneously, who underwent grade II or worse CIT. The primary endpoint is the incidence of
      severe CIT (≧grade III) in subsequent chemotherapy, the second endpoints are recovery time
      from bone marrow suppression and progression free survival, and the exploring index is the
      immulogical status.
