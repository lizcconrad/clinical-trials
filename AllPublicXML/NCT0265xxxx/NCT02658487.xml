    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well vosaroxin and cytarabine work in treating patients with
      untreated acute myeloid leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vosaroxin and
      cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the rate of complete remission (CR) after induction therapy with the combination
      of &quot;7+V&quot; (vosaroxin and standard dose infusional cytosine arabinoside [ara-C]) for patients
      with newly diagnosed, previously untreated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Frequency of grade 3-5 adverse events related to administration of &quot;7+V&quot;.

      II. To evaluate for the presence of minimal residual disease (MRD) remaining after &quot;7+V&quot;
      induction and/or re-induction.

      III. To determine the CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate after one and/or
      2 cycles of &quot;7+V&quot; induction.

      IV. To determine the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery following &quot;7+V&quot; induction.

      V. To assess disease-free survival (DFS) at 1 year (yr) of patients achieving CR/CRi after
      &quot;7+V&quot; induction.

      VI. To assess overall survival (OS) at 1 yr of all patients receiving protocol-defined
      therapy.

      VII. To determine the correlation of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) comorbidity
      index and Wheatley Index scores with disease response, DFS and OS.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  I. To describe the mutational burden of this cohort of AML patients.

        -  II. To correlate genomic aberration with response rate, DFS, and OS.

        -  III. To determine the number of patients treated with vosaroxin who eventually go to
           allogeneic HSCT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive vosaroxin intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 4 and cytarabine IV continuously
      on days 1-7 (Induction-I). Patients with residual leukemia and for whom a second course is
      indicated in the judgment of the investigator may undergo a second course of treatment
      (Induction-II) 14-57 days after day 1 of Induction-1

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

    <description>A likelihood ratio, not a tail area probability (p-value), will be used to represent the strength of statistical evidence with respect to either a 40% or 60% true CR rate. It is assumed the complete remission rate of standard induction chemotherapy is 40% in the targeted population of this trial and that the use of vosaroxin in combination with cytarabine may increase this rate to 60%.</description>

    <description>Events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Frequency and percentage of patients will be summarized for any adverse event by grade, attribution, organ class, and preferred term overall and by patient.

Linear and non-linear regression will be used to model changes over time, accounting for intra-patient correlation using mixed models or generalized estimating equation, as appropriate.</description>
