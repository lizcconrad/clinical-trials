  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single- and multiple-oral
      doses of GS-9674, and characterize the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      GS-9674. The study will be conducted in 3 parts (Part A, Part B, and Part C). Participants
      will receive either GS-9674 or GS-9674 placebo.

      Part A will proceed in 4 prespecified staggered cohorts. Within each cohort, the cumulative,
      blinded safety data will be evaluated for dose escalation from single-dose (Period 1) to
      multiple-dose (Period 2). Based on the available safety, pharmacokinetics, and/or
      pharmacodynamics (PD) data from cohorts in Part A and Part C (if applicable), total daily
      doses and frequency of dosing will be chosen for the cohorts in Part B. Parts B and C will
      consist of adaptive cohorts and may be initiated in parallel. Part B cohorts may be initiated
      in parallel with cohorts in Part A if the total dose under evaluation is at or below a dose
      already evaluated.

      This study is partially blinded (no one is blinded on Day -1).
