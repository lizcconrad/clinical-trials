  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a handheld ultrasound device helps in the
      placement of labor epidurals by studying the accuracy of the Accuro Handheld Ultrasound
      device compared to a standard ultrasound machine.

      Pregnant women who present to Labor and Delivery for an anticipated vaginal delivery will be
      identified as potential participants based on inclusion/exclusion criteria and their desire
      for labor epidural analgesia. Ultrasound evaluations will be conducted in a cohort of 50
      parturients who decide they want epidural analgesia in labor. Prior to epidural placement, a
      hand held ultrasound device will be utilized to identify L2/3, L3/4 and L4/5 interspace. A
      mark will be made on the patient's back at these levels. The handheld ultrasound device will
      also estimate the depth to epidural space at each level using its programmed algorithm. A
      standard ultrasound will then be used to locate the same interspaces, identify midline, and
      estimate depth to epidural space with caliper calculation. Upon patient request, an epidural
      will be placed at L3/4 with a loss of resistance to saline technique. The actual depth to
      loss of resistance during epidural insertion will be determined by measuring the Tuohy with a
      sterile measuring tape while it is in the skin.
