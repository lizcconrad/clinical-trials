  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore whether there is a differential impact of
      verbal versus imagery-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as a treatment augmentation
      strategy for individuals with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Clients who have not
      demonstrated clinically significant change following group CBT for SAD will receive four
      additional sessions of either verbal-based CBT or imagery-based CBT. We hypothesize that that
      individuals who receive imagery-based CBT will experience even stronger improvements and be
      more satisfied with their treatment than individuals who received traditional
      verbal-linguistic CBT.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is a debilitating disorder, marked by significant functional
      impairment and high personal distress for those who suffer. Psychological treatment for SAD
      has traditionally been verbal-linguistic cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). However, a
      significant number of individuals who complete CBT for SAD do not achieve full response and
      continue to struggle with significant residual symptoms. One innovation that has received
      attention recently in the literature is using imagery-based CBT as a way to augment treatment
      outcome in SAD. Results from a pilot and benchmarking study suggest that participants who
      received imagery-based CBT were more likely to complete treatment than those who received
      traditional CBT and treatment outcome was strong for both groups, but stronger in the
      imagery-based CBT group.

      However, before re-training hundreds of practitioners in using a completely novel treatment
      approach, it is important to see if a brief augmentation of traditional CBT programs is
      effective in producing further change for individuals with residual symptoms after group CBT.
      It is possible that individuals just require a few more sessions of the same
      verbal-linguistic CBT to consolidate treatment gains or work on lingering triggers of
      anxiety. It is also possible that more of the same is not as valuable as offering therapy
      using a different modality, such as imagery. Therefore, we propose to evaluate a brief
      imagery-based augmentation of traditional group CBT to explore its effects on further symptom
      reduction.
