    <textblock>
      Effective adjuvant treatment can increase cure in patients with high-risk resected melanoma.
      High dose interferon is a standard of care in the adjuvant setting but is highly toxic and
      marginally effective. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab is the most active regimen
      in patients with advanced melanoma so there is clear rationale to test this regimen in the
      adjuvant setting. Investigators are testing if nivolumab 3mg/kg every 2 weeks with 1mg/kg
      ipilimumab every 6 weeks in the high risk adjuvant setting. The duration of therapy will be
      six months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven melanoma. The primary site of melanoma may be

             Patients with stage T4BN0 are also eligible. It is required that patients with stage
             IIIA disease have &gt; 1mm nodal involvement via pathology assessment of the resected
             node. All patients must be disease free to be eligible.

          -  No prior treatment for melanoma other than surgical resection or radiation. At least 4
             weeks since prior surgery and 3 weeks since prior radiation to registration date.

        Platelets &gt;/= 100 X 109/L; Total Bilirubin â‰¤ 1.5 x ULN except subjects with normal direct
        bilirubin or those with known Gilbert's syndrome. Send information to BrUOG if patient has
        known Gilbert's syndrome AST and ALT &lt;/= 2.5 X ULN Albumin &gt;/= 2.5 g/dL Renal Creatinine OR
