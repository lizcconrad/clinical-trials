  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional hand-stitching colostomy involves extensive hand-stitching by the surgeon. There
      are significant variations in the outcome of surgery due to differences in the suture
      techniques of surgeons. The use of a circular stapler in colostomy seems more rapid and
      efficient colostomy than the conventional methods.But all those reports are single center
      retrospective cohort study，no randomized controlled trials have been carried out so far.The
      aim of this study is to comparing the safety and efficiency of circular stapler-assisted
      colostomy with conventional hand-stitching colostomy in patients with colorectal carcinoma.

    <textblock>
      It has been difficult to standardize the pull-out of the colon and the size, shape and
      sutures of the colostomy due to the different techniques employed and varying levels of skill
      of surgeons in different regions.Thus, various postoperative colostomy complications are
      inevitable after surgery. Surgeons have been looking for a simple and efficient way to
      standardize colostomy and reduce its complications.

      So we want to compare the safety and efficiency of circular stapler-assisted colostomy with
      conventional hand-stitching colostomy in colorectal cancer patients.
