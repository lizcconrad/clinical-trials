  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a dysfunction of endocrine system of women of
      reproductive age. Approximately 5%-10% women in China have this syndrome. Irregular
      menstruation (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea), hirsutism and obesity are the common clinical
      manifestations of PCOS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in
      improving the menstrual frequency of PCOS patients who do not have fertility requirements.

      Methods: A total of 172 participants diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome would be
      randomly assigned to either the acupuncture group or sham-acupuncture group, at a ratio of
      1:1. Participants in both groups will receive treatment for 12 weeks, three times a week. The
      primary outcome will be the proportion of participants with at least a 50% increase from
      baseline in the monthly menstrual frequency from baseline after 12 weeks intervention, while
      secondary outcomes will be the difference in anthropometrics, serum hormone level, ovarian
      morphology, anxiety and depression, and quality of life from baseline to after 12 weeks
      intervention and to 12 weeks post-intervention follow-up between groups.

      Discussion The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for
      improving menstrual frequency and other symptoms of patients with PCOS. The limitation of
      this trial is that it would be difficult to blind the acupuncturists. Additionally, these
      findings may not be suitable for women with PCOS who are seeking pregnancy.

               2. Polycystic ovary morphology is defined as the presence of ≥12 follicles in each
                  ovary measuring 2-9 mm in diameter and/or an ovarian volume &gt;10 mL on
                  transvaginal ultrasound.

          -  Participants who are between 18 to 40 years old.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with fertility requirements.

          -  Participants with oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea caused by hyperandrogenemia, premature
             ovarian failure, or hypothalamus or pituitary disorders.

          -  Participants with hyperandrogenism caused by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's
             syndrome and androgen-secreting tumors.

          -  Participants with endocrine disorders such as thyroid dysfunction, adrenal disorders,
             hyperprolactinemia and diabetes mellitus.

          -  Participants with severe heart disease, hepatic disease, renal system and
             hematopoietic system disease, or malnutrition of the whole body.

          -  Participants who use hormones or other medications that would affect reproductive
             function, or received the same protocol of this study in the past three months.
