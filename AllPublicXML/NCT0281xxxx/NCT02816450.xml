  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the influence of changes in water intake on changes in
      cognitive function among preadolescent children. Further, the proposed work will determine
      the relationship between urinary markers of hydration process and cognitive function. We
      hypothesize that an increase in water intake will result in greater cognitive performance. In
      addition, improvements in hydration demonstrated by lower urine concentration will be
      correlated with greater cognitive performance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Parental/guardian consent

          2. Normal or corrected-to-normal vision based on the minimal 20/20 standard in order to
             complete the cognitive task (below 20/20 vision).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Participants younger than 9 years and older than 10 years at the time of testing age.

          2. Prior diagnosis of cognitive or physical disability, including ADHD (severe asthma,
             epilepsy, chronic kidney disease, and dependence upon a wheelchair/walking aid).

          3. Use of anti-psychotic, anti-depressant, anti-anxiety medication, as well as those
             medications used for ADD/ADHD (use of any anti-psychotic, anti-depressant,
             anti-anxiety, and ADD/ADHD medications).

          4. Participants must have not yet reached, or be in the earliest stages, of puberty, as
             measured by a modified test of the Tanner Staging System

          5. IQ below 85

          6. Use of medications that alter urinary excretion and water metabolism

          7. Use of internal electronic device, such as a pacemaker
