  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cognitive functions in humans are based on asymmetrical brain networks. For example, in
      most adults, the language is essentially processed by the left hemisphere, while other
      auditory functions, such as voice recognition, tend to be processed by the right hemisphere.
      Many studies, especially those conducted by Ghislaine Dehaene's team, have demonstrated the
      presence of anatomical and functional asymmetries by the first months of life. What are the
      causes of these asymmetries? How do they develop? Are they necessary for functioning or
      effective learning?

      This study, conducted in collaboration with the Compi√®gne applied mathematics team (Abdelatif
      El Badia) and the INSERM team (Ghislaine Dehaene), is designed to determine the stage of
      development at which hemispheric dominance for voice recognition is first observed and to
      identify the brain structure involved in preterm neonates whose sound environment is usually
      very different from that of the foetus. The impact of this environment on the infant's brain
      development and early learning will be evaluated.
