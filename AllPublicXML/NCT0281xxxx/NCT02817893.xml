    <textblock>
      The waveform plethysmographic signal can be used to establish an index for predicting fluid
      responsiveness (∆POP: respiratory variation of the plethysmographic waveform of pulse
      oximetry). This index was validated in some studies and because of its non-invasiveness it
      seems very interesting in anesthesia.

      However, in a previous study the investigators evaluated the correlation between the results
      provided by this index (∆POP) and those of the reference index (∆PP: pulse pressure
      variation), and the obtained results were significantly lower than what had been previously
      described. In this study, the index was calculated from a recording of a filtered signal.
      This unavoidable application of a filter on anesthesia monitors could contribute to the
      discrepancy between the ∆POP and the ∆PP.

      The realization of a new study, comparing ∆PP and ∆POP obtained from an unfiltered
      plethysmographic signal, should answer the ∆POP ability to be used in place of ∆PP.
