  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Taxotere-cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy is commonly used as an adjuvant chemotherapy
      regimen in patients with resected early stage breast cancer. TC chemotherapy can cause
      febrile neutropenia (FN) which can be serious and associated with treatment delays and dose
      reductions, thereby compromising treatment efficacy. To reduce the risk of
      chemotherapy-induced FN,TC is administered with either one of two highly effective standard
      treatments; namely primary prophylaxis with either ciprofloxacin or granulocyte
      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). However, there are considerable cost differences between
      these strategies; subcutaneous daily G-CSF costs at least $12,000 over 4 cycles of treatment
      while oral ciprofloxacin costs about $100.

      The investigators have therefore been performing a feasibility study to explore whether the
      &quot;integrated consent model&quot; involving oral consent is feasible in practice; and whether it can
      be used to increase the number of physicians and patients who take part in clinical trials.
      This feasibility study (REaCT-TC NCT02173262) has been an amazing success and the
      investigators are therefore now performing a definitive study comparing G-CSF with
      ciprofloxacin. This study will not be evaluating feasibility endpoints, but rather clinically
      important endpoints of hospitalizations and febrile neutropenia rates.
