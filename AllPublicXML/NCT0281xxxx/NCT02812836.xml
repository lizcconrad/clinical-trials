  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anorectal 3D manometry (3D HRAM) is the most advanced version of manometric equipment that
      measures pressures along the anal canal in a very detailed manner. It provides complete data
      about pressure profile of anorectum and may indicate impaired defecation dynamics. Balloon
      expulsion test (BET) is a cheap, easy way to diagnose constipation as the result of outlet
      obstruction.

      Our aim is to compare this two methods of diagnosis of dyssynergic defecation and to find the
      correlation between this diagnostic equipment.

      Patients with the diagnosis of constipation will be enrolled in the study. Each patient will
      be investigated by anorectal manometry and after the procedure BET will be performed at the
      same day.

      During anorectal manometry conventional manometric parameters will be recorded, such as
      resting pressure, squeeze pressure, bear down manoeuver, thresholds of sensation and
      threshold of recto anal inhibitory reflex. 3D picture of anal canal will be recorded.

      After the manometry standard BET will be performed. The balloon will be inserted into the
      rectum and patient will be asked to expel it in private during 1 min.

      Data from manometry will be correlated with the success rate of BET.

    <description>Each patient will be investigated first by anorectal manometry, standard protocol of conventional parameters will be recorded such as: resting pressure, squeeze pressure, bear down manoeuver, thresholds of sensation and threshold of recto anal inhibitory reflex. 3D picture of anal canal will be recorded. After that balloon with 50 ml of water will be inserted into the rectum and patient will be asked to expel the device within 1 min in privacy.</description>
