  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiological data from Europe have shown that around 30% of subjects aged over 65 years of
      age are pre-frail, and 15% are frail. Recent research has demonstrated that identifying
      frailty and implementing preventive measures can help to slow cognitive decline. Screening
      and treating frailty seem to be a good start towards preventing dependency.

      On the premise that this frailty is the result of more pronounced tissue alterations in
      certain elderly subjects, assessment of post-translational modification derived products
      (PTMDP) represents an innovative evaluation method. These include advanced glycation
      end-products (AGE), and carbamylation-derived products (homocitrulline). Indeed, the
      intensity of these modifications increases with ageing, and assessing the products resulting
      from these alterations could show the existence of differences according to frailty status.
      This would make it possible to adapt treatment accordingly in elderly subjects.
