    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to assess the relationship between personality style,
      self-compassion and depression during pregnancy, to identify psychological risk factors,
      particularly personality styles, that may contribute to the onset of PPD. Additionally, the
      study will provide support for the effectiveness of Internet-based Compassionate-Mind
      Training (iCMT) as a prevention intervention for Postpartum Depression (PPD) for women in the
      2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The study will also assess differences along personality
      predictors and depression severity as they relate to intervention outcomes (i.e. depression
      in postpartum and self-compassion) and engagement. The researchers hypothesize that women
      both at high and low risk for PPD will receive benefits from the intervention, however, those
      who endorse more maladaptive personality traits will likely engage and benefit less than
      those who do not endorse these traits.
