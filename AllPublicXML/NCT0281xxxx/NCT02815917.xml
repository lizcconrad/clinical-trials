  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical work suggests that D3 dopamine receptors may be important in the study of the
      pathophysiology of affective disorders, psychotic disorders and addiction. D3 receptors may
      also play a role in dystonia, Parkinson's disease and response to treatment of these
      disorders. However, there has been a lack of specific radioligands for imaging D3 receptors.
      This proposed protocol will evaluate the uptake of [18F]FTP as a more specific in vivo
      measure of D3 receptor binding in the brain in healthy volunteers subjects after injection of
      lorazepam vs placebo, and in cocaine-dependent subjects. Test-retest scans will evaluate the
      variability of [18F]FTP uptake measures in both healthy volunteer subjects and
      cocaine-dependent subjects.

    <description>Up to 5 healthy volunteers will participate in a double-blind, placebo controlled serial imaging cohort 1a. Each subject will undergo two dynamic [18F]FTP PET/CT brain scans on two separate days. On one scan day the patient will receive an IV injection of normal saline (placebo) prior to the FTP brain scan, on the other scan day the patient will receive an IV injection of lorazepam prior to the planned FTP injection scan. The type of injection (placebo versus lorazepam) will be double-blinded to the patient and the injecting nuclear medicine Authorized User. Up to 5 subjects will participate in Cohort 1b where subjects will undergo two FTP PET/CT with and without perphenazine.
Subjects in all cohorts are required to have a structural brain MRI performed within 1 year of study enrollment. If the subject has not had a brain MRI that is deemed acceptable for use for this study, they will be asked to undergo a research brain MRI after they have consented for this study.</description>

    <description>Up to 5 cocaine-dependent males who are voluntarily seeking treatment for cocaine dependence will participate in this imaging cohort. Each subject will undergo one dynamic [18F]FTP PET/CT brain scan. Patients will have an arterial line placed for blood draws during the scan.
