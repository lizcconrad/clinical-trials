    <textblock>
      There is a lot of confusion when it comes to understanding nutrition information on food
      packages, thus making it difficult for consumers to choose healthy products. In today's busy
      and fast-paced shopping environment, mobile digital technology (for example, Smartphone
      applications) can help consumers make 'healthier' food choices when they are shopping. This
      study will investigate whether a traffic light front-of-pack system or an overall star rating
      system, coupled with an automated healthfulness comparison feature, on a Smartphone app can
      help consumers identify and purchase healthier foods.

    <textblock>
      The rising rate of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases illustrate that Canadians'
      eating habits need to change. Equipping Canadians with information and tools to enable
      healthy food choices that decrease risk for disease is imperative. While the Nutrition Facts
      table (NFt) is the most standardized and complete form of nutrition labelling, studies have
      shown that consumers are confused about serving size, nutrient quantities, and the
      interpretation of the % Daily Value. Thus, expert groups have proposed the introduction of
      interpretive front-of-pack (FOP) nutrition rating systems (e.g. traffic light labelling or
      star ratings) that also help consumers understand the significance of the levels of nutrients
      in relation to the &quot;healthiness&quot; of a food. One of the main barriers to the introduction of
      such a system is the absence of high quality studies that objectively measure the impact of
      nutrition information on actual food purchases. This is a consequence of both the practical
      challenges associated with designing and conducting such studies in 'real-world' settings,
      and the lack of food industry support to quantitatively examine or publish the potential for
      enhanced nutrition labels to modify consumer food choices. With the growing burden of
      diet-related disease, there is an urgent need for robust evidence to evaluate the potential
      for additional interpretive nutrition labelling systems to modify and improve food purchasing
      patterns. Given the relative ubiquity of mobile digital technologies, our Canadian Smartphone
      application (FoodFLIP) provides us with an unprecedented opportunity to examine and improve
      consumers' diets.

      This study will investigate whether a traffic light FOP system or an overall star rating
      system, coupled with an automated healthfulness comparison feature, on a Smartphone app can
      help consumers identify and purchase healthier foods.

      Objective 1: To evaluate the effects of two technology-enabled FOP systems on the nutritional
      quality of foods purchased by consumers compared to a control, and analyze the moderating
      effects of key consumer characteristics, including nutrition literacy.

      Objective 2: To determine which of the two FOP systems support healthier food choices and are
      preferred by Canadian consumers.

    <description>Using the mean FSANZ nutrient profile score, the nutritional quality of foods purchased by the three intervention groups will be compared (mixed models). The FSANZ nutrient profile score is assigned to each food/beverage product by scoring individual points for calories, sugar, sodium, fat, fibre, protein, fruits/vegetables/legumes/seeds/nuts and added/deleted (based on FSANZ nutrient profile criteria) to arrive at a final score (ranging from -18 to +81). Mean nutrient profile scores for all products in each category (e.g Beverages, Dairy Products, Bakery Products etc.) in each intervention arm will be calculated and compared among the intervention groups.</description>

    <description>The usability of the smartphone app is assessed through questionnaires (e.g easy to use, easy to understand etc). Responses on these questionnaires are scaled using a five-point Likert-scale and scores for each question are recorded separately to assess the usability of the smartphone app (e.g 1 least liked to 5 most liked).</description>

    <description>Participants in this group will download an app which features the nutrition information of the selected product in a multiple coloured traffic light format (i.e. the traffic light system shows a coloured round indicator for each of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium; shaded red (high), amber (medium) or green (low), according to thresholds set for each nutrient). In addition, a list of healthier similar products will appear on screen to facilitate comparisons.
