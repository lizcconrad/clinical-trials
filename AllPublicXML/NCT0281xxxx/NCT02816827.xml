    <textblock>
      Intake of caffeinated drinks is known to improve energy levels, alertness, and concentration
      levels. Caffeine is a stimulant of central nervous system and therefore is probably the most
      commonly used psychoactive substance in the world. Caffeine intake is preferred by many
      individuals because moderate amount of caffeine consumption postulates certain beneficial
      effects on nervous system as well as on general well-being, like increase in the level of
      alertness and diminution in exhaustion especially in low arousal circumstances (e.g. working
      at night), improvements in performance on vigilance tasks and simple tasks that require
      sustained response. Along with these virtues caffeine intake is associated with certain
      demerits also. High dose of caffeine that is more than 400 mg a day in healthy adults may be
      associated with adverse events such as psycho motor agitation, insomnia, headache,
      gastrointestinal complaints depending on several other lifestyle parameters.

      Since caffeine intake is habitual, withdrawal of caffeine poses certain concerns on
      performance like its negative impact on mood levels following its withdrawal.

      Hence there is always a need to find an alternative to caffeine which has the same attributes
      of caffeine but is not associated with its habit forming stance. In order to fulfill this
      unmet need Enovate Biolife has designed a novel natural caffeine free ingredient which
      postulates to enhance the mental alertness and combats mental fatigue similar as caffeine
      without causing adverse effects associated with caffeine.
