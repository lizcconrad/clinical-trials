    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-828. TAK-828 is being tested to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in healthy non-Japanese and
      Japanese participants in Parts 1 and 2, respectively.

      The study will enroll approximately 56 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to receive either TAK-828 or matching placebo. This
      assignment will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study
      (unless there is an urgent medical need).

      Proposed doses:

        -  Part 1: TAK-828 15 mg, 45 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, and placebo BID

        -  Part 2: TAK-828 45 mg, and 100 mg, and placebo BID

      All participants will be asked to take the solution at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion:

        For Parts 1 and 2, subject eligibility is determined according to the following criteria
        prior to entry into the study:

          1. In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is capable of understanding and
             complying with protocol requirements.

          2. The subject or, when applicable, the subject's legally acceptable representative,
             signs and dates a written, informed consent form and any required privacy
             authorization prior to the initiation of any study procedures including requesting
             that a subject fast for any laboratory evaluations.

          3. The subject is a healthy male, or a healthy female not of child-bearing potential.
             Females not of childbearing potential are defined as those who have been surgically
             sterilized (hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation) or who are
             postmenopausal (example, defined as at least 1 year since last regular menses, with a
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] level of &gt;40 international units per liter [IU/L]
             or at least 5 years since last regular menses confirmed before any study drug is
             administered).

          4. For Part 1: the subject is a non-Japanese adult, aged 18 to 55 years (inclusive) at
             the time of informed consent and first dose of study drug.

          5. For Part 1: the subject weighs at least 50 kg and has a body mass index (BMI) of 18 to
             30 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2) (inclusive) at Screening.

          6. For Part 2: the subject is of Japanese descent (born to Japanese parents and
             grandparents), aged 20 to 55 years (inclusive) at the time of informed consent and
             first dose of study drug.

          7. For Part 2: the subject weighs at least 45 kilogram (kg) and has a BMI of 18.5 to 25
             kg/m^2 (inclusive) at Screening.

        Exclusion Criteria

        For Parts 1 and 2, any subject who meets any of the following criteria will not qualify for
        entry into the study:

          1. The subject received any investigational compound within 30 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is longer) before the first dose of study drug.

          2. The subject used prescription or nonprescription drugs and dietary supplements within
             7 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) before Check-in (Day -1). Herbal
             supplements and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) must be discontinued 28 days prior
             to Check-in (Day -1). As an exception, acetaminophen may be used at doses of less than
             or equal to (&lt;=) 1 gram/day. Limited use of nonprescription medications that are not
             believed to affect subject safety or the overall results of the study may be permitted
             on a case-by-case basis following approval by the sponsor.

          3. The subject is an immediate family member or study-site employee or is in a dependent
             relationship with a study-site employee who is involved in the conduct of this study
             (example, spouse, parent, child, sibling) or may consent under duress.

          4. The subject has a history or presence of any disease or condition (or there is any
             finding upon review of the subject's medical history, physical examination, or
             clinical laboratory tests giving reasonable suspicion of a disease) that could
             interfere with study participation or safety, contraindicate taking TAK-828 or a
             similar drug in the same class, or potentially confound the study results (example,
             history or presence of clinically significant neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary,
             hepatic, hematologic, renal, immunologic, metabolic, musculoskeletal,
             gastrointestinal, endocrine, or psychiatric disease). It is the responsibility of the
             investigator to assess the clinical significance; however, consultation with the
             Takeda medical monitor may be warranted.

          5. The subject has a known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation of
             TAK-828.

          6. The subject has an active infection at Screening.

          7. The subject has a positive urine drug result for drugs of abuse (defined as any
             illicit drug use) at Screening or Check-in (Day -1).

          8. The subject has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) or a history
             of alcohol abuse within 1 year, or the subject drinks 7 or more drinks/week for
             females or 14 or more drinks/week for males (1 drink=5 ounces [150 milliliter {mL}] of
             wine, 12 ounces [360 mL] of beer, or 1.5 ounces [45 mL] of hard liquor) within 6
             months before the Screening visit or is unwilling to abstain from alcohol and drugs
             throughout the study.

          9. The subject is taking or took any excluded medication, supplements, or food products
             during the time periods listed in the Prohibited Medications, Foods, and Products
             table

         10. If male, the subject intends to donate sperm during the course of this study or for 14
             weeks after the last dose of study drug.

         11. The subject has any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (example,
             gastrectomy).

         12. The subject has a history of cancer, except basal cell carcinoma that has been in
             remission for at least 5 years before Screening.

         13. The subject has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody at Screening or has a known history of human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

         14. The subject used nicotine-containing products (including, but not limited to,
             cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, nicotine patch, or nicotine gum) within 28
             days prior to Check-in (Day -1) or cotinine test is positive at Screening or Check-in
             (Day -1).

         15. The subject has poor peripheral venous access.

         16. The subject donated or lost 450 mL or more of his or her blood volume (including
             plasmapheresis) or had a transfusion of any blood product within 30 days prior to Day
             1.

         17. The subject has a Screening or Check-in (Day -1) abnormal (clinically significant)
             ECG. Entry of any subject with an abnormal (not clinically significant) ECG must be
             approved, and documented by signature of the principal investigator or medically
             qualified subinvestigator.

         18. The subject has abnormal Screening or Day -1 laboratory values that suggest a
             clinically significant underlying disease or the subject has the following laboratory
             abnormalities: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and/or aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             greater than (&gt;) 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN).

         19. The subject has a creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) or cardiac troponin above the
             ULN at Screening or Day -1.

         20. If female, the subject is of childbearing potential (example, premenopausal, not
             sterilized).
