      Does baseline impedance measured during the landmark phase of esophageal High resolution
      impedance manometry HRIM correlates with direct mucosal impedance measurement and
      discriminates GERD from non GERD patients?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to the Mayo Clinic Rochester for a clinically indicated high resolution
      impedance manometry (HRIM), 24 hour impedance pH (MII-pH) study, and
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) will be recruited. Gastroesophageal reflux will be defined
      as a total 24 hour esophageal acid exposure time ≥5% regardless of concomitant Proton Pump
      inhibitor (PPI) use. A negative 24 hour MII-pH study will be defined as an acid exposure time
      ≤2% off PPI therapy or ≤1% if on PPI therapy.

    <description>Patient's having a clinically indicated endoscopy, a high resolution impedance manometry and a 24 hour pH impedance study.
During the clinical endoscopy, the 2.13 mm catheter will be passed through the channel of the standard endoscope this is called an Intraluminal Impedance. This device has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but it is considered to be minimal risk related to using it.</description>

    <description>During the clinical endoscopy, the 2.13 mm catheter will be passed through the channel of the standard endoscope this is called an Intraluminal Impedance. The Intraluminal impedance (made by Sandhill Scientific) has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but it is considered to be minimal risk related to using it. The catheter gives the investigators a reading at each level.
The catheter will be placed on the esophageal mucosa 5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction (where the stomach and esophagus meet) for 5 second
At 10 cm above the gastroesophageal junction the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds
And at 20 cm</description>
