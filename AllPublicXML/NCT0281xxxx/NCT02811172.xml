      Background Despite of advances in research, at the moment, various points related to the
      physiology of gestation and the etiology of severe diseases that can be developed in the
      course of it remain unknown. One of those aspects is the behavior of biomarkers
      (triglycerides, prolactin, glucose and cholesterol) during pregnancy, which experience a
      gradual increase in their levels until they reach the peak of hypertriglyceridemia, a few
      days before delivery. Several studies have reported that biomarkers experience a higher
      elevation in diabetic and obese pregnant women and in those women who suffer preeclampsia.
      The description of their behavior in different population of pregnant women (healthy women
      and women at risk) would identify the relation of these with some of the alterations that
      occurs more frequently during pregnancy.

      Objective The aim of this study is to develop a multi-paradigm biological model of systems to
      determine triglyceride, prolactin, glucose and cholesterol levels during pregnancy and its
      relation with lactogenesis in healthy and risk pregnant women.

      Methods A prospective cohort study will take place with women during pregnancy and lactation.
      Participating women will be divided into two groups. One group will be integrated by healthy
      women and the other group by pregnant women with a risk medical history. The personal, family
      and a detailed medical history will be collected in each group. A study of all the variables
      which influence the level of the mentioned biomarkers (triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose
      and prolactin) will be done.

      The universe consists in 4,300 women, who constitute the historical average deliveries during
      the semester in the city of Granada (Spain). The sample collection will be made in medical
      office's pregnancy control in Granada's hospitals, in their respective health centers and
      during the second half of 2015. The sample will be stratified and probabilistic.
      Peculiarities of pregnant women will be taken into account when calculating the size of the
      study sample. This sample will be made up of 224 women who comply with the inclusion criteria
      and that have signed the informed consent.

      To achieve the project objectives an organization comprising six theoretical and practical
      phases enabling the scientific development of the project.

      During the first phase, the technical and administrative preparation of the project is
      constructed. Thereafter, the work is divided into two action areas which encompass the
      collection and data modeling.

      The creation of a biological multi-paradigm computer simulation model of the levels of
      biomarkers in different months of pregnancy and in the various pathologies of pregnant women
      can be very effective to know the risks that involve high levels of lipids for the mother and
      for the baby.

    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Begins in the 20 weeks and ended 20 days after delivery. Since the 37 week is taken each 72 hours and then daily when an increase of the values occurs and it's followed until 20 days after delivery.
Measures during this stage are performed with the reagent disk Piccolo®, using the blood analyzer Piccolo express™. It is designed for using in quantitative determination &quot;in vitro&quot; of the total cholesterol, High Density Lipoproteins and triglycerides in a clinic laboratory.
The levels of normality have been stablished to the following biomarkers:
Triglycerides levels: under 150 mg/dl, with a high limit between 155 and 199 mg/dl and higher between 200 and 499 mg/dl. During pregnancy it is recommended to keep it under 300 mg/dl.</description>

    <description>Gestational diabetes: it is diagnose when in the O'Sullivan test the values are equal or superior to the following: blood sugar 105 mg/dl; 1 hour,190 mg/dl; 2 hours, 165 mg/dl and 3 hours, 145 mg/dl.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>cholesterol levels</measure>
    <time_frame>18 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the values of total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides the samples should be taken after 8 or 12 hours without eating.
The test begins after 10 minutes of transferring the sample to the disk. The levels of normality are:
Total cholesterol: under 200 mg/dl. LDL cholesterol: 40-60 mg/dl, values under 40 mg/dl indicate a higher risk of cardiovascular disease.</description>

    <measure>Nutritional evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>In the first interview to the pregnant woman and after the sign of the informed consent the medical record is performed. Nutritional evaluation is carry out through a validate survey that was published in 2012 by our research team (González Jiménez et al., 2012).
Bioelectrical impedance was also performed. In clinical history socio demographics variables personal and familiars were collected and anxiety and depressive test were performed (Snaith &amp; Zigmond, 1983).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Collection of samples: mother's milk</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is about to follow the evolution of the process of lactation and the quality of mother's milk. In each group of study three samples are collected: colostrum (2 to 6 days after delivery); transition milk (7 to 21 days after delivery) and maturing milk (after 21 days of delivery).
Lactogenesis is the process that begins with milk secretion. It is stablished between 24 hours and the sixth day after delivery and is a consequence of the action of prolactin and the low estrogenic level. Before delivery, PRL levels increase but the estrogens of placenta blocked the secretion of glands. The maintaining of lactation requires a continuous suction of the nipple. The estrogenic fall after delivery allows unblock or mammary tissue.</description>
