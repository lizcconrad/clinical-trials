  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational, retrospective database study of patients with uterine
      fibroids is to compare the durability of symptom relief after uterus-conserving treatments
      for symptomatic fibroids in terms of incidence of, and time to, new or recurrent symptoms and
      subsequent procedures and evaluate the effect stakeholder participation had on the research
      process.

        The patient population for the retrospective data analysis was uterine fibroid patients who
        have a record of at least 1 of the procedures of interest occurring during the time period
        of January 1, 2005 - December 31, 2011, with the first instance being designated as the
        index date. The study time period spanned from January 1, 2004 - December 31, 2013 to allow
        for 12 months pre-index for evaluating baseline demographic and clinical characteristics
        and 24 months post-index, ensuring a minimum of 2 years follow-up.
