  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The closed-loop delivery system is composed of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose sensor
      and a dosing algorithm that calculates the insulin dose to infuse based on sensor readings.
      Pramlintide is a drug and an analog of amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in
      healthy individuals, and is deficient in people with type 1 diabetes. Co-injection of
      pramlintide with insulin at meal times improves glucose control in type 1 diabetes.
      Literature data suggests that regular insulin may better match the effect of pramlintide
      compared to rapid insulin in regulating post-prandial glucose levels.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 3 strategies to control your
      day-and-night glucose levels:

        1. rapid insulin-alone closed-loop delivery;

        2. rapid insulin-plus-pramlintide closed-loop delivery;

        3. regular insulin-plus-pramlintide closed-loop delivery.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. During closed-loop control, the simultaneous basal-bolus infusion of pramlintide and
           fast-acting insulin improves glucose control compared to fast-acting insulin-alone
           infusion.

        2. During closed-loop control, the simultaneous basal-bolus infusion of pramlintide and
           regular insulin improves glucose control compared to fast-acting insulin-alone infusion.

      The closed-loop delivery system is composed of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose sensor
      and a dosing algorithm that calculates the insulin dose to infuse based on sensor readings.
      Pramlintide is a drug and an analog of amylin, a hormone that is co-secreted with insulin in
      healthy individuals, and is deficient in people with type 1 diabetes. Co-injection of
      pramlintide with insulin at meal times improves glucose control in type 1 diabetes.

      Literature data suggests that the pharmacodynamics of regular insulin may better match the
      effect of pramlintide compared to the pharmacodynamics of fast-acting insulin. Moreover, the
      cost of regular insulin is significantly lower than fast-acting insulin. Therefore, if a
      similar (or better) glucose profile can be achieved with regular insulin-plus-pramlintide
      compared to fast-acting insulin-plus-pramlintide, then a co-formulation employing regular
      insulin should be prioritized.

      Therefore, in this protocol, we aim to assess the effect of the simultaneous, closed-loop,
      basal-bolus infusion of pramlintide with insulin at a fixed ratio in controlling glucose
      levels. In the first experimental arm, we propose to infuse pramlintide with fast-acting
      insulin. In the second experimental arm, pramlintide will be infused with regular insulin.
      The control arm will be fast-acting insulin-alone closed-loop system.

      The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of the simultaneous, closed-loop, basal-bolus
      infusion of pramlintide with fast-acting insulin at a fixed ratio and pramlintide with
      regular insulin at a fixed ratio in controlling glucose levels compared to fast-acting
      insulin-alone closed-loop infusion.

      The investigators aim to conduct a randomized, three-way, crossover trial to compare the
      efficacy of 1) fast-acting insulin-plus-pramlintide closed-loop delivery, 2) regular
      insulin-plus-pramlintide closed-loop delivery, and 3) fast-acting insulin-alone closed-loop
      delivery in regulating glucose levels over a period of 24 hours in a study on adults in
      inpatient settings. Insulin (fast-acting and regular) and pramlintide are given with fixed
      ratio (6 Âµg of pramlintide for each unit of insulin).

      Before each 24-hour intervention visit, the participant's insulin therapy (basal rates and
      insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios) will be optimized for a minimum of 10 days, with a target of
      14 days.

      There will be a wash-out period of 0 to 42 days between the three intervention arms
      (termination of 24-hr intervention and start of next optimization period).

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. During closed-loop control, the simultaneous basal-bolus infusion of pramlintide and
           fast-acting insulin improves glucose control compared to fast-acting insulin-alone
           infusion.

        2. During closed-loop control, the simultaneous basal-bolus infusion of pramlintide and
           regular insulin improves glucose control compared to fast-acting insulin-alone infusion.

    <description>Subjects will be admitted at the research facility at 7:30. A cannula will be inserted into an arm or a hand vein for blood sampling purposes. Each 24-hour intervention visit includes 3 standardized meals (8:00, 12:00, and 17:00), an evening snack (21:00) and an overnight stay. The glucose level as measured by the real time sensor will be entered manually into the computer every 10 minutes. The insulin and pramlintide pumps' infusion rates will then be changed manually based on the computer generated recommendation, while still maintaining the ratio. The computer generated recommendations are based on a predictive algorithm.</description>
