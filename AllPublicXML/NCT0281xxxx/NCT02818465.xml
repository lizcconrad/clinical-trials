  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with an extensive vasculopathy and high
      cardiovascular mortality as well as an accumulation of uremic toxins. Among the latest,
      advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) interact with RAGE. Investigators aimed to analyze the
      role of RAGE in the calcification process of hemodialyzed patients, in a correlative and
      prospective study. Vascular calcifications will be assessed by Xray and tomodentimetry while
      accumulation of AGEs will be measured in the serum and in the skin (non invasive).
      Additionally factors influencing RAGE activation such as genetic polymorphism and level of
      soluble forms of RAGE will be measured and analyzed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Renal impairment

          -  Hemodialysis for more than 3 months

          -  Have agreed to participate in research

          -  Affiliated to a social security scheme

          -  major

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetes , for diabetes induces accelerated formation of advanced glycation end
             products , which could then be a confounding factor in our study.

          -  minors

          -  pregnant women

          -  Matt or pigmented skin because the skin hyperpigmentation interfere with reading the
             skin fluorescence giving falsely elevated values .
