    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of a community-based counseling intervention to improve
      contraception among residents in two deprived neighborhoods in Barcelona (Spain). Half of the
      participants received contraceptive counseling at the community setting, while the other half
      acted as a control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effects of a community-based counseling intervention to improve contraception
      among residents in deprived neighborhoods a randomized controlled trial is performed. Women
      aged 14-49 years and men aged 14-39 years from two low income neighborhoods in Barcelona
      (Catalonia, Spain) who had not undergone an irreversible contraceptive method and aren't
      planning a pregnancy have been recruited in 2011-13. The intervention consists of a
      culturally developed and theoretically-based brief counseling in community settings. The
      primary outcome is the consistent use of very effective contraceptive methods (optimal use).
      Secondary outcomes analyzed are the incorrect use of very effective contraceptive methods and
      use of less effective methods stratified by sex and migrant status. Differences within
      subgroups from baseline to 3 months - follow up are analyzed and intervention effects are
      assessed with adjusted robust Poisson regressions.

    <description>A culturally adapted counselling session lasting up to 45 minutes at the community setting. The interview is based in WHO guidelines and communication tools, in social cognitive theory and in motivational interviewing. Along the interview, topics follow easy to read leaflets prepared to discuss the main benefits of contraception from the view of the immigrant communities, with guided discussions on family planning in the life course, the amount of time required to care children, the economic resources that newborn and children need, and an assessment of the knowledge on the contraceptive methods, and of their current use. Contraceptive methods, abortion and emergency contraception are discussed. Primary health care centre and sexual and reproductive health clinic access is reinforced.</description>
