  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endodontic therapy is to achieve the eviction of the inflamed or infected pulp and fill the
      canal opening with a hermetic sealing material.

      The analysis of the literature on intracanal therapeutic shows great variability of the
      results obtained, the reported success rate is 53 to 95%.

      This is explained by the difficulty of the surgical procedure, but also by the multiplicity
      of possible factors of failure, related practitioner, canal anatomy, the operating
      procedures, the preparation techniques and root canal filling. This success rate is variable
      depending on the presence or absence of periapical pathology before treatment: more than 85%
      for teeth treated without initial periapical pathology against only 62% for teeth with
      pathology before treatment. Furthermore, the literature review revealed two contradictory
      assumptions about the dominant factor failure in endodontics: the failure of the sealing
      canal system (bad level shutter) against the failure of the endovascular disinfection.

      Main hypothesis of the research objectives:

      The probability of success in a year endodontic treatments carried out according to the
      recommendations and the operating standards on teeth with periapical pathology is
      approximately 60%.

      The primary prognostic factors would be the existence of intracanal obstacles (stop
      calcification ...) responsible for a sub-obturation of the canal, factors inherent to the
      tooth (situation ductal anatomy and complexity), the operating techniques used, the
      practitioner ( skill level), the quality of the restoration.
