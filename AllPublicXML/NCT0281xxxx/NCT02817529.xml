      Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy is a device aiding airway clearance and secretion
      mobilization, also prevent the small airway from collapsing. The purpose of this research is
      to compare two PEP devices (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet) in stable COPD patients. Patients'
      compliance, satisfaction, 3 months and 6 months lung function test and life quality will be
      compared.

      Background : Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy is a type of airway clearance therapy
      in which the patient exhales through a resistance, which helps to shift the pressure points
      that aid mobilization of sputum and prevent the lung from collapsing. PEP therapy helps
      patients reduce the need for ventilatory support, improve hyperinflation and dyspnea.
      Although PEP devices are used, only a few studies have compared their beneficial effects and
      preference among COPD patients.

      Objective: The purpose of this research is to compare two PEP devices (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet)
      in stable COPD patients. .

      Methods:

      A baseline assessment of the patient will be taken at the beginning, three months and the end
      of six months, including patients' ability to clear secretions via Breathlessness, Cough and
      Sputum Scale (BCSS), patients' self-reported quality of life via St. George's Respiratory
      questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores, pt's satisfaction with each
      device, and cardio-pulmonary function via pulmonary function test and six minute walk test in
      three and six months.

      Subsequently, patients will be randomly assigned a PEP device (Pulmonica, RC-Cornet) and
      given instructions on how to properly use the device including frequency of PEP therapy. Each
      patient will receive a monthly follow-up call in order to determine adherence and
      satisfaction with PEP therapy, also BCSS, SGRQ and CAT scores.

    <description>The RC-Cornet is a device that provides oscillatory positive expiratory pressure (OPEP) therapy for the detachment and removal of pulmonary secretions. Through variable pressure settings and optional aerosolized medication delivery, patients realize maximum efficacy specific to their unique clinical needs.The RC-Cornet uses the patient's full expired air volume to produce pressure and oscillatory vibrations. Participants who will be instructed to inhale and exhale through the PEP device at least ten times daily for up to six months.</description>
