  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NC-6004 is a polymeric micelle containing cisplatin as an active moiety. The nanoparticle
      provides sustained release of the active moiety and utilizes the enhanced permeability and
      retention (EPR) effect to target release of platinum to tumors. This Phase I study aims to
      establish a recommended dose (RD) for the triplet combination of NC-6004 plus 5-FU and
      cetuximab as first-line treatment in patient with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck for further clinical study development.

      1. Primary objectives

           ♦ To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of NC-6004 according to the Dose
           Limiting Toxicity (DLT) in combination with 5-FU plus cetuximab as firstline treatment
           in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and
           neck (SCCHN), and to decide the RD for the following studies

        2. Secondary objectives 1). To evaluate the safety and tolerability profile of NC-6004 in
           combination with 5- FU plus cetuximab 2). To assess the pharmacokinetic effects of
           NC-6004 3). To assess the antitumor effects of NC-6004
