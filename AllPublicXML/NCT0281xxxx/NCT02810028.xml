  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adults, muscle diseases are usually chronic long-term conditions that do not have a
      definitive cure. Supportive care has been shown to reduce complications from muscle disease
      and improved survival in some cases. However, there has been limited research to evaluate
      interventions that may improve quality of life (QoL) with this patient group. The QoL of
      those with MD is not just affected by the severity of their MD but also a variety of
      psychological variables. Based upon the knowledge of these psychological variables the
      investigators feel that a particular type of psychological intervention known as &quot;acceptance
      and commitment therapy&quot; (ACT) could potentially improve QoL in those with MD. The
      investigators therefore propose to test whether ACT does in fact improve QoL in those with MD
      by randomising 154 patients to receive either standard medical care plus a guided self-help
      ACT programme, or standard medical care only.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research has shown that while QoL is determined by the severity of the MD, this does
      not explain all aspects of the reduced QoL of those with MD. Previous research suggested that
      a cognitive behavioural approach using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) would best
      suit those with MD. A pilot study of this approach in seven participants with MD was
      promising, and has led to this definitive trial of ACT. The aim of this study is to determine
      the efficacy of an ACT intervention to improve the QoL of individuals with MD.

      Patients with one of the following muscle diseases will be recruited: limb girdle muscular
      dystrophy, dystrophinopathies resulting in a Becker' muscular dystrophy phenotype,
      facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy and inclusion body myositis. Patients will be
      recruited primarily through muscle clinics at King's College Hospital (KCH) and The Royal
      London Hospital (RLH) but also via Muscular Dystrophy UK (MDUK) and UK registries of patients
      with these muscle diseases.

    <description>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a form of cognitive behavioural therapy focused explicitly on promoting psychological flexibility. An ACT programme suits the aims of the study because it targets avoidance of distress, promotes acceptance of illness through motivating meaningful activity outside of illness, improves the processes that underlie beliefs rather than by directly challenging beliefs, thus reducing possible trivialisation of the understandable distress caused by living with MD.</description>
