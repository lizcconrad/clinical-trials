    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of TD-1473 in subjects with moderately-to-severely active UC over 28
      days. This exploratory study will also serve as a signal seeking endeavor to demonstrate
      biologic effect associated with TD-1473 through biomarker analysis and clinical, endoscopic,
      and histologic assessments.

             investigational drug was a biologic or another Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, or is
             currently participating in another trial of an investigational drug (or medical
             device)

          -  Use of prescription medications started or with a dose adjustment within 4 weeks prior
             to study enrollment, or over-the-counter medications or supplements started or with a
