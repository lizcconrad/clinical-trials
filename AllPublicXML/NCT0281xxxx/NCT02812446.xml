      The purpose of this study is to identify bacterial and/or clinical features involved in the
      pathogenesis of Staphylococcus aureus implant-associated infections (IAI). Materials &amp;
      methods: In total, 57 IAI S. aureus and 31 nasal carriage (NC) S. aureus isolates were
      studied. Staphylococcus aureus genetic background was obtained by microarray analysis.
      Multilocus sequence typing was performed to determine clonal complexes (CC). Biofilm
      production was investigated by resazurin and crystal violet methods

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to identify phenotypic (biofilm production) markers in two different groups of S. aureus strains isolated from patients with IAI or screened from nasal carrier in noninfected patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.
By using resazurin method, IAI and NC nasal carriage isolates were divided into three groups. Isolates were classified as strong, moderate and weak biofilm producers.</description>

    <description>The primary aim of this study is to identify genotypic markers in two different groups of S. aureus strains isolated from patients with IAI or screened from nasal carrier in noninfected patients undergoing orthopedic surgery.
IAI and NC isolates genetic background was determined in order to compare the prevalence of individual virulence factor genes. All genes provided by the Alere StaphyType DNA microarray were studied.</description>

      A total of 57 nonduplicate S. aureus clinical isolates collected from implant-associated
      infections (IAI) between January 2007 and December 2010 at Nantes University Hospital
      (France) were analyzed. IAI were confirmed using Infectious Diseases Society of America
      criteria for bone and joint infections. Thirty-five isolates came from hip arthroplasty, 18
      from knee replacement and four from osteosynthesis. Thirty-one S. aureus isolates were
      collected from 100 noninfected patients screened for S. aureus nasal colonization from
      December 2011 to February 2012 at the orthopedic consultation ward.

        Fifty-five IAI patients were included; two of them had two different S. aureus IAI
        episodes. The median age was 73 years (range: 21-96 years) with 29 women (52.7%). Twenty
        seven percent of patients suffered from diabetes and were smokers.

        Nine patients including six women were immunosuppressed with a median age of 71 years. The
        main diagnosis for arthroplasty was arthrosis (38%). Implants were hip prosthesis (n = 35),
        knee prosthesis (n = 18) and osteosynthesis (n = 4). Main local consequences of IAI were
        scarce alteration (n = 34) and skin fistulization (n = 22). These IAI were treated by
        surgical removal of all infected tissue and implant or a combination of debridement with
        implant retention associated to long-term antimicrobial therapy active against biofilm
        microorganisms. Eighteen early, nine delayed and 30 late infections occurred. Blood group
        phenotypes were available for 54 patients and were distributed as follows: 26 O group, 17 A
        group, 10 B group and one AB group.
