  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase 3 study is to determine if subcutaneous velcade is non-inferior to
      intravenous velcade when administered in combination with low-dose dexamethasone in chinese
      refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (r/rMM) patients. The study will assess the overall
      response rate after 4 cycles of velcade and dexamethasone administration.
