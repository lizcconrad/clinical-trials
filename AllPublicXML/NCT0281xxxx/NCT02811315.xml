        Patients eligible to be prescribed fluticasone/formoterol fixed dose combination as
        follows:

        Patients not adequately controlled in inhaled corticosteriods and &quot;as required&quot; inhaled
        short acting beta 2 agonist or patients already adequately controlled on both an inhaled
        corticosteriod and a long-acting beta 2 agonist.

        The decision to prescribe fluticasone/formoterol fixed dose combination will precede and be
        independent of the decision to enroll the patient into the study.
