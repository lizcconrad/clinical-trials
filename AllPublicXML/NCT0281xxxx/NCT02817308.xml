  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is the fifth leading cause of cancer related deaths in
      the European Union. Tumor markers CA19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen are important
      components in decision making and follow-up of patients diagnosed with this disease.

      These tumor markers were found to be elevated not only in the serum but also in other body
      fluids in patients with malignant lesions of the parotid gland and the urinary tract. The
      authors have described in a previews small preliminary study a positive and a strong linear
      correlation between the levels of CA19-9 in urine and saliva with those presented in the
      serum of patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. The current study seeks to
      enlarge the study population to confirm the previous results and standardize the measured
      levels of CA19-9 in these body fluids.
