  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring the bispectral index (BIS) as a peri-operative hemodynamic tool appears to be
      justified by the agreement between various clinical situations in which BIS monitoring
      appears to be of value: the prognosis in traumatic head injury, the diagnosis of brain death
      , and the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism. The current controversy concerning the
      &quot;triple low&quot; state reinforces the need for an accurate study in this field. Furthermore, the
      recent review by Bidd argues in this sense.
