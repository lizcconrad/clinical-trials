  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study is to assess and confirm the adequate immunogenicity and safety profile of the Sanofi
      Pasteur's DTaP-Hep B-IPV-PRP-T fully liquid combined hexavalent vaccine administered in
      HIV-exposed uninfected infants (HIV-exposed uninfected) and in HIV-exposed infected infants
      (HIV-exposed infected).

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the 3-dose primary
           series in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To describe the persistence of all antibodies before receipt of the booster vaccination
           in HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To evaluate the immunogenicity of the study vaccine 1 month after the booster dose in
           HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe the safety profile after each and all doses of the study vaccine
           administered as a 3-dose infant primary series in HIV-exposed infected and in
           HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

        -  To describe the safety profile of the study vaccine administered as a booster in
           HIV-exposed infected and in HIV-exposed uninfected infants.

      Male and female infants born from HIV-infected mothers will be tested for HIV infection from
      birth to 6 weeks of age. HIV infected and HIV uninfected participants will be enrolled into
      two groups at Day 0. Some infants will be detected outside of this screening and will already
      have proof of HIV infection, and will be enrolled in the study at Day 0. All participants
      will receive primary vaccinations with Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine at
      6, 10 and 14 weeks of age and a booster dose at approximately 15 to 18 months of age will
      receive a booster dose of the Sanofi Pasteur's DTaP-IPV-HB-PRP-T combined vaccine.
