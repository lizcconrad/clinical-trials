    <textblock>
      This study will help the investigators design a method to detect the disease-causing immune
      cells in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Such methods are not currently available,
      but if successful, would help scientists to better understand the causes of RA.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are interested in learning about the immune cells in the blood that
      contribute to disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They have developed a
      method for identifying a specific type of immune cells that can react against normal tissues
      in the body.

      In this study, the investigators will enroll RA patients from the University of Minnesota
      clinics, collect blood samples from enrolled patients, and process the blood samples to
      isolate DNA, RNA, serum, and blood cells. They will use the serum to detect whether specific
      autoantibodies (Anti-cyclic Citrullinated Peptide, or anti-CCP) are present. In cases where
      anti-CCP antibodies are detected, the investigators may quantify the numbers of immune cells
      present that contain receptors with the same anti-CCP specificity. They may also test whether
      the numbers of immune cells with these receptors correlate with measures of disease activity
      in RA patients.
