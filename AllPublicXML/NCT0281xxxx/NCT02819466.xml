  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspiration pneumonia is a dreaded complication of anaesthesia because of its prevalence
      (1/3,886 cases in elective anaesthesia and 1/895 cases in emergency settings) and its high
      morbidity and mortality (3 to 9%). This chemical and/or infectious pneumonia is secondary to
      passage of the gastric contents into the unprotected upper airways during general
      anaesthesia. The prognosis depends on three factors: the presence of food debris, and the
      acidity and volume of the gastric contents. To prevent this complication, the French society
      of anaesthesia and intensive care recommends preoperative fasting rules and, in patients
      presenting risk factors for aspiration, the use of antacids and rapid sequence intubation.
      This preventive strategy is associated with certain adverse events: deferred operative
      procedures, discomfort and hypoglycaemia secondary to fasting, more frequent anaphylactic
      complications, and memory of anaesthetic induction.

      Over recent years, ultrasound has become more widely used by anaesthetists for local
      anaesthesia, vascular catheterization, haemodynamic monitoring and, more recently, 2D
      ultrasound estimation of intragastric volume. However, 2D ultrasound estimation of
      intragastric volume presents several limitations: because of the complex shape of the
      stomach, this technique requires a long learning curve and the measured volume is poorly
      correlated with reference techniques (MRI and 99Tc scintigraphy). Two studies have recently
      measured intragastric volume by three dimensional ultrasound with promising results.
