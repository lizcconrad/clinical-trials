  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (HCl)
      extended release (CER) 15 mg once daily in subjects with muscle spasms associated with acute
      painful musculoskeletal conditions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (HCl)
      extended-release (CER). CER is being tested to treat people who have muscle spasms associated
      with acute painful musculoskeletal conditions. This study will look at medication
      helpfulness, relief from muscle spasms and pain, and improvement in range of motion and daily
      living activities.

      The study will enroll approximately 180 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  CER 15 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a capsule that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one capsule at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record rating of medication helpfulness, relief from
      local pain, clinical global impression
