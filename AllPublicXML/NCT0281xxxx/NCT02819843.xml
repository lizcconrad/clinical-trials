  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II clinical study is to test the good and bad effects of T-VEC
      (talimogene laherparepvec) with or without hypofractionated radiotherapy on people with
      melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, or other solid tumors with skin metastasis.

    <description>Patients will receive 3 radiotherapy treatments (one treatment every 3-5 days) during weeks 3 and 4. The first treatment will occur 6 (+/- 2) hours after the Talimogene Laherparepvec administration at week 3.Talimogene Laherparepvec will be administered at weeks 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 15. The first dose of Talimogene Laherparepvec will be 10^6 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL, followed three weeks later by a dose of 10^8 pfu/mL.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Man or woman ≥ 18 years old

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 4 months

          -  Histopathologically confirmed melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma or other solid tumor
             malignancy

          -  Cutaneous subcutaneous soft tissue, or superficial lymphatic metastasis not suitable
             for surgical resection

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

          -  Cutaneous subcutaneous soft tissue, or superficial lymphatic metastasis that is
             amenable to injection and irradiation and &gt; 10 mm in longest dimension

             ° Cutaneous metastasis in a region of previous radiation therapy is amenable to
             radiation therapy as part of this protocol if at least 6 months has elapsed since
             prior radiotherapy and the dose of radiotherapy previously administered did not exceed
             an equivalent dose of 60 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent fractions at the skin surface (using
             linear-quadratic modeling with alpha/beta=11.5)

          -  Metastasis that is &gt; 10 mm in longest dimensionor exhibits radiotracer uptake
             consistent with metastasis on PET/CT

          -  Adequate coagulation function (platelet count &gt;50 k/mcL, international normalized
             ratio of &lt; 1.5)

          -  Completion of other cancer therapy (targeted therapy, chemotherapy, investigational
             therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery) 14 days prior to first dose of protocol
             therapy
