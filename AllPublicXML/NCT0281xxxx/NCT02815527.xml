      This study evaluates the feasibility of a high whey-protein enteral nutrition formula in 20
      ventilated ICU patients. The primary endpoint of study is the feasibility to attain the
      individualized protein target (≥1.2 g/kg ideal body weight/day) 96-hours after ICU admission.
      Secondary endpoints include tolerance and efficacy in terms of the amino acid response in
      blood.

      In the present pilot study, the investigators will use a high whey-protein nutrition formula
      during the first four days of ICU admission. The reason for using a high protein nutrition is
      that the investigators previously found that an early high protein intake in non-septic
      non-overfed patients was associated with lower hospital mortality (Weijs PJM et. al.,
      Critical Care 2014,18). Furthermore, during the first days of critical illness tolerance to
      full enteral nutrition is often diminished. The use of a high protein nutrition will
      facilitate an early high protein intake.

      The whey protein is hydrolysed. Hydrolyzation of protein prevents coagulation and subsequent
      solidification in the digestive tract and therefore promotes efficient absorption of the
      protein. Of all nutrition proteins, whey protein has the largest leucin content. Leucin is
      crucial for muscle protein synthesis. (Meyer RF, et.al.: BMC Gastroenterol 2015, 15), (Marik
      PE: Ann Intensive Care 2015,5:51)

      Our previous observational data also showed that early overfeeding was associated with higher
      mortality, while an intake of 80-100% of measured energy expenditure at day 4 of ICU
      admission was associated with lower mortality. (Weijs PJM et. al., Critical Care 2014, 18)

      Therefore, the energy target during the first four days will be 90% of the measured Energy
      Expenditure (EE). To optimize energy intake, the investigators will measure EE by metabolic
      monitoring (Deltatrac®, Datex, Helsinki, Finland), If metabolic monitoring is not available,
      the investigators will assess EE from the ventilator derived VCO2 (8.19*VCO2). (Stapel S,
      et.al., Critical Care 2015,19:370)
