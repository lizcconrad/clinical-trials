  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate feasibility, safety and effectiveness of the first
      generation transfemoral JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System (formerly named JenaValve TAVI Plus
      System- Transfemoral) in an elderly patient population with severe aortic stenosis who are at
      high risk for surgical aortic valve replacement.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, multi-center trial conducted at 2 centers in Germany
      enrolling up to 12 subjects. Each patient will be followed for 2 years. The last patient's
      follow-up will end in February 2016. It is planned that the study will end in June 2016.
      Study endpoints are defined in accordance with the &quot;Standardized endpoint definitions for
      transcatheter aortic valve implantation clinical trials: a consensus report from the Valve
      Academic Research Consortium (VARC-2)&quot;. These endpoint definitions combine the expertise of
      surgeons, interventionalists, medical cardiologists, clinical trial and other specialists and
      allow for comparison of different trials concerning effectiveness and safety in TAVI.

    <description>In this study, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) will be performed using the JenaValve Pericardial TAVR System, which is intended for use in subjects with severe aortic stenosis. The JenaValve replacement valve is placed inside the aortic valve by using a delivery system.</description>
