  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first study of my PhD showed that acute supplementation of berry extracts can modulate
      cognitive behaviour in healthy adults. There is a growing body of evidence supporting an
      improvement in memory and learning performance in animal models following the ingestion of
      flavonoid rich fruits (Shukitt-Hale et al 2008;Spencer 2008; Spencer et al., 2008). However,
      study 2, showed no effect on any aspects of memory in healthy young adults after
      supplementation of the berry extracts. It is hypothesised that the lack of behavioural
      effects on memory of the berry juice in study 2 was because of the cohort used. These healthy
      adult participants were already performing near to their peak (Salthouse et al., 2009), and
      unlike study one, participants were not mentally fatigued enough to reveal subtle cognitive
      benefits.

      The aims of the study are to examine if acute supplementation of two berry extracts in an
      older population can augment memory, attention and executive function. Secondly, the time
      course of these behavioural effects will be measured by multiple cognitive assessments
      throughout the day after consumption of the extracts.
