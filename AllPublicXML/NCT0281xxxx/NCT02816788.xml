  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In partnership with SARI Therapeutic Riding (SARI TR), Brescia University College, at the
      University of Western Ontario, will study the use of Equine Assisted Therapy (EAT) for
      military veterans diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Data will be collected
      through tests and questionnaires, and follow-up interviews with participants. It is expected
      that after a series of 10 EAT sessions, the social, emotional and psychological well-being of
      participants will be improved and PTSD symptoms alleviated.

    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate outcomes of participation in Equine Assisted
      Therapy for those with a history of PTSD.

      This study will use a within subjects design: Treatment group with pre- and post-intervention
      comparisons. Participants will be military Veterans with prior diagnosis of PTSD; N=8 to 10.

      Procedures for treatment group: The treatment group will engage in weekly EAT sessions to be
      run at SARI Therapeutic Riding (SARI TR). A typical EAT session will involve beginning the
      session by checking in as a group, engaging in one or two activities with the horses and then
      processing the activity as a group. Each session will also end with a check out. The
      activities with equines will range from observation/educational, grooming, reflective work
      involving creative expression with writing/art, or more active activities such as leading.
      Each session will have an overall topic which will provide the framework for the session.
      Interactions with equines will take place in the indoor arena (an enclosed space for
      riding/training horses), whilst other aspects of the sessions will take place in the main
      lounge. Sessions will be conducted by a Clinical Counsellor certified with the Ontario
      Counselling and Psychotherapy Association, assisted by a certified Life Coach, and an
      experienced, Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association (CanTRA) certified TR instructor from
      SARI. Each session will include eight to ten participants. There will be two persons with
      therapeutic expertise and one with horse/TR experience attending to participants at all times
      during interaction with equines. Sessions will last two and a half hours, incorporating
      psychotherapy and interacting with equines, over a course of ten sessions.

      General procedure: Military Veterans with PTSD will be recruited from the local Occupational
      Stress Injury Social Support (OSISS) PTSD support group and similar organizations. This
      service &quot;is a partnership program between the Department of National Defence and Veterans
      Affairs Canada&quot; (OSISS website) created to provide peer support to Canadian Forces personnel,
      Veterans and their families. The OSISS provides peer support and aids in linking members to
      appropriate services, programmes and supports. Data will be collected through
      questionnaire-type tests and post-session interview of participants. A set of short tests,
      the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PNAS), and the PTSD
      Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) will be administered. Participants will complete sets of tests at
      pre-session, post-session, and follow-up, and will be interviewed one week after the end of
      the study in order to obtain further data. Longer-term follow-up is also anticipated, with
      measures being repeated at further time points (e.g., one-, three-, and six-month follow-up)
      after completion of EAT sessions.
