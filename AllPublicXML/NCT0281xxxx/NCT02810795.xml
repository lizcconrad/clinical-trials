    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of MPICT for the detection
      of hemodynamically relevant coronary stenosis (as determined by invasive FFR) in patients
      with suspected or known CAD clinically referred for invasive angiography.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) provides accurate assessment of the coronary
      arteries and detects significant coronary stenosis with high diagnostic accuracy. However,
      the hemodynamic relevance of these stenotic lesion remains unclear, although highly relevant
      for clinical decision-making. Recent technical developments with third-generation dual-source
      CT allow to determine myocardial perfusion during hyperemia and thus for assessment of the
      hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions using a dynamic acquisition mode. To date, there is
      only very limited evidence of the feasibility of this approach stemming from single-center
      studies with varying standards of reference.

      Objective: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of MPICT for the detection of hemodynamically
      relevant coronary stenosis (as determined by invasive FFR) in patients with suspected or
      known CAD clinically referred for invasive angiography. In an optional sub-study the
      diagnostic accuracy of MPICT for the detection of myocardial perfusion defects as determined
      by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) will be investigated.

      Study design: Observational cohort study with fractional flow reserve (FFR) during invasive
      angiography as the reference standard.

      Study population: Patients with known or suspected CAD clinically referred for invasive
      angiography.

      Main study parameters: Myocardial perfusion defect on dynamic CT perfusion imaging, and
      diagnostic accuracy as compared invasive FFR.
