  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory adverse events continue to be the leading reason for perioperative critical
      events in children. It is crucial for the anaesthesiologist to anticipate, recognize and
      treat these respiratory adverse events. Respiratory adverse events are one of the major
      causes of morbidity and mortality during paediatric anaesthesia. To avoid trouble, one must
      be prepared for trouble: if a difficult airway is very likely, anaesthesia should be
      administered by experienced anaesthesiologists and should only be performed in a protected
      well-equipped area where the personnel adequately trained.

      This survey focuses on assessment and management of paediatric airway and highlights the
      unique challenges encountered in children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Airway management is one of the key areas of paediatric anaesthesia practice. The paediatric
      patients have significant anatomical and physiological differences compared with adults,
      which impact on the techniques and tools that the anaesthesiologist might choose to provide
      safe and effective control of the airway. Furthermore, there are a number of pathological
      processes, typically seen in the paediatric population, which present unique anatomical or
      functional difficulties in airway management. The presence of one of these syndromes or
      conditions can predict a &quot;difficult airway&quot;.

      Respiratory adverse events continue to be the leading reason for perioperative critical
      events in children. New developments in airway management in paediatric patients can only
      improve perioperative outcome if anaesthesiologists who are fully acquainted with these
      fundamental aspects of paediatric anaesthesia care for these children.

      This survey was taken out within members of the Community of European Anaesthesiologists, to
      describe and explore current patterns of their airway management in paediatric anaesthesia.

      The purpose of the study was to see whether there are more uniform practice patterns among
      anaesthesiologist with paediatric experience than those without paediatric experience.

      Secondarily, the survey also explored anaesthetists'' knowledge about the risks of
      respiratory adverse events and, and about national organizations' recommendations.

      Therefore, this survey highlighted some of the important anatomical and physiological
      differences and their implication in daily anaesthesiological practice.
