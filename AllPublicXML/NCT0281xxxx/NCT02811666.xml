  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and function) can be observed at any age and results of
      multiple factors (age, activity, inflammatory factors, nutritional status...). It deeply
      impacts the physical performance and the basal metabolism, and induces cardiovascular
      disorders, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Sarcopenia appears like an independent factor
      decreasing the quality of life, exacerbating the toxicity of chemotherapy and increasing
      mortality for gastrointestinal cancer. However, few studies have demonstrated his impact on
      postoperative course in digestive oncology. The search for sarcopenia, complementary
      nutritional status, is now a source of great interest with 62 ongoing projects in the United
      States.

      The first objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of preoperative sarcopenia on
      30-days morbidity and mortality of patients operated on from poor prognosis gastrointestinal
      cancer (liver and pancreas). The second objective is to evaluate the impact of preoperative
      sarcopenia on the long term outcomes (12 months) on the same patients.

      In this interventional, intent-to-treat, single-center cohort, prospective study, sarcopenia
      will be evaluated by the decrease in muscle surface (assessed by CT-Scan) associated with a
      decrease in muscle strength (assessed by hand gauge). Preoperative evaluation will also
      include nutritional status by physical examination and laboratory tests, and many nutritional
      questionnaires. The same data (including sarcopenia, laboratory tests and nutritional
      evaluation) will be collected at 7 days, 30 days and 12 months, as well as the morbidity and
      mortality. Statistical tests might evaluate if sarcopenia may be an independent factor of
      morbidity and mortality among these patients.
