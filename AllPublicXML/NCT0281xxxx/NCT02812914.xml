  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Greater efforts are needed to bring affordable, clean stoves and adaptive behavioral
      strategies to the millions of households worldwide that continue to burn solid cooking fuels
      using inefficient stoves. Two of the leading causes of infant mortality, preterm birth and
      pneumonia, are associated with high exposures to household air pollution during pregnancy and
      early infancy. The proposed study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of an
      introduced liquid petroleum gas stove, complemented by two alternative approaches to
      delivering tailored behavioral change interventions, among pregnant women and their neonates.

    <description>Women will participate in four classes on how to safely use gas stoves and methods to reduce exposure to air pollution. Additionally, peer educators will visit each home after group classes to help the woman, and key decision-makers in her family, identify top priority strategies to reduce air pollution. Using a checklist, peer educators will observe whether household members are adhering to tailored strategies at subsequent home visits, and provide ongoing support to women and their families.</description>
