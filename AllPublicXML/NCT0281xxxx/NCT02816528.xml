  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      France is a country strong consumer of antibiotics in Europe, specially in primary care.

      Outpatient antibiotic use represents around 90% of total antibiotic use and prescriptions
      come mainly from general practitioners. A literature review of antibiotic stewardship in
      primary care show that there is no evaluation of interest of giving information about
      consumption of antibiotics and bacterial resistance to general practitioners. The objective
      of this study is to demonstrate that practitioners implicated in the followed of consumption
      of antibiotics and bacterial resistance around their geographical area of practice could
      change and improve their practices in good use of antibiotics.
