  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-week, non-interventional, observational study of patients undergoing chemotherapy
      (sutent) designed as a three-arm parallel study. In this study, the efficacy of Ectoin
      containing mouthwash given prophylactically for the prevention of mucositis in patients
      before radio- and/or chemotherapy; as well as during radio- and/or chemotherapy for patients
      with mucositis compared to standard treatment should be investigated. The study doesn't
      intervene with routine treatment strategy.
