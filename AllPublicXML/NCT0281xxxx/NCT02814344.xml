  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The original aspect of the methodology proposed for this study concerns the use of as many as
      16 electrodes to study the propagation and coordination (or synchronization) of uterine
      contraction. Over the last two years, the Compi√®gne University of Technology and the
      University of Reykjavik (Iceland) teams have developed the tools required to obtain good
      quality signals during electrohysterography and have worked on filtering and mapping of
      uterine electrical activity derived from these signals.

    <description>To demonstrate a difference of propagation of the electrical signal during a physiological contraction of pregnancy and uterine contraction during delivery. The parameter H2 (nonlinear correlation coefficient) will be used to measure propagation of the electrical signal.</description>
