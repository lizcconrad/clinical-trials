  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more about blood glucose control when people with Type 1
      Diabetes switch to an insulin pump. The investigators hope to learn whether using a
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) helps to create personalized insulin doses that may lead to
      stable blood glucoses and less frequent insulin pump dose changes during the transition to an
      insulin pump.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. Participants will be asked to wear a
      Medtronic iPro2 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) 1-2 weeks prior to starting on insulin pump
      therapy. Depending on randomization groups, participants will either have CGM data used
      inform starting insulin pump doses (treatment group), or to standard of care for starting on
      insulin pump (control group). Participants will wear the CGM again during the first 5 days of
      pump start and at approximately 6 weeks after pump start, in order to collect blood glucose
      data. Each time the CGM is worn, blood glucoses must be checked 6-8 times daily, and a
      written log must be completed. Baseline medical information also will be collected at the
      start of participation. Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire at
      approximately 6 weeks after pump start. Participation in the study will be complete after a
      standard of care follow up visit approximately 3 months after pump start.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and Females aged 2-24 years

          3. Duration of diabetes: At least 6 months

             - This will ensure some glycemic stability prior to study, and most children do not
             start on an insulin pump until about 6 months into their diagnosis.

          4. Basal/bolus insulin regimen using long-acting and rapid-acting insulin

             - This will provide a uniform method of insulin therapy.

          5. Willingness to perform at least 6-8 capillary blood glucose tests per day while
             wearing the iPro速2

          6. Willingness to wear the iPro速2 for 5 days continuously per insertion

          7. Participant agrees to comply with the study protocol requirements

          8. Informed Consent, Assent, HIPAA Authorization, and California Experimental Subject
             Bill of Rights signed by the participant and/or parent guardian

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Comorbid conditions, including but not limited to cystic fibrosis, oncologic
             processes, other systemic diseases that may affect overall glycemic control

          2. Glucocorticoid use within 2 weeks of study enrollment

          3. Concurrent use of other medications that may affect glycemic control

          4. Prior CGM use in the past 6 months

          5. The participant has any skin abnormality (e.g. psoriasis, rash, staphylococcus
             infection) in the area of iPro速2 placement that has not been resolved at the time of
             enrollment and would inhibit the participant from wearing the iPro速2.

          6. Non-English or non-Spanish speaking
