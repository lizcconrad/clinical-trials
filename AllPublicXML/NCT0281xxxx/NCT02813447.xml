      Objective: Determine whether treatment of perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with
      anti-depressant therapy improves dyspnea scores, 6-minute walk (6MW) distance and quality of
      life (QoL) in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and ILD
      (Interstitial Lung Disease) undergoing pulmonary rehab.

      The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to assess
      the effect of an SSRI on 6MW, dyspnea scores, and QoL in COPD and ILD patients undergoing
      pulmonary rehab. Thirty subjects that carry an ICD-9 code diagnosis of COPD and/or ILD and
      CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression) score of &gt; 16 will be recruited from Duke
      Pulmonary Rehab.

      Multivariable regression models will be constructed to evaluate the relationship between
      perceived stress, anxiety, and depression with adjustments by race, gender, age, BMI and GOLD
      score. A multivariable regression model will be constructed to assess whether treatment of
      perceived stress, depression, and anxiety with antidepressant therapy (sertraline) is an
      effect modifier on 6MW distance and dyspnea scores in patients with COPD or ILD who are
      enrolled in pulmonary rehab.

      Descriptive statistics will be used to examine the socio-demographic characteristic data.
      Student t-tests will be performed to assess group differences in continuous data. Categorical
      variables will be examined using the Pearson's Chi-Squared test.

    <description>Subjects randomized into this arm will be given active study drug (sertraline). Subjects will take 25mg tablets by mouth daily starting at visit 1 along with participating in the intensive pulmonary rehab program. Subjects will be assessed at one week intervals +/- 7 days for tolerability and side effects, and if tolerating study drug, the dose will be increased weekly by 25mg over the course of the first four weeks with maximum effective dose of 100mg daily by the end of week four. Subjects will continue this dose over the course of the remaining 8 weeks of the study, while participating in the graduate program of pulmonary rehab.</description>
