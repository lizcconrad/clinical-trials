  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pragmatic cluster randomized trial that is being conducted in 5 countries,
      with sites in 4 cities in Canada, Benin, Ghana, Indonesia and Vietnam. The unit of
      randomization is the health facility (24 health facilities randomized). The trial tests a
      complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package which includes a
      standardized public health evaluation and analysis, to identify problems and barriers
      limiting Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis and treatment among close contacts of active
      Tuberculosis cases. This will be followed by implementation of appropriate solutions and
      strengthening of the LTBI clinical program. The primary objective of the study is to increase
      the proportion of household contacts of index TB patients that start Latent Tuberculosis
      Infection treatment A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this two
      phase intervention. If successful, this approach can be expanded throughout these countries.
      After initial preparations, including administrative and ethical review, all participating
      sites will be randomized to intervention or control. Immediately after this, Phase 1 will
      begin in intervention sites with the standardized public health evaluation to identify
      barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment initiation and the selection of solutions to be used
      in Phase 2. To ensure standardization of data gathering research staff will use (i) current
      indicators of the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care in intervention facilities
      (number of contacts per index case registered, investigated, started on treatment and
      completing treatment) and (ii) interviewer administered questionnaires for patients with
      active pulmonary Tuberculosis, adult and child household contacts and clinic staff. These
      questionnaires will assess latent Tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from
      the perspective of these different participants. Results from intervention sites in Phase 1
      will be analyzed, and used by the investigators, together with local public health officials,
      to decide on appropriate corrective solutions in each sites. Contact Investigation registries
      will also be developed with research staff from sites. In Phase 2, solutions for problems
      identified will be selected and implemented at the intervention sites, Contact Investigation
      registries will be implemented and clinical training will be provided to strengthen LTBI
      health care worker knowledge and clinical programs. Study outcomes and costs will be measured
      at all intervention and control sites throughout Phase 1 &amp; 2. The main study will run for 18
      months. Upon completion of the main study, a 1 year cross over study will be conducted where
      control sites will receive a streamlined version of the intervention and original
      intervention sites will be used to evaluate the sustainability of the intervention. Results
      will be disseminated within each country through existing links with National Tuberculosis
      Programs, and through international organizations such as the World Health Organization.

    <description>Latent Tuberculosis Infection program evaluation &amp; diagnosis: In intervention health facilities the current Latent Tuberculosis Infection program will be evaluated and gaps in the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care will be identified. Gaps in the current cascade will be quantified and solution proposed that are unique to the problems identified in each site. In phase 2 of the study low cost solutions will be implemented and the Latent Tuberculosis Infection program scaled up and improved. Study outcomes (proportion of Latent Tuberculosis Infection cases starting treatment) are evaluated at the start and end of the trial. Costing evaluations are done throughout the trial.</description>
