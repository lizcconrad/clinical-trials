  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One-lung ventilation is desirable for Several clinical procedures, such as
      thoracic,pulmonary, and cardiac surgery to facilitate lung exposure for these surgical
      procedures by collapsing the lung and most commonly used device is the double-lumen tube
      (DLT) for this surgical procedures.Bronchial blockers (BBs), such as univent tube with an
      bronchial Blocker, has more advantages than the double-lumen tube: no need exchange tube when
      mechanical ventilation is required postoperative, easier insertion,less postoperative sore
      throat (ST) and hoarseness. However, BBs requires more time for placement and more difficult
      to position, especially patients undergoing left-side thoracic surgery. So, this study
      intends to evaluate the feasibility and security issues of univent bronchial blockers outside
      the single lumen endotracheal tube for one- lung ventilation in left thoracic surgery
      patients.
