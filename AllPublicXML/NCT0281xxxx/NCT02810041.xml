  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are public health problems worldwide. Even though heredity may be one
      of the causes the diseases, the vast majority of cases is rather linked to a sedentary
      lifestyle associated or not with a low-variety, high-calorie diet. Many diets and slimming
      methods propose low-calorie meals or physical exercise, and the consequences of these are
      sometimes negative with advancing age (muscle wasting). Certain studies have shown the
      efficacy of foods with antioxidant properties on the reduction of blood pressure, Low Density
      Lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and weight or on the distribution of fat mass-lean mass. The
      investigators put forward the hypothesis that the daily consumption of two yoghurts
      containing XXS, a mixture of natural polyphenolic compounds -rich in quercetin- from plant
      extracts, could lead to weight loss, a better fat mass-lean mass distribution and an
      improvement in markers of oxidative stress in overweight persons aged 50 to 65 years.
