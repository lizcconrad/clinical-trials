  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) are at increased risk of developing mechanical
      complications such as dialysate leaks and hernias thought to be related to an increase in
      intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) secondary to the addition of dialysate to the abdomen.
      Resistance training has been shown to increase IAP but it is unclear in the general
      population and in patients treated with PD if this training increases the risk of developing
      hernias.

      This study is observing the difference in IAP pressure measurements obtained by the Stryker
      pressure monitor versus the standard IAP pressure measurements obtained with the insufflator
      at the time of PD catheter insertion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients who are having a PD catheter inserted at the Ottawa Hospital, and who provide
      informed consent, will undergo IAP measurements with the Stryker pressure monitor. Values
      will be compared to the insufflator at inflation pressures 5,10,15, and 20mmHg.

      To determine if the Styker pressure monitor is appropriate for measuring IAP in PD patients,
      the observed pressures will be analyzed with Bland Altman plots. If the mean difference
      between readings is 5mmHg and 95% of the points fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean
      difference, the stryker pressure monitor will be considered an acceptable method of measuring
      IAP.

      This tool will then be used as part of a future larger trial which will 1) measure IAP with
      resistance training in patients treated with PD; with and without dialysate, 2) assess PD
      patient interest in participating in resistance training trials and 3) determine the
      appropriateness of the proposed resistance training program for this patient population.

      The ultimate goal is to use this study to help inform and develop a clinical trial to 1)
      assess the impact of resistance training on quality of life and functional status, 2) assess
      the risk of developing leaks/hernias, and 3) determine if there is an association between IAP
      during resistance training and subsequent hernia development
