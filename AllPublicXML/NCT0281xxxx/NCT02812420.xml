    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of durvalumab and
      tremelimumab is safe and tolerable when given to patients with bladder cancer before surgery
      to remove the bladder.

      This is an investigational study. Tremelimumab and durvalumab are not FDA or commercially
      available for the treatment of bladder cancer. The use of these drugs are considered
      investigational.

      Up to 35 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive durvalumab and
      tremelimumab by vein on Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 4. Each study drug infusion will last 1 hour.
      You will receive tremelimumab first and then you will receive durvalumab about 1 hour later.
      You will be monitored for side effects after you receive the study drugs. You will be in the
      clinic for up to 6 hours.

      Study Visits:

      During Day 1 of Weeks 1 and 4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Your vital signs will be measured within 30 minutes before, every 15 minutes while you
           are receiving the study drugs, and 3 times over 1 hour after the end of your dose of
           durvalumab.

        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests. This blood or
           urine collection will also include a pregnancy test if you can become pregnant.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing and thyroid
           function testing.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have a cystoscopy to check the status of the
           disease. If the doctor thinks it is needed, you may need to have a surgery to remove the
           tumors. If you need this surgery because the disease got worse very quickly, you may be
           taken off study.

      During Week 9 to 11:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.

        -  You will have an EKG.

        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for immune system testing.

        -  Urine will be collected to check the status of the disease.

      During Week 9 to 11, you will have surgery to remove part or all of your bladder. You will
      sign a separate consent explaining the surgery and its risks. If during screening you were
      told that you were not eligible to have surgery at Week 9 to 11, you will have a biopsy after
      your last dose of study drugs.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the Week 17 visit. You will no longer be able to take the study
      drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to
      follow study directions.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

        -  About 90 days after last dose of study drug, you will asked about any side effects and
           how you are doing.

        -  Every 3 months for a total of 1 year from the start on the study, you will be called and
           asked how you are doing. This phone call should last about 15 minutes.

will be determined to have an extreme toxicity (ETOX) as follows:
The patient experiences any grade 3 or higher adverse event (AE) that is possibly, probably, or definitely related to therapy received on this protocol and occurs up to 30 days after the last dose of therapy.
a. Exception: Any such AE that is potentially treatable with steroids will only count as an ETOX if it does not improve to grade 1 or better within 2 weeks
The patient has a delay in surgery of 30 days due to AE, even if that AE does not meet the definition of ETOX.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt;/= 18 years at the time of screening. In general, urothelial cancer occurs in the
             6th to 8th decade of life, so it is unlikely that pediatric patients will be included.

          2. Patients must have tissue resected by transurethral resection of bladder tissue
             (TURBT) at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.

          3. Patients must have histologic proof of urothelial cancer. This includes bladder
             cancer, in addition to other tumors of the urothelial lining including renal pelvis,
             ureteral, and urethral cancer. Upper tract urothelial carcinoma will also be included.
             This group may include any patient requiring cystectomy (or applicable surgery to
             resect tumors), including muscle invasive disease (cT2-3aN0M0), whose tumor could not
             be completely removed at transurethral resection.

          4. continued 3) Patients with the following high-risk features who are not candidates for
             traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be included for this trial: micropapillary,
             sarcomatoid and plasmacytoid features; 3-D mass on exam under anesthesia (EUA);
             lymphovascular continued from 3)invasion; hydronephrosis (unless in the opinion of the
             treating physician, this is not due to tumor); high grade (grade 3) tumors of the
             ureter, renal pelvis, or tumors in these areas with radiographic abnormality large
             enough to recognize as an abnormal mass by CT or MRI imaging; direct invasion of the
             prostatic stroma or the vaginal wall (i.e. cT4a disease). Patients who are candidates
             for but refusing conventional chemotherapy may be considered eligible. For patients in
             whom eligibility is unclear, final arbitration will be determined by the Principal
             Investigator.

          5. Subjects must have no prior exposure to immunotherapy, such as, but not limited to
             other anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies excluding vaccines

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1.

          7. Able and willing to give valid written consent for available archival tumor samples or
             fresh tumor biopsies/resections.

          8. Adequate organ and marrow function (subjects must not have received transfusions or
             growth factor support within 28 days prior to first dose), as defined below: a.
             Hemoglobin &gt;/= 9 g/dL b. Absolute neutrophil count &gt;/= 1,000/mm^3 c. Platelet count
             &gt;/= 100,000/mm^3 d. Total bilirubin &lt;/= 1.5 × ULN except subjects with documented
             Gilbert's syndrome (&gt; 3 × ULN), who must have a baseline total bilirubin &lt;/= 3.0 mg/dL
             e.Subjects must be considered cisplatin ineligible as per treating physician due to
             renal dysfunction, or hearing impairment, or co-morbidities. Cisplatin ineligibility
             defined as: GFR less than 60 or; CHF NYHA class III or higher or; Peripheral
             neuropathy grade 2 or higher or; ECOG PS 2 or higher or; impaired hearing. Patient's
             refusal of traditional chemotherapy.

          9. Females of childbearing potential who are sexually active with a nonsterilized male
             partner must use a highly effective method of contraception from the time of
             screening, and must agree to continue using such precautions for 180 days after the
             final dose of investigational product. Cessation of contraception after this point
             should be discussed with a responsible physician. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm
             method, and the withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of contraception. They
             must also refrain from egg cell donation for 180 days after the final dose of
             investigational product.

         10. Nonsterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of childbearing
             potential must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception from Day 1
             through 90 days after receipt of the final dose of investigational product. In
             addition, they must refrain from sperm donation for 90 days after the final dose of
             investigational product.

         11. Mild autoimmune conditions (such as localized psoriasis) requiring minimal treatment
             or systemic autoimmune conditions well controlled by target agents such as an
             anti-IL-17 that do not affect overall immune system. Patients with a history of
             Hashimoto's thyroiditis only requiring hormone replacement, Type I diabetes, or
             conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger are allowed to
             participate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical trial, unless in a follow-up period or it is
             an observational study.

          2. Any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, or hormonal therapy for cancer
             treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions (e.g. insulin
             for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.

          3. Any investigational anticancer therapy received within 28 days prior to the first dose
             of durvalumab and tremelimumab.

             NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 or 1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values
             listed per the inclusion criteria. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is not
             reasonably expected to be exacerbated by durvalumab and tremelimumab may be included
             (e.g. hearing loss) after consultation with the Principal Investigator.

          6. Known or suspected autoimmune disease. Patients with a history of inflammatory bowel
             disease (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis) and autoimmune disorders
             such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic progressive sclerosis [scleroderma], Systemic
