  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, randomized, evaluator-blinded, split-face clinical study
      design. Fifty patients will receive one treatment session consisting of Restylane® Silk
      (right side of the face) and Belotero Balance® (left side), or vice versa (1:1 dose
      conversion ratio) injections to the superficial, vertical perioral lines. Injections will be
      performed at the baseline visit. To ensure subject and investigator blinding, syringes will
      be prepared and labeled &quot;1&quot; and &quot;2&quot; immediately before subject attendance for injection by
      the sub-investigator. The same injection sites and techniques will be used on both sides of
      the face. Then, patients will follow-up on post-treatment day 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
      180.
