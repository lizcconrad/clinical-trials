  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is a cost difference between darbepoetin
      alfa and epoetin alfa when used intravenously to treat anemia in hemodialysis patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible hemodialysis patients who are currently receiving an erythropoiesis stimulating
      agent (ESA) who enrol and sign consent will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to either remain on
      epoetin alfa or switch to darbepoetin alfa as their anemia therapy. Patients will be dosed
      with the assigned drug using a study algorithm to maintain their hemoglobin (Hb) level within
      the currently recommended range (100-120 g/L). There will be an initial &quot;run in&quot; period of a
      minimum of six weeks to ensure the patient's hemoglobin is stable within the target range.
      The trial itself will run for a subsequent twelve months (active phase). Every effort will be
      made to ensure that Hb stays within the target range during the study period. The primary
      outcome will be the total cost of each ESA therapy over the twelve month active phase. Data
      including Hgb, iron indices and dosing, and clinical events will be obtained from electronic
      sources and from the attending physicians and/or the clinical pharmacist.

    <description>Patients who are enrolled and randomized to the Epoetin arm will remain on their current dose and frequency. After the first hemoglobin (Hb) measurement the study algorithm will be used to guide anemia management. The subjects in this arm will remain on epoetin for the required run-in phase followed by the 12 month active phase.</description>

    <description>Patients who are enrolled and randomized to the Darbepoetin arm will have their epoetin discontinued at the end of the week preceding entry into the study and will switch to darbepoetin on the date that they would normally be receiving their next dose of epoetin.
Switching patients to darbepoetin will be done using the conversion ratio of 200 units of epoetin to 1 μg of darbepoetin as used per week, rounded up or down to the nearest available pre-filled syringe dose available from the manufacturer.
After the first Hb measurement the study algorithm will be used to guide anemia management. The subjects in this arm will remain on darbepoetin for the required run-in phase followed by the 12 month active phase.</description>

    <description>The investigator will adjust epoetin doses as per the study algorithm during the run-in (every two weeks) and active phases (every four weeks). This will continue until the 12 month active phase is complete or the patient is withdrawn from the study.
All epoetin will be administered intravenously through a hemodialysis machine port using a manufacturer-provided pre-filled syringe.
It is not anticipated that a subject will require a dose of epoetin &gt; 30 000 units weekly. If this occurs the dose will not be escalated any higher. Such a patient would likely meet the criteria for study withdrawal.
Intravenous iron will be given as per the study algorithm and only one formulation of iron is used, sodium ferric gluconate.</description>
