  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an interactive web-based patient education program to
      help educate patients about the increased risk of MS and its cardiac risk factors following
      allo-SCT and to inform and motivate patients how to make lifestyle changes. This program will
      be used in addition to counseling at participants clinic visits. The investigators are not
      changing the recommendations for prevention and management of these conditions, but rather
      are trying to improve the way they provide this education to patients.

    <description>This is a single-arm design. Development of the web-based application will occur over a 6 month period. Patient accrual will not occur until development of the program is complete. Controlled usability testing during the development/design process of the computer program will not be employed as we do not aim to assess the mechanics of patient use, but rather overall time spent interacting with the application in an uncontrolled environment. Following completion of the tool, patient accrual will occur over a six month time period in order to meet our target sample size of up to 50 participants. Participants will be directed to complete a pre-test questionnaire at the time of accrual and will have 3 months to use the program before being directed to complete the post-test questionnaire.</description>
