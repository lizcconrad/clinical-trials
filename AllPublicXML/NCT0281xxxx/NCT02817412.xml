  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Binge eating disorder is the most prevalent eating disorder and affects both men and women at
      comparable rates unlike anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Given that binge eating and
      obesity are strongly associated, binge eating treatments should aim to reduce binge eating as
      well as weight. However, most binge eating interventions do not produce lasting weight loss.
      Recent research has shown computer-based response inhibition training with high-calorie foods
      reduces reward region response to and attentional bias for the training foods, decreases
      training food intake, increases inhibitory control, and produces weight loss in overweight
      adults. There is evidence that the weight loss effects from such response training persist
      through 6-month follow-up. Further, binge eating has been associated with increased
      food-related impulsivity and increased activation in a reward-processing brain region to
      high-calorie foods. Prior research suggests that food response training may be an effective
      intervention for binge eating that teaches automatic self-control in response to high-calorie
      foods which in turn, reduces binge eating and produces weight loss. This study will examine
      the effectiveness of food response training interventions in reducing binge eating and weight
      among adults engaged in binge eating.

      The goals of this study are to: (1) test the hypothesis that adults who complete the food
      response trainings will show significantly greater reductions in binge eating frequency and
      in body mass index (BMI) compared to generic response training from pretest to posttest and
      at 3-month follow up, (2) to determine whether one of the food response trainings is more
      effective in binge eating frequency and reducing BMI from pretest to posttest and at 3-month
      follow up, and (3) test whether a reduction in valuation of the high-calorie versus
      low-calorie foods (willingness to pay for the pictured foods) and/or behavioral improvement
      of inhibitory control during the training tasks mediate the effects of the various trainings
      on reductions in binge frequency and body mass index.

    <arm_group_label>Go/No-Go Training</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the go/no go training, participants are shown images in which high-calorie foods are shown on one side of the screen and low-calorie foods on the other. They are told to press response keys as quickly as possible to indicate the side of presentation (go-trials). On half of the trials, the rectangular frame surrounding the image is not solid but hatched, which is a signal for them to withhold their response (no-go trials). This training is divided into 4 blocks of 50 trials.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Stop-Signal Training</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the stop signal training, participants are shown images in either a dark blue or light gray border. They are told to press the space bar as quickly as possible when the border is blue (go trials) and to withhold a response when the border is gray (no-go trials). This training is divided into 20 blocks of 32 trials.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Dot-Probe Training</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the dot-probe training, participants are shown images in which high-calorie foods are shown on one side of the screen and low-calorie foods on the other. Immediately after the images disappear, a small dot probe appears in the location of one of the images. Participants are told to press response keys as quickly as possible to indicate whether a visual probe appeared behind the left or right image during the trials. The probe appears in the location occupied by a high-calorie food image 10% of the time and in the location occupied by a low-calorie food image 90% of the time. This training is divided into 6 blocks of 40 trials.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>In the generic training, participants complete a generic go/no-go training that uses images of flowers and office supplies instead of the images of high-calorie and low-calorie food images. This generic go/no go training is identical in duration and contact time to the go/no-go food training.</description>
