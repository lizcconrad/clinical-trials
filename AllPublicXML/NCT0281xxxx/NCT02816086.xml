  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suboptimal use of medications among geriatric patients is well-known problem and leads to
      medication errors, re-hospitalizations and death. By using a randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) design the investigators aim to explore a new inter-professional working structure. The
      working structure is based on the scientifically and clinically acknowledged integrated
      medicines management (IMM) model. The overall aim of the study is to explore the effect of
      the new working structure on the composite endpoint re-hospitalization + visit to an
      emergency department during 12 months after hospital discharge.
