  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study 30 men, with advanced metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC)
      planned to have hormonal treatment, will undergo conventional imaging and functional imaging
      prior to treatment and post treatment to determine if changes in imaging results will be
      prognostic of outcome. Patients will have a clinical follow-up every 3 months post
      randomization for one year and followed for survival at Years 2 and 3.

    <textblock>
      In this study 30 men, with advanced metastatic CRPC intended to have abiraterone acetate or
      enzalutamide hormonal treatment will undergo conventional imaging including a 99mTc-Methyl
      diphosphonate (MDP) bone scan and Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, and
      functional imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET-CT and
      2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic
      acid (18F-DCFPyL) PET-CT one to four weeks prior to hormonal treatment and approximately 10
      weeks post hormonal treatment.

      Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) will also be obtained at baseline and every three months in
      the first year. Baseline imaging of disease and changes between baseline and follow-up
      imaging on 18F-FDG PET-CT and 18F-DCFPyL PET-CT will be compared with standard of care
      imaging (99mTc-MDP bone scan and CT of the abdomen/pelvis) as well as with clinical
      evaluation including response to therapy and progression of disease.

      This information could be used by clinicians to guide androgen receptor (AR) - targeted
      therapy. Patients will have a clinical follow-up every 3 months post randomization for one
      year and will be followed for survival at Years 2 and 3.
