  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure how much LY3023414 (a test formulation and a
      reference formulation) gets into the blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid
      of it.

      The study will also evaluate the effects of a high fat meal on LY3023414 compared to taking
      LY3023414 on an empty stomach. In addition, the tolerability of the study drug formulations
      will be evaluated. Information about any side effects that may occur will be collected.

      This study includes 3 periods. Participants will be admitted to the clinical research unit
      (CRU) one day before dosing in each period. Total study duration is about 21 days, including
      follow-up. Screening may occur up to 30 days before the first dose of study drug.

      This study is for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical conditions.
