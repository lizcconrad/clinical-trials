    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of physical exercise on cognition, functional status, brain
      atrophy and blood flow, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease in adults
      with a mild memory impairment.

      Half of participants will participate in a stretching-balance-range of motion exercise
      program, while the other half will participate in a moderate/high aerobic training program.

    <description>The ADAS-Cog is a structured scale that evaluates memory (word recall, word recognition), reasoning (following commands), language (naming, comprehension), orientation, ideational praxis (placing letter in envelope) and constructional praxis (copying geometric designs). Ratings of spoken language, language comprehension, word finding difficulty, and ability to remember test instructions are also obtained. The test is scored in terms of errors, with higher scores reflecting poorer performance and greater impairment. The 13-item version of the ADAS-Cog will be administered in EXERT, which includes Delayed Word Recall and Number Cancellation. Scores can range from 0 (best) to 80 (worse).</description>
