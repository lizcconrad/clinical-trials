    <textblock>
      This study compared two methods of insulin infusion by syringe pumps to assess the impact of
      medical devices on the glycaemic variability in patients under IIT in ICU. The main objective
      of the study was to show the superiority of the infusion system which permitted to dedicate a
      line for the insulin administration on the &quot;standard&quot; installation in terms of control of
      glycaemic variability.

    <description>The standard insulin infusion system consisted in regular human insulin administration through a six-stopcock manifold connected to the distal line of a multilumen central venous catheter by 150 cm tubing. Insulin was systematically infused by syringe pump on the patient proximal port of the manifold. Carrier was infused via pump through the manifold. All others medicines were infused through the other five stopcocks.</description>

    <description>The optimised insulin infusion system consisted in regular human insulin administration through a multilumen device (Edelvaiss Multiline-8, Doran International, Toussieu, France). This device had ports for eight infusions which run through separate channels within a 150 cm flexible plastic tube. Since fluids from the individual channels do not meet until they exit the distal tip. Carrier was infused through the high flow (HF) line and insulin was infused by syringe pump systematically next to the HF line port. All others medicines were administered via adjacent ports on the Multiline-8.</description>
