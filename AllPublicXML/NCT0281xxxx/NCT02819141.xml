  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to test the efficacy of dexmedetomidine for
      the self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) in a sample of critically ill patients
      receiving mechanical ventilator support. The investigators hypothesis is that self-management
      of sedative therapy by mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU),
      tailored to their individual needs will be more efficacious than nurse-administered sedative
      therapy in reducing anxiety, which may reduce duration of mechanical ventilator support and
      occurrence of delirium.

      The overall objective of this study is to demonstrate efficacy for conducting a future,
      pragmatic effectiveness trial to test whether self-management of sedative therapy (SMST) is
      superior to nurse-administered sedative therapy in day-to-day intensive care unit (ICU)
      practice. This efficacy trial is powered for the investigators primary, clinically relevant
      endpoints (anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and delirium presence), and examines
      patient outcomes adversely affected by sedative administration practices, such as prolonged
      ICU stays, altered mental status, and diminished post-ICU quality of life. This randomized
      clinical trial with a total of 190 mechanically ventilated patients enrolled and maintained
      on protocol will address the following Specific Aims.

      The primary aim is to determine the efficacy of SMST compared to nurse-administered sedative
      therapy on anxiety, duration of mechanical ventilation, and presence of delirium in
      mechanically ventilated patients (MVPs).

      The secondary aim is to compare level of arousal and sedative exposure in mechanically
      ventilated patients (MVPs) randomized to SMST to those MVPs receiving nurse-administered
      sedative therapy. The investigators hypothesize that SMST patients will be easily arousable,
      more alert, and exposed to less sedation than those who receive nurse-administered sedative
      therapy.

      An exploratory aim is to compare post-ICU outcomes (physical/functional status, psychological
      well-being, and health-related quality of life) between MVPs randomized to SMST and those
      receiving nurse-administered sedative therapy.

Scores are summed for the 24-hour period over the 6, 4-hour time blocks to produce a daily sedation intensity score.</description>
