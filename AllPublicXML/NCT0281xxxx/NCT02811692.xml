  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The French CODEX study is designed as a national database to describe, in routine medical
      practice, functional and anatomical responses to intravitreal Aflibercept injection, in a
      large population of anti-VGEF-naïve patients presenting with wet Age-related Macular
      Degeneration (wAMD), Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO),Branch Retinal Vein
      Occlusion(BRVO), or Diabetic Macular Edema (DME). This national database will gather
      databases from French private and public ophthalmologic centers.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The retrospective data will be gathered from the first injection of Aflibercept for the
      indications macular edema following Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) directly by each
      physician. For each patient, the first injection date of Aflibercept is defined as the index
      date.

      Electronic files from each ophthalmologist, containing patient medical records, will be
      periodically transmitted according to the milestones of the study with a maximum of 4
      transfers (at Q2 2016 for the first transfer and then every 9 months thereafter).

      As each electronic transfer will be independent of each other and as patients' data will be
      anonymized by physicians before each transfer, data comparisons will be not possible between
      the four electronic files transfers planned over the study period.
