    <textblock>
      Though Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) is a commonly used form of
      non-invasive neonatal respiratory support, the optimal method of weaning off NCPAP is not
      well established. In this prospective, two-center randomized control trial we hypothesize
      that gradually increasing time off NCPAP (sprinting) increases the success of weaning NCPAP
      off in infants born between 23 0/7-30 6/7 weeks of gestational age.

      Eligible infants admitted to two Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) were randomized to a
      sprinting (SP) vs. a non-sprinting (NSP) protocol, both over 4 days. Infants assigned to the
      SP group sprinted twice daily for 3h (day 1), 6h (day 2), 9h (day 3) &amp; then 24h back on NCPAP
      (day 4) before switching to nasal cannula (NC) on day 5. Infants in the NSP group were
      maintained on NCPAP of 5 cm of water for the first 4 days before switching to NC on day 5,
      similar to the SP group. Infants in both groups were observed for the next 3 days (day 5-7)
      to ensure stability off CPAP
