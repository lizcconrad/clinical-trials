    <textblock>
      Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with rising prostatic specific antigen (PSA)
      are eligible for this study. 11C-Choline PET/CT will be used to identify metastatic lesions.
      Patients with &lt;=3 metastatic lesions will receive stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) as
      definitive treatment. Blood draws will be taken to monitor the development of anti-prostate
      cancer immunity

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Metastatic castration-refractory prostate cancer patients with ≤ 3 lesions identified
             on standard imaging and/or choline PET/CT within 60 days of registration

          -  Castrate levels of testosterone

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) ≤ 2 (Appendix I).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Emergent cord compression for spinal metastases

          -  Severe, active co-morbidity, defined as follows:

               1. Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure requiring hospitalization within
                  the last 6 months prior to registration

               2. Transmural myocardial infarction within the last 6 months prior to registration

               3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time
                  of registration

               4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation or other respiratory illness
