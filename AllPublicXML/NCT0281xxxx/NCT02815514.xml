  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Documentation of all consecutive patients of the participating centers with significant
      aortic stenosis, undergoing one of the following therapies:

        1. Percutaneous transfemoral aortic valve replacement

        2. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement transapical

        3. Percutaneous aortic valve replacement transaortic

        4. Aortic valve balloon valvuloplasty

        5. Surgical aortic valve replacement

        6. Conservative treatment

             -  Documentation of the indications, procedural results and clinical short-and
                long-term results of the above therapies

             -  Documentation of operational risk and quality of life

             -  Documentation of the technical implementation of the procedure and success of the
                intervention and of hospital reinterventions

             -  Documentation of hospital mortality, nonfatal major complications (stroke, TIA,
                myocardial infarction, dialysis, vascular complications, bleeding,
                neuropsychological status)

             -  Documentation of discharge medication and the length of hospital stay

             -  Documentation of the serious long-term complications, including mortality, stroke,
                TIA, myocardial infarction, dialysis, the reintervention and quality of life and of
                drug therapy within 30 days, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years.
