      This trial adopt in a parallel, open, single dose study design. The subject was divided into
      one of five groups according to the degree of renal Insufficiency, which including normal,
      mild, moderate, severe, and end-stage. All subjects were given SP2086 50mg, and collected the
      blood samples before and after the medicine taken.
