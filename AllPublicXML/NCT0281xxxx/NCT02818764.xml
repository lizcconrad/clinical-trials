  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this study is to test for perturbations in intraoperative
      electroencephalogram (EEG) , cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
      consumption (CMRO2), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and serum and cerebral spinal fluid
      biomarkers associated with delirium in high risk population having elective hip arthroplasty
      at Penn Presbyterian Medical Center (PPMC).

      All prospective patients will be given a copy of the informed consent which explains the
      details and responsibilities of the study.

      Each patient will have a preoperative baseline CAM, DRS and a mBDRS to document preoperative
      cognitive function and possible criteria for exclusion.

        1. The Delirium Rating Scale-98 (DRS), is a validated 16 item clinician rated scale with 13
           severity items and 3 diagnostic items. Instructions, the questions, and the score sheet
           are included as supplement material.

        2. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) test is a clinician evaluation and algorithm for
           the binary determination of presence or absence of delirium. It can be performed
           simultaneously with the DRS test.

        3. The modified Blessed Dementia Rating Scale (mBDRS) is a series of questions given to
           either the patient or close care giver to rate presence of and severity of dementia,
           while distinguishing dementia from other psychiatric diseases like delirium and
           schizophrenia. The worksheet is included as supplemental material. The resulting score
           ranges from 0 to 17 and distinguished from mild, moderate and severe forms of dementia.

      A non-invasive frontal EEG patch will be placed prior to or at the start of anesthesia.
      Anesthetic depth will be measured using the SEDline® by Masimo. Continuous raw EEG, spectral
      edge, compressed spectral analysis and percentage suppressed will be recorded from the
      SEDline® monitor.

      The investigators will be drawing blood from patients who agree to participate in the study.
      Preoperative blood sampling will be done while the investigators place the intravenous line,
      or if present, from an arterial line.

      If a spinal anesthetic is being used, 5 mL of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) will be collected
      at the time of dural puncture prior to the administration of the neuraxial blockade.

      Members of the research team will administer CAM and DRS testing on post-operative days 1 and
      2.
