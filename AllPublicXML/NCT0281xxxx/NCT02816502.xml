      This study investigates the clinical and neural effects of stress management skill building
      programs for young adults with childhood adversity. The investigators will recruit a total of
      60 young adults (21-35 years old) who will be randomized into two different stress management
      skill building programs, both of which are 8 weeks long. MRI and psychological assessments
      will be acquired from all subjects before and after the intervention programs in order to
      investigate changes in clinical symptoms (such as depression, anxiety and stress) and
      hippocampus structure and function as well as other neural changes.
