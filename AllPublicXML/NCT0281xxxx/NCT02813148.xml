      This post-authorization observational safety study determines the characteristics of patients
      prescribed naloxegol at time of first prescription and treatment patterns of naloxegol in
      follow-up in the United Kingdom (UK), Norway, Sweden, and Germany.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall research questions for this study are: 1) What are the demographic, clinical, and
      treatment characteristics (including dose) at baseline of patients prescribed naloxegol in
      real-world practice (including the use of naloxegol in non-indicated populations)? and 2)
      What are the treatment patterns of naloxegol utilization during follow-up?

      Primary objectives:

        1. To describe the characteristics of patients prescribed naloxegol at time of first
           prescription (demographics, targeted comorbidities, targeted comedications, provider
           characteristics, and indication characteristics).

        2. To describe any of the following treatment patterns:

             -  Discontinuation of naloxegol (permanently during the observation period)

             -  Switching from naloxegol to other drug(s) potentially used by patients with opioid
                induced constipation (OIC)

             -  Prescription of other drug(s) potentially used by patients with OIC in the same
                period when naloxegol is prescribed (augmentation)

             -  Restart in the prescription of naloxegol (after temporary discontinuation or
                treatment holiday)

             -  Continuous treatment with naloxegol during the study period

             -  Change in dosing

      Exploratory objective:

      1. To identify predictors of length of naloxegol use

        Patients in the targeted countries who are newly prescribed naloxegol will be identified
        for inclusion. Patients analyzed in this study will be those who have at least 12 months of
        continuous data available prior to first prescription. The number of patients who do not
        have at least 12 months of prior data will be reported for completeness.
