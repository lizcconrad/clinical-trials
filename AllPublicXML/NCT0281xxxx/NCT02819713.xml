      This is a randomized controlled trial. One group (intervention group) will get in advance to
      the prostate biopsy rectal approximately 5 cc Instillagel. And one group (control group) will
      get in advance to the ultrasound -guided prostate biopsy rectal gel. Pain is measured using
      the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS). The NRS is an imaginary line from 0 until 10. The 0 is no
      pain and 10 is most worst imaginable pain.

      Urologist within Rijnstate use both Instillagel and ultrasound gel during prostate biopsy.
      According to the protocol, the ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy must be performed using
      ultrasound gel. Some urologists departed from the protocols because they think that
      Instillagel will give a pain reduction. With this research we investigate whether Instillagel
      will have an effect on the pain perception bij the patients.

      There will be three moments of pain measurements; Prior to het prostate biopsy. Immediately
      after the prostate biopsy. And five to thirty minutes after the prostate biopsy, when the
      patient is dressed and before the patient goes home.

      Primary endpoint Pain measured by the Numeric Rating Scale

      Secondary endpoints

        -  Age of patient

        -  Previous prostate biopsy

        -  The number of biopsies taken

        -  Presence of prostate cancer

        -  Other complications as after prostate biopsy

      The prostate biopsy will be performed by a urologist working at the outpatient clinic of
      Rijnstate. The ultrasound equipment that will be used during prostate biopsy is Aloka
      ProSound SSD-3500 or Aloka ProSound SSD or SV-3500 SX.
