  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the ten leading cancers in Taiwanese
      male. The prognosis is poor with a five-year overall survival rate of 10 to 30 %. Randomized
      clinical trials have demonstrated that trimodality therapy (TMT), consisted of neoadjuvant
      concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT) and radical esophagectomy, improves the overall survival for
      patients with locally advanced disease. Despite of the advancement, the outcome remained
      unsatisfactory with the median progression-free survival around 20 to 25 months and median
      overall survival around 30 months. It is know that the most important prognostic factor is
      whether a pathological complete response can be achieved after neoadjuvant CCRT. However, the
      use of new generation chemotherapeutic agent taxanes and epidermal growth factor inhibitors
      (such as Cetuximab) failed to significantly improve prognosis comparing to the standard
      platinum-fluorouracil (PF) regimen. As a consequence, it is mandatory to develop new
      chemotherapeutic regimen for CCRT.

      In previous prospective studies, investigators used proximal ligation assay technology to
      identify serum VEGF-A in correlation with the pathological response and prognosis for
      patients receiving neoadjuvant CCRT plus radical esophagectomy for locally advanced ESCC.
      Other investigators also showed high VEGF expression correlating to poor outcome. Therefore,
      investigators generate the hypothesis that adding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      monoclonal antibody, Bevacizumab, to standard neoadjuvant CCRT may improve outcome for
      patients with ESCC. Meanwhile, several prospective clinical studies have shown the
      feasibility, safety, and activity of adding Bevacizumab to chemotherapy, CCRT, or combined
      modality therapy including surgery, either in head and neck cancer, esophageal cancer, or
      esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. However, its efficacy should be further investigated
      in larger prospective trials and little is known about the activity and toxicity of
      Bevacizumab in ESCC due to small number of reported cases. In the present clinical trial,
      investigators plan to investigate whether incorporation of Bevacizumab into standard
      neoadjuvant PF-CCRT will improve treatment response and increase pathological complete
      response rate. Investigators will also evaluate associated biomarkers in relation to
      prognosis. By the present research, investigators expect to develop a new TMT regimen for
      this poor prognostic disease.

      This study is a randomized trial to compare the outcomes between patients receiving
      neoadjuvant PF-CCRT plus Bevacizumab (BPF-CCRT) or PF-CCRT alone. Investigators design to
      enrol 6 patients in the run-in phase, and 44 patients in the randomized phase (22 patients in
      each group) to develop the preliminary evidence for using Bevacizumab in ESCC.
