  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines how online self-guided programs can improve mood and anxiety symptoms.
      These programs use exercises from Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, which is an evidence-based
      treatment for depression and anxiety. The purpose of this study is to learn who will do best
      with the online format. Our aim is to learn for whom online self-guided interventions are
      most efficacious. This knowledge is important because it will help inform clinicians and
      patients about who might benefit from this type of intervention versus who would need the
      assistance of a therapist. More specifically, we hope to figure out who would benefit from
      solely an online intervention and who would benefit from an online intervention in addition
      to other treatment.

    <description>Good Days Ahead is a web-based program based on the principles of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). It can be used to supplement traditional psychotherapy, or as a stand-alone intervention. There are 9 lessons that address Thinking Skills, Behavioral Skills, Schemas, and Coping Tools. Lessons include videos from expert therapists and a Practice Section in which patients complete forms for self-monitoring symptoms and challenging negative thoughts.</description>
