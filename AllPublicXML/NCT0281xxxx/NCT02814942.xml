      Aim:To determine the baseline characteristics of heart failure patients in Singapore
      undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); the long term outcome and predictors of
      response to CRT.

      Methodology:Among patients undergoing CRT for severe heart failure according to indications
      stipulated in international Cardiology guidelines, baseline demographic data is collected.
      Age, gender, NYHA functional class, co-morbidities, QRS width on ECG, presence of left bundle
      branch block pattern on ECG, presence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF) on echocardiogram, ventricular dimensions, 6 min walk test distance are
      collected. In addition, during the CRT implant procedure, blood is drawn from the vascular
      access and analysed for NT-pro BNP levels and other biomarkers of heart failure.

      The echocardiographic and ECG parameters and blood biomarkers are reanalysed at 6 months and
      12 months following CRT implant. Response to CRT is defined as a reduction in the iLVESV
      (left ventricular end-systolic volume index to body surface area) of &gt;/= 15% and/or an
      increase in the LVEF of &gt;/= 10%.
