  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Degenerative disc disease (DDD) is the primary cause of low back pain. The most important
      factor in the development of DDD is the vertical load force on the disc, increasing the
      hydrostatic pressure and facilitating discs degenerations. One of the most common conditions
      accompanying DDD is segmental instability of the spine. The pathogenesis evolves in three
      phases characterized by a progressive disc dehydration and loss of the disc height.

      This phenomenon can be observed in magnetic resonance imaging (T2 weighted MRI) as a decrease
      of the water signal inside the intervertebral disc. It is considered as an indirect sign of
      the alteration of the composition (including glycosaminoglycans) and the structure of the
      intervertebral disk with, as consequence, a modification of the spine biomechanics. Animal
      studies showed that disc regeneration could be enhanced by a decrease of the hydrostatic
      pressure. This could be observed as a signal increase on T2 weighted MRI.

      Recent quantitative MRI sequences now allow the quantification of glycosaminoglycans (GAG)
      concentration inside the cartilage and in the intervertebral disc.

      The actual surgical trends are in favor of an anterior (intersomatic) vertebrak fusion,
      associated or not with a posterior fusion. These technics sacrifice the intervertebral disc
      and change the spine biomechanics.

      Based on a pilot study, the investigators believe that the conservation and even a
      regeneration of the intervertebral disc is possible and allows the preservation of the spine
      biomechanics.

      The purpose of the study is to analyze the relations between specific MRI signals, the GAGs
      concentration, and the functional outcome before and after the surgical treatment.
