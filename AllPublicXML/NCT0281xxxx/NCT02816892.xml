  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate Serum Tenascin C levels in patients with acute symptoms
      relating to a known or newly diagnosed aortic aneurysm in emergency department and reveals
      the possible role of Tenascin C in the development of the disease.

      Patients with acute and chronic aortic disease /survivors and non-survivors were compared.
      Further subgroup analysis on the characteristics of the aneurysm and patients were performed.
      The aneurysms (ruptured and dissected) were divided according to the style of the Stanford
      classification,according to the location of the pathology in aneurysms of the ascending
      thoracic aorta .the descending thoracic aorta, or the abdominal aorta.The subgroup were
      divided according to the extent of propagation of the disease (rupture,covered rupture, acute
      dissection, chronic dissection and ectasia). Rupture was defined by direct visualisation of
      the discontinuity of the aortic wall by computed tomography, sonography, intraoperative
      findings or at autopsy with detection of blood in the pleural, pericardial or abdominal
      cavity. Covert rupture was defined as an intramural haematoma without detection of free blood
      in the body cavities. Acute dissection was defined when blood separating the layers of the
      aortic media was newly diagnosed. Chronic dissection was defined as the absence of any
      visible propagation of a known dissection compared to preexisting examinations. Ectatic
      aneurysm was defined as a permanent localised dilatation of the aorta with a diameter of at
      least 50% greater than normal. Documentation of the surgical interventions and autopsy
      reports was used to confirm the diagnosis. In all patients the investigators collected the
      history, age of the patients, duration of pain, blood pressure at admission and laboratory
      parameters (haematocrit, creatinine) and Tenascin C Serum levels after admission to our
      emergency department immediately. The patients were followed up until hospital discharge and
      the outcome (survived/died) was recorded.
