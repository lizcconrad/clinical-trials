    <textblock>
      In many of urothelial carcinoma patients, one does not find common risk factors such as
      smoking. The medical center is located in an industrial city with known air and water
      pollution. The investigators decided to check the presence of nano particles and traces of
      metals in urinary samples of patients known and suspected for urothelial carcinoma and
      compare the results to both cystoscopic and cytological findings. The patients will fill a
      validated epidemiological respiratory disease survey and the results will be compared to a
      control group.
