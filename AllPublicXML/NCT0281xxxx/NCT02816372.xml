  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the use of protective ventilation, neuromuscular blocking agent and prone position,
      ARDS mortality remains high (30%-50%) in observational studies, and pneumothorax rate in
      randomized controlled trial remains stable (10%). The driving pressure (the ratio of tidal
      volume over respiratory system compliance) has recently been strongly associated with ARDS
      mortality, suggesting that tidal volume reduction below 6ml/kg may offer mortality benefit.
      While extracorporeal CO2 removal technique are currently under investigation in association
      with tidal volume reduction
