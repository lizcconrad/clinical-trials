  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of durvalumab and
      tremelimumab can help to control sarcoma. The safety of this drug combination will also be
      studied.

      This is an investigational study. Durvalumab and tremelimumab are not FDA approved or
      commercially available. They are currently being used for research purposes only. The study
      doctor can explain how the study drugs are designed to work.

      Up to 150 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive tremelimumab and
      durvalumab by vein, over about 1 hour each, every 4 weeks for up to 16 weeks (4 doses). After
      Week 16, you may continue to receive durvalumab alone by vein over about 1 hour for an
      additional 32 weeks (8 doses).

      If you have a side effect related to the combination of durvalumab and tremelimumab during
      the first 16 weeks of the study, you may be able to switch over to receive durvalumab alone
      sooner than expected. This will be discussed with you.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Week 0:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have 3 EKGs in a row.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests. If you can
           become pregnant, part of this routine blood and urine sample will be used for a
           pregnancy test.

        -  Blood (about 2½ tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing. Biomarkers
           are found in the blood and may be related to your reaction to the study drug. The type
           of genetic testing in this study will be performed to learn how your DNA (genetic
           material) may change how you respond to the study drugs.

      On Day 1 of Weeks 2 and 6, blood (about 3½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine, genetic,
      and biomarker testing.

      On Day 1 of Week 4 and then every 4 weeks after that (Weeks 8, 12, 16, and so on) until Week
      44:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

        -  You will have imaging scans. You will not have these scans at Weeks 16 and 24.

      On Day 1 of Weeks 10 and 14, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Length of Study:

      You may receive up to 4 doses of durvalumab in combination with tremelimumab and up to an
      additional 8 doses of durvalumab alone. You will no longer be able to take the study drug(s)
      if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow
      study directions.

      If you complete 12 months of therapy but the disease appears to get worse, you may be able to
      re-start treatment. The study doctor will discuss this with you.

      It is expected that your participation in this study may last up to 15 months. Your
      participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      As soon as possible after your last dose of study drug(s):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.

        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker and genetic testing.

      Follow-Up Visit:

      About 30 days after your last dose of study drug(s):

      You will have a physical exam. Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Long-Term Follow-Up

      Every 3 months:

        -  You will have an MRI, CT, or PET/CT scan.

        -  You may be called to learn how you are doing and if you have started any anti-cancer
           treatments. If you are called, it should take about 5-10 minutes.

             for the subtype (i.e. Progressing well-differentiated liposarcoma, clear cell sarcoma
             etc do not require prior therapy).

          4. Subjects must have at least 1 lesion that is measurable by irRECIST a. A previously
             irradiated lesion can be considered a target lesion if the lesion is well defined,

             except for pts with Osteosarcoma who will be allowed to participate with an estimated
             creatinine clearance (CrCl) of &gt; 40 mL/min, as calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault

             first dose of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab are permitted to enroll.

          4. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional
             study.

          5. Receipt of any conventional or investigational anticancer therapy not otherwise
             specified above within 28 days or 5 half-lives of the agent prior to the first dose of

          6. Any concurrent chemotherapy, Immunotherapies or biologic or hormonal therapy for
             cancer treatment. Concurrent use of hormones for non-cancer-related conditions (eg,
             insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable. In addition,
             local treatment (eg, by local surgery or radiotherapy) of isolated lesions for
             palliative intent is acceptable beyond the first cycle with prior consultation and in
             agreement with the PI.

          7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to
             NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 or 1 with the exception of alopecia and laboratory values

             reasonably expected to be exacerbated by any of the investigational products may be
             included (eg, hearing loss) after consultation with the study chair.

          8. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 14 days prior to the first
             dose of MEDI4736 or tremelimumab. The following are exceptions to this criterion: a.

             intra-articular injection), b. Systemic corticosteroids at physiologic doses not to
             exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent, c. Steroids as premedication for

             diagnosis of tuberculosis

         10. True positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis B or C.

         11. Receipt of live, attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to the first dose of
             investigational products (NOTE: Subjects, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine
             during the study and 180 days after the last dose of investigational products).

         14. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirement, substantially increase risk of incurring AEs from MEDI4736 or
             tremelimumab, or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed
             consent.

         15. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor, would interfere
             with evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or
             study results.

         16. Patients with a history of pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.
