  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TwHF), a traditional Chinese herb, is widely used in China for
      treating Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), but limited only for elderly RA patients because of its
      reproductive system toxicity. The investigators are inspired by Chinese external therapy, an
      immemorial therapy for thousands of years, and take its advantage to make TwHF topically in
      order to get an effective and safe treatment for active RA patients.
