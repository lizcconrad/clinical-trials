    <textblock>
      It is acknowledged that IL-18, as a product of the inflammasome, is involved in host defence
      against viral and bacterial stimuli by modulating the immune response. The aim of this study
      was to determine IL-18 levels in serum of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome
      and to investigate whether corticosteroid attenuate its levels.

    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by an inflammatory injury to the
      lung that is characterized clinically by acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Pathologically
      complex changes in the lung are manifested by an early, exudative phase followed by
      proliferative and fibrotic phases. Persistent ARDS is characterized by ongoing inflammation,
      parenchymal-cell proliferation, and disordered deposition of collagen, all of which may be
      responsive to corticosteroid therapy. Systemic corticosteroids have been considered a
      potentially beneficial therapy. However, several studies have failed to provide convincing
      evidence to prove the efficacy of corticosteroids in decreasing the mortality of ARDS. For
      the secondary outcomes, such as oxygenation improvement and reduction of the duration of
      mechanical ventilation, have shown consistent findings in favor of corticosteroid therapy.
      However, the underlying mechanisms that account for the anti-inflammatory actions of
      corticosteroid in ARDS patients have not yet to be elucidated, and the activities do not
      appear to be controlled by a single mechanism. Interleukin-18 (IL-18), along with
      interleukin-1b (IL-1b), is produced by inflammasomes when activated by a number of pathogen,
      environmental or host-derived danger signals. Inflammasomes are innate immune regulatory
      protein complexes which seem to play a key role in the host immune response of patients with
      ARDS. The aim of this study is to determine the role of steroid on IL-18 levels in serum of
      patients with ARDS and its effect on prognosis.
