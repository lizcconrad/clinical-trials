  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetuses with IUGR, there is a correlation between Doppler indices of cardiovascular function
      and perinatal mortality. An index of systolic flow velocities at the aortic isthmus (ISI) has
      previously been described in a population of normal fetuses. Fetuses with IUGR, the
      velocities recorded in the aortic isthmus could be affected and the normal development of the
      ISI should be changed, because of the increase in placental resistance on one hand, and the
      gradual deterioration ventricular functions on the other one. Investigators hypothesize that
      the ISI index in the context of placental insufficiency could provide additional arguments on
      the extraction timing, the prognosis and the fetal extraction mode to severe hypoxia. The
      primary outcome of the study is to evaluate in an exploratory manner the feasibility and the
      potential interest of longitudinal monitoring of fetuses with IUGR by Doppler systolic
      isthmus and the calculation of the ISI index.

    <textblock>
      Today evaluating the hemodynamic tolerance of the fetus with IUGR, is based on clinical
      evidence of fetal well-being and ultrasound arguments, since we know in fact that there is a
      correlation between Doppler indices of cardiovascular function and perinatal mortality.

      The flow to the systolic aortic isthmus may be a marker of systolic performance balance of
      both ventricles. An index of systolic flow velocities (ISI) has previously been described in
      a population of normal fetuses. Fetuses with IUGR, the velocities recorded in the aortic
      isthmus could be affected and the normal development of the ISI should be changed, because of
      the increase in placental resistance on one hand, and the gradual deterioration ventricular
      functions on the other one. Investigators hypothesize that the ISI index in the context of
      placental insufficiency could provide additional arguments on the extraction timing, the
      prognosis and the fetal extraction mode to severe hypoxia.

      The strategy evaluates the feasibility of measuring the ISI index on Doppler systolic flow in
      the aortic isthmus in the follow-up by ultrasound of the fetus with IUGR due to placental
      insufficiency.

      The ISI is obtained from this flow by calculating the ratio of the minimum systolic velocity
      (called Nadir) on the peak systolic velocity (called Peak) or Nadir / Peak. The fetal
      extraction decision (birth) will be taken, blinded the outcome of the ISI, following the
      protocol of national recommendations for the management of fetuses with IUGR.
