  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the implementation, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability
      of a worksite lifestyle improvement program that includes lifestyle education classes led by
      trained individuals from the worksite and improvements in the worksite environment that will
      make it easier for employees at risk for diabetes or with unmedicated diabetes to lose
      weight, exercise more, and eat a healthier diet. A total of 2000 participants across 8
      worksites in India (4 from Delhi and national capital region [NCR] region and 4 from Chennai)
      will be involved in this study for 5 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will implement and evaluate in a pre-post design trial the acceptability,
      delivery, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of a worksite-based lifestyle improvement
      package including a peer-led lifestyle change education program (described below) augmented
      with changes in the worksite environment that promote social support, healthy eating and
      exercise. The lifestyle education program will include 2000 adults with prediabetes (HbA1c of
      5.7-6.4%) or unmedicated diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% identified at screening) across eight diverse
      worksites in India (changes to the worksite environment will impact a much broader population
      of employees). A mixed methods approach will be used to evaluate implementation of the
      program.

      Participants at high risk for diabetes or with unmedicated diabetes will be enrolled in a
      lifestyle intervention training program that includes strategies to maintain a healthy
      weight, maintain healthy blood glucose levels, eat a healthy diet, increase physical
      activity, overcome barriers, and build social support. Participants will be assigned two
      goals to achieve during lifestyle classes; to increase the physical activity to at least 150
      minutes per week of moderate level activity and lose at least 7% of their baseline body
      weight. Participants also will be given knowledge and tools necessary to improve their diet
      quality and quantity.

Participants will also be assigned goals to achieve; increasing physical activity and losing 7% of their baseline body weight. During maintenance, participants will receive biweekly SMS text messages providing lifestyle advice tips and encouragement.</description>
