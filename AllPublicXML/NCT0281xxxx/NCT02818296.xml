  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigation examines the efficacy of a brief, one-session computerized interpretation
      bias modification paradigm (CBM-I) in the reduction of intolerance of uncertainty.
      Intolerance of uncertainty is a risk factor for the development and maintenance of various
      forms of psychopathology.

    <description>This paradigm was designed to train individuals to endorse benign interpretations of ambiguous information and reject negative/threatening interpretations of ambiguous information. Participant's baseline interpretation bias was measured at baseline. Participants then underwent two training phases in which their responses were either reinforced (i.e., they were told they were correct) or punished (i.e., they were told that they were incorrect). Interpretation bias was measured again at post-training.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This paradigm was identical to the active condition except that the word/sentence pairings used were not relevant to IU and/or anxiety.</description>
