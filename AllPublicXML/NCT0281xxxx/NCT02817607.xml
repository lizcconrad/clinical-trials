  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to establish techniques for evaluating breast cutaneous
      sensation at baseline and following either lumpectomy or mastectomy for breast cancer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Measuring nerve recovery and breast sensibility has been reported in a limited fashion in the
      past. A number of studies have assessed patients before and after breast reduction surgery
      using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments and found this to be an effective technique. A limited
      number of studies have been done in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer using
      these techniques. The main limitation of these existing studies is the lack of prospective
      measurements before surgery and through time, thus restricting the findings to isolated
      long-term outcomes. Additionally, no studies have compared patients undergoing mastectomy
      versus lumpectomy to determine the impact that surgical approach has on breast sensibility.

    <description>Semmes-Weinstein testing: Each breast will be subdivided into 5 regions. This will include the upper 1/3rd, the middle 1/3rd medial and lateral to the nipple areola complex, the lower 1/3rd and the nipple areola-complex. These regions are consistent with the dermatomes described for the breast innervation.
A cutaneous nerve/skin biopsy is a simple procedure commonly performed on an outpatient setting. The total procedure is expected to take 20 minutes and may be done at the time of surgery as well as 2 and 6 months post operatively either during a revision or at a follow up visit.</description>
