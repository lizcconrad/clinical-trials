    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes is the predominant type of diabetes. Because a quiet evolution, it is
      difficult to have a rapid diagnose. A better knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms at
      the origin of type 2 diabetes and about its complications could make it possible to improve
      the prevention and the treatment of this disease.

      Research team developped a new research axis : the microbiota of the intestinal mucosa. They
      proved a translocation process of intestinal bacteria from the intestinal mucosa to different
      tissue of the organism implicated in glucose homeostasis. This mechanism is involved in the
      type 2 diabetes development. A clinical study (MICIMAB) of predictive biomarkers of diabetes
      and obesity is ongoing.

      In parallel, the same team explored the role of intestinal immunity modifications in the
      bacteria translocation from the gut to the blood circulation. They already have some results
      on animal model but not yet in human. In animal model, a solid reduction of lymphocytes T CD4
      Th17 in the intestinal wall is responsable of the translocation of intestinal bacteria and in
      the induction of a metabolic inflammation wich promotes insulin resistance, abdominal obesity
      development and type 2 diabetes.

      The aim of this study is to explore this hypothesis in human to have therapeutic solution
      later.
