      The purpose of this study is to examine whether Texting for Relapse Prevention (T4RP), a text
      messaging-based early warming for relapse prevention in people who have schizophrenia/SAD, is
      associated with fewer relapse symptoms compared to a treatment-as-usual control group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is among the 20 most debilitating illnesses worldwide, responsible for 1% of
      the global burden of disease. Schizoaffective disorder (SAD) affects an additional 0.2% to
      1.1% of adults. As many as four out of five people who have schizophrenia or SAD relapse
      within 5 years of recovery from their initial episode. Interventions aimed at early
      intervention to prevent relapse would impact public health.

      The Texting for Relapse Prevention (T4RP) is an innovative service delivery program delivered
      via text messaging designed for people who have schizophrenia/SAD. The intervention will be
      tested in a randomized controlled trial against a treatment-as-usual control group which, for
      most, involved meeting with their therapist every 2 to 4 weeks and meeting with their
      psychiatrist at least once every 90 days or more frequently as clinically indicated. A total
      of 40 people with schizophrenia and 5-15 provider participants (depending on the patient
      distribution across the providers) in the pilot RTC. The study is being conducted by
      researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Johns Hopkins Community
      Psychiatry Program (JHCPP).

      The investigators posit that T4RP will reduce psychiatric morbidity and institutionalization
      rates and promote recovery by facilitating improved patient-provider communication, promoting
      medication adherence, helping people self-monitor their early warning signs, and promoting
      self-management of symptoms.

      If T4RP is effective, this cost-effective and easily scalable intervention will make a
      significant public health impact and reduction in relapse-related costs for people with
      schizophrenia/SAD.

    <description>T4RP is a relapse prevention mHealth program text messaging to people who have schizophrenia/SAD. The intervention will include an online interface for clinicians and an automated text messaging program for patients. Firstly, patients and providers will meet in an intake session, to identify the patient's personal early warning signs from a pre-identified list. Using the online interface, providers will enter additional warning signs or personalize the wording of the messages as requested by the patient. The patient also will determine the threshold at which the provider will be alerted about a possible relapse and whether additional contact people should be alerted.</description>

    <description>The control group will be a treatment as usual comparison group. For the majority of individuals with schizophrenia/SAD in care at JHCPP, this involves meeting with their therapist every 2 to 4 weeks and meeting with their psychiatrist at least once every 90 days or more frequently as clinically indicated. All routine appointments are scheduled, but individuals can walk in or call if they do not feel well between sessions.</description>
