    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of domperidone on the QTc interval
      duration in Chinese healthy adult participants after multiple domperidone doses of 10
      milligram (mg) 3 times a day (tid) and 20 mg tid.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, medical history,
             vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at Screening. If there are
             abnormalities, they must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study
             population. This determination must be recorded in the participants source documents
             and signed by the investigator

          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of clinical laboratory tests performed at
             Screening. If the results of the serum chemistry panel including liver enzymes,
             hematology, or urinalysis are outside the normal reference ranges, the participant may
             be included only if the investigator judges the abnormalities or deviations from
             normal to be not clinically significant or to be appropriate and reasonable for the
             population under study. This determination must be recorded in the participants source
             documents and signed by the investigator

          -  A woman, must have been proved to be non-pregnant via a highly sensitive serum
             beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) pregnancy test at Screening; and a
             negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1 of each treatment period

          -  Due to the lack of adequate reproductive toxicity data, in addition to the user
             independent highly effective method of contraception, a male or female condom with or
             without spermicide is required. Male condom and female condom should not be used
             together (due to risk of failure with friction)

          -  Body mass index (BMI; weight [kilogram {kg}]/height^2 [meter {m}]^2) between 18 and 30
             kilogram per meter square [kg/m^2] (inclusive), and body weight not less than 50
             kilogram (kg)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of or current clinically significant medical illness including cardiac
             arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, hematologic disease, coagulation disorders
             (including any abnormal bleeding or blood dyscrasias), lipid abnormalities,
             significant pulmonary disease, including bronchospastic respiratory disease, diabetes
             mellitus, renal or hepatic insufficiency, thyroid disease, neurologic or psychiatric
             disease, infection, gastro-intestinal disease, or any other illness that the
             investigator considers should exclude the participant or that could interfere with the
             interpretation of the study results

          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or
             urinalysis at screening or at admission to the study center as deemed appropriate by
             the investigator

          -  Presence of hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypomagnesemia, hypercalcemia
             or hypocalcemia

          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical examination, vital signs or 12-Lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG) at Screening or at admission to the study center as deemed
             appropriate by the investigator

          -  Known allergy to the Domperidone or any of the excipients of the formulation
