  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspite of curative treatment 30-50% patients with ColoRectal Cancer (CRC) develop tumor
      relapse during the first 3 years after treatment of the primary tumor. Treatment of relapses
      is based on surgical resection, when possible, chemotherapy and targeted therapies. To detect
      recurrences or metastases, a surveillance strategy is recommended for patients able to
      withstand complementary treatment during a five-year period. Over this period, the
      probability of one false-positive result is 87%. Considering that less than 10% of recurrent
      patients are suitable for potentially curative treatment and that more intensive programs
      enable an increase of the overall rate of curative resection but do not result in reduced
      mortality, less time and cost-consuming, tailored follow-up is necessary. The level of
      circulating ccfDNA, defined as extra cellular DNA, increases in CRC patients. The Inplex®
      method could validate the use of ccfDNA as a cancer biomarker in terms of prognosis and
      surveillance.

      Tubes for ccfDNA analysis will be taken during medical examination at the same time of the
      CEA dosage (if it was not made before the consultation). Cryotubes of plasma will be sent for
      analysis in the laboratory INSERM (National Health Institute) of Montpellier and the
      remaining plasma will be kept in biological collection.

      Patients will have a consultation of follow-up every 3-4 months during which the dosage of
      CEA and ccfDNA will be realized as well as a medical examination, a general examination
      (weight, size, and blood pressure), an evaluation of the indices of performance status and a
      nutritional evaluation in case of loss of weight.
