      Maternity and neonatology, caregivers are regularly confronted with the pain of the newborn,
      especially after a birth injury, but it is sometimes difficult ti define.

      There is not, to our knowledge, any prevalence study of pain in newborn motherhood. The data
      available are those of the perinatal survey 2010, with the number of operative vaginal
      deliveries (5.3% of suction, forceps 3.9%, 2.9% spatulas) and the number of extractions the
      seat (4.7%). These delivery modes can be purveyors of pain.

      At St. Joseph's Hospital, there were in 2013: 259 instrumental deliveries and 90 extractions
      by headquarters. Fifty five paracetamol bottles were consumed in the layer sequence in 2013,
      and 15 in the delivery room. But this consumption is a poor reflection of the pain because
      treatment could be given pain-authenticated (measured with the EDIN scale), and because a
      bottle is discarded one month after opening.

      The scales measuring pain used in the new-born at term based on the assessment of change in
      behavior; two specific scores of the newborn are used in France: Pain and Discomfort Scale
      Newborn (EDIN) for prolonged pain and Acute Pain scale Newborn (DAN) for acute pain related
      to health care.

      The EVENDOL scale (Child Pain Evaluation) has been validated for pediatric emergencies in
      children 0-7 years, as well as pre-hospital, to measure the intensity of pain whether acute
      or prolonged (8 ). It is easy and fast to use. validation cohorts included a significant
      proportion of newborns. This scale appears suitable for evaluation of the newborn to term
      maternity

      Objectives:

      Principal: validation of the instrument &quot;EVENDOL&quot; in the new-born at term.

      Secondary:

        -  EVENDOL is equivalent to EDIN to diagnose the pain of the newborn at term.

        -  While being faster and easier to dimension.

        -  EVENDOL preferred by caregivers

      Methodology and conduct of the study:

      DESIGN: Study of practical evaluation of observational, prospective, multicenter.

      Places of study: maternity of Saint Joseph Hospital, and Kremlin Bicetre. A feasibility study
      is underway, it was started in neonatology Antoine Béclère. Time study: 12 to 18 months
      Required subjects: 100 patients (1/3 painless children, 2/3 of painful children).
