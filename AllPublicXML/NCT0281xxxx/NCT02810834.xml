  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of the Fueling Learning Through Exercise (FLEX) study is two
      innovative school-based physical activity programs (a walking/running program and a classroom
      activity break program) will increase school-time and total daily minutes children engage in
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, relative to controls, and that children who attend
      schools with these PA programs will demonstrate improved cognitive functioning, academic
      achievement, and attendance, relative to controls.

      The FLEX Study is a three-year, randomized control trial that seeks to understand how two
      different innovative school-based physical activity (PA) programs influence not only
      children's time spent in MVPA but also their cognitive and academic outcomes. The FLEX Study
      will be implemented and evaluated by researchers from Tufts University. The project is funded
      by the National Institutes of Health.

      Schools participating in the study will be randomly assigned to receive a walking/running
      program, a classroom physical activity program, or no program (control) during first year and
      a half of the study. Third and fourth grade children will be enrolled in the study.

      Physical activity will be assessed objectively using accelerometry. Additional measurements
      will include: BMI/BMI-z (measured height and weight), diet and physical activity
      questionnaires, cognitive functioning (tests of working memory and inhibitory control).

    <description>Participants will receive a behavioral intervention that consists of a school-based, walking/running/jogging program. Participants work to accumulate miles towards a goal of at least 100 miles, over the course of the school year. Program will be implemented through a &quot;champion&quot; in the school and structured/scheduled according to the schools resources (before, during, or after school). Miles are tracked at the school level, and incentives are provided for participants' completion of set milestones (25, 50, 75, and 100 miles).
The intervention will run over two school years (approximately 16 months)</description>

    <intervention_name>Classroom physical activity break program</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will receive a behavioral intervention that consists of a classroom-based, physical activity break program. Classroom teachers, paraprofessionals, and other school staff will lead short (5-15 minute) activity breaks that include both higher intensity (ex. jumping jacks, squats) and low-intensity (ex. stretching, yoga) activities. Classrooms will be encouraged to integrate at least one short break per day. Activities are connected to national Common Core academic standards so that breaks can be integrated with academics.
The intervention will run over two school years (approximately 16 months)</description>
