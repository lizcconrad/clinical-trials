      The purpose of this study is to elaborate a multi-dimensional indicator of the quality in
      palliative care for patients of end-of-life.

      The study will, as secondary objectives:

        -  elaborate in a standard manner one set of indicators of organization and inner working
           of a palliative care setting.

        -  compare according to these indicators, the qualities of 3 types of palliative care:
           palliative care unit in hospitals, specified identified bed for palliative care patients
           and non-specified bed.

        -  explore the relationship between organizational aspects and results in term of burden.
