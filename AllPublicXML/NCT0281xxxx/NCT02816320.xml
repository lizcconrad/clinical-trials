    <textblock>
      In a retrospective cross-sectional study, investigators aimed to valid the variables employed
      to generate standardized mortality ratio from hospital administrative databases. For this
      purpose, investigators have compared those variables collected in administrative databases
      with the information available in patient medical record.
