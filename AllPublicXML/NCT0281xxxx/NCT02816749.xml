  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study of participants with diabetic foot ulcers who will receive either
      maggot debridement therapy (MDT) or conventional dressing therapy (CDT). Wound healing time
      is the main outcome measure to compare the clinical efficacy of these two therapies. The
      investigators developed a hypothesis that MDT could achieve remarkable shorter time and
      better healing rate for wound closure when compared with CDT.

    <textblock>
      The investigators designed a prospective randomized study to compare the clinical safety and
      efficacy of maggot debridement therapy (MDT) and conventional dressing therapy (CDT). This
      study is scheduled from July 2016 to February 2017. Patients, aged from 18-80, who suffered
      from type 2 diabetic mellitus foot ulcers with Grade 1 or Grade 2 according to the Wagner
      classification could be the participants of this study. A sample of 138 participants was
      calculated based on the morbidity of diabetic foot ulcers, accounting for estimated 10%
      attrition rate. The glycemic control is important for the validity of study results. A
      specific team of endocrine doctors will manage the blood glucose of participants of two
      groups within the range of 7-10 mmol/L.

      Participants will be allocated into MDT group and CDT group randomly according to the random
      number table. For MDT-participants, bio-bags containing sterilized, live, medicinal Lucilia
      sericata larvae will be placed on the wound of ulcers. For CDT-participants, conventional
      dressing (disinfected by iodophor, dressed by gauze ) will be performed ordinally. Every 3
      days the procedures of two groups will be performed and wounds assessment will be done until
      the wounds closure is achieved. The wounds assessment, including measurement of the area of
      wound surface and bacterial culture, will be performed by a specific team of microsurgical
      doctors. The outcome measures include wound healing time (days) and the time negative
      bacterial culture occurs (days). The secondary outcome measures include the area of wound
      surface (cm2), treatment related pain, comfort of the dressing and adverse events.
