  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The question this research project wants to explore is whether using the Prevena Incision
      Management System (Prevena) will improve sternal wound edge oxygenation in patients
      undergoing Coronary Artery bypass surgery with Bilateral Internal Mammary Artery grafts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass is the gold standard surgical treatment of patients with complex
      coronary disease. It is a common operation and more than 16000 procedures per year are
      carried out in the UK. Recent publications suggest that during the bypass procedure both left
      and right internal mammary arteries should be used to bypass coronary stenoses. It was noted
      that using both internal mammary arteries will result in even better long term survival with
      improved freedom from cardiac events such as myocardial infarction or further coronary
      intervention than using. The major drawback of using both internal mammary arteries is the
      increased risk of sternal wound infection and breakdown. The investigators will use Near
      Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) to assess the wound edge oxygenation delivery. The NIRS INVOS
      system the investigators use within Sheffield Teaching Hospitals can measure oxygenation of
      soft tissue to a certain depth making it suitable for the assessment of wound edge oxygen
      delivery. Prevena is commercially available and has a CE mark.

      The Prevena wound management system differs from conventional wound dressings, it applies
      negative pressure to the closed wound for 7 days. Wound complications/infections are
      decreased when this type of wound management system is used. Studies suggest that Prevena
      achieves these outcomes because of an increase of perfusion in the wound edges and keeping
      the wound dry. Patients will be randomised to either the Prevena wound management or their
      standard of care NHS wound management for their procedure. The oxygenation and outcomes of
      the wounds will be compared through data collection and the patients followed up during their
      routine inpatient care and 6 week outpatient appointment.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients are those who require isolated coronary artery bypass surgery, who
             need at least 2 bypass grafts, and who are deemed suitable by the operating surgeon to
             have both right and left internal mammary arteries harvested as conduits

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Require additional procedures in addition to the coronary bypass or need for internal
             mammary artery harvest for feasibility study

          -  Who are deemed by the operating surgeon as unsuitable for bilateral internal mammary
             artery harvest because of

          -  Age (75 or older where prognostic benefit of using both internal mammary arteries has
             been questioned),

          -  Obesity with a BMI which is higher than 35 (increased risks of wound infection)

          -  Diabetes (of any type) (increased risks of infection.)
