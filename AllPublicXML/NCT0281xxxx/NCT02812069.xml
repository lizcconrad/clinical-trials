  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothermia during surgery and in the postoperative period is associated with adverse
      outcomes including impaired drug metabolism, cardiac morbidity, shivering, impaired immune
      function, coagulopathy, and increased use of hospital resources. Several clinical studies
      have demonstrated that maintenance of normothermia during the perioperative period
      significantly reduces morbidity.

      Mercury Biomed has developed a patient-warming system, WarmSmart, that potentially transfers
      adequate heat through hands and feet based on the physiological principle of peripheral
      arterio-venous shunt vaso-dilation. The technology works as a two-step process by selective
      thermal stimulation along the spinal cord to up-regulate blood flow to arterio-venous shunts
      and triggering arterio-venous shunt vasodilation and by applying circulating water heat
      exchangers to the palmar and plantar glabrous skin to warm highly perfused shunts in that
      area.

      General anesthesia reduces the vasoconstriction threshold (triggering core temperature) by
      1-2°C, thus promoting arteriovenous shunt dilation. It remains unknown, though, whether
      cervical spine warming further augments arterio-venous shunt dilation during general
      anesthesia. If spine heating proves unnecessary under anesthesia, Mercury Biomed's WarmSmart
      warming could be simpler and less expensive. Investigators therefore propose to test the
      hypothesis that cutaneous heating near the cervical spine does not further augment
      arterio-venous flow in fingers during general anesthesia.

      Investigators propose to enroll ten patients. The patients will be pre-warmed and warmed
      intraoperatively with forced-air to maintain a core temperature near 36°C.

      A ThermaZone® Device capable of heating the cervical spine area will be positioned behind the
      patient's neck upon arrival in the operating rooms. Additionally a forced-air warmer will be
      positioned appropriately and activated as soon as practical, usually after prepping and
      draping. Ambient temperature will be maintained near 20°C.

      After about one hour of anesthesia when temperature and other factors are stable,
      investigators will start a 30-minute observation period. Thereafter investigators will
      activate the cervical spine warming system for 30 minutes (warming measurement period) and
      thereafter have a 30 minutes control period again.

      Measurements will be recorded such as mean-skin temperature, distal esophageal temperature,
      MAC fraction, mean-arterial pressure and finger blood flow.
