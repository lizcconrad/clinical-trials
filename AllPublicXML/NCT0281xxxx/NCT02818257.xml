    <description>The three strips applied to skin that has received the same treatment (either buffer 1, buffer 2 or dry) are removed at three different time points (max 60 min) and the peel force is measured.
Peel force (90 degree angle from skin) The tensile tester was mounted on a tripod under which the subject was lying. In this way the tensile tester measures the force (Newton), which was needed to remove the adhesive from the skin with a constant speed and with a mean angel of 90°</description>
