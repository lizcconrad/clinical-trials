  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently identified promiscuous HLA-DR-derived epitopes from the human
      telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) called universal cancer peptides (UCP), to study
      tumor-specific CD4+ T cell responses.

      The investigators found high frequency of naturally occuring UCP-specific TH1 cells in long
      term survival of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) previously treated by 5 fluoro-uracil
      -oxaliplatin (Folfox) +/- bevacizumab regiment (Godet et al. OncoImmunology 2012 and
      unpublished data).

      Epitopes-CRC02 is a French prospective multicenter study which will evaluate the post
      chemotherapy and post surgery modulation of host tumor-specific CD4 TH1 cell responses in
      metastatic colorectal cancer patients and their correlation with progression-free survival.
