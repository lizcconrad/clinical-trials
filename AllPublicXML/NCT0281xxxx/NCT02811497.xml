      This is a phase 2 study of investigational drug, durvalumab given in combination with
      azacitidine (CC-486). The main purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the antitumor
      activity of azacitidine in combination with durvalumab patients with microsatellite stable
      colorectal carcinoma (MSS-CRC), platinum resistant epithelial ovarian cancer type II (PR-OC),
      and estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative breast cancer.
