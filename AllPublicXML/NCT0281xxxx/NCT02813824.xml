  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial will evaluate the effect of aspirin 300 mg/d and 100 mg/d during 4 years
      vs placebo, in a 4 groups randomised parallel design in Lynch syndrome patients: patients
      with proven carriers of pathological mutations in mismatch repairs genes and patients with
      personal and family history characterizing Lynch syndrome according to modified Amsterdam
      criteria without proven mutation, aged more than 18 years with signed informed consent. The
      main hypothesis to be tested is that aspirin could decrease colorectal adenoma recurrence
      evaluated during high quality follow-up by colonic chromo-endoscopy in Lynch syndrome
      patients. The trial will also explore: (i) colorectal neoplasia recurrence according to
      different germline alteration in mismatch repair genes, (ii) observance to chemoprevention in
      Lynch syndrome patients, (iii) the burden of adverse events attributable to aspirin in Lynch
      syndrome patients, (iv) the dose-effect of aspirin on adenomatous polyp burden. All
      pathological samples will be reviewed using a centralized procedure. The INCA regional
      network organization and the HNPCC patient organization will allow the recruitment and the
      follow-up of a large number of patients with well characterised Lynch syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common inherited colorectal cancer syndrome, and results from
      germline mutations in mismatch repair genes that confer a high lifetime risk of colorectal
      cancer (CRC) (60 to 70%). Most CRCs arise from asymptomatic polyps. Development of such
      polyps into cancer can be prevented if polyps are detected early by endoscopy and removed.
      Colonoscopy is proposed every 2 years in LS patients more than 25 years old, and every year
      when colonic neoplasia has been detected. Efficient chemoprevention has the potential to
      represent a cost-effective intervention in these patients and could allow a delay in
      colonoscopic surveillance.

      Several epidemiological studies have shown that regular use of low dose aspirin (75 to 300
      mg/d) is associated with a 20 to 30 % reduction in the risk of sporadic colonic polyps and
      CRC. Four randomised controlled trials (RCT) have also shown a decrease in colorectal polyp
      recurrence. In a pooled analysis of cardio-vascular prevention RCTs, as well as in a
      meta-analysis, daily aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of CRC and CRC associated
      mortality. Aspirin preventive benefit is expected to outweigh its putative side effects in
      high risk patients. The CAPP2 study in Lynch syndrome patients showed that aspirin (300 mg
      x2/d) did not reduce significantly the risk of colorectal neoplasia after 29 months, but an
      extended follow-up (mean 56 months) showed a reduction in colorectal cancer in the aspirin
      group. In this study, the endoscopic follow-up was not optimal with a relatively low
      detection rate of colorectal neoplasia according to usual reported rate when chromo-endoscopy
      is performed. So, the real effect and clinical benefit of aspirin are still to be
      characterised in Lynch syndrome patients.
