  <brief_summary>

      The study of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to track progression of Parkinson's disease
      (PD) is essential while disease-modifying treatments are being developed. Many clinical
      biological or imaging biomarkers have been tested but no &quot;gold standard&quot; has been found as of
      yet. Among these, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relaxometry using R2* measurement (R2* =
      1/T2*), which is a validated marker for estimating brain iron concentration, appears to be an
      attractive technique because its safety, rapidly measured in clinical conditions and its ease
      to ensure individual longitudinal follow-up. Current data of cross sectional studies of R2*,
      which have shown an iron increase in Substantia Nigra (SN), led to suppose that it could be a
      biomarker of disease vulnerability. Recently, the investigators have conducted the first
      longitudinal follow-up of R2* (1.5 T MRI), which showed a rapid R2* increase in both parts of
      the SN and in the caudal putamen. We propose, here, a multicenter prospective study of
      one-year cohort follow-up of R2* variations (ΔR2*) in three regions of interest (ROIs) (the
      SN, the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) and the Putamen) of 160 patients with PD, using a 3
      Tesla MRI, to evaluate the potential interest of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression.
      The variation of R2* (ΔR2*) will be correlated with clinical markers of disease progress,
      non-motor symptoms. 80 healthy controls subjects will also be included to assess the effect
      of aging on cerebral physiological iron levels.

      The study of non-invasive and reliable biomarkers to track progression of Parkinson's disease
      is essential while disease-modifying treatments are being developed. Many clinical biological
      or imaging biomarkers have been tested but no &quot;gold standard&quot; has been found as of yet. Among
      these, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) relaxometry using R2* measurement (R2* = 1/T2*),
      which is a validated marker for estimating brain iron concentration, appears to be an
      attractive technique because its safety, rapidly measured in clinical conditions and its ease
      to ensure individual longitudinal follow-up. Current data of cross sectional studies of R2*,
      which have shown an iron increase in substantia nigra, led to suppose that it could be a
      biomarker of disease vulnerability. Recently, we have conducted the first longitudinal
      follow-up of R2* (1.5 T MRI), which showed a rapid R2* increase in both parts of the SN and
      in the caudal putamen. We propose, here, a multicenter prospective study of one-year cohort
      follow-up of R2* variations (ΔR2*) in three regions of interest (the substantia nigra, the
      ventral tegmental area and the putamen) of 160 patients with Parkinson's disease, using a 3
      Tesla MRI, to evaluate the potential interest of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression.
      The variation of R2* (ΔR2*) will be correlated with clinical markers of disease progress,
      non-motor symptoms. 80 healthy controls subjects will also be included to assess the effect
      of aging on cerebral physiological iron levels.

      Type of study : Interventional multicenter prospective study of cohort follow-up.

      Number of centers : 6 (Clermont-Ferrand, Lyon, Grenoble, Paris, Limoges, Lille)

      Study population :

      Recruitment

      160 patients with Parkinson's disease divided into four subgroups of 40 patients according to
      disease duration:

        -  &lt; 5 years

        -  Between 5 and 10 years

        -  Between 10 and 15 years

        -  &gt; 15 years

      In parallel, 80 sex-age matched healthy controls subjects matched equally distributed in the
      4 groups (n = 20/group) based on a stratified plan by gender and age (ratio 1:2).

      Subjects will be assessed twice, one year apart by the procedures detailed below. The two
      neurological assessments should be made by the same certified neurologist.

      Patients' procedure:

      Visit 1 (Day 0) (duration: 1 day or 2 half days)

        -  Signature of an informed consent form (only at Day 0).

        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease duration, treatments).

        -  Neurological evaluation.

        -  Neuropsychological evaluation.

        -  Self-administered questionnaires.

        -  1st MRI acquisition.

      Visit 2 (Day 0 + 1 year) (duration: 1 day or 2 half days)

        -  Current treatment(s), adverse event(s), serious adverse event(s).

        -  Neurological evaluation.

        -  Neuropsychological evaluation.

        -  Self-administered questionnaires.

        -  2d MRI acquisition.

      Matched healthy controls subjects' procedure:

      Visit 1 (Day 0) (duration: 1 half day)

        -  Signature of an informed consent form (only at Day 0).

        -  Demographic and clinical characteristics (sex, age, disease duration, treatments).

        -  Brief neuropsychological evaluation.

        -  1st MRI acquisition.

      Visit 2 (Day 0 + 1 year) (duration: 1 half day)

        -  Current treatment(s), adverse event(s), serious adverse event(s).

        -  Brief neuropsychological evaluation.

        -  2d MRI acquisition.

      MRI acquisition (duration: 45 to 60 min)

      The procedure will be performed on a 3 Tesla MRI, allowing a substantial gain in
      signal-to-noise ratio compared with the one obtained at 1.5 Tesla.

      Different sequences will be planned:

        -  T2-weighted sequence * 3D GRE multi-echo. This sequence will generate a R2* maps of the
           whole brain.

        -  T1-weighted sequence in high resolution 3D. This sequence will allow the anatomical
           characterization of different brain structures and will help the normalization of T2* in
           pictures an anatomical reference space.

        -  T2* sequence 3D multiple gradient echo (Spoiled Gradient Recalled echo sequence). This
           sequence will measure the decay rate of NMR signal according to the echo time.

        -  2D spin echo sequence T1-weighted for neuromelanin. This sequence view the substantia
           nigra and locus coeruleus (optional sequence).

        -  Optional Diffusion-weighted sequence. This sequence determines the movements of water
           molecule in the brain and to infer the main lines of connections between neurons
           (optional sequence).

      The R2* (1/T2*) will be measured in three different regions of interest (substantia nigra,
      ventral tegmental area and the putamen) for the 2 MRI's in order to calculate ΔR2.
