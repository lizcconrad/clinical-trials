  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a very common reason for presentation to pediatric
      emergency departments. So as not to overlook the risk of complications, which occur at a rate
      of 0-7%, measures such as cranial computed tomography (CCT-scan) and/or short inpatient
      observation are prescribed. Ultimately, the majority of these measures could be avoided and a
      large Australian cohort shows that the risk of brain tumors is 2.44 times higher for children
      who had a CCT-scan (3.24 for age 1-4 years). Assay of a sensitive biomarker in blood, such as
      the S100B protein, has the potential to reduce the number of these unnecessary measures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on initial results from a previous prospective study, a multicenter interventional
      study will be necessary to validate the routine use of this biomarker .The ultimate goal is
      to include serum S100B assay in the current recommendations for m traumatic brain injury
      (mTBI) management based on the study of Kupperman et al. (2009), as mTBI accounts for 5-8% of
      pediatric emergency admissions in France (60-100 per 100,000 children). The study of
      Kuppermann et al. strongly dictated the recommendations for mTBI management by the French
      Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU) . Then, from these 2 publications, the French Society of
      Pediatrics (SFP) redacted their recommendations after adjustment method recommendations for
      clinical practice, used by the French High Authority of Health (HAS) .

      The use of serum S100B assay as part of the management of pediatric mTBI should make it
      possible to reduce the number of additional examinations, in particular a 30% reduction in
      the number of CCT-scans, with a resultant reduction in radiation exposure, known to be a risk
      factor for cancer. The study protocol corresponds to a diagnostic prospective, controlled,
      multicenter study using a randomized stepped wedge cluster design, in which pediatric
      patients (aged ≤ 16 years) presenting to the pediatric emergency room for mTBI with a GCS
      score of 15 will benefit from usual care (&quot;conventional management&quot; arm) in the control
      group, and from S100B management in the interventional group.
