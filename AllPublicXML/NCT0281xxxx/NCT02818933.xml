    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the quality of self-report data obtained using
      the Automated Self Administered 24-Hour Recall (ASA24-Kids-2014) relative to an interviewer
      administered 24-hour recall in a sample of adolescents ages 12-17 years, to determine their
      method preference, and to assess issues related to each method.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-reported dietary intake currently provides the best approach to quantify foods and
      nutrients for many nutrition research studies. The interviewer administered 24-hour diet
      recall is generally considered the best available method; however, it is limited by a high
      degree of participant burden and cost. A web-based, automated, self-administered 24-hour
      recall (ASA24-Kids-2014) was recently designed by researchers at the National Cancer
      Institute (NCI) to mimic the interviewer administered 24-hour recall approach to collecting
      high quality dietary intake data in children and adolescents while minimizing time and cost.
      Although the ASA24-Kids-2014 is a potentially useful and cost-effective tool for collecting
      dietary data for research studies in children and adolescents, it has not been validated for
      use in pediatric populations. A total of 30 adolescents will be recruited to achieve the
      study aims. For Aim 1, 10 participants will complete one diet recall using ASA24-Kids-2014
      and one interviewer administered 24-hour recall. Their feedback on both methods and
      preference will be assessed. For Aim 2, 20 participants will be randomly assigned to complete
      six (one per week) web-based or interviewer administered 24-hour recalls. Data from Aim 2
      will be analyzed to determine whether the reporting quality decays over time for each method.
      In addition, feedback from participants in both aims will be collected on specific factors
      related to the recall methods such as ease of use, technical challenges, flexibility,
      duration, and database completeness. Results obtained from this pilot study could provide
      critical information to design a larger method comparison study to rigorously assess the
      performance of the ASA24-Kids web-based diet recall.

    <description>This group follows a crossover design where adolescents 12-17 years old (n=10) complete a diet recall using one of the two methods (interviewer-administered vs web-based), and then does another diet recall using the other method about a week later. Participants are randomly assigned to the order in which they complete each method of diet recall.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adolescents at least 12 years old and no greater than 17 years old who have access to
             a phone and a desktop or laptop computer.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons having prior experience completing food recalls, either for a research study,
             or for personal use

          -  persons having prior experience with mobile food apps, either for research or for
             personal use

          -  persons following a special diet

          -  persons having a mental, physical, or visual limitation that would hinder their
             ability to use a computer or recall from memory

          -  Non-English speakers are excluded because using an interpreter could increase the
             length of time it takes to complete a dietary food recall thus, possibly skewing the
             data.

          -  those with self-reported body mass index (BMI) less than the 5th or greater than the
             85th percentile (as determined during telephone screen)
