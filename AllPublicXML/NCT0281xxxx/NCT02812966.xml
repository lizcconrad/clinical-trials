      Investigators hypothesize in patients presenting with significant peripheral arterial disease
      with clinical indications for treatment with angioplasty, there will be a difference in 12
      month patency between the subjects with Lutonix 035 Drug coated Balloon PTA Catheter and

      Investigators hypothesize in patients presenting with significant peripheral arterial disease
      with clinical indications for treatment with angioplasty, there will be a difference in the
      12 month patency (defined as PSVR &lt;=2.4 at 12month follow-up visit with no TLR or target
      lesion bypass) between the subjects with Lutonix 035 Drug coated Balloon PTA Catheter and
      IN.PACT Admiral Paclitaxel-Coated PTA Balloon Catheter. Investigators will also assess and
      compare target lesion revascularization rates, safety profiles, adverse events, healthcare
      costs, and healthcare utilization.

          3. Age greater &gt;=18 years of age

          4. Patients with moderate to severe claudication or ischemic rest pain as defined by
             Rutherford 2-4 class symptoms

          5. &gt;=1 tibial run-off vessel at baseline

          6. Angiographic criteria

               -  &gt;=70% stenosis (via visual angiographic estimate in the superficial femoral
                  artery and/or popliteal arteries as appropriate)

               -  4-7mm vessel diameter

               -  &lt;=15cm for planned treatment segment length.

               -  Planned treatment segments are to no further proximal than 1 cm from the
                  bifurcation of the common femoral artery and no further distal than the 1 cm
                  above the tibioperoneal trunk.

               -  Lesions treated within the target vessel are either De Novo lesions or not
                  previously stented restenotic segments of the superficial femoral artery and/or
                  popliteal artery that are greater than 90 days from prior angioplasty procedure

               -  If the target vessel was previously stented the treated lesion must be at least 3
                  cm from the previously placed stent

               -  Lesion must be able to be treated with either drug coated balloon device based on
