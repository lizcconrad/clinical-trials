  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carbohydrate ingestion, in particular fructose, has been shown in a handful of previous
      studies to elicit a thermic effect and increase core body temperature after ingestion.
      Carbohydrate foods and supplements are commonly consumed prior to endurance running
      competition, including situations where an athlete's ability to dissipate body heat is
      compromised. Thus, there is some potential for pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion to have a
      deleterious effect on body heat regulation in hot and humid environments. Thus, this projects
      aims to study the effects of pre-exercise carbohydrate ingestion on core body temperature,
      perceived thermal stress, and perceived exertion during high-intensity running.

    <description>Core body temperature will be measured with a ingestible pill thermometer. Readings will be taken during a 60 minute rest period and at 1-km intervals during a 5-km run.</description>

    <measure>Thermal Sensation Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>80 minutes (60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 min pre-run and at 1-km intervals during a 20 min 5-km run)</time_frame>
    <description>The Thermal Sensation Scale is a 0-8 numerical rating scale with descriptors of &quot;unbearably cold&quot; at 0, &quot;neutral&quot; at 4, and &quot;unbearably hot&quot; at 8. These ratings will be collected during a 60 minute rest period and at 1-km intervals during a 5-km run.</description>

    <time_frame>80 minutes (60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 min pre-run and at 1-km intervals during a 20 min 5-km run)</time_frame>
    <description>The Feeling Scale is a bipolar numerical rating scale ranging from -5 to +5, with descriptors of &quot;very bad&quot; at -5, &quot;neutral&quot; at 0, and &quot;very good&quot; at +5. These ratings will be collected during a 60 minute rest period and at 1-km intervals during a 5-km run.</description>
