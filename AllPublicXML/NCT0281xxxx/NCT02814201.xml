  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Action slowing has been demonstrated in many diseases. Parkinson's disease (PD) and
      Huntington's disease (HD) are two neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia,
      particularly the medial globus pallidus, and the clinical expression of these two diseases is
      characterized by a combination of motor and cognitive disorders, but with two opposing
      patterns of dysfunction. Action slowing has been demonstrated in both of these diseases and
      has been extensively studied in Parkinson's disease, suggesting a perceptive-cognitive
      origin. Far fewer studies have been conducted in Huntington's disease. However, all of these
      studies were performed with different methodologies in small cohorts and the value of the
      proposed study is to use a validated and standardized computerized mental chronometry
      paradigm, providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of action slowing in these two
      diseases and to more clearly define a disease-specific profile.
