      Introduction: Ketamine has been well studied for its efficacy as an analgesic agent. However,
      intranasal (IN) administration of ketamine has only recently been studied in the emergency
      setting.

      Objective: To elucidate the efficacy and adverse effects of a sub-dissociative dose of IN
      Ketamine compared to IV and IM morphine.

      Methods: A single-center, randomized, prospective, parallel clinical trial of efficacy and
      safety of IN ketamine compared to IV and IM morphine for analgesia in the emergency
      department (ED). A convenience sample of 90 patients aged 18-70 experiencing moderate-severe
      acute traumatic pain (≥80mm on 100mm Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) were randomized to receive
      either 1.0mg/kg IN ketamine, 0.1mg/kg IV MO or 0.15mg/kg IM MO. Pain relief and adverse
      effects were recorded for 1 hour post-administration.

      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcome was efficacy of IN ketamine compared to IV and IM MO,
      measured by &quot;time-to-onset&quot; (defined as a ≥15mm pain decrease on VAS), as well as time to and
      degree of maximal pain reduction.

    <measure>Effectiveness of intranasal ketamine in decreasing pain intensity [patient assessed - VAS pain score]</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour post administration</time_frame>
    <description>Time to achieve a clinically meaningful pain reduction was defined as the first time-point at which the patient reported 15mm of pain reduction or more. Maximal pain reduction was defined as the lowest VAS score reported by the patient over the course of follow-up. Time to maximal pain reduction was defined as the time at which the patient has the lowest VAS score over the course of the hour follow-up.</description>

    <description>Adverse effects were recorded at the end of one hour using the 'Opiate Related Symptom Distress Scale' and included measurements of the presence, frequency, intensity and disruptiveness of 12 common opiate side-effects. Among these were nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, constipation, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, confusion, and others.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients aged 18-70 years, with mild to moderate blunt trauma (sustained in road, workplace
        and home accidents) causing moderate to severe pain (≥ 80mm score on a 100mm Visual Analog
        Scale=VAS) were eligible for participation in the study. Inclusion criteria also included a
        Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) of 15, body weight of 50-110 kg, systolic blood pressure of 90-160
        mmHg, heart rate &lt;100 bpm. Patients were also required to have an American Society of
        Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 1 or 2, deny head injury, and deny regular use or use of
        opiates.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any analgesia received within the prior 3 hours, allergic sensitivity to morphine or
        ketamine, a large meal ingested within the previous hour, pregnancy, deviated nasal septum
        or trauma to the nose, and a history of a psychiatric condition. Despite evidence that
        ketamine does not exacerbate intracranial hemorrhage in patients with head trauma, patients
        with head injury complaining of loss of consciousness, dizziness, vomiting, or nausea were
        excluded as well.
