      Background:

      LMB-100 is a man-made protein designed to kill cancer cells. LMB-100 targets a cancer marker
      called mesothelin. Mesothelin is found on the surface of many different tumors, including
      pancreatic cancer, but is made by a very small number of normal tissues. Other cancers that
      make mesothelin include mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma, thymic carcinoma, ovarian, lung,
      gastric, endometrial, cervical, and ampullary cancers. After binding to the mesothelin on
      tumors, LMB-100 can attack and kill cancer cells. Researchers want to see how well it works
      when given with and without nab-paclitaxel, a drug which treats pancreatic cancer.

      Objectives:

      Arm A- To find a safe dose of LMB-100 with a fixed standard dose of nab-paclitaxel in people
      with advanced pancreatic cancer. To see how well the combination of the two drugs reduce
      tumor size.

      Arm B- To find a safe dose of LMB-100 when it is given as a continuous infusion over several
      days.

      Eligibility:

      Arm A- Adults age 18 and older with advanced pancreatic cancer that has worsened after
      anti-cancer therapy.

      Arm B- Adults age 18 and older with advanced pancreatic cancer, mesothelioma or other solid
      tumor that makes mesothelin that has worsened after anti-cancer therapy

      Design:

      Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will give blood,
      urine, and tissue samples. They will have scans and x-rays.

      During each 21-day cycle:

        -  For Arm A

             -  Participants will get LMB-100 by an IV catheter on days 1, 3, and 5. This is a tube
                inserted in a vein, usually in the arm.

             -  Participants will get nab-paclitaxel by IV on days 1 and 8.

        -  For Arm B

             -  Participants will get LMB-100 by an IV catheter as a continuous infusion beginning
                on day 1 and continuing for 2-4 days

             -  Some participants will also get nab-paclitaxel by IV on days 1 and 8.

      All participants will get this combination for up to 2 cycles or until their disease worsens
      or they have intolerable side effects.

      Participants will have blood and urine tests and scans throughout the study.

      Participants will have a safety follow-up visit 3-6 weeks after treatment ends. If their
      disease remains stable or improves, they will be scanned every 6 weeks until their disease
      gets worse. Even if their disease gets worse, they or their doctor will be called to talk
      about their cancer status.

      Background:

        -  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States,
           claiming more than 40,000 lives each year.

        -  Incidence nearly equals mortality with just 6% of participants living five years beyond
           their diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, but even patients
           with early stage disease have a long term survival of less than 20%.

        -  Mesothelin is specifically a marker of adenocarcinoma in the human disease and is not
           expressed in preceding pre-malignant stages of tumor development

        -  Expression of mesothelin in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been examined in
           several published studies and ranges from 86 to 100%

        -  Recombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are antibody-based therapeutics that carry a toxin
           payload. RITs that target mesothelin contain a genetically engineered variant of
           Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) in which the native cell-binding domain of PE is replaced by
           the mesothelin-binding antibody fragment. SS1P was the first mesothelin-targeted RIT
           tested in patients.

        -  LMB-100 contains a newly engineered PE fragment that has improved activity against most
           pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro, and is also much less toxic than SS1P in
           preclinical models. The new PE contains modifications specifically designed to reduce
           immunogenicity of the molecule.

        -  Pre-administration of paclitaxel with SS1P was demonstrated to increase the amount of
           immunotoxin internalized by tumor cells and to reduce levels of shed mesothelin in the
           intra-tumoral environment so that more immunotoxin could bind tumor cells. The effect is
           even more pronounced with NAB-paclitaxel in a pancreatic cancer model.

        -  Initial clinical testing of LMB-100 was performed by Roche in a multi-center
           international first in human trial (NCT02317419). The agent was well tolerated and
           appeared to have decreased immunogenicity compared to SS1P based on preliminary results.

        -  In initial and subsequent clinical testing, LMB-100 was found to have half-life of
           approximately 60 mins. This is shorter then that measured for previous RITs used in the
           clinical setting.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  Arm A1 (Phase I, short infusion):

           --To determine the maximum tolerated dose of short infusion LMB-100 in combination
           nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer

        -  Arm B1(Continous infusion single agent lead-in):

           --To determine the maximum tolerated dose of LMB-100 given in a continuous infusion
           format over 24 - 96 hours to patients with advanced solid tumors that express mesothelin

        -  Arm B2 (Continous infusion combination therapy)

           --Establish a tolerated dose of LMB-100 given by continuous infusion in combination with
           nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in participants with advanced pancreatic cancer

        -  Arm A2(Phase II, short infusion):

             -  To determine the objective response rate (PR+CR) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria
                of short infusion LMB-100 in combination with nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy in
                participants with advanced pancreatic cancer

      Eligibility:

        -  Age greater than or equal to18 years

        -  Histologically confirmed recurrent, metastatic and/or advanced pancreatic ductal
           adenocarcinoma (Except for Arm B1 [B Single Agent Lead-in])

        -  For Arm B1 (Single Agent Lead-in), ONLY: Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy
           for which no curative therapy exists with at least 25% of tumor cells expressing
           mesothelin as determined by NCI Laboratory of Pathology. Determination can be made

      using archival tumor tissue or fresh biopsy.

        -  Treatment must include at least one prior chemotherapy regimen

        -  No nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel treatment in the last four months (Except for Arm B1
           [Single Agent Lead-in])

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  Participants with HIV, active HBV or HCV infections are eligible only for the Arm B1
           (Single Agent Lead-in)

      Design:

        -  This study is a Phase I/II open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of LMB-100
           in combination with the standard of care agent nab-paclitaxel in participants metastatic
           and/or locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

        -  Subjects will be treated for up to 2 cycles

        -  In Arm A1 (Phase I, short infusion) of the study, up to 3 dose levels will be evaluated.
           LMB-100 will be administered on days 1, 3 and 5 of a 21 day cycle and nab-paclitaxel
           will be administered on days 1 and 8

        -  Arm A2 (Phase II, short infusion), up to 20 evaluable participants (including those
           treated at the short infusion MTD in the phase I study) will be enrolled.

        -  Arm B1 (Continous infusion single Agent Lead-in), escalating doses of single agent
           LMB-100 will be administered. The study drug will be given as a continuous infusion for
           the 1, 2, 3, or 4 days of a 21-day cycle.

        -  Arm B2 (Continous infusion, combination therapy) will be initiated after completion of
           both Arm A1 and Arm B1 Single Agent Lead-in. It will test a single dose level of LMB-100
           based on data from the Lead-in given in combination with nab-paclitaxel. LMB-100 will be
           given as a continuous infusion for the 1, 2, 3 or 4 days of a 21-day cycle.
           Nabpaclitaxel will be given on Day 1 and Day 8.

        -  The Arm A2 (Phase II, short infusion) portion of the study will be conducted in a Simon
           Minimax two stage phase II design. The first stage will enroll 13 evaluable
           participants, including the six participants treated at the short infusion MTD from
           phase I. If 1 or more has a response, then accrual would continue until a total of 20
           evaluable participants have been enrolled.

               -  Live attenuated vaccinations within 14 days prior to treatment

               -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent

               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of LMB-100 on the
                  developing fetus are unknown and may have the potential to cause teratogenic or
                  abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
                  events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with LMB-100,
                  breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with LMB-100. These
                  potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.

               -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the components of LMB-100

               -  Baseline QTcF interval of &gt; 470 ms, participants with baseline resting
                  bradycardia &lt; 45 beats per minute, or baseline resting tachycardia&gt; 100 beats per
                  minute.

          -  Exclusion criteria specific to patients who will be receiving nab-paclitaxel (all arms
             except Arm B1 Single Agent Lead-in)

               -  Participants with contra-indication and/or history of severe hypersensitivity
                  reactions to nab-paclitaxel

               -  Participants with baseline peripheral neuropathy greater than grade 2

               -  HIV or active HBV or HCV infection due to risk of progression while receiving
                  immunosuppressive chemotherapy
