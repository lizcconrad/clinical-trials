      The breast MRI is used in the preoperative scenario to evaluate the extension of a newly
      diagnosed breast cancer and to screen the contralateral breast. The scan consists of a series
      of images taken after the use of intravascular contrast media that may detect areas of
      enhancement that look malignant, but are actually benign tissue, producing a false positive
      result. The investigators aim to evaluate a novel MRI sequence of images that does not use
      contrast, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Addition of DTI sequence does not add significantly
      to the time of standard breast MRI exam. This novel technique provides improved detection of
      tissue microstructure and is able to differentiate malignant from benign tumor. Hence, the
      investigators hypothesize that DTI may decrease the false positive rate when compared with
      standard dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.
