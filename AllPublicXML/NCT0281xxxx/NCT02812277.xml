      This is a single centre, observational and retrospective clinical study. The study group was
      about all HR positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients who were hospitalized between
      January, 2008 and October, 2010, and ever accepted AI therapy with the completed follow-up
      data.

      The department of surgery at Tian Jin Medical University Cancer Hospital, one of the centers
      of excellence to treat patients with breast cancer in China, collects and maintains an
      electronic database of patients treatment details and follow up data. This is a single
      centre, observational and retrospective clinical study. The study group was about all HR
      positive postmenopausal breast cancer patients who were hospitalized between January, 2008
      and October, 2010, and ever accepted AI therapy with the completed follow-up data.All the
      enrolled patients received breast-conserving surgery or whole breast surgery, and afterwards,
      received adjuvant chemotherapy according the pathological types. The patient's clinical
      pathological data include the age, family history, surgery options, pathologic type, the size
      of tumor, lymph node status, histological grade, chemotherapy regime, irradiation regime, and
      the expressions pattern of Her-2 and Ki-67. The research starts when the patients received
      the first time AI treatment. In the subsequent treatment, we analyzed the patients' bone
      density changes (T value &gt;-1 indicates normal,-2.5≤T value≤-1 indicates mild osteoporosis, T
      value &lt;-2.5 indicates severe osteoporosis) each half year for 3 years, analyzed the patients'
      liver function and kidney function changes each half year for 3 years (AST, ALT, ALP, TBIL,
      DBIL,UREA and CREA values &gt; 2 times ULN indicates abnormal), analyzed the patients'
      blood-lipoids (LDL, HDL, TG and TC) each half year for 3 years, the occurrence rates of
      adverse reactions (skin flush, joint pain, headache, rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, et
      al), the causes and rates of treatment termination between the 2 groups, the 3 years DFS and
      OS between two groups, and the factors associated with survival and prognosis, and identified
      the benefit individuals of AI therapy.
