  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioural disorders are very common right from the initial stage of dementia and contribute
      to loss of autonomy. Behavioural dysexecutive disorders have a particular status due to their
      prevalence and their diagnostic importance, as they often constitute the initial symptoms of
      Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), Semantic Dementia (SD) and Huntington's disease (HD) and they
      are classically more frequent in vascular dementia (VaD) than in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
      The presence of these disorders at the stage of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has only been
      partially evaluated and would increase the risk of progression to dementia. These classical
      data are based on non-standardized assessments and non-validated diagnostic criteria. The
      Groupe de Reflexion pour l'Evaluation des Fonctions EXécutives (GREFEX) has developed a
      standardized assessment tool for behavioural dysexecutive disorders, the Behavioural
      Dysexecutive Syndrome Inventory (BDSI) and has validated diagnostic criteria for this
      syndrome.
