      This study is being carried out to see if the drugs MEDI4736, Savolitinib and Tremelimumab
      can be used alone or in combination to reduce the size of tumours in patients with kidney
      cancer.

      The drugs being tested in this study have an anti-tumour effect and have been tested in
      pre-clinical and human studies before. MEDI4736 and tremelimumab work with the immune system
      to help the body fight against tumour cells with immune cells. Savolitinib works to correct a
      faulty signal which causes tumour growth.

      If a patient is eligible for the study and decides to take part, they will be enrolled into
      one of 3 stages of the study.

        -  First stage [CLOSED TO RECRUITMENT]: aims to find the optimal dose of
           MEDI4736+savolitinib.

        -  Second stage [RECRUITING]: patients with papillary cell cancer will be treated with
           MEDI4736+savolitinib. Patients with clear cell cancer will be randomised to one of four
           treatment arms and receive MEDI4736, savolitinib, MEDI4736+savolitinib, or
           MEDI4736+tremelimumab.

        -  Third stage [NOT YET OPEN TO RECRUITMENT]: patients will be tested for biomarkers before
           enrolment, and depending on the results will be allocated to one of 3 treatments
           (MEDI4736, savolitinib, or MEDI4736+tremelimumab) to see if certain biomarkers are
           linked to drug efficacy.
