      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of various anatomic
      measurements alone or in combination in predicting difficult intubation. The investigators
      hypothesized that goniomastoid distance, thyrogonial distance and tongue movements are
      sensitive and specific tests for predicting difficult intubation MATERIALS AND METHODS: The
      investigators included the data of 170 patients (85 difficult intubation and 85 easy
      intubation) who underwent an abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Patients in
      difficult intubation (n=85) and easy intubation (n=85) groups were matched by age, BMI, and
      gender. Intubation difficulty scale (IDS) scores were recorded. Upward and downward maximal
      protrusions of tongue (UMPT and DMPT, respectively) were evaluated in all patients.
      Anthropometric measurements were measured.

      To define the tongue protrusion tests, anatomic landmarks and horizontal lines were used. The
      first horizontal line (lower target line) was passing through the midpoint of the distance
      between stomion to mentum (mandible height) and the second horizontal line (upper target
      line) was passing through the midpoint of the distance from subnasal to stomion (upper lip
      height). The horizontal lines were drawn with an erasable marker pen on the each patient's
      face. In the sitting position, patients were asked to make maximal tongue protrusion upward
      (UMPT) and downward (DMPT) in anatomical neutral position. The inability of the tip of the
      tongue to reach to the target line was scored &quot;1&quot; and ability of the tongue tip to reach or
      pass the target line was scored &quot;2
