  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      (1)The efficacy of the regimen is evaluated by objective remission rate, disease control
      rate, progress free survival, duration of remission, overall survival, time to progression.

      Safety is monitored by vital signs, blood routine test, liver function, kidney function and
      electrolytes level, ECG, and cardiac ultrasonography.

      All the data is documented by CRF form, and carefully preserved.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung carcinoma with EGFR 19/21 point mutation, verified
             by histology or cytology.

          2. Achieved remission (CR or PR) over previous EGFR-TKI treatment; or achieved stable
             disease (SD) ≥ 6 months over previous EGFR-TKI treatment; disease progression emerged
             during the following EGFR-TKI treatment (within the past 30 days); no other treatment
             employed after the withdrawn of EGFR-TKI.

          3. Age ≥18 years, male or female;

          4. Has at least 1 measurable focus according to RECIST criteria 1.1, which has not been
             treated by radiotherapy.

          5. General condition should be ECOG 0-2, expected survival ≥ 3 months.

          6. Organ functions should fit the following:

             Bone marrow: absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 109/L, platelet ≥100 × 109/L, Hb ≥
             90g/L; Liver: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times of the normal maximum, ALT and AST≤ 2.5
             times of the normal maximum. (ALT/AST≤ 5 times of the normal maximum for patients with
             infiltrative liver disease) Coagulation: INR or PT ˂ 1.5 folds of the normal maximum;
             Serum creatinine ˂ 1.5 folds of the normal maximum; creatinine clearance rate
             ≥50ml/min (calculated by Cockroft-Gault10 formula), for underweight patients, or whose
             results differ largely from the two formula, other methods for creatinine clearance
             rate calculation should be employed, like the EDTA method, inulin clearance method or
             24 hour urine analysis.

          7. For patients with metastatic brain disease, their symptoms should be well controlled
             by regional therapy (surgery or radiotherapy), and no need for hormone maintenance
             therapy.

          8. For fertile women, urine or blood pregnancy test should be negative within 7 days
             prior to the treatment, all patients (male and female) should have contraceptive
             measures during the whole treatment period and 4 weeks after the treatment; willing to
             sign the written consent and be enrolled in the trial, and adhere to the treatment and
             follow up protocol.

          5. Patients' organ conditions:

             Metastatic brain/ meningeal disorders (except for those whose symptoms are well
             controlled by regional therapy, and no need for hormone maintenance therapy).

             Patients with history of mesenchymal lung disease, drug-induced mesenchymal disease,
             hormone-required radiation pneumonia, idiopathic lung fibrosis in baseline CT scan,
             uncontrolled massive pleural effusion or pericardial effusion.

             Patients with evidence of severe or uncontrolled systemic disease (like unstable or
             non-compensated respiratory/cardiac/hepatic/renal disease), according to the judgment
             of the researchers.

             Any unstable systemic disease (including ˃ CTCAE 2 active clinical infection, level IV
             hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, congestive heart failure, QT interval ˃450ms,
             HIV infection, metabolic liver or kidney disease); History of any malignant tumor
             within 5 years prior to the trial. Definitive history of neural or mental disorders,
             including seizure or dementia.

             Patients with xenogenic organ transplantation, patients had severe injury or massive
             surgery 4 weeks prior to the 1st dosage admission of medicine in the trial.

          6. Women during pregnancy or lactation.

          7. Allergic constitution, like those who are allergic to ≥2 foods or drugs, or allergic
             to the components of the medicine used in the trial;

          8. Any condition that impairs the patients' ability to swallow, and any condition that
             impairs drug absorption or drug kinetic parameters, including any kind of
             gastrointestinal resection or surgery;

          9. Patients with drug abuse, or any medical, psychological, social conditions that may
             impair trial process or the evaluation of the results of the trial;
