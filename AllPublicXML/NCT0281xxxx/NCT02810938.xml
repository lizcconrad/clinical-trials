      The MIFI Flutter Registry is a non-interventional, multi-centre, prospective registry in
      consecutive patients with atrial flutter and indication for right atrial isthmus ablation.
      The registry is an observational study and patient's participation in this study has no
      impact on his/her indication for treatment, diagnostics or therapy. Patients are supposed to
      be treated according to current guidelines and the site's internal directives.

      Treatment pattern and treatment initiation, continuation or changes are solely at the
      discre-tion of the physician and the patient. There will be no attempt to influence the
      treatment patterns of any individual treating physician. All drug prescriptions will be in
      the usual standard of care. Participation in the registry will in no way influence payment or
      reimbursement for any treatment received by subjects during the study.

      A minimum of 10 hospitals in Germany treating atrial flutter and using the Maximum
      voltage-guided (MVG) ablation technique are eligible for participation. The enrolment period
      is estimated to be 6 months.

      Eligible are all patients with atrial flutter, who will visit consecutively a participating
      site of the MIFI Flutter Registry. It is planned to enrol approximately 120 patients in
      total.

      The follow-ups of patients will be performed using a standardized patient interview
      (telephone call) at 6 months by Institut f√ºr Herzinfarktforschung (IHF). In case of relevant
      complications, the treating physician is asked to provide medical records for verification.
      If the patient is not accessible by phone, local registration offices will be contacted for
      further information.
