  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) is a cerebrovascular disease with high incidence and morbidity
      in the Brazilian population, and is considered a major cause of disability in adults. Brain
      damage caused by stroke generates a maladaptive pattern of neural activity and modulation
      between the cerebral hemispheres, unbalancing in the inter-hemispheric inhibition. This
      condition affects patient's functional recovery.

      The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of repetitive transcranial magnetic
      stimulation Association (rTMS) in the cortex motor contralesional, Transcranial Direct
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) in the motor cortex ipsilesional and the association between these
      two types of brain stimulations on the upper limb recovery after stroke.
