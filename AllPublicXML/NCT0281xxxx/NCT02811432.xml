  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is uncertainty in the effect of KMC in unstable babies and there is a lack of evidence
      to guide how stable an infant must be to gain a mortality benefit from KMC. There is
      therefore, a need for a well-designed RCT that initiates KMC within 48 hours after birth to
      examine the effect on mortality versus conventional incubator care in infants weighing ≤2000g
      who are considered by the responsible clinician to be unstable. We propose such a parallel
      group RCT to be conducted at Jinja Hospital, a resource-limited regional referral facility in
      eastern Uganda.
