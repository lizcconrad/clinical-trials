  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition is a major health problem with serious consequences for the quality of life of
      elderly people: it increases the number of hospitalizations and lengths of stay, worsens
      functional dependency and increases morbidity and mortality rates There are numerous
      recommendations and tools to detect or to manage malnutrition and the prescription of Oral
      Nutritional Supplements (ONS) can be a solution. As the elderly suffer from food monotony, as
      well as age-related changes, which may or may not be associated with the presence of disease,
      it is necessary to ensure full ingestion of the prescribed supplements to optimize the
      benefits provided by these products. To achieve this it is necessary to know the chemosensory
      characteristics of foods enjoyed by hospitalized elderly people who are malnourished or at
      risk of malnutrition. The investigators make the hypothesis that by further optimizing taste
      and energy content of foods, consumption by the elderly and the health benefits would be
      improved.

A first half of volunteers will start the testing process with the beverages at day 1 and continue with the creams at day 2.
