      The objective of this study is to determine the effect on glycemic responses of adding
      various doses of OatWell28XF to Quaker Instant Oatmeal in order to: 1) describe the
      dose-response curve and 2) If possible, identify the minimum level of OatWell28XF which, when
      added to a serving of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, would result in a glycemic response at least
      20% less than that elicited by a β-glucan-free cereal.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or non-pregnant females, 18-75 years of age, inclusive

          -  Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 20.0 and &lt; 35 kg/m² at screening (visit 1).

          -  Willing to maintain habitual diet, physical activity pattern, and body weight
             throughout the trial and to refrain from smoking for 12hr prior to each visit.

          -  Willing to maintain current dietary supplement use throughout the trial. On test days,
             subject agrees not to take any dietary supplements until dismissal from the GI labs.
             Failure to comply will result in a rescheduled test visit.

          -  Normal fasting serum glucose (&lt;7.0mmol/L capillary corresponding to whole blood
             glucose &lt;6.3mmol/L).

          -  Willing to abstain from alcohol consumption and avoid vigorous physical activity for
             24 h prior to all test visits.

          -  Absence of health conditions that would prevent fulfillment of study requirements as
             judged by the Investigator on the basis of medical history.

          -  Understanding the study procedures and willing to provide informed consent to
             participate in the study and authorization to release relevant protected health
             information to the study investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet any one of the inclusion criteria

          -  Known history of AIDS, hepatitis, a history or presence of clinically important
             endocrine (including Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus), cardiovascular (including,
             but not limited to, atherosclerotic disease, history of myocardial infarction,
             peripheral arterial disease, stroke), pulmonary, biliary or GI disorders.

          -  Use of medications known to influence carbohydrate metabolism, including, but not
             limited to adrenergic blockers, diuretics, thiazolidinediones, metformin and systemic
             corticosteroids within 4 weeks of the screening visit, or with any condition which
             might, in the opinion of Dr. Wolever, the president of GI Testing, either: 1) make
             participation dangerous to the subject or to others, or 2) affect the results.

          -  Major trauma or surgical event within 3 months of screening.

          -  Unwillingness or inability to comply with the experimental procedures and to follow GI
             Labs safety guidelines.

          -  Known intolerance, sensitivity or allergy to any ingredients in the study products.

          -  Extreme dietary habits, as judged by the Investigator (i.e. Atkins diet, very high
             protein diets, etc).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mm Hg or diastolic blood
             pressure ≥100 mm Hg as defined by the average blood pressure measured at screening.

          -  Change in body weight of &gt;3.5kg within 4 weeks of the screening visit.

          -  Presence of any signs or symptoms of an active infection within 5 d prior to any test
             visit. If an infection occurs during the study period, test visits should be
             rescheduled until all signs and symptoms have resolved and any treatment (i.e.
             antibiotic therapy) has been completed at least 5 d prior to each test visit.

          -  History of cancer in the prior two years, except for non-melanoma skin cancer.

          -  Recent history (within 12 months of screening) or strong potential for alcohol or
             substance abuse. Alcohol abuse is defined as &gt; 14 drinks per week (1 drink=12 oz beer,
             5 oz wine, or 1.5 oz distilled spirits).

          -  Exposure to any non-registered drug product within 30 d prior to screening.
