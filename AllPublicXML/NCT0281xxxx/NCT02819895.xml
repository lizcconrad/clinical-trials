      The purpose of this study is to determine if in a rural setting of Ondo State, Nigeria, a
      customized automated telephone and email immunization reminder system will be feasible,
      acceptable, and significantly improve immunization utilization rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Worldwide, vaccine preventable diseases account for 29% of all deaths between 1
      month and 5 years, underscoring the importance of immunizations. In Nigeria, routine
      childhood immunization rates are unacceptably inconsistent and low, ranging from 35-85% at 14
      weeks and 10-37% for all routine immunizations at 12-24 months.

      GAP: The feasibility, acceptability and utility of an automated phone immunization reminder
      system have never been explored in this rural setting of Nigeria.

      HYPOTHESIS: Given ~90% of the adult population in Nigeria uses a mobile phone, a customized
      mHealth immunization reminder system will be feasible and acceptable; and will significantly
      improve immunization rates in this rural setting of Ondo State, Nigeria.

      METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial study design will be utilized. This study
      will recruit parents of healthy newborn infants delivered at Mother and Child Hospital Ondo,
      who live in Akure or Ondo Town and plan to receive their immunizations at Mother and Child
      Hospital Ondo.

      DATA ANALYSIS: The proportion of immunization visits between intervention and control groups
      will be compared using a two-sided, two sample test of proportions with p &lt;0.05 being
      significant. Secondary analysis will focus on the predictive value of social demographic
      variables on immunization rates.
