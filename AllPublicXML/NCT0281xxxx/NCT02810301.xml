    <textblock>
      Study to demonstrate the efficacy of Probiotic ES1 in alleviating symptoms of gluten
      sensitivity in non-celiac gluten sensitive subjects exposed to a small, fixed amount of
      gluten.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Sixty non-celiac gluten
      sensitive subjects will be randomized into one of two groups; Probiotic ES1 or placebo. For
      the duration of the study, subjects must adhere to a gluten-free diet, apart from a scheduled
      fixed gluten exposure of two slices of bread once daily. Subjects will be required to take 1
      capsule before and after consuming the two slices of bread and score the severity of their
      symptoms in a diary provided for the duration of the study (7 days).

    <description>B. longum ES1 is formulated for oral use as Glutagest. Each capsule contains 1 billion CFU of B. longum. The capsules are off-white in color and cylindrical in shape with approximate dimensions of 19 mm x 6.63 mm and a weight of 500 mg. Non-medicinal ingredients consist of the common excipients filler rice maltodextrin, lubricant stearic acid, and encapsulating agent vegetable cellulose.</description>

    <description>The placebo is composed of the same non-medicinal ingredients as the investigational product (IP) (i.e. rice maltodextrin, stearic acid, and vegetable cellulose) but it does not contain the active ingredient B. longum ES1. The placebo is designed to resemble the IP in terms of physical appearance.</description>
