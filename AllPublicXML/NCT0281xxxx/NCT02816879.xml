    <textblock>
      This clinical trial compares three anal cytology collection procedures (collected at a single
      visit) in men who have sex with men (MSM). It also compares two different tests for human
      papilloma virus, the virus that causes high grade anal dysplasia, which is thought to occur
      before anal cancer. This study may help doctors develop better screening for high-grade anal
      dysplasia in MSM in order to identify those who need to return for additional screening and
      treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the sensitivity &amp; specificity, predictive positive value (PPV), &amp; predictive
      negative value (PNV) (test characteristics) &amp; cellularity, beta-globin, deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA), &amp; protein (quality measures) from nylon-flocked (NF)- &amp;
      Dacron-swab protocols to detect biopsy-detected high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia
      (HG-AIN) &amp; human papillomavirus (HPV)-infections, using randomized-controlled study design.

      II. Evaluate the test characteristics for anal cancer screening algorithms that incorporate
      sequentially or simultaneously performed high-threshold molecular HPV tests, with &amp; without
      cytology, to predict HG-AIN.

      III. Evaluate the cost-effectiveness &amp; relative cost of single- &amp; multiple-test anal cancer
      screening algorithms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo anal cytology collection using 2 NF swabs and 1 Dacron swab for analysis via
      Papanicolaou (Pap) staining, HPV genotyping, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

    <description>Two contingency tables will contrast HPV infection characteristics for APTIMA-HPV &amp; HC-2 compared to PCR based genotyping using Linear Array assay. Kappa statistics will be estimated to evaluate the observed versus expected agreement between the Linear Array assay (gold standard) &amp; the findings for APTIMA-HPV &amp; HC-2, separately. Prevalence estimates for 37 individual HPVs will be estimated from the data; also, for each type, agreement between the NF- &amp; Dacron protocols for HPV genotypes will be summarized in tabular &amp; graphical form.</description>

    <measure>Cost effectiveness analysis evaluating differences in survival, the cost of out-patient procedures &amp; in-patient hospitalizations for invasive anal cancer.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The cost-effectiveness analyses calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing two intervention groups/strategies to the current standard of care, Dacron cytology alone. The ICER is the ratio of the difference in the total costs per patient between groups (numerator) versus the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) between groups (denominator). Specifically, for these analyses, ICERs are separately estimated for best single &amp; best combination screening algorithm relative to usual care (Dacron-cytology). The analysis focuses on life-time costs.</description>
