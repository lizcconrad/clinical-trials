      This is a four year project evaluating the effectiveness of a group-based lifestyle
      intervention (PeerFIT) supported by mobile health (mHealth) technology and social media
      compared to Basic Education in fitness and nutrition supported by a wearable Activity
      Tracking device (BEAT) in achieving clinically significant improvements in weight loss and
      cardiorespiratory fitness in young adults with serious mental illness (SMI).

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a group-based lifestyle
      intervention (PeerFIT) supported by mobile health (mHealth) technology and social media to
      promote weight loss and improved fitness in young adults with serious mental illness (SMI).
      The study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted in real world mental health
      settings to evaluate the effectiveness of the 12-month PeerFIT intervention compared to Basic
      Education in fitness and nutrition supported by a wearable Activity Tracking device (BEAT) in
      achieving clinically significant improvements in weight loss and cardiorespiratory fitness.
      The investigators will enroll 144 overweight and obese (BMI ≥ 25) young adults ages 18 to 35
      with SMI attending one of two community mental health who are interested in losing weight and
      improving fitness. The investigators hypothesize that PeerFIT compared to BEAT will be
      associated with a greater proportion of participants who achieve cardiovascular risk
      reduction at 6 and 12 months follow-up as indicated by either clinically significant weight
      loss (5% or greater) or increased fitness (&gt;50 m on the six-minute walk test). The
      investigators also hypothesize that PeerFIT compared to BEAT will be associated with greater
      improvements in A1c and lipid profiles at 6 and 12 months follow-up. They will also
      investigate two theoretical mechanisms of action hypothesized to account for greater weight
      loss and increased cardiorespiratory fitness among participants assigned to PeerFIT: 1)
      improved self-efficacy and 2) increased peer support for health behavior change. The
      investigators hypothesize that the relationship between PeerFIT and weight loss and improved
      fitness will be mediated by improved self-efficacy and peer support for health behavior
      change.

    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' weight will be measured in pounds (lbs.) on a flat, even surface with the use of a high-quality, calibrated professional medical scale, with the participant wearing indoor clothing and no shoes.</description>

    <measure>Change in 6-minute walk test</measure>

    <description>After a baseline blood pressure has been obtained, participants are asked to walk a measured distance as far as they are able in 6 minutes.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in weight loss self-efficacy assessed using the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Weight Efficacy Lifestyle (WEL) questionnaire will be used to measure self-efficacy for weight loss. The WEL consists of 20 items designed to measure self-confidence to control weight by resisting overeating in certain tempting situations. The total score will be used in analyses. The items are scored on a 10-point Likert scale from 0 (&quot;not confident&quot;) to 10 (&quot;very confident&quot;) and total score calculated as the sum of individual item responses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for exercise behaviors assessed using the Self-efficacy for Exercise Behaviors (SEB) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Self-efficacy for Exercise Behaviors (SEB) scale will be used to measure participants' self-efficacy related to the ability to exercise despite barriers. The 12-item scale consists of common barriers that might affect participation in exercise (e.g., feeling depressed, socializing, stressful life changes, household chores). For each situation, participants use the scale from 1 (&quot;I know I cannot&quot;) to 5 (&quot;I know I can&quot;) to describe his or her confidence that they could exercise in the face of these barriers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in peer support for health behavior change assessed using the 24-item Social Provisions Scale (SPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months, and 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' level of perceived peer support will be measured with the 24-item Social Provisions Scale (SPS). The SPS assesses six types of support from social relationships (guidance, reliable alliance, reassurance of worth, attachment, social integration, and opportunity for nurturance) and the total score will be used in the analysis. The items are scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 (&quot;strongly disagree) to 4 (&quot;strongly agree&quot;) as it pertains to relationships with group members. Higher scores indicate greater perceived support from group relationships.</description>

    <description>Lipids will be measured using the CardioChek PA Analyzer, a hand-held dual testing system that produces values for total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and triglycerides using a multi-panel test strip and a single drop of blood acquired with a finger prick.</description>

    <description>The 12-month PeerFIT intervention consists of a 6-month intensive phase including: (a) once weekly 60-minute group weight management and exercise session led by a lifestyle coach; (b) once weekly one-hour physical activity session delivered in community settings; and (c) Facebook and mHealth technology (i.e., Fitbits, text messaging support) to increase motivation and facilitate self-monitoring and peer social support for health behavior change. Participants then transition to a 6-month lower intensity phase in which the 90-minute weight management sessions are discontinued. The groups will be conducted as open groups with a minimum of 4 and maximum of 18 participants at any given time.</description>

    <description>Participants in BEAT will receive monthly individual lifestyle sessions delivered by a lifestyle coach including education, guidance, and support for self-monitoring behaviors (i.e., daily self-weighing and tracking daily steps) during the first six months of the study, plus text message reminders and encouragement for self-monitoring weight loss behaviors during the entire 12-month study period. Participants will receive materials with tips and strategies for healthy eating and increasing physical activity. They will also be given a wearable activity tracker (i.e., Fitbit Zip) to use with instructions for using the device. The first session with the lifestyle coach will be in person and thereafter by phone.</description>

    <ipd_description>The proposed project involves human subject data, and all data collected on subjects (both positive and negative) will be submitted to the National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT). This will include individual level data from all subjects enrolled in both the active intervention and control conditions.
The NDCT is a secure data repository run by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) that allows researchers to collect and share de-identified information with each other. This secure informatics platform facilitates scientific collaboration and data sharing, and enables effective communication of detailed research data, tools, and supporting documentation. The NDCT links data across research projects using Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) for each participant, and the NDCT Data Dictionary.</ipd_description>
