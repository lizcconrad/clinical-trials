      The aim of this prospective cohort study is to compare the esthetic, clinical and
      patient-centered outcomes following immediate and delayed implant placement protocols.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are divided into two groups: immediate and delayed implant placement. The
      investigators are asking subjects to take part in a research study of soft tissue and bone
      healing around dental implants following tooth extraction. The investigators want to compare
      how the gums and the bone changes shape with healing in two different scenarios.
