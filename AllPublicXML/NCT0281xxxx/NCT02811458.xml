  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are the most common mental disorders in community settings, and they are
      associated with significant psychological distress, functional and social impairment.
      Although pharmacological and psychological treatments for anxiety and depression have existed
      for several years now, only a minority of anxiety disorder sufferers are treated according to
      guidelines. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is the most consistently efficacious
      psychological treatment for anxiety disorders, but implementation of CBT in primary care is
      challenging due to limited resources. Recent studies indicate that transdiagnostic group CBT
      for multiple anxiety disorders could be a promising alternative to individual CBT in primary
      care. The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of group CBT for anxiety disorders
      as a complement to usual care. The clinical trial will be conducted in three Health and
      Social Services Centers in the province of Québec (i.e. Sherbrooke, Laval and Québec).
      Patients will be French-speaking adults with anxiety disorders, and they will be randomly
      assigned to one of two treatment conditions: a) Transdiagnostic group CBT (12 weekly 2-hour
      sessions), b) usual care. The transdiagnostic group CBT will be offered as a differed
      intervention to participants in the usual care group after the 8-month follow up.
      Participants in both study arms will undergo a baseline clinical evaluation as well as
      outcome assessment interviews at post-treatment, 4, 8, and 12 month follow-up time-points.
      The primary study results will include improvement on a questionnaire on anxiety symptoms.
      Widespread implementation of group CBT could lead to better outcomes for a large number of
      patients living with anxiety.
