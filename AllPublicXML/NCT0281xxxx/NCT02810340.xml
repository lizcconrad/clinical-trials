    <textblock>
      MCV-5 is a vaccine being studied for use against a germ that causes infections of the brain
      and/or the blood. There are several licensed vaccines that protect against meningitis caused
      by 4 different types of the germ, but there is one type of the germ that these vaccines do
      not protect against. MCV-5 includes the same coverage as these other vaccines and includes a
      fifth type. The purpose of this study is to test how this vaccine affects adult human
      volunteers when compared to a licensed meningitis vaccine. Investigators will monitor
      volunteers for side effects and collect blood to test for antibodies.
