      The purpose of this study is to investigate the possible relationship of microRNA and
      postoperative delirium.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is one of the most common postoperative complications in elderly
      patients.It has been shown that postoperative delirium has independent adverse effects on
      short and long-term mortality and morbidity, including poor functional recovery,
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction, deterioration in quality of life, and increased costs.
      However, at the present time, postoperative delirium is a clinical phenomenon, and its
      neuropathogenesis remains unknown. This gap in knowledge has become a barrier that limits
      further studies, including the development of potential interventions for postoperative
      delirium.

    <description>All of the participants had spinal anesthesia for the scheduled surgery. Two milliliter of CSF was collected from a spinal needle by anesthesiologists during the spinal anesthesia before the administration of the local anesthetic. Blood samples were collected from patients prior to spinal anesthesia.</description>

    <description>Trained clinical research assistants interviewed the patients on the first and second day post surgery. The assessment of post deliriu (POD) was performed once per day between 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM. Patient notes were not reviewed for episodes of delirium which could occur outside the time of assessment. The clinical research assistants who performed the delirium assessments in this study had good training and went through quality control procedures. We used state-of-the-art delirium detection methods, which tend to report a higher incidence of delirium. The interview included the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS).</description>
