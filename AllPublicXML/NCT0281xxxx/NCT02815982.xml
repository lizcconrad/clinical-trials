      This purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility of and optimal time post
      cancer treatment to offer caregivers a new health behavior change intervention (NOURISH-T),
      as well as assess its preliminary efficacy on specific child health behaviors. The study will
      also explore whether caregivers NOURISH-T exhibit more improvements than caregivers in EUC
      (standard care).

    <description>The intervention aims to increase caregivers' self-efficacy for behavioral change, and facilitate an authoritarian approach to parenting. Behavioral strategies such as self-monitoring, contingency management, and stimulus control are integrated in these sessions. Further, because participatory experiences enhance overall intervention efficacy, these activities are incorporated throughout, including self-assessments, discussions and experiential activities. Homework will be assigned between sessions so skills can be practiced. We also focus on the caregivers' relationship with everyone in the family, not just the &quot;identified patient&quot; or overweight child.</description>

    <description>Caregivers randomized to the EUC will attend assessment sessions and an initial session moderated by an independent interventionist. The session will address the role of diet and exercise in pediatric overweight. In addition, EUC caregivers will receive nationally available print or web-based brochures on pediatric overweight on 2 occasions during the study so that similar (but not as intensive) information is provided in the intervention and EUC arms of the study. Participants will also receive a booster phone call 2 months after the end of the intervention period.</description>
