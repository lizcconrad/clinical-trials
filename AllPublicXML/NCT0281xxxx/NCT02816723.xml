  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in younger
      individuals. The proposed study investigates the usefulness of these classes in older
      Veterans aged 50-85. We hope to show that such classes can lead to improvements in both
      thinking skills as well as stress levels.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The expansion of the aging Veteran population, in addition to the frequent presence of
      comorbidities (e.g., PTSD and TBI) that exacerbate age-associated cognitive and health
      declines, has generated substantial interest in interventions that promote brain health in
      older Veterans. A growing body of evidence shows the positive effects of Brain Health &amp;
      Wellness classes on brain health in younger and middle-aged adults, thus training might be
      able to enhance brain health in older Veterans and offset age-related declines. Such training
      holds particular promise in enhancing areas of cognition that are especially susceptible to
      aging processes (e.g. attention and executive control), potentially through multiple
      mechanistic pathways. It is in many respects a cognitive exercise and may strengthen neural
      networks involved in such processes. Additionally, there is evidence for further facilitating
      brain health in other ways related to, for instance, altering the stress response. Currently,
      there is little information regarding the potential brain health benefits in older adults. As
      a first step to understanding these potential beneficial effects in Veterans, the aim of the
      proposed pilot study is to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of
      two Brain Health &amp; Wellness classes in healthy older Veterans through a randomized,
      controlled trial.
