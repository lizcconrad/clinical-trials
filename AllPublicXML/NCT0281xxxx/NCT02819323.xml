         17. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, should not be included in the study
             for any reason, including inability to follow study procedures and history of major
             medical/psychiatric conditions that would compromise the safety of the study.

         18. Subjects who have participated in an investigational surgical, drug, or device study
