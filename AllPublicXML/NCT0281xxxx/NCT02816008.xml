    <textblock>
      Cognitive rehabilitation is defined as a systematic functionally oriented intervention of
      therapeutic cognitive activities based on the assessment and understanding of patient's brain
      behavior deficits. This project focuses on restoring cognitive functions in order to
      understand the underlying deficits in the patient's brain by developing integrated cognitive
      rehabilitation scenarios in virtual reality that combine memory, attention and problem
      solving training with context specific motor movements.
