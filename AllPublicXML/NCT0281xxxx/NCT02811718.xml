  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine, whether the 3RP is feasible, accepted and efficacious
      and durable when delivered via Skype to patients with neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) who are
      deaf or have severe hearing loss using Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART)
      and/or American Sign Language (ASL).

      This will be a substudy of the IRB-approved protocol #2013P002605. It is the same study
      except it is looking at a particular sub-population: patients with NF2 who are hard of
      hearing.

    <description>The WHOQOL-BREF comprises of 26 items which measure the following broad domains: physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment. The WHOQOL-BREF is a shorter version of the original instrument that may be more convenient for use in large research studies or clinical trials.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Measure of Current Status (MOCS-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between Baseline (week 0), Post-intervention (week 8) and Follow Up (week 32)</time_frame>
    <description>The MOCS-A is a 13-item measure assessing participants' current self-perceived status on several skills such as: the ability to relax at will, recognize stress-inducing situations, restructure maladaptive thoughts, be assertive about needs, and choose appropriate coping responses as needed. Responses are made on a 7-point scale with higher scores reflecting higher life satisfaction.</description>
