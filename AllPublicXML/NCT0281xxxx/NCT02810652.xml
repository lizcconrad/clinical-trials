      The purpose of this research study is to addresses the challenge of managing the unique
      perioperative needs of older cancer patients undergoing surgical resection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of a
      perioperative geriatrics intervention versus usual care in older patients with
      gastrointestinal (GI) cancers undergoing surgical resection. The perioperative geriatrics
      intervention will entail pre- and post-operative geriatric care for patients age ≥65
      undergoing surgery for pancreatic, esophageal and gastric cancers. Specifically, geriatric
      clinicians will evaluate and manage patients preoperatively in the outpatient setting and
      postoperatively in the inpatient setting as a consultant.

      The investigators will evaluate the effect of the perioperative geriatrics intervention on
      postoperative length of stay (primary outcome) and readmissions in a sample of 160 patients.
      The investigators will also assess the impact of the perioperative geriatrics intervention on
      patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life (QOL) and symptom burden.

      The study will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital.
