  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project will be to demonstrate that Synaptive Medical's Diffusion Tensor
      Imaging(DTI) product functionality used in pre-operative planning and intraoperative surgical
      navigation, improves clinical outcomes corresponding to a reduction in neurological and
      neuropsychological deficits in pediatric brain tumor surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Brain tumours are the most common form of solid tumours in children which often arise from
      the cerebellum. Treatment involves a complete resection of the tumour. Although surgical
      resection may eliminate most of the malignancy, signs of post-neurologic deficit may present
      as a consequence to the treatment.

      One such example is cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS), a postoperative syndrome typically
      arising 1 to 2 days after resection of a midline posterior fossa tumor; it consists of
      diminished speech progressing to mutism, emotional lability, hypotonia, and ataxia. While
      some of the symptoms recover after a few months, neuropsychological testing shows long term
      deficits in language (agramatism), executive function and verbal memory.

      This study aims to investigate whether the use of Synaptive Medical's BrightMatter™
      technology can help neurosurgeons better visualize and plan surgeries by avoiding eloquent
      fiber tracts in the brain and cerebellum; thus minimizing damage pertaining to neurologic and
      motor functionality. The use of these products will also be assessed for improved clinical
      outcomes in pediatric tumor surgery.

    <description>Control Group (surgical standard of care): Subjects 18 years and younger diagnosed with a pediatric brain tumor, and who are eligible for surgical treatment will be recruited. All subjects will have clinical MRI scans that include a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol. Surgery will be carried out according to usual standard of care, without the use of processing for DTI tractography. Additional clinical scanning with the same protocol will be carried out post-operatively at 6 months. Pre-operative and post-operative quality of life assessments, functional testing and clinical outcome tests will be conducted at this post-operative period (6-months).</description>

    <description>Interventional Group (involvement of all BrightMatter™ products): Subjects 18 years and younger diagnosed with a pediatric brain tumor and who are eligible for surgical treatment will be recruited. All subjects will have clinical MRI scans that include a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol and will be sent to the interventional technology (BrightMatter Bridge) for quality control. The QC'ed images will then be sent to a pre-operating planning software (BrightMatter Plan) for planning the surgical approach. Surgery will be carried out with guidance from the exported plan and the intra-operative neuro-navigation software, BrightMatter Guide, with the use of post-processing DTI tractography. Additional clinical scanning with the same protocol will be carried out post-operatively at 6 months. Pre-operative and post-operative quality of life assessments, functional testing and clinical outcome tests will be conducted at this post-operative period (6-months).</description>

    <description>BrightMatter™ Plan (BMP): BMP is a software that enables surgeons to plan their neurosurgery preoperatively. BMP automatically generates whole brain tractography and highly accurate fusion of anatomical MRI and DTI images.
BrightMatter™ Bridge (BMB):BMB involves offering SMI's MRI expertise to ensure a smooth workflow in neuroimaging including DTI to ensure optimized protocols are used to acquire the DTI images. Once the images are acquired, they are evaluated for their quality in real time using a quality control (QC) algorithm. The QC allows quality assessment of DTI images at the time-of-scan allowing for immediate correction while the patient is still there and reduces the need for patient re-scan.
BrightMatter™ Guide (BMG): BMG is a neuro-navigation system that utilizes the DTI information and the trajectory planned by the surgeon in BMP pre-operatively, but bringing it into the operating room intraoperatively.</description>
