      The objectives of this study are twofold

        -  To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.1% AGN-195263 administered twice daily compared
           to its vehicle in patients with evaporative dry eye (EDE)

        -  To evaluate the systemic pharmacokinetics of 0.1% AGN-195263 administered twice daily in
           patients with EDE

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of patients with a percent change of at least -50% (ie, improvement greater than 50%) in overall ocular discomfort.
The percent change in overall ocular discomfort score (OODS) defined as below will be computed for each patient: [(OODS at month 6 - OODS at baseline)/OODS at baseline]x100)</description>
