      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the contraceptive efficacy, vaginal bleeding
      pattern (cycle control), and the general safety and acceptability of the 15 mg estetrol
      (E4)/3 mg drospirenone (DRSP) combination in healthy women aged 18 to 50 years.

    <description>On-treatment pregnancies are defined as pregnancies with an estimated date of conception within the in-treatment period i.e. Day 1 to 2 days after the last intake of investigational product (whether active or inactive tablet).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The number of on-treatment pregnancies as assessed by the method failure Pearl Index in subjects aged 18 to 35 years, inclusive, at the time of screening.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months (13 cycles with 1 cycle = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The method failure Pearl Index is calculated using the same method used for the Pearl Index, but includes only those pregnancies that were classified as method failure and not the pregnancies due to user failure, i.e. incorrect intake of the contraceptive method.</description>

    <measure>Number of subjects with scheduled bleeding/spotting.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months (13 cycles with 1 cycle = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Scheduled bleeding/spotting is defined as any bleeding/spotting that occurs during the hormone-free interval (i.e. Days 25 - 28) and continues through Days 1-3 of the subsequent active cycle.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 12 months (13 cycles with 1 cycle = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Unscheduled bleeding/spotting is defined as any bleeding/spotting that occurs while taking active hormones that does not meet the criteria for scheduled bleeding.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects with absence of any bleeding/spotting.</measure>

    <measure>Change in endometrial histology from baseline to end of treatment in subjects having been treated for at least 10 complete cycles.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 months (13 cycles with 1 cycle = 28 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Endometrial biopsies will be obtained from a subset of 100 subjects included in the endometrial safety Substudy at the Screening Visit and at Visit 7a if the subject has completed at least 10 cycles.</description>
