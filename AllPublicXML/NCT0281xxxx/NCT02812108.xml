      This study was designed to collect a large series of patients with aneurysms treated
      endovascularly to analyze hemodynamic factors that affect aneurysm recanalization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the rapid development of endovascular technique, endovascular treatment has become the
      first line treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Compared to microsurgical clipping,
      less invasive and lower morbidity have been shown after endovascular treatment. However, the
      aneurysms recanalization is the drawback of such modality. It has been reported that many
      factors, including complete initial embolization, stent assisted coiling, dense packing and
      flow diverter, could reduce recanalization rate. Larger size, wide neck, rupture status and
      intraluminal thrombosis are reported as risk factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, no
      analysis of hemodynamic risk factors affecting the aneurysm recanalization has been conducted
      in a large prospective series of patients.

      Hemodynamics is reported to play an important role in aneurysm initiation, growth and
      rupture. Previous studies have showed that the hemodynamics is associated with outcomes of
      aneurysms after endovascular treatment. High wall shear stress and flow velocity are risk
      factors of aneurysm recanalization. However, the relationship between hemodynamics and
      aneurysm outcomes is still unclear. To explore the hemodynamic predictors of aneurysm
      recanalization is of great value for clinical practice.

      Hemodynamic analysis for intracranial aneurysms recanalization after endovascular treatment
      (HARET) is a prospective trial designed to collect a large series of patients with aneurysms
      treated endovascularly to analyze hemodynamic factors that affect aneurysm recanalization.
