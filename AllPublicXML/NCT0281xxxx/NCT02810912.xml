  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric regurgitation increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration in surgical patients
      receiving general anesthesia because of depression of gastro-esophageal reflux. In addition,
      some patients may have higher risk of aspiration as a result of reduced gastric emptying and
      gastroesophageal reflux, prolonged surgical time, and laparoscopic surgery. Second-generation
      supraglottic airway device (SAD) provides an additional channel to facilitate the drainage
      the gastric content to prevent from aspiration, which was routinely used in surgeries.
      Currently, multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (MII-pH) monitoring, which combines
      multiple impedance channels to conventional pH catheters, is regarded as the most sensitive
      technique for detecting reflux events. Therefore, application of MII-pH monitoring on the
      SAD-based general anesthesia may help to detect ongoing reflux/regurgitation in the esophagus
      of patients during perioperative period. The hypothesis of the present study is that the
      occurrences of gastroesophageal regurgitation during general anesthesia may be influenced by
      the several factors, such as abdominal insufflation during laparoscopy, longer surgical time,
      Trendelenburg position, higher body weight, etc.

      Investigators aim to observe the occurrences of gastroesophageal regurgitation through the
      continuous monitoring with the novel technique of MII-pH during the perioperative period of a
      variety of common surgical procedures under SAD-based general anesthesia in this pilot study.
      Furthermore, investigators will also determine the factors associated with the occurrence of
      gastroesophageal regurgitation during these various surgical procedures under general
      anesthesia.

      Investigators include the patients who will receive scheduled surgery under SAD-based general
      anesthesia and aged &gt;= 20 will be enrolled. All subjects provide basic demographic data and
      fill in standard symptom questionnaire for evaluation of baseline severity of
      gastroesophageal reflux and other associated gastrointestinal and sleep symptoms.
      Supraglottic airway device with i-gel will be inserted to establish airway, and the gastric
      content will be suctioned out through the esophageal vent of i-gel. MII-pH catheter will be
      inserted though the esophageal vent of i-gel to detect and characterize gastroesophageal
      reflux events in the perioperative period. After removal of SAD, the patients were follow the
      saturation, sore throat or hoarseness in the postoperative care unit, as well as the possible
      complications.

      Investigators will not only elucidate the clinical characteristics and risk factors in
      patients receiving elective surgeries, but also determine the severity of gastric
      regurgitation during the intraoperative period.

      Investigators will correlate the reflux pattern, frequency, content and proximal extent of
      all reflux events and symptom correlation with clinical features in the intraoperative
      period. The study results could help us study more in the gastric regurgitation in
      perioperative period.

    <description>Investigators do not have intervention in the observation study. Investigators only use the MII-pH catheter to observe the episodes of gastric regurgitation in patients receiving supraglottic airway device under general anesthesia. Thus, investigators are going to observe the effect of surgical position change, body weight, surgical time. And investigators will have a control group, which patients undergo elective surgeries without surgical position change, no longer surgical time, and normal range of body weight.</description>
