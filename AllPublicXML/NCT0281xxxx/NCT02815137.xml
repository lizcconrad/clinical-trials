    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the XPO1 E571K mutation could be used as
      molecular residual disease biomarker in classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. To determine the
      interest of the mutation assessment by digital Polymerase Chain Reaction, sensitivity and
      specificity after 2 courses of chemotherapy (C2) will be compared with the deltaSUVmax
      determined by Positron Emission Tomography after C2 and at end of treatment.

      A research team of Centre Henri Becquerel recently detected an unexpected recurrent point
      mutation of XPO1 (exportin 1) (also known as Chromosome Region Maintenance 1) located in exon
      15 (c.1711G&gt;A) leading to the Glu571Lys (p.E571K) missense substitution in
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) Primary Mediastinal Large B-cell Lymphoma (PMBL) patients included
      in the LYSA LNH03 trial program and in classical Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients. It was found
      recurrent XPO1 E571K mutations in a large cohort of 94 patients with classical Hodgkin's
      lymphoma. This observation is new and could add new information on driver events and
      tumorigenesis in this disease. In total, 24.2 % of the patients with classical Hodgkin's
      lymphoma harbored the XPO1 E571K mutation. It is remarkable that 29% of all XPO1 mutations
      were only found in the plasma but not in the tumor because of the well-known tumor cell
      sparsity in Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this particular disease, highly sensitive techniques like
      digital Polymerase Chain Reaction and targeted Next-Generation Sequencing are essential to
      highlight low frequency mutations. The research team of the Centre Henri Becquerel have
      identified a trend toward unfavorable prognostic impact in terms of progression-free survival
      in patients with detectable XPO1 E571K mutation in plasma cell-free DNA at the end of
      treatment, which could prove to be statistically significant in a larger cohort. It was
      observed that 57% of patients who ultimately relapsed were positive in the plasma after end
      of therapy. It remains to be established whether this mutation adds new relevant value as
      compared to Positron Emission Tomography-scan.
