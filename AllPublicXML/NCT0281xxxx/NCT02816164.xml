  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with early-stage breast cancer, chemotherapy has substantially improved survival
      rates. Improvements in outcomes, however, are compromised by the considerable toxicities
      associated with chemotherapy, the most notable being neutropenia. Neutropenia is the presence
      of abnormally few white blood cells, leading to increase susceptibility to infection and can
      require hospitalization and need for intravenous antibiotics and is sometimes fatal. Febrile
      neutropenia (FN) can also be associated with treatment delays and dose reductions,
      potentially compromising treatment efficacy. Patients can receive medication to reduce the
      risk of FN such as Neupogen (filgrastim) as a daily injection for 5, 7 or 10 days. Since
      there is genuine uncertainty among healthcare professionals as to which administration
      schedule of Neupogen is the best for patients, the investigators are performing a randomized
      study for which patients will receive either 5, 7 or 10 days of Neupogen. Neupogen can cost
      approximately $200/injection, so if a physician prescribes 10 days for 8 cycles of treatment,
      this can cost $16,000 compared to a 5 day treatment which would cost half this. In addition
      to cost savings, many patients are not able to give themselves injections on a daily basis
      and require nursing resources which are utilized at high cost. This study will use an oral
      consent model to compare 5, 7 and 10 days of Neupogen to evaluate rates of febrile
      neutropenia and hospitalization.
