      Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score (MSFC) is one of the gold standard for multiple
      sclerosis (MS) patient clinical evaluation. However, its practical implementation is not
      always optimal as it can prove to be very time consuming. Moreover, it often constrains the
      range of tests used and is not a particularly good marker for patient real life disability
      status.

      A mobile application called Digital Self-Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (DAM) was
      developed in order to replicate each of MSFC tests available in order to assess MS
      progression in the patient environment.

      Patients are selected during a consultation at the Neurology department of the
      Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (France). Each patient is given access to DAM on their own or a
      provided iPhone. During the enrolment visit, patients have to complete a MSFC and DAM
      evaluation (V0). Through a push-notification on their phone, patients are reminded to perform
      two DAM evaluations at home at days 30 (V1) and 60 (V2). At day 90 (V3), they have to come
      back to hospital for a second MSFC and DAM evaluation
