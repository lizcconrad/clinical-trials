  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the investigators observed a case of glucocorticoid mutation revealed by incidentally
      discovered bilateral adrenal nodular hyperplasia, it was postulated that this molecular
      anormality could be more frequent than previously described. To validate this hypothesis, it
      was decided to study 150 multicenter consecutive patients, presenting with incidentally
      discovered bilateral adrenal masses without clinical signs of Cushing's disease. In all these
      patients GR gene will be studied, mutations will be detected and described, functional
      disturbance will be tested. Usual polymorphisms will be described. Correlation between
      clinical signs, hormonal and morphological abnormalities and presence or absence of GR
      mutations will be searched.
