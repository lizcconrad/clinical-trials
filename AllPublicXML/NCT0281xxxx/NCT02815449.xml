  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is a wide spread problem in Africa and iron
      fortification can be an effective strategy to decrease this.

      In the current study adding different levels of a stabilizer to iron fortified cubes and it's
      effect on iron bioavailability from these cubes will be studied in the context of a Nigerian
      meal in women.

      24 Female subjects with low serum ferritin levels will be included in the study. The study
      will last 64 days and subjects will be asked to consume a breakfast and lunch prepared with a
      bouillon cube with isotope labeled iron during 3 periods of 5 consecutive days. The
      absorption of iron will be evaluated after every period and compared between the cubes.
