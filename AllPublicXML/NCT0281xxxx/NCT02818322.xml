      The role of telemedical monitoring in diabetic foot care is still uncertain. The aim is to
      compare telemedical + standard and standard alone outpatient monitoring in the care of
      patients with diabetic foot ulcers in a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome of
      the overall study is the time of ulcer healing. The number of amputation, hospital admissions
      and surgical procedure will be also reported. Investigators hope to include 150 patients in
      this study.
