    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety, and
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years old with Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy caused by a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene. The study includes a 4-week
      screening period, a 4-week study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who
      complete the 4-week study period (52 weeks total treatment).

    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a Phase 2, multiple-dose, open-label study evaluating the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ataluren in patients aged ≥2 to &lt;5 years
      old with nmDMD. In nmDMD, early start of treatment is important and necessary and, therefore,
      it is relevant to understand the correct and tolerable dose in this age group, particularly
      since ataluren is dosed by weight. The study will include a 4-week screening period, a 4-week
      study period, and a 48-week extension period for patients who complete the 4-week study
      period (52 weeks total treatment). The objective of the extension period is to assess the
      long-term safety of chronic administration of ataluren in this patient population.
