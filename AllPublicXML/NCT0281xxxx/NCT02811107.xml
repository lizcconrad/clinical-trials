  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety is associated with discomfort but also with an increased risk of pain and/or
      analgesic consumption. A prescription of anxiolytics is very common in pre-anesthetic
      consultation but without considering the real anxiety level of the patients. The objective of
      this premedication is mainly to improve patient comfort, to reduce patient anxiety and to
      improve patient cooperation.

      According to a study conducted in the 1990s, 40 to 80% of patients are anxious before
      surgery.

      Consequences of anxiety are somatic (tachycardia, hypertension, difficulty to falling
      asleep), behavioural (aggressiveness, regression, fight against anaesthesia induction) and
      postoperative pain.

      Preoperative area is a place of convergence for patients who need surgery or an
      interventional procedure.

      Staying in the preoperative area may be a source of anxiety and may affect the patient
      management.

      The investigators will interview patients undergoing surgery or interventional procedure to
      assess their level of anxiety, pain and their experiences during their stay in preoperative
      area. The objective is to analyse the level of anxiety and / or pain and their clinical
      consequences, and then to assess the relationship with any potential premedication.
