      This study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Folfox4 chemotherapy regimen to
      prevent early recurrence for hepatocellular carcinoma patients with portal vein tumor
      thrombus following curative resection

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Curative resective is well-accepted as the predominant treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma
      (HCC) patients. Unfortunately, the long-term prognosis remains poor due to frequent
      postoperative recurrence, especially in HCC patients with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT).
      When PVTT invades into the portal vein system, tumor cell spreads and distributes along with
      the portal vein and its branches,thus resulting in intra-hepatic micro-metastasis which
      contributes to early recurrence for patients following curative resection. Postoperative
      adjuvant interventions include TACE, antiviral therapy, immunotherapy, local radiotherapy
      were applied to prevent recurrence. However, the efficacy and safety of these regimens
      remains unsatisfactory. Thus new therapeutic strategy remains to be investigated. This study
      is to investigate the efficacy and safety of Folfox4 chemotherapy regimen to prevent early
      recurrence for HCC patients with PVTT following curative resection.
