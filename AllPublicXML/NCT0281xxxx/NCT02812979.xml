  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal objective is to show noninferiority of nebulized salbutamol through the high
      flow nasal system moistened AIRVO ™ 2 in terms of reversibility of airflow obstruction
      compared to nebulization by the usual method (spray mask).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, comparative, non inferiority study between two nebulization strategies
      bronchodilators, one according to the method tested namely the spray - in across the top
      humidified nasal flow system and the other according to a customary procedure, through a
      mask. A third arm will be evaluated (control arm) to overcome a possible own bronchodilator
      effect of high flow nasal humidified.

    <description>AIRVOTM2 will be set to deliver air (21% oxygen concentration ) at a rate of 30 L / min at 100 % relative humidity at 37 ° C.
Nebulization of salbutamol will be effected by means of a nebulizer to the vibrating screen (Aerogen® Solo, Aerogen , Galway, Ireland ) which is a nebulizing device for single use, commonly used in invasive and non invasive mechanical ventilation.
Nebulizer will be responsible for a salbutamol solution available in the form of containers of 2.5 ml containing 2.5 mg of salbutamol</description>

    <description>During nebulization in the usual way ( oral facial mask ) , it will be used a pneumatic nebulizer powered by a 6 L / min air flow rate ( usual method ).
