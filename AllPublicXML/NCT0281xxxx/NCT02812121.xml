  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a severe disease
      with high mortality. Our previous study have demonstrated that peripheral infusion of bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) weekly for 4 times is safe and improves 24
      weeks survival rate of ACLF patients. In this study, we intend to assess the safety and
      efficacy of umbilical cord blood derived MSCs for HBV-related ACLF patients.
