    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single sequence study to evaluate the effect of BCX7353 on hepatic and
      intestinal cytochrome P450 enzymes using probe substrate drugs in healthy subjects.
      Pharmacokinetics of the probe substrate drugs will be measured prior to and following
      administration of multiple doses of BCX7353.

      This is a single centre, single sequence, open-label, study to evaluate the effect of BCX7353
      on hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 (midazolam IV and PO, respectively),
      CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), CYP2C19 (omeprazole) and CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan) enzyme activity
      using probe substrate drugs in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetics of the probe substrate
      drugs will be measured prior to and following administration of multiple doses of BCX7353.

      Twenty healthy male and female subjects are planned for dosing.

      Each subject will receive the following treatments:

      Day 1: 1 mg midazolam will be administered as an IV bolus simultaneously to administration of
      500 mg tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, and 30 mg dextromethorphan orally.

      Day 2: a single oral dose of 2 mg midazolam. Days 3 to 9: 350 mg BCX7353 once a day. Day 10:
      1 mg midazolam will be administered as an IV bolus simultaneously to administration of 500 mg
      tolbutamide, 40 mg omeprazole, 30 mg dextromethorphan and 350 mg BCX7353, orally.

      Day 11: a single oral dose of 2 mg of midazolam along with 350 mg BCX7353.
