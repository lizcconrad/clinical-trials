      The purpose of this study is to compare the adenoma detection rates of full-spectrum
      endoscopy versus standard forward-viewing colonoscopy in colorectal cancer screening
      programme.

      Colorectal cancer is the third most common neoplasia and the second leading cause of cancer
      death in West countries. Colonoscopy is the gold standard for prevention of colorectal cancer
      disease. Screening for colorectal cancer with biennial faecal occult blood testing is a
      widely used strategy followed by colonoscopy for those with a positive test. Colonoscopy
      identifies polyps during the procedure as well as polyp removal in order to prevent
      progression to cancer. Although, interval cancer appears after a colonoscopy because of
      22-28% of polyp missed rates. Advanced Technology may improve adenoma detection rates so
      decrease interval cancer and reduce mortally. Full-spectrum endoscopy with 330º angle vision
      decrease adenoma miss rate in general population.

      The investigators conducted a randomized trial in patients from colorectal cancer screening
      programme (aged 50-69 years) after faecal immunological test positive. One arm the
      colonoscopy is performed with standard forward view colonoscopy (170º angle view) and the
      other arm is performed with full-spectrum endoscopy (EndoChoice) (330º angle view)
