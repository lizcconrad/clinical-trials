  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to conduct a pilot study to test the utility of a Natural
      Language Processing (NLP) clinical messaging tool to improve the reach and the quality
      (fidelity and competency) of coaches providing behavioral activation (BA) strategies through
      a mobile mental health app called Personalized Real-time Intervention for Motivational
      Enhancement (PRIME). This study will improve the reach of clinicians by using a NLP-powered
      messaging tool, which will ensure fidelity to the BA model and clinicians will have access to
      real-time clinical information about their patients to guide more targeted treatment
      (competence). If successful, PRIME could operate as a cost effective tool for clinicians to
      extend their reach and an accessible treatment for the population of those struggling with
      depression.
