    <textblock>
      Purpose: Central serous retinopathy (CSCR) is characterized by macular detachment due to
      thickened choroid mostly affecting young men under perceived stress. While most previous
      studies in CSCR have been retrospective and have focused on a single facet of the patient's
      personality, the investigators conducted a prospective intercontinental controlled study to
      analyze the multifaceted personality profile in CSCR.

      Design: Prospective interview. Participants and Controls: Subjects with CSCR consented to
      participate in a questionnaire. Controls not having retinal disease were recruited from the
      same clinic.

      Main Outcome Measures: The main parameters registered were presence of stress, daily number
      of cups caffeine intake, personality traits (Type A; obsessive-compulsive; aggressive).

      Methods: The interview consisted of a 60-item questionnaire. Recruitment of participants was
      from January 2015 to February 2016. Controls were matched for age, gender and race.
      Statistical analyses were done using univariate and multivariate analysis.

      Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) characterized by serous macular detachment is the
      fourth most common retinal disease after age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
      retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion. In a population-based retrospective cohort and case
      control study in Olmsted county, Minnesota, USA, Kitzmann et al4 reported a mean age-adjusted
      incidence of 9.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.4-12.4) per 100, 000 in men, and 1.7 (95% CI
      0.7-2.7) in women. The mean age of onset of CSCR appears between 41 and 45 years5. The
      disease affects various racial groups5-8 and occasionally can be familial9. The pathogenesis
      remains poorly understood and currently the exudation is thought to result from
      hyper-permeable choroid secondary to venous stasis, ischemia, or inflammation2. Because of
      lack of proper animal models and lack of definite cure, clinical research has focused on risk
      factors such as stress, corticosteroid intake, and type A personality. Different
      hospital-based studies yielded different risk factors. Epidemiologic studies failed to
      ascertain many of these risk factors. Due to different methodology (retrospective vs.
      prospective case-control studies; selection of controls; questionnaire vs. interview by
      physician assistant vs. interview by physician) and focus on single risk factors in the
      literature, the investigators designed a study that targets a vast number of known or
      potential risk factors in various collaborative centers and compare it to results reported in
      the literature.
