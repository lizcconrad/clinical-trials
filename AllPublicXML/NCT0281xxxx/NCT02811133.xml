  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open trial which seeks to determine safety and tolerability of using inositol for
      children and adolescents with bipolar disorder and comorbid anxiety disorders with
      exploration of efficacy and dose response.

    <textblock>
      Anxiety disorders are a common comorbidity among children and adolescents with bipolar
      disorder. Treatment with standard pharmacologic agents may worsen mood problems or lead to
      drug dependency. Inositol has shown benefit for bipolar depression in adults. This is an open
      multi-case control study. The investigators will enroll 20 children and adolescents ages 8-17
      treated at the Child and Adolescent Bipolar Services (CABS) at Western Psychiatric Institute
      and Clinic. A subjects involvement will be 14 weeks, including the initial titration of the
      supplement, maintenance, and taper. Primary outcomes will include standard measures of mood
      and anxiety. Also, physiologic measures including body mass index and bedside glucose will be
      followed.
