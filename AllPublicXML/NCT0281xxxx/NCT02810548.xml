      Background: the ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is the regeneration of periodontal
      tissues. Researches had demonstrated the benefits of platelet concentrates bine grafts in
      osseous regeneration in the areas of periodontal surgery.

      Aim of the study: to evaluate the effect of PRF with/without nanohydroxyapatite in
      periodontal intrabony defects.

      Background: the ultimate goal of periodontal therapy is the regeneration of periodontal
      tissues. The regenerative and wound healing potential of platelets has attracted much
      attention over the last few years. Researches had demonstrated the benefits of platelet
      concentrates in osseous regeneration in the areas of periodontal surgery and implantology. In
      addition, nanohydroxyapatite was shown to be unsheathed by newly formed bone and partly
      replaced by it, but resorbed very slowly, as shown in animal experiments after 9 months or in
      clinical studies after a 6-month observation period. The clinical and biochemical studies
      evaluating the regenerative effect of PRF alone or in combination with nanohydroxyapatite in
      periodontal intrabony defects are still deficient.

      Aim of the study: to evaluate clinical and biochemical effect of PRF with/without
      nanohydroxyapatite in treatment of human intrabony defects.
