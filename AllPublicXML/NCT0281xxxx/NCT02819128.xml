      Hypothesis:

      Homeless people have infections not diagnosed with a potential impact on their health status.

      Main Purpose: Improve the etiological diagnosis of endemic and/or emerging pathologies among
      homeless people.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Marseilles, the population of homeless is estimated at 1500 individuals, including 800
      usually sleeping in the street, 600 in foster homes and a hundred in the structures of care.
      The precarious living conditions of homeless persons promote the emergence or re-emergence of
      many communicable infectious diseases homeless people whose symptoms are often overlooked by
      the subject and rarely established etiologic diagnosis.

      Among these diseases, frequently described in the literature are infestation by lice and
      infectious diseases that they transmit (Bartonella quintana), skin infections, hepatitis E
      and C and finally the infection with Tropheryma Whipplei. In this study we propose to
      systematically in homeless subject an etiological diagnosis of pathogens at the origin of
      these diseases (i) to improve knowledge (ii) to improve their management, (iii) to limit the
      contagion.
