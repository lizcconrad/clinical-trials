  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the clinical utility of 11C or 18F-Choline Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Whole Body Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) versus conventional bone scan and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements
      in response prediction to treatment with Enzalutamide in Hormono-Sensitive Metastatic
      Prostate Cancer patients.

      The study will assess how these 2 imaging modalities perform compared to traditional serial
      PSA measurements and bone scan in assessing metastatic tumour load, progressive disease and
      response to treatment with Enzalutamide.

      In addition measurements of serially collected circulating tumour cell (CTC) samples,
      cell-free tumour DNA and RNA will be performed in order to evaluate their predictive value in
      terms of response measurement.

      Metastatic prostate cancer patients eligible for 1st line hormonal treatment will undergo
      treatment with Enzalutamide (XTANDI). Subjects will receive 1dd 160 mg Enzalutamide orally
      continuously until progressive disease occurs. All subjects will undergo Choline (11C or
      18F)-PET/CT scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 and 6, 9 and 12 months after starting androgen
      receptor (AR)-directed treatment. All subjects will undergo Whole Body MRI at baseline, 6, 9
      and 12 months. Bone scans will be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 and 12 months. PSA will
      be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter until at 12 months. CTC counts and
      characteristics will be measured at baseline and during Enzalutamide treatment.

    <description>Radiological progression is defined by any of the following criteria:
Soft tissue lesions: Progressive disease on Choline (11C or 18F) PET/CT or Whole Body MRI by RECIST 1.1. Bone or bone marrow lesions: Progressive disease on PET/CT or MRI as evidenced by new lesions or an increase in size of 25% of the sum of target lesions.
Conversion of the Choline (11C or 18F) PET signal of the metastases at 2 weeks, 2 or 6 months compared to baseline PET which by comparing it to PFS at 6 and 12 months may be an indicator or drug response. Radiological PFS at 6 and 12 months will be compared to a) PET signal conversion and to b) PSA measurements, and changes in number of lesions on the bone scan (conventional work up).</description>
