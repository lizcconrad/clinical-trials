  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>

      medications.

    <measure>Change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Score From the Start to the End of the Double-blind Treatment Phase</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks (week 2 to week 18)</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) measures psychiatric symptomatology, especially related to psychosis. The complete PANSS contains ratings for 30 symptoms, including 7 positive symptoms, 7 negative symptoms, and 16 general psychiatric symptoms. The severity of each symptom is rated on a scale ranging from 1 (minimal) to 7 (extreme); higher scores indicate increased symptomatology. Total PANSS scores include scores from all categories and range from 30 to 210 units on a scale.</description>

    <description>The sulforaphane nutraceutical contains inactive glucoraphanin, a glucosinolate from broccoli seeds, and myrosinase from broccoli sprouts. The ingestion of this compound leads to the hydrolysis of glucoraphanin, the generation of sulforaphane within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the subsequent systemic absorption of the sulforaphane. The dose per tablet is 16 mg of glucoraphanin or 37 µmol; 6 tablets per day should yield about 100 µmol of sulforaphane. The tablets, which will be swallowed, are provided as .375 punch size, round concave tablets. In this arm, the participant will take 6 tablets of the sulforaphane nutraceutical daily for 16 weeks after a 2-week placebo run-in.</description>
