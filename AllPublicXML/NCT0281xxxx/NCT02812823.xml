  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressures measured by manometric solid-state catheters may differ according to the type of
      the catheter and specific anatomy and physiology of anorectum.

      The aim of the study is to establish the difference in recordings between 2 types of
      anorectal catheters used in pediatric patients and to validate the most appropriate way to
      diagnose of functional disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients enrolled in study will be investigated by both types of anorectal catheters, first
      by anorectal high resolution flexible, thinner, solid-state catheter and after that with
      rigid, thicker, solid-state catheter. Both procedures will be undertaken during one session.
      There will be used standard protocol of the procedure that measures conventional manometric
      parameters (resting pressure, squeeze pressure, bear down manoeuver, thresholds of sensation
      and recto anal inhibitory reflex threshold.

The parameter is recorded with 2 different types of anorectal catheters and the difference is evaluated.</description>

    <description>All subjects will be investigated by high-resolution anorectal manometry. At the beginning the anorectal cather will be used to record conventional parameters and after that 3D high-definition anorectal manometric catheter will be inserted in order to measure conventional parameters and 3D picture of anorectum.</description>
