  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Development of an S. sonnei human challenge model using a newly manufactured lyophilized lot
      of S. sonnei strain 53G (Lot 1794) that can be used in the future as a challenge strain for
      all S. sonnei vaccine candidates. An adaptable dosing plan will be used to determine the dose
      of Shigella sonnei 53G that induces the primary outcome in approximately 60% of subjects.

             significant physical examination findings and (c) no screening laboratory values
             significantly outside the normal limits of the testing laboratory within 45 days of
             challenge.

          3. Demonstrate comprehension of the protocol procedures and knowledge of study by passing
             a written examination (pass grade ≥70%) on day -1.

          4. Willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF).

          5. Willingness to participate for an inpatient stay lasting up to 11 days and an
             outpatient follow-up lasting 6 months from challenge.

          6. Willing to not smoke during the inpatient stay.

          7. Available for all planned follow-up visits.

          8. Negative serum pregnancy test at screening and negative urine pregnancy test on the
             day of admission to the inpatient phase for female subjects of childbearing potential.
             Females of childbearing potential must agree to use an effective method of birth
             control (birth control pills, injection hormonal contraceptive, implant hormonal
             contraceptive,

             hormonal patch, IUD, sterilization by hysterectomy or tubal ligation, spermicidal
             products and barrier methods such as cervical sponge, diaphragm, or condom) within two
             months of challenge and during the entire study. Abstinence is acceptable. A woman is
             eligible if she is monogamous with a vasectomized partner.

          9. Willing to not donate blood for up to 6 months after completion of the inpatient phase
             of the study.

         10. Willing to refrain from participation in another investigational vaccine or drug trial
             at least until after completion of the 6 month follow-up safety call.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of a significant medical condition (e.g. psychiatric conditions, alcohol or
             illicit drug abuse/dependency, or gastrointestinal disease, such as peptic ulcer,
             symptoms or evidence of active gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease,
             inflammatory bowel disease), or other laboratory abnormalities which in the opinion of
             the investigator precludes participation in the study.

          2. Immunosuppressive illness or IgA deficiency

          3. Positive serology results for HIV, HBsAg, HCV, or RPR (syphilis) antibodies.

          4. Evidence of inflammatory arthritis on exam and/or HLA-B27 positive.

          5. Family history of inflammatory arthritis.

          6. Significant abnormalities in screening lab hematology or serum chemistry, as
             determined by PI.

          7. Allergy to fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole

          8. Fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3 stools per day as the usual frequency.

          9. History of diarrhea in the 2 weeks prior to planned inpatient phase

         10. Use of antibiotics during the 7 days before receiving the challenge inoculum dosing

             hours prior to investigational product administration

         12. Travel within two years prior to dosing to countries where Shigella infection is
             endemic.

         13. Use of any medication known to affect the immune function [e.g., oral steroids,
             parenteral steroids, or high-dose inhaled steroids (&gt;800 μg/day of beclomethasone
             dipropionate or equivalent and others): nasal and topical steroids are allowed] within
             30 days preceding receipt of the challenge inoculum or planned use during the active
             study period.

         14. Serologic evidence of Shigella sonnei (titer &gt; 1:2500)
