      Primary Objectives:

        -  Phase I: To evaluate safety and tolerability of isatuximab in Japanese patients with
           relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.

        -  Phase II: To evaluate efficacy of isatuximab at recommended dose and to further evaluate
           the overall response rate (ORR) of isatuximab in Japanese patients with relapsed and
           refractory multiple myeloma.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety including immunogenicity of isatuximab. The severity, frequency
           and incidence of all adverse events will be assessed.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of isatuximab in the proposed dosing
           schedule.

        -  To assess the efficacy using International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response
           criteria.

        -  To assess the relationship between baseline CD38 receptor density on multiple myeloma
           cells and efficacy.

      The study duration for an individual patient will include a screening period for inclusion of
      up to 21 days, the treatment period consisting of 28 day cycles and a follow-up period.
      Treatment with isatuximab may continue until disease progression, unacceptable adverse event
      or other reason for discontinuation.
