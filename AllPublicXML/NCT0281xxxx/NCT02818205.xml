  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of detecting physiological patterns
      of arousal to sensory inputs in children with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
      Accordingly, two questions directed this methodological research investigation: (1) Is there
      a relationship between rest (tonic) and response (phasic) patterns of arousal among typically
      developing children and children with ASD?, and (2) Is there a difference in EDA response to
      sensation between typically developing children and children with ASD?

      This methodological research design is a prospective exploratory test-retest design assessing
      the relationship between tonic and phasic Electrodermal Activity (EDA) variables. EDA during
      rest and in response to a variety of sensations was measured using skin conductance.
      Descriptive statistics summarized EDA dependent variable data using skin conductance response
      (SCR) magnitude, SCR amplitude, skin conductance level (SCL), non-specific response (NSR) and
      habituation (HAB). The data was used to assess the relationship between tonic and phasic
      patterns of arousal and compare response patterns between groups using the Sensory Challenge
      Protocol (SCP) in children with ASD and typically developing children (TD).

        A convenience sample of boys between the ages of 4 - 11 years with and without a diagnosis
        of Autism Spectrum Disorder were recruited from private and public New Jersey Schools,
        Barpak Occupational Therapy clinic, Bergenfield, New Jersey and Seton Hall University
        campus.
