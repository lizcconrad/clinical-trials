  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to verify the effects of a segmental stabilization exercise program on the
      anticipatory postural adjustment of subjects with chronic lumbar pain. The effects will be
      assessed by means of superficial electromyography focused on the registry of the onset of
      multifidius and deltoid (anterior and posterior) activity during a repetitive shoulder
      ﬂexion/extension.

    <description>The stabilization program focuses on the reestablishment of motor control and coordination between deep and superficial trunk muscles. The exercise program is based on the following criteria progression: 1) Precise contraction of the transverse abdominal and multifidus muscles, keeping the lumbar spine in a neutral position (as the middle way between maximum flexion and extension, repeated three times); 2) Keep the neutral position for 10 repetitions of 10 seconds; 3) Perform exercises with lower limbs in different postures.</description>
