      Congenital idiopathic clubfoot (CC) is the fifth most common congenital malformation in
      children. The Ponseti method is an effective protocol for treatment of congenital idiopathic
      clubfoot. Plaster is essential for the Ponseti treatment. This paper describes a new brace
      that can be used for the treatment of clubfoot in newborns and infants instead of plaster.

      Methods In the orthopedic department of our hospital, 38 infants and newborns, (57 feet) ,all
      the patients were under the age of 3 months with congenital clubfoot underwent polyaxial
      braces between Jan, 2011 to Oct ,2013. Polyaxial brace was used for the deformity correction.
      Then, during the following 1-3 years, the Dennis braces were used during the night in case of
      recurrence. Prospective follow-up for a mean duration of 25 months (range, 15-36months) was
      carried out. The efficacy of the treatment was assessed by Pirani's scoring system before and
      after treatment.
