    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate connectivity regardless whether patients present a clinical type that
      requires medical treatment. In this point, investigators will include patients with
      progressive evolution as well as initial forms of the disease (CIS) and properly established
      forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in remittent-recidivant (RR) forms. The researches will not
      focus on medical treatment as some of these clinical forms have no indication for disease
      modifying drugs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, no clear consensus has been reached related to default mode network (DMN) activity
      and different clinical types of MS. Due to this controversy on the literature regarding
      increment and decrement of DMN activity along the natural history of MS evolution, this study
      aim to add experimental information and more data that might help to disentangle this
      paradox, also correlating this DMN activity with anatomic and cognitive indexes. The
      investigators will also introduce a novel experimental design, including a prospective
      measure of the investigators connectivity and cognitive measures.

      In this study, investigators aim to evaluate connectivity regardless whether patients present
      a clinical type that requires medical treatment. In this point, patients with progressive
      evolution as well as initial forms of the disease (CIS) will be included and properly
      established forms of MS in RR forms. Researchers will not focus on medical treatment as some
      of these clinical forms have no indication for disease modifying drugs. Nevertheless,
      investigators consider that the study of connectivity is worth regardless their
      pharmacological treatment.

      The investigators also aim to offer data on the natural history of MS evolution for distinct
      MS type patients and healthy controls, as this study is planned to collect data
      longitudinally.
