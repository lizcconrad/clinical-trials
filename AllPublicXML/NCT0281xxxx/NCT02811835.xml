    <textblock>
      Short-term (1-year) results of renal transplantation are now excellent (over 95%). Long-term
      (10-year and longer) results are, however, still disappointing. Where most research has
      focused on immunosuppression and infections, the investigators hypothesize that due to poor
      homeostatic capacity and necessary use of immunosuppressive and other drugs, renal transplant
      recipients are much more susceptible to poor dietary habits and exposure to potentially toxic
      contaminants than people of the general population, and that this contributes to accelerated
      function loss of the graft and excess risk of premature mortality, both contributing to poor
      long-term results. This study is a biobank and cohort study which investigates this
      hypothesis.

      Short-term (1-year) results of renal transplantation are now excellent (over 95%). Long-term
      (10-year and longer) results are, however, still disappointing. Where most research has
      focused on immunosuppression and infections, the investigators hypothesize that due to poor
      homeostatic capacity and necessary use of immunosuppressive and other drugs, renal transplant
      recipients are much more susceptible to poor dietary habits and exposure to potentially toxic
      contaminants than people of the general population, and that this contributes to accelerated
      function loss of the graft and excess risk of premature mortality, both contributing to poor
      long-term results.

      To investigate one part of this overarching hypothesis, the investigators wrote a project on
      around the specific topic of the relation between dietary acid load, ammoniagenesis and its
      potential influence on blood pressure. The investigators used this project to build a biobank
      and cohort in which they can test additional hypotheses on the relation between diet,
      contaminants and development of graft failure and the occurrence of mortality.

      The investigators also included 300 healthy controls to compare diet, contaminant exposure
      and biomarkers with the renal transplant recipients.
