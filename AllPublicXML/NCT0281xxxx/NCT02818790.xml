  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the MI field test is to assess users' overall satisfaction, usability and
      acceptability of the PRECIOUS system, and to explore if MI in combination with gamification
      principles is a feasible solution to foster adherence to PRECIOUS system. Moreover, it is
      pursued to trigger behavior change and build up motivation to maintain sustained change
      towards healthy lifestyles. The field test at University Hospital Vall d'Hebron will be
      carried out with morbidly obese pre-diabetic patients. This pilot test will serve to explore
      users' acceptance of PRECIOUS system in an early stage of its development. Considering that
      this is a pilot test, feedback and outcomes obtained will serve to refine and adjust PRECIOUS
      system concept and architecture.

  <detailed_description>

      The pilot test will recruit 30 morbidly obese pre-diabetic patient and they will be
      randomized into three groups: Group 1. Treatment as usual; Group 2. PRECIOUS system; Group 3.
      PRECIOUS system and Motivational Interviewing counseling. Researchers of this study will
      contact telephonically with potential participants and will ask for voluntary participation.
      Among those who agree, a face-to-face appointment at the reference hospital will be
      scheduled. In this appointment, general information on the study objectives and procedures
      will be offered.

      The length of intervention will be 3 months with the following scheduled follow-up
      appointments: week 2 (considering baseline as week 1), week 5, week 8 and week 12. In the
      follow-up appointments 2, 5 and 8, only doubts and questions regarding system use will be
      addressed (not specific measures will be collected). Two types of measures will be assessed:
      1) Primary outcome measures (at the end of the test) to assess usability, satisfaction,
      user's acceptance, and effectiveness of PRECIOUS system; and 2) Secondary outcome measures
      (baseline and final assessment) to assess different aspects of lifestyle and health habits.
      In addition, all patients will use a device to record heart rate during 3 consecutive days
      (week 1 and 12).
