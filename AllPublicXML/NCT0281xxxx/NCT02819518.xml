  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of two parts. In Part 1, the safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in
      combination with one of three different chemotherapies will be assessed in the treatment of
      locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which has
      not been previously treated with chemotherapy. In Part 2, the safety and efficacy of
      pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy will be assessed compared to the safety and efficacy of
      placebo plus chemotherapy in the treatment of locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic
      TNBC, which has not been previously treated with chemotherapy.

      The primary hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab and chemotherapy prolongs
      Progression-Free Survival (PFS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in all participants and
      in participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors, and prolongs
      Overall Survival (OS) compared to placebo and chemotherapy in all participants and in
      participants with PD-L1 positive tumors.
