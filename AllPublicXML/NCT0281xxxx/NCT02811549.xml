      The purpose of this feasibility study is to evaluate the benefit of unilateral implantation
      in adults who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in one ear, and up to
      moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the other ear (asymmetric hearing loss).

        Inclusion Criteria:

        General Requirements:

          -  Ability to provide Informed Consent

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  English language proficiency

          -  Willingness to participate in all scheduled procedures outlined in the study
             investigational plan

          -  Willingness to use an approved cochlear implant signal processing strategy in an
             everyday listening program during study

        Ear to be Implanted:

          -  Severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (&gt; 70 dB HL) as defined by the pure tone
             average for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz

          -  CNC word recognition score ≤30% (tested in subject's everyday listening condition for
             that ear)

          -  Duration of severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss (≥ 70 dB HL) &gt;3 months and
             ≤10 years in the ear to be implanted only

        Contralateral (non-implanted) ear:

          -  Up to a moderate sensorineural hearing loss (&lt;70 dB HL) as defined by the pure tone
             average for 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz

          -  CNC word recognition score &gt;30% (tested in subject's everyday listening condition for
             that ear)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous experience with a cochlear implant

          -  Cochlear malformation or obstruction (i.e. ossification) that would preclude full
             insertion of electrode array in the ear to be implanted

          -  Medical or psychological conditions that contraindicate surgery or impact the ability
             to manage an implanted device or the study related procedures as determined by the
             investigator

          -  Diagnosis of auditory neuropathy/dys-synchrony in either the ear to be implanted or
             the contralateral ear

          -  Active middle-ear disease/infection in the ear to be implanted

          -  Unrealistic expectations regarding potential benefits, risks and limitations inherent
             to implant surgical procedures as determined by the investigator

          -  Unwillingness or inability of subject to comply with all investigational requirements
             as determined by the investigator
