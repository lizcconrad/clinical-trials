      This quasi-experimental study with two groups design and pre-posttest method was conducted at
      Ahvaz University of Medical Sciences in 2014. About 100 Medical Students of in their third
      semester were recruited for the study based on census. Participants were divided into two
      intervention and control groups by using random sampling and Random Number Table List.
      Students in the control group were lectured in Anatomy using traditional lecture method.
      Whereas, students in the experimental group were taught Anatomy using concept map teaching
      method. Student's critical thinking was evaluated by examining&quot; Standard California Critical
      Thinking Skills Questionnaire&quot;
