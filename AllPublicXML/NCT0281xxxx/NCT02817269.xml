      The first aim of the study will be to identify the most common ReP pattern and compare its
      coincidence with that described by Travell and Simons. Second, the study aim will be to
      verify whether there are any significant differences by sex and types of technique used in
      regard to the ReP pattern of TrP 2 of the infraspinatus muscle, an area described as more
      sensitive.Finally, the third aim of the study will be to determine whether deep dry needling
      will evoke the LTR and ReP more easily than manual palpation.

      Patients will be recruited from a university's employee and student population by advertising
      at the university. Patients with shoulder complaints (described as pain felt in the shoulder
      or upper arm) will be randomly assigned to either an manual palpation or deep dry needling
      group. Participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups, a deep dry needling group and
      manual palpation group. Visual analogue scale (VAS), referred pain (ReP) pattern and features
      of referred pain of the infraspinatus muscle will be all assessed post-technique.

    <description>The participants from both groups will ask to report whether ReP is evoked and to describe the ReP pattern using an anatomical map of the upper half of the human body divided into eighteen areas. Nine areas corresponded to the anterior part of the body and the other nine to the posterior part of the body.</description>

    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for pain measures the amount of pain experienced by a subject on a continuum from 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 maximum pain.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>For the manual palpation group, the reference position will be a lateral position, lying on the non affected shoulder while the affected side will be explored. The arm and elbow are flexed 90° resting on a pillow and legs placed with 90° hip and knee flexion to stabilize the body, with the head resting on a pillow to maintain body alignment. The physiotherapist will be in front of the participant and carried out the examination with flat palpation using the thumb to identify soreness taut band tried to elicit local twitch response and referred pain in the infraspinatus area. First, three attempts will be made to elicit an local twitch response (LTR) using snapping palpation if a response will be obtained. After LRT, referred pain could also be evoked by palpation.</description>

The arm and elbow are flexed 90° resting on a pillow and legs placed with 90° hip and knee flexion to stabilize the body, with the head resting on a pillow to maintain body alignment. The physiotherapist will be in front of the participant and carried out the examination with flat palpation using the thumb to identify soreness taut before making the needle insertion. Sterile stainless steel needles (length 40mm/caliber 0.32 with a cylindrical plastic guide) will be used.</description>

    <intervention_name>Manual palpation</intervention_name>
    <description>The manual palpation level will kept constant by applying enough digital pressure to cause the finger nail bed to blanch. When the nail will be turn pale, the amount of pressure will be measured at approximately 3 4kg/cm2 and will be maintained for 5-10 seconds to evoke referred pain. A manual palpation referred pain will be present if the pain radiated far enough for the patient to feel more than just a local pain.</description>

    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Deep dry needling</intervention_name>
    <description>Intramuscular needling will be carried out via deep dry needling into myofascial trigger point (MTrP) area without the introduction any substances. The aim is to elicit a local twitch response upon inserting the needle into the MTrP area and perform a neurological stimulation (by rotating the needle 360 degrees) to more easily evoke referred pain, holding for 10 seconds and then extracting the needle gently. The procedure will be followed by one minute of haemostatic compression.</description>
