  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital clubfoot(CCF) is a kind of common congenital foot deformities in children. Though
      Ponseti method can cure most of the CCF patients, there are still part of patients can not
      get satisfactory recovery, especially those children classified as Dimeglio grade Ⅲ and Ⅳ.
      Carroll's technique is considered to be an ideal method of surgical treatment. But the
      postoperative scar is relatively large, and accordingly the postoperative complications is
      still common. Based on the clinical practice of the investigator's group, a modification of
      Carroll's technique, minimally invasive Carroll's technique, was applied. For the Dimeglio
      grade Ⅲ and Ⅳ CCF, the postoperative excellent and good rate was over 90%. Therefore, the
      investigator conducted a multicenter randomized controlled trial on treatment of congenital
      idiopathic clubfoot with minimally invasive Carroll's technique.
