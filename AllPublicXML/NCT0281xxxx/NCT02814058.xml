    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study of zolpidem hemitartarate orodispersible tablet 1.75 mg in fasting
      and postprandial administration. Sample size is 28 healthy volunteers, male and female, aged
      from 18 to 50 years old.

      This is an open-label, randomized, crossover study. Each volunteer will be randomized to one
      of the following sequencies:

      Sequency 1: zolpidem hemitartarate 1.75 mg in fasting (period 1) and zolpidem hemitartarate
      1.75 mg postprandial (period 2) Sequency 2: zolpidem hemitartarate 1.75 mg postprandial
      (period 1) and zolpidem hemitartarate 1.75 mg in fasting (period 2) Formulation will be
      administered in a single dose, orally in each period. Trial volunteers will be admitted in
      two different periods of 36 hours each, when investigational product will be administered and
      blood samples will be collected at pre-determined periods of time up to 24 hours for
      pharmacokinetics evaluation.

      Primary objective is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the new formulation of zolpidem
      hemitartarate orodispersible tablet 1.75 mg in healthy volunteers. As a secondary objective,
      it will be evaluated if there is any pharmacokinetics difference between genders.
