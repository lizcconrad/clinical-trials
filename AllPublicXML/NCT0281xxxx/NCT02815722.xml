  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center and cross-over study of SP2086 and Simvastatin in healthy adult volunteers. All
      subject were randomized into two groups, and the drugs will be administered according to the
      AB and BA sequences. The A sequence was that SP2086 was taken at 40mg qd on Day1-Day 10;
      Simvastatin will be administered orally (by mouth) as 200mg on Day 6-Day10.The B sequence was
      that Simvastatin was taken at 40mg qd on Day6-Day10. There were 5 days washout period between
      A and B. The total time of this trial was 27 days.
