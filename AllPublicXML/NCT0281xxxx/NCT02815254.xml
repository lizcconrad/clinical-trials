    <textblock>
      The focus of this project are elderly people who have experienced hip fracture and need at
      least two weeks rehabilitation after discharge from hospital. The aim is to increase the
      evidence-based knowledge base for planning and appropriate follow-up intervention for
      patients with hip fracture on short-term / rehabilitation stays. In this study the
      investigators want to explore whether training High Intensity Functional Exercises (HIFE) ,
      of short duration ie a 2- 4 week program and frequent intervention ie 5 times per week has a
      significant positive effect on physical function, pain and quality of life. The main aim is
      to explore whether a high intensive strength and balance training program has better effect
      than a low intensive strength and balance training program on functional status measured by
      Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) in patients with hip fractures. Another aims is to
      explore whether this high intensive strength and balance training program has better effect
      than a 'low intensive strength and balance training program' on pain, endurance and quality
      of life measured respectively Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPR), 6-minute walk test and SF-36.
      The study is a randomized controlled trial.
