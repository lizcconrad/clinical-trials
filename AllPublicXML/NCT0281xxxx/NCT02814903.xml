  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a major and frequent complication occurring
      after cardiac surgery, contributing to prolonged intensive care and hospital stays and is
      associated with several cardiovascular complications. The exact mechanisms and signaling
      pathways involved in the development of POAF seem to be multifactorial and remain to date
      incompletely understood. β-blockers and amiodarone are the first line preventive drugs but
      are partially effective and near 30% of POAF resist to these strategies. In this context,
      there is some evidence indicating that renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and Galectin-3
      (Gal-3) share signaling pathways in the development of cardiac fibrosis and therefore could
      be very useful predictive biomarkers of POAF and potentially interesting therapeutic target
      to prevent POAF occurrence.

      The investigators hypothesis is that preoperative plasma aldosterone levels and galectin-3
      (Gal-3) expression (in plasma, right atrial appendage or epicardial fat) could be predictive
      of POAF in patients undergoing elective CABG surgery with preserved LVEF.

        collection of human tissues (right atrial appendage, subcutaneous and epicardial fat) and
        blood collection, was obtained from the Ethics Committee of Caen University Hospital
        (Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord-Ouest III, Caen, France) and will be in accordance
        to the declaration of Helsinki; the details of the study will be explained to the subjects,
        and written informed consent will be obtained from each patient.
