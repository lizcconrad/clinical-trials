  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two period cross-over study randomizing patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery
      into 2 different groups: group 1 in which patients receive &quot;deep neuromuscular blockade&quot; in
      the beginning portion of their laparoscopic surgery followed by a period of &quot;moderate
      blockade&quot; and, group 2 in which patients receive &quot;moderate neuromuscular blockade&quot; in the
      beginning portion of their laparoscopic surgery followed by a period of &quot;deep blockade&quot;. The
      deep neuromuscular block is defined as post tetanic count of 1 to 2 and the moderate
      neuromuscular block is defined as 1-2 twitches. In all patients, sugammadex is used to
      reverse the block at the end of surgery in order to obtain optimal extubating conditions.

    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is frequently utilized in laparoscopic procedures to improve
      surgical conditions by relaxing the abdominal muscles and thus facilitating insufflation with
      carbon dioxide to optimize surgical view. Increased airway pressures can lead to an increase
      in alveolar and perivascular edema, a decline in dynamic lung compliance and hypoxemia.

      Several studies have investigated surgical view under deep vs. moderate neuromuscular
      blockade. Literature supports deep neuromuscular blockade providing better operating
      conditions/view by a surgeon and low airway pressures but, potentially, longer duration to
      extubation and worse respiratory mechanics at the end of anesthesia versus moderate
      neuromuscular blockade which shows worse operating conditions/view by a surgeon and worse
      airway pressures but possibly shorter duration to extubation and better respiratory mechanics
      at the end of anesthesia.

      Thus, there is clearly equipoise with regard to the comparative effectiveness of deep vs
      medium NMB. Therefore, this study is designed to ascertain if a deep neuromuscular block will
      decrease the airway pressures in patients undergoing laparoscopic procedures compared to
      those under a moderate block. A reduction in airway pressures may lead to a decrease in the
      complications associated with elevated airway pressures including hypoxemia, total static
      lung compliance, alveolar edema, and long term morbidity. Additionally, the study aims to
      determine if time from administration of sugammadex to reversal is different between patients
      that have a moderate NMB as compared to a deep NMB.

    <description>After induction and intubation, the patient will be maintained in a &quot;deep&quot; (post-tetanic count, one or two twitches) neuromuscular block (NMB), obtained with an intubating dose of rocuronium of 0.6 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion. The initial infusion rate will be set at 0.6 mg/kg/h. To minimize any type of carry-over effects, after the completion of the deep NMB 20 minute period, a &quot;transition period&quot; of approximately 10-15 minutes will begin. During this &quot;transition period&quot; the rocuronium infusion will be paused and the Train of Four (TOF) monitor will be set to every 1-2 min. Once the patient has achieved a &quot;moderate&quot; NMB state (one to two twitches), the infusion of the muscle relaxant will be resumed at a low dose to maintain the patient at this level of blockade.</description>
