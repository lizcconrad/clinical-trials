    <textblock>
      This Phase III, multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled study is designed to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of the anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab
      compared with docetaxel in participants with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have
      progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen. Treatment may continue until
      disease progression, loss of clinical benefit, or unacceptable toxicity.
