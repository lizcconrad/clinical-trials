      The purpose of the study is to investigate the potential interaction between SP2086 and
      Glyburide after the singe and multiple oral doses treatment in healthy adult volunteers
      respectively.

      This is an open-label (volunteers will know the names of treatments they are assigned)
      single-center and cross-over study of SP2086 and Glyburide in healthy adult volunteers. All
      subject were randomized into two groups, and the drugs will be administered according to the
      AB and BA sequences.The A sequence was that Glyburide was taken at 5mg qd dose on
      Days1,4,5,6,7 and 8; SP2086 will be administered orally (by mouth) as 200mg on Days 8.The B
      sequence was that SP2086 was taken at 200mg qd dose on Days1,4,5,6,7 and 8; Glyburide will be
      administered orally (by mouth) as 200mg on Days 8.
