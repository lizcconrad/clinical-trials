      PHYSALYS is an observational multicenter study. It's an analytical study comparing 2 groups:
      patients exposed to physical activity and unexposed. The main objective of the study is to
      compare the evolution of glomerular filtration rate at inclusion and 12 months later between
      patients practicing physical activity and patients not practicing. If necessary, the renal
      disease-related complications, which are not influenced by physical activity: (type of kidney
      disease, age and tobacco), would be taken into account. TIRCEL patients with chronic kidney
      disease (CKD) at stages 3, 4 or 5 can be included in the study. Their serum creatinine data,
      12 months prior to inclusion, is collected retrospectively. Patients are followed in the
      trial during 12 months. To evaluate physical activity, patients respond to Global Physical
      Activity Questionnaire 2 (GPAQ2) at inclusion and 12 months later. During this 12 months
      period, the same biological data are collected prospectively.

    <description>The practice of physical activity is measured by the GPAQ 2 questionnaire (Global Physical Activity Questionnaire)
A patient is defined as practicing physical activity (exposed) when he meets one of the conditions following:
At least 20 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity for at least 3 days per week
At least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or walking daily for at least 5 days per week
At least 5 days of walking and moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity achieving at least 600 MET-minutes per week.
The Metabolic equivalents (MET) is the ratio of metabolic rate during activity physical and metabolic rate at rest. One MET corresponds to the energy spent by a person sitting still and is equivalent to a consumption of 1 kcal / kg / hour. It is estimated that a moderately active person has an energetic cost four times higher, and a very active person eight times higher than the energy cost of a person sitting without move.</description>
