    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to use 11C-acetate PET/CT to preliminarily test and validate methods
      for imaging astrocyte activation as an early indicator of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's
      disease (AD). 11C-Acetate PET/CT has been shown to quantify astrocyte activation in vivo, but
      no reports have evaluated its potential in AD. The investigators propose to test 11C-Acetate
      PET/CT as a marker for astrocyte activation associated with pathologic amyloid deposition in
      AD. The investigators will compare binding between subjects with early stage AD and healthy
      controls. Further, the investigators will investigate the correlation between amyloid and
      acetate binding. If the investigators find increased astrocyte activation in response to
      cerebral amyloid by showing a group difference in brain acetate uptake between disease and
      controls or a strong correlation between acetate and amyloid PET/CT binding. Validating
      neuroinflammation markers in AD ultimately may guide therapeutic modulation of beneficial and
      damaging neuroinflammation to slow disease progression, as well as providing new insights
      into AD pathophysiology.

    <description>Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (up to 14) will be recruited primarily from the Penn Memory Center (PMC). Clinical diagnostic criteria (described in further detail in Study Procedures section) will be used to identify subjects who are meet criteria for amnestic MCI. Participants will receive injection of radioactive tracer 11C-acetate and complete a PET/CT scan.</description>

    <description>Normal control subjects in the same age range (up to 6) will be recruited from a current ongoing study investigating neuroinflammation in late life depression and healthy controls, from the control group in which all subjects receive MRI and LP and from the PMC research cohort. Participants will receive injection of radioactive tracer 11C-acetate and complete a PET/CT scan.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria for amnestic MCI cohort:

          1. Participants will be at least 65 years of age

          2. Positive brain amyloid PET/CT scan within 6 months of study screening

          3. Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) score â‰¥ 24 at screening visit

          4. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of
             11C-Acetate PET/CT and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study
             analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as a part of
             this study

          5. Participants must identify a study partner who is willing to accompany the patient to
             study visits

          6. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures. If the patient is unable to provide informed consent,
             the patient's legal representative may consent on behalf of the patient but the
             patient will be asked to confirm assent.

        Inclusion Criteria for Control cohort:

          1. Participants will be at least 65 years of age

          2. History of negative brain amyloid PET/CT scan within 6 months of study screening OR
             negative CSF analysis for AD biomarkers within 6 months of study screening

          3. Mini-mental status examination (MMSE) &gt; 27 at screening visit

          4. A brain MRI is required. If a brain MRI has been performed within 6 months of
             enrollment to this study and of adequate quality that scan may be used for the study
             analysis, subjects who do not have a brain MRI will undergo a brain MRI as a part of
             this study

          5. Participants must be informed of the investigational nature of this study and provide
             written informed consent in accordance with institutional and federal guidelines prior
             to study-specific procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria for both cohorts:

          1. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to imaging procedures (PET/CT or MRI) in the
             opinion of an investigator or treating physician

          2. History of stroke or other neurological disease that in the opinion of the
             investigator might interfere with evaluation of the 11C-Acetate scan

          3. Any medical or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would compromise the subject's safety or successful participation in the study.
