  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      After the use of DNA chips for diagnostic purposes, high-throughput sequencing (HTS) is
      transforming the field of developmental diseases, from fundamental research to care.
      Nonetheless, before HTS can be transferred to everyday clinical practice, in particular for
      expert diagnosis using exome HTS, it is necessary to anticipate the nature of the information
      to be given to patients and to parents in order to obtain consent for exome HTS.

      The objective in terms of public health is to allow patients with rare diseases to benefit
      from innovative technologies in optimal conditions of information and accompaniment.

      the objectives of this project are to

        1. evaluate the preferences of families of patients with development disorders as regard to
           suspicious and incidental findings from HTS before its introduction for diagnostic
           purpose,

        2. and then, following the exome analyses carried out for diagnostic purposes, describe,
           analyse and understand the experience, expectations and reactions of families and
           geneticists concerning the diagnostic trajectory in general and at the time the results
           of the HTS were announced in particular A methodology that associated quantitative and
           qualitative approaches was chosen so as to combine the advantages and overcome the
           shortcomings of each: a quantitative study to investigate a large number of patients,
           which would ensure a certain representativeness of the population and allow sub-groups
           analyses to study the upstream phase concerning indications for high-throughput
           sequencing; and a qualitative study, which though it allows only a small number of
           patients to be investigated, makes it possible to describe, analyze and understand in
           depth the complex downstream phenomena of high-throughput sequencing results
