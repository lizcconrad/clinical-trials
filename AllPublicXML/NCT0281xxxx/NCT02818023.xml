  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to treat patients with pembrolizumab and thus blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 axis
      would render tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor parenchyma more functional as
      a consequence of BRAF inhibition, such that T cell activation by BRAFi would not be dampened
      by the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction. This combination would reverse dysfunction among T cells in
      the tumor parenchyma, maximizing T cell mediated immune anti-tumor efficacy. Progression free
      survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-001 was 57% at 6 months, and 46.4% in the more
      recently reported phase III trial. PFS with vemurafenib treatment in BRIM-3 was ~50% at 6
      months. Combined treatment with pembrolizumab, cobimetinib and vemurafenib for BRAF mutant
      melanoma is hypothesized to be safe and to improve the PFS compared to these recent
      historical controls. Because this combination has not yet been tested, and because the
      primary objective is to assess safety, the investigators are staging accrual in the first
      phase of the trial. The study aims to accrue up to 50 patients to the mTPI design of this
      study with the expectation that there will be at least 30 patients treated at RP2D. In case
      there are less than 30 patients on the RP2D, additional patients will be accrued. Patients
      will continue to receive treatment with pembrolizumab, vemurafenib and cobimetinib until
      disease progression or dose limiting toxicity. Patients with treatment response and no dose
      limiting toxicity may receive treatment with pembrolizumab for up to 24 months.
