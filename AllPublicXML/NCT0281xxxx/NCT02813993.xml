  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has shown that young people that want to have children have low fertility
      knowledge. This study evaluates the efficacy of a video intervention on fertility knowledge,
      on changes in lifestyle and on the decision to start to get pregnant.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the efficacy of a video intervention versus control (no video) in
      couples that intend to have children in the next three years. The couples will be randomized
      to the two groups. The video contains information concerning age-related fertility decline,
      fertility risk factors, the success of infertility treatments, and emotional consequences of
      childlessness.
