  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely low birth weight (ELBW), birth weight less than or equal to 1000 g, infants are at
      high risk for developing brain injury in the first week of life. Intraventricular hemorrhage
      (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) are the most common injuries in this group of
      infants. Their incidence is inversely proportional to gestational age (GA) and birth weight
      (BW). These lesions are associated with neurodevelopmental delay, poor cognitive performance,
      visual and hearing impairment, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy; and instability of systemic
      hemodynamics during transition from intra- to extra-uterine life and during the early
      neonatal period is believed to be at their genesis. While the incidence of ultrasound-
      diagnosed cystic PVL has decreased dramatically over the last 2 decades, diffuse PVL detected
      by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still prevalent in survivors of neonatal intensive
      care. Moreover, PVL, even when non-cystic, is associated with decreased cortical complexity
      and brain volume and eventual neurocognitive impairment.

      Currently, clinicians lack the tools to detect changes in cerebral perfusion prior to
      irreversible injury. Unfortunately, the incidence of brain injury in ELBW infants has
      remained relatively stable. Once translated to the bedside, the goal of this research is to
      develop a monitoring system that will allow researchers to identify infants most at risk for
      IVH and PVL and in the future, intervention studies will be initiated to use the changes in
      cerebral perfusion to direct hemodynamic management.

      The purpose of this study is to first understand the physiology of brain injury and then to
      eventually impact the outcomes in this high-risk group of infants by assessing the ability of
      the diastolic closing margin (DCM), a non-invasive estimate of brain perfusion pressure, to
      predict hemorrhagic and ischemic brain injury in ELBW infants. The information collected for
      this study will help develop algorithms or monitoring plans that will maintain the
      appropriate brain perfusion pressure and thereby, prevent severe brain injury.

      This is a prospective, single-center, data collection research study for premature ELBW
      infants at high risk of developing brain injury. This study is being done to evaluate the
      changes in brain perfusion measured by the DCM using a comprehensive and innovative brain
      monitoring platform that encompasses direct and continuous measures of cerebral blood flow
      (CBF), cerebral oximetry, cerebral autoregulation, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2),
      and arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the hopes to both describe the physiology of brain
      injury and to correlate these findings to short- and long-term outcomes relevant to ELBW
      infants.

      About three hundred and ten (310) subjects are expected to be enrolled. Subjects' active
      participation in the study may last up to one week and the total time they will be followed
      after birth is approximately 24 months (2 years) depending on their prematurity. Information
      from the subjects' medical records may be accessed, reviewed, and recorded for an additional
      year after their final study visit. This study consists of about 5 study visits: Study Visit
      1 (the enrollment visit), Study Visit 2 (occurs 2-7 days after the enrollment visit), Study
      Visit 3 (occurs approximately 2-4 months after the enrollment visit), Study Visit 4 (occurs
      approximately at 12 months after the enrollment visit), and Study Visit 5 (occurs
      approximately at 24 months after the enrollment visit).

      STUDY ASSESSMENTS:

        -  Medical and Surgical History: The subjects' detailed history will be reviewed and
           recorded. The subjects' mothers will also be asked questions about their own medical
           history. The mothers' medical records may also be accessed.

        -  Continuous Physiologic Monitoring: Monitoring will be performed that includes the
           transcranial Doppler ultrasound, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and partial pressure
           of carbon dioxide (PCO2) from birth to 7 days of life (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Ventilator: The highest daily ventilator settings and mean airway pressure (MAP) will be
           reviewed and recorded from birth to 7 days of life (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Head Ultrasound: A head ultrasound will be performed upon enrollment (visit 1) to assess
           for early and preexisting brain injury (IVH).

        -  Adverse Events: Any adverse events (AEs), special events of interest, or unanticipated
           problems (UPs) that subjects may have experienced after enrollment will be reviewed and
           recorded (visits 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).

        -  Concomitant Medications: Review and record any medications of interest that subjects are
           taking from birth to 7 days of life (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Blood Transfusions: Review and record the transfusion of blood products that are
           performed on the subjects as part of standard of care from birth to 7 days of life
           (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Echocardiogram (ECG) and Head Ultrasound: Review and record ECG and head ultrasound
           results that are performed on the subjects as part of standard of care from birth to 7
           days of life (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Respiratory Interventions and Suctioning: Review and record any respiratory
           interventions and/or suctioning that are performed on the subjects as part of standard
           of care from birth to 7 days of life (visits 1 and 2).

        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): Perform a MRI exam at visit 3.

        -  Capute Scales and Neurologic Exam: Perform this assessment at visit 4 to assess the
           subjects' development and cognitive function and to provide an early evaluation for any
           neurologic abnormalities that may be related to brain injury.

        -  Bayley-III Motor Sub-Test Exam: Perform this assessment at visit 4 to assess the
           subjects' development and cognitive function and to provide an early evaluation for any
           neurologic abnormalities that may be related to brain injury.

        -  Complete Bayley-III Exam: Perform this assessment at visit 5 to assess the subjects'
           development and cognitive function and to provide an early evaluation for any neurologic
           abnormalities that may be related to brain injury.
