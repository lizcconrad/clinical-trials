    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Ametropic or irregular cornea subjects who need to wear spectacle lens or contact lens
             in their daily life.

          -  Is of age at least 20 years old and no older than 65 years old capacity to volunteer.

          -  Has read and signed the Informed Consent Form or waiver. (4) Has myopia or hyperopia
             -20.00D～+20.00D, astigmatism -0.25~-4.00D, or presbyopia +1.00D～+3.50D.

          -  Irregular cornea subjects include keratoconus, high astigmatism (&gt;-4.00D) or
             post-refractive surgery patients.

          -  No active ocular disease, infection or any disorder of eyelids and conjunctiva.

          -  Has reasonable expectation of improvement in visual acuity with the test lenses.

          -  Is willing and able to follow subject instructions and meet the protocol -specified
             visit schedule. (If subjects missed any visit, they must be discontinued from the
             study.) (9) Agrees to wear the test lenses at a daily wear basis. (10) Willing to
             adapt wearing GP contact lens.

        Exclusion criteria:

        The subject is ineligible for entry into the study if the subject

          -  Has any systemic disease affecting ocular health.

          -  Is using any systemic or topical medications that will, in the Investigator's opinion.
             Affect ocular physiology or lens performance within one (1) week before entering this
             study.

          -  Has an active ocular disease or has ever used systemic steroid or any other medicine
             that may affect significant on vision or healing.

          -  Has any Grade 2 or greater finding listed in the Quantification of Slit Lamp
             Observations Form. Subjects with corneal infiltrates, however, of ANY GRADE, are not
             eligible.

          -  Has any &quot;Present&quot; finding listed in the Quantification of Slit Lamp Observations that,
             in the Investigators' judgment, interferes with contact lens wear.

          -  Has any scar or neovascularization within the central 4mm of the cornea. Subjects with
             minor peripheral corneal scarring that, in the Investigator's judgment, does not
             interfere with contact lens wear are eligible for this study.

          -  Severe dry eye (Schirmer Test&lt;5mm/5min)

          -  Corneal keratitis

          -  Is aphakic

          -  Had undertaken the following surgery: Retina, Glaucoma, Cataract surgery.

          -  Is amblyopic, BSCVA can't achieve (include) 20/40(0.5) when wear trial lenses.

          -  Allergy to contact lens solution.

          -  ls participating in any other clinical research study.

          -  Pregnancy or Breast-feeding.
