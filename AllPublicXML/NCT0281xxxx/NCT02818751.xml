      Neurofunctional Predictors of Escitalopram Treatment Response in Adolescents with Anxiety. To
      determine the effects of escitalopram on functional activation patterns during a Continuous
      Performance Task with Emotional and Neutral Distracters, the CPT-END. To examine baseline
      functional activity and functional connectivity profiles in the ventrolateral prefrontal
      cortex as markers of subsequent treatment response to escitalopram in adolescents with
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). To use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS) to
      examine glutamatergic and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-related abnormalities in the anterior
      cingulate in adolescents with GAD as compared to healthy adolescents.

      The long-term goal of this study is to explore the neurobiological basis of generalized
      anxiety disorder (GAD) using a validated functional MRI (fMRI) paradigm and functional
      connectivity analyses with a cohort of GAD patients and healthy subjects and generating
      feasibility and preliminary data regarding treatment-related effects of escitalopram on brain
      functional activation and Fc patterns in pediatric GAD. An additional goal is to identify
      biological markers in saliva and urine that will predict treatment response in pediatric
      subjects with GAD. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that core dysfunction within
      the prefrontal-amygdala network, which the investigators and others have observed in GAD,
      will be normalized by successful treatment. The rationale underlying this hypothesis is that,
      despite the high prevalence of GAD, there is a need to understand its neurobiology and to
      identify biomarkers of treatment response and the mechanisms by which selective serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) putatively effect changes in the neurocircuitry of pediatric GAD.
