  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), is the leading cause of maternal mortality and is responsible
      for approximately 25% of maternal mortality deaths.It is defined as blood loss in excess of
      500 ml following vaginal childbirth. Primary (immediate) PPH occurs within the first 24 hours
      after delivery.

      In clinical practice, if after giving birth, the placenta is not expelled naturally, an
      active management should be triggered. After obstetric maneuvers therapeutic, options begin
      with uterotonic treatments before considering invasive treatments such as embolization,
      vessel ligation and hysterectomy. However, the morbidity associated with these techniques and
      the desire to preserve fertility mean that new therapeutic solutions have been conceived,
      which has recently led to the development of an innovative intrauterine hemostasis medical
      device : a hemostatic intrauterine suction cup.

      Assuming that postpartum hemorrhages are mainly due to uterine atony, we propose in this
      biomedical research, the study of a new medical device. Our hypothesis is that the uterine
      walls will append to the walls of the suction cup after the latter is put under vacuum. The
      actuation of the suction cup will lead to the aspiration of all sides of the uterus.

      In this study, as a first pass in human of this innovative non CE marked medical device, we
      aim to demonstrate the feasibility of using the hemostatic intrauterine suction cup for
      patients who present primary PPH (blood loss ≥ 500ml) after a vaginal delivery requiring
      administration of Nalador®. We will evaluate its placement in the uterus, the application of
      vacuum and its removal from the uterus.

    <description>The primary outcome is composite and consists of 3 the following component outcomes:
Qualification of success or failure of the introduction of the suction cup in the uterine cavity
Qualification of success or failure to create negative pressure in the suction cup. The negative pressure is validated if vacuum is maintained for at least 30 seconds.
Qualification of success or failure of removing the suction cup in its entirety.
The feasibility of using the suction cup will be validated if success is obtained for the 3 component outcomes.</description>
