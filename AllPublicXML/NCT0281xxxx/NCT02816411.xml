  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators utilized protein supplementation over an 8-day period
      following eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage in order to test the initial hypotheses :
      i) protein supplementation after exercise-induced muscle injury affects exercise-induced
      aseptic inflammation and muscle performance.

      The objective was to examine weather protein supplementation is able to affect the
      inflammatory response as well as recovery of muscle performance following an intense
      eccentric exercise protocol. In a double-blind, counterbalanced design, 14 men received
      either Placebo (PLA) or milk protein isolate (PRO) for 8 consecutive days following a single
      bout of exercise (300 eccentric contractions at 30 deg/sec). In both conditions, performance
      was assessed at baseline, immediately post-exercise, 2h post-exercise and daily for 8
      consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 2h post-exercise and daily for
      the remaining 8 days. Muscle biopsies from vastus lateralis were collected at baseline as
      well as at day 2 and day 8 of the post-exercise period.
