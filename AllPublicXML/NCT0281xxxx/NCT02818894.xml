  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia is commonly used in patients undergoing total hip replacements. The purpose
      of this study is to compare lidocaine to bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in patients having a
      total hip arthroplasty (THA). The objective of this study is to compare the two spinal
      anesthesia treatments in regards to transient neurological symptoms (TNS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have their patient records examined prospectively and complete up to four
      telephone questionnaires after randomization to lidocaine or bupivacaine spinal anesthesia to
      see how they are feeling after their total hip arthroplasty (THA). Transient neurological
      symptoms, urinary retention, timing of full mobilization, incidence of hypotension, and
      length of hospital stay will be recorded for both methods of spinal anesthesia for
      comparison.

    <description>Following a prepared questionnaire, the study team member will ask about symptoms of TNS and pain not associated with the operation area. The subject will be asked to specify the location of the symptoms and grade the complaints after a verbal analogue scale from 0 to 10, with zero as no discomfort and ten as unbearable discomfort. Scores between the two study arms will indicate if there's a difference in TNS after surgery between lidocaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in THA patients.</description>

    <measure>Time of First Voiding after recovery from spinal anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day Post-Operation to 3 Days Post-Operation</time_frame>
    <description>Urine retention will be captured through the use of an intermittent catheter or foley catheterization and data obtained through review of the inpatient records. Additionally, subjects will be asked for the time of their first voiding by a study team member.
Average times between the two study arms will indicate if there's a difference in urinary retention after surgery between lidocaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in THA patients.</description>

    <measure>Timing of ambulation after recovery from spinal anesthesia</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day Post-Operation to 3 Days Post-Operation</time_frame>
    <description>Following a prepared questionnaire, the study team member will ask the participant about the time to full mobilization. Additional data regarding timing of ambulation during hospital stay will be obtained from the participant's inpatient medical chart.
Average times between the two study arms will indicate if there's a difference in timing of ambulation after surgery between lidocaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in THA patients.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of hypotension</measure>
    <time_frame>1 Day Post-Operation to 3 Days Post-Operation</time_frame>
    <description>Hypotension is defined as systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg Vitals are obtained by the study team member from reviewing the inpatient medical chart.
Average systolic blood pressure readings between the two study arms will indicate if there's a difference in incidence of hypotension between lidocaine and bupivacaine spinal anesthesia in THA patients.</description>
