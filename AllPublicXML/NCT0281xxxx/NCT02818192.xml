  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the project is to elucidate the primary bio-psycho-social (BPS) risk
      factors for albuminuria in youth with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and the mechanisms by which they
      cause renal injury. The Study Aims include:

        1. Characterize the primary BPS risk factors associated with prevalent and progressive
           albuminuria in youth with T2D.

        2. Determine individual, family and community level factors that influence biological and
           psychological risk factors and behaviors (adherence) that could be modified to protect
           against prevalent and progressive albuminuria.

        3. Determine if systemic and renal inflammation is the common pathway through which BPS
           risk factors lead to albuminuria in youth with T2D.

      Study Hypotheses include:

        1. Biological factors (poor glycemic control and systolic ambulatory hypertension), and
           psychological and social adversity (stress, mental distress and poverty) are significant
           predictors of prevalent and progressive albuminuria in youth with T2D.

        2. Community and family support will be negatively associated with stress, and a lower risk
           of both prevalent and progressive albuminuria.

        3. Systemic and renal inflammation is the common pathway through which BPS risk factors
           lead to albuminuria in youth with T2D.

      The investigators will conduct a case-control study within a two-year, prospective
      observational cohort study of 400 prevalent cases of T2D diagnosed &lt;18 years of age. The
      investigators will evaluate the primary BPS risk factors associated with prevalent
      albuminuria using a principal component analysis (PCA) of associations between primary
      exposure variables at enrollment. After confirming the relevant BPS factors in the PCA
      analysis, the investigators will utilize a structural equation modeling approach to confirm
      the developed model.

    <description>Change in albumin excretion over 2 years. The change in albumin:creatinine ratio, treated as a continuous outcome measure was selected as a valid evaluation of progression of renal injury over time.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) over time.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be exploratory as significant changes are not expected during a 2-year follow-up period. However, as GFR reflects actual kidney function, this outcome will become increasingly important as chronic kidney disease (CKD) progresses in the cohort over time. GFR will be determined with serum creatinine measurements, utilizing a new eGFR formula for overweight youth, which have been validated utilizing iohexol GFR data from the initial cohort.
eGFR will be calculated with the pediatric Schwartz formula and iCARE equation. This equation was previously validated for use in the iCARE cohort.</description>

      Serum, plasma, random urine and buffy coat for DNA extraction will be collected at the
      baseline visit on all recruited patients that consent to biobanking such that future
      ancillary studies can be performed. Samples will be processed and frozen at -80 Â°C, and will
      be stored for up to 25 years with participant consent. Tests that may be run on stored
      samples include metabolomics, peptidomics, proteomics, and podocyte microparticle analyses
      should additional funding be obtained. Samples will be collected at each site and frozen.
      Periodically samples will be sent to the Canadian Biosample Repository at the University of
      Alberta for long term storage.
