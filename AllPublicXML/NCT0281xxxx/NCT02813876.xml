        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Acute pancreatitis confirmed by clinical history, serologic testing and/or
             radiographic imaging

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Severe acute pancreatitis defined as the presence of any of the following:

               -  Organ failure (oxygen saturation&lt;90% on room air, mean arterial pressure&lt;70 mmHG
                  or any requirement for vasopressor or inotropic support, serum creatinine&gt;2.0,
                  Glasgow coma score&lt;15)

               -  Suspected or confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis: fever, leukocytosis in the
                  setting of suspicious findings on cross-sectional imaging (gas within necrotic
                  collection) or confirmed infection on fine needle aspirate

                    -  Chronic pancreatitis or any chronic pain syndrome requiring use of narcotic
                       analgesic within 30 days prior to hospitalization

                    -  Abdominal surgery within 60 days prior to hospitalization

                    -  History of gastrointestinal motility disorder

                    -  Inflammatory bowel disease

                    -  Chronic comorbid illness including but not limited to &gt;New York Heart
                       Association Class II congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, oxygen-dependent
                       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or malignancy other than non-squamous
                       skin cancer not in remission.

                    -  Documented allegy to any of the following medications: dilaudid, Tylenol

                    -  Patients transferred from an outside hospital for ongoing care

                    -  Non-English speaking patients for whom an appropriate language interpretor
                       cannot be identified.

                    -  Pregnant women will be excluded from participation in this phase IIb trial
                       given the limited projected sample size and rarity of this condition during
                       pregnancy.

                    -  Minors (patients &lt;18 years of age) will not be eligible for study inclusion.
                       The interventions being compared in the study protocol are standard care for
                       adult patients with acute pancreatitis. However, the safety and efficacy of
                       these treatments in the pediatric population has not been established.
