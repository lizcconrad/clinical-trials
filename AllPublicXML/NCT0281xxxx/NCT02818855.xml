  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession (GR) is frequently associated with deterioration in dental esthetics and
      dental hypersensitivity. Outcomes from recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that when
      the root is covered and the gain in the width of keratinized tissue (KT) is expected, the use
      of subepithelial connective tissue grafts (SCTGs) associated with coronally advanced flaps
      (CAF) appears to be more predictable, and may be considered the gold standard procedure.
      However, the SCTGs may increase patients' morbidity (e.g., pain). This occurs because of the
      need for a donor surgical area, which may increase the risk of surgical complications like
      bleeding, as well as increases post-operative discomfort and the period of the surgical
      procedure. Another biomaterial, a new collagen matrix (CM) has been used as a substitute for
      the SCTG. The use of CM was associated with a significant reduction in post-operative
      morbidity, less post-operative pain and discomfort in the patient, and more esthetic
      satisfaction.
