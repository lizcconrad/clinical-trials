    <textblock>
      The suture of the supraspinatus tendon is a common surgery that requires physical therapy for
      back pain and functional impairment to such surgery. Kinesiotaping technique (KT) is being
      used to treat myofascial trigger points that appear after surgery and for the treatment of
      physiotherapy in the supraspinatus muscle and deltoid.

      To evaluate the effectiveness of KT technique over the technique of Jones
      (Straincounterstrain or SCS) in patients undergoing suture the tendon of the supraspinatus
      muscle.

      Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of the KT technique against Jones
      (Strain-Counterstrain or SCS) technique in patients with the suture of the tendon of the
      supraspinatus muscle.

      Design: Test clinically controlled, randomized, masking of intervention by double placebo and
      blind to the subject of the essay and the Studio analyst.

      METHOD: Patients with supraspinatus tendon suture are randomly divided into two groups: a
      group treated with KT (n = 18) and other treated with SCS (n = 18). The treatment was applied
      the 1st, 4th and 8th day of physical therapy session. All patients were evaluated the 1st and
      the 12th day of the session with the visual analog scale of pain (VAS), with the scale of
      Disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) to assess the functionality and active
      direction-finding (ROM) to assess travel articulate.
