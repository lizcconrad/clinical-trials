  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Pilates Method (PM) has been widely used in the daily practice of many professionals. It
      is well known that anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) have a strong relation with the
      improvement in performance through motor control improvement. However, no studies have
      investigate the PM exercises performed with pelvis in different positions on the improvement
      of performance, APAs and these influences on motor control. This study aims to compare the
      effects of practicing a single session of Pilates-based therapeutic exercises with posterior
      pelvic tilt and neutral position of the pelvis on the APAs of elderly subjects.
