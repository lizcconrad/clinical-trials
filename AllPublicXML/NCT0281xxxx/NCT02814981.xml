  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On 04/30/2015, ANSM (the National Security Agency of Medicines and Health Products) shared an
      information for general practicioners, pediatricians, anesthesiologists, dermatologists,
      geriatricians, psychiatrists, community pharmacists and hospital about using hydroxyzine and
      the associated risk of QT prolongation on the electrocardiogram.

      Drugs containing hydroxyzine (the best known and most used is the AtaraxÂ®) are used in France
      in various indications including the treatment of minor manifestations of anxiety,
      premedication with general anesthesia and the symptomatic treatment of urticaria.

      A prolonged QT interval is a known risk factor for occurrence of torsades de pointes which
      can cause sudden death. We distinguish congenital and acquired long QT interval. The main
      cause of acquired long QT interval is a drug inhibition of the HERG potassium channel 1. Many
      drugs have been reported to cause sudden death by prolongation of QT interval and occurrence
      of torsades de pointes (macrolides, anti -arythmics, some psychotropic ...) The molecules
      based on hydroxyzine are known to be at risk of prolongation of QT interval in an
      experimental point of view but is not clearly identified in daily clinical practice.
      Pharmacology unit of Caen was the first to publish a case of QT prolongation under
      hydroxyzine . Through this publication, associated with other clinical data, hydroxyzine has
      been added to the list of drugs that can induce QT prolongation .

      Despite these recent recommendations, it does not seem that hydroxyzine prescriptions were
      changed daily and therefore the risk of QT prolongation persists. We therefore propose the
      study of the impact of hydroxyzine on the QT interval measured on the electrocardiogram in
      patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Caen.

        All Patients hospitalized in Caen University Hospital with a prescription of hydroxyzine
        drug.

        From there, after informing the patient, we will collect the measurement of QT interval
        before introducing hydroxyzine and the same measure will be performed again on the 3rd day.

        QT will be corrected by heart rate by Bazett's formula (the most commonly used) and
        Fridericcia (most reliable). Reproducibility of analyzes inter and intra-individual will be
        carried out to ensure the reliability of the measurements.
