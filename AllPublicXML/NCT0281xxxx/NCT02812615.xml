      This is a community-based intervention study which will be undertaken at Mirpur, Dhaka,
      Bangladesh. Participants will be recruited from two age groups: a child cohort (age 12 to 18
      months) and an adult cohort (age 18 to 45 years). The child cohort will consist of stunted
      children (length for age Z score, LAZ &lt; -2), children who are at risk of stunting (length for
      age Z score &lt;-1 to -2) and child controls. The adult cohort will consist of malnourished
      adult cases (Body Mass Index &lt;18.5) and adult controls. After screening the participants for
      any organic diseases and application of inclusion/exclusion criteria, they will receive
      nutrition interventions. Participants eligible for study will be tested for potential bio
      markers of environmental enteropathy (stool, urine and serum) once before and once after the
      nutritional intervention. Participants who will fail to respond to nutritional therapy
      (measured by anthropometric assessment) will become candidates for upper gastrointestinal
      endoscopy with biopsy. The study will include duodenal biopsies from a control group of
      children from University of Virginia Hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia who will undergo
      upper GI endoscopy as part of their clinical care as per the standard clinical protocol
      followed at the hospital. Adult controls (BMI &gt; 18.5) for endoscopy will be collected from
      international centre for diarrhoeal disease research,Bangladesh staff clinic, Dhaka Medical
      College and Hospital (DMCH), Dhaka and Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU),
      Dhaka.

      Study design This will be a community-based intervention study. Survey, screening, enrollment
      of subjects will be done in Mirpur in Dhaka city.

      Subjects Participants will be recruited from two age groups: a child cohort (age 12 to 18
      months) and an adult cohort (age 18 to 45 years). The child cohort will consist of two groups
      of children- stunted children (LAZ score &lt; -2) and children who are at risk of stunting (LAZ
      &lt;-1 to -2). A group of malnourished adults (BMI &lt;18.5) will also be enrolled from the parents
      of children and by a cross sectional survey from Mirpur area of Dhaka city.

      Sample size:

      Participants will be collected and recruited in a cross sectional manner. Based on a sample
      size calculation with 10% precision and 95% confidence interval, a minimum of 35 stunted
      children, 35 at risk of stunting children and 35 adults will be recruited. So, the final
      sample size for endoscopy is 105 subjects (35+35+35). As endoscopy is an invasive procedure,
      it was assumed that only one-third of those who would fail to respond after nutrition
      intervention would give consent for endoscopy. So, basic sample size was increased three
      times for a minimum of 105 (35 x 3) stunted children (LAZ &lt;-2), 105 (35 x 3) children at risk
      of stunting (LAZ &lt;-1 to 2) and 105 (35 X 3) malnourished adults (BMI &lt; 18.5) who would fail
      to thrive. To achieve that 525 stunted children, 525 children at risk of stunting and 525
      malnourished adults for nutrition interventions will be recruited as it was assumed that ~20%
      of each group will fail to respond despite the nutritional intervention. For that order of
      recruitment surveying at least 3977 (1312+2665) children 12-18 months old and 2100 adults
      based on the current prevalence of malnutrition in the two age groups is required. For adult
      control group, same number (35) of adult controls will be recruited from Dhaka Medical
      College and international centre for diarrhoeal disease research,Bangladesh staff clinic by
      convenient sampling method

      Description of field site:

      The study will be conducted among residents of Mirpur, one of the 21 administrative units of
      the nation's capital, Dhaka.

      Recruitment, Screening and Consenting If the participants are interested to volunteer in the
      study, the designated staff will proceed to screening and consenting. Screening will consist
      of a review of the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed above. If the subject is eligible
      to participate, the process will proceed to consenting consisting of a thorough review of the
      written consent form in a manner appropriate for the child's parents' / participants literacy
      level. Prior to signing the consent form, they will have an opportunity to ask any questions
      about the study. If the Field Research Assistant (FRA) determines that participants have
      demonstrated adequate comprehension of the study, the consent form will be signed by the FRA
      and the child's parent(s) /adult participants. If the parent(s) / adult participants are not
      sufficiently literate to read and/or sign the consent form, consenting and a thumb impression
      will be obtained in the presence of a witness who is not associated with the study. The
      child's parent(s) / adult participants will be provided with a copy of the signed consent
      form.

      Detailed procedure of Directly Observed Nutritional Therapy:

      After enrollment, participants will receive daily directly observed nutritional therapy.
      Nutritional therapy consists egg and milk and will be provided by the study free of cost.
      Duration of nutrition interventions will be 3, 2 and 2 months for stunted children, children
      at risk of stunting, and malnourished adults, respectively and nutritional therapy will be
      delivered between the morning and mid day meal, anytime between 10:00 am to 11:30 am.
      Participants will be asked to come to the designated nutrition center (to be established at
      Mirpur) daily for nutritional therapy to avoid the issue of food sharing. A staff will visit
      the family's household if a participant defaults in coming to the nutrition center. In
      addition to the food based nutritional therapy, participants will receive the following
      nutritional and health support:

        -  Anti-helminthic treatment (Albendazole/Pyrantel Pamoate) as per national guidelines

        -  Parents/caregivers will be given nutritional counselling

        -  For the child cohort, parents will be given one sachet of multiple micro-nutrient
           sprinkles per day for two months.

        -  Any inter-current illnesses detected by the study team will also be taken care of.

      Food based nutritional therapy: Supplementation of the usual home diet with one egg, and 150
      ml of whole milk which will provide an additional 178 kilo-calories, 11.1 g protein, and 11.5
      g of fat to the daily diet of enrolled subjects. Sachets of multiple micro-nutrient powder
      will be provided for use at home at dinner.

      In order to clarify the role of food-based nutritional therapy, there will be comparison
      subgroups of 40 stunted children and 40 children at risk of stunting who will be followed for
      3 and 2 months respectively, without any nutritional therapy. At the end of the observation
      period of 3 and 2 months, nutritional therapy will be provided to these children same as that
      provided to the enrolled participants.

      Discontinuation from the study: A child will be discontinued from the study and referred for
      medical evaluation if he/she shows reluctant to feed for consecutive 7 days which includes
      daily intake of 50% or less amount of food that will be offered. A new eligible child will be
      recruited in his position for nutritional intervention.

      Collection of biological samples:

      All biological samples (blood, urine, stool, duodenal aspirates, and endoscopic biopsies)
      will be collected as per the standard operative procedures (SOPs) which will be prepared for
      this protocol. A total amount of 5ml blood will be collected from each participant before and
      after nutritional intervention. Urine will be collected for Lactulose-Rhamnose assay, and for
      metabolomic studies; breath samples will be collected for testing for small intestinal
      bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Second SIBO will be done 1-2 weeks prior to endoscopy so that
      the findings from the endoscopy can be compared to the breath tests. Fecal samples will be
      collected for biomarkers, Taqman array card (TAC) assays and Microbiome/Microbiota for age
      Z-score (MAZ)/Bug fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

      Detailed procedure of Bio-marker testing

      The bio-markers going to be tested for are-

        -  C- Reactive Protein

        -  Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein

        -  Soluble cluster of differentiation 14

        -  Kynurenine-Tryptophan Ratio

        -  Glucagon-like peptide-2

        -  Insulin-like growth factor-2

        -  Tissue Transglutaminase

        -  Ferritin

        -  Zinc

        -  Pepsinogen I/II Ratio

        -  Low density lipoprotein related receptor 1 (LRP1)

        -  Blood plasma metabolomics

      Other proposed biomarkers

      • Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth

      After completion of nutritional therapy, all enrolled participants will have an assessment
      for response which will include:

        -  Anthropometric measurements

        -  Collection of one 5 ml blood sample for serum bio-markers of gut function and screening
           tests for the endoscopy with biopsy procedure, if the procedure is indicated for failure
           to thrive

        -  Collection of stool specimen for bio-markers of gut function

        -  Administration of lactulose-rhamnose solution and collection of urine for up to 2 hours
           for urine bio markers of gut function

      At this time, the final inclusion criterion for endoscopy with biopsy will be evaluated to
      determine whether the participants failed nutritional therapy or had an adequate response, or
      have an underlying disease that caused the malnutrition. Failure of nutritional therapy in
      this study, or failure to respond, is defined in the absence of any other underlying diseases
      such as tuberculosis:

        -  LAZ score remains &lt; -2 for stunted children cohort

        -  LAZ score remains &lt; -1 for &quot;at risk of stunting&quot; children cohort

        -  BMI &lt; 18.5 and &lt; 10% increase in BMI for adults.

      Participants who meet the study definition of &quot;failure to respond&quot; will be checked for
      presence of any secondary cause of malnutrition like tuberculosis, carcinoma, any parasitic
      infection etc. Stool microscopy for parasite identification will be done at icddr,b
      parasitology lab as soon as possible after collection of stool samples. If nothing conclusive
      can be found, the participants may be requested to undergo preparations for upper GI
      endoscopy with biopsy, as they may benefit from further evaluation to identify the potential
      cause(s) of intervention failure and to determine an appropriate therapeutic course. It will
      also benefit others by validating the non-invasive bio-marker signature of Environmental
      Enteric Dysfunction. Participants who will undergo endoscopy will receive necessary
      treatments according to diagnosis.

      Participants having celiac disease and clotting disorder (tested by prothrombin time /
      International Normalized Ratio coagulopathy) will be excluded from the study. Endoscopy of
      upper gastrointestinal tract will be done as per standards recommended by North American
      Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN0, American College
      of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Reg1 is known to promote intestinal epithelial cell proliferation, regeneration and repair, and is up-regulated in a variety of enteric infections and inflammatory conditions. A commercial ELISA assay will be run on fecal samples to measure Reg 1 levels.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool neopterin level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Neopterin is a product of the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) when released from phagocytic cells, and an increase in neopterin can be found with the activation of cellular immune response. So, increased neopterin in stools will be used as a marker for an inflammatory immune response in the intestinal epithelium.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool myeloperoxidase level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Derived from azurophil granules, which are a specific marker of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) activity, myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the oxidation of substances through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The MPO H2O2-system has a toxic effect on many micro-organisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and mycoplasma. MPO determination in the stool reflects the inflammatory activity of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. During inflammation in the intestinal mucosa, neutrophils migrate towards the gut mucosa and release myeloperoxidase from granulocytes which can be detected in stools and used as a marker of intestinal inflammation. A commercial ELISA kit will be used to measure myeloperoxidase in stool specimens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool Alpha-1-antitrypsin level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha-1-antitrypsin is an acute phase protein predominantly made in the liver, but also in intestinal macrophages, monocytes, and epithelial cells and released during inflammation. The presence of alpha-1-antitrypsin in the stool is a marker of intestinal inflammation, intestinal permeability and protein loss. A commercial ELISA kit will be utilized to measure alpha-1-antitrypsin in stool specimens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool Calprotectin level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Calprotectin is released by activated neutrophils, and it accounts for more than 40% of the cytosolic proteins of neutrophils. Elevated concentrations of calprotectin can be measured in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, urine, and feces when inflammation is present or in malignant conditions. The high fecal calprotectin concentrations can be explained by increased turnover of leukocytes in the gut wall and increased migration of neutrophils into the gut lumen . The fecal calprotectin results are expressed in mg of calprotectin per kilogram of wet feces within a normal reference range of &lt;50 mg/kg.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in stool TaqMan Array Card (TAC) result</measure>

    <description>The TaqMan Array Card (TAC) system is a real-time polymerase chain reaction format that is used to detect multiple infection targets. An enteric TaqMan Array Card can detect 27 enteropathogens, including viruses and helminths Fecal samples will be spiked with extrinsic controls, and total nucleic acid will be extracted. TAC allows fast, accurate, and quantitative detection of a broad spectrum of enteropathogens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in gut microbiota maturity status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The human gut microbiota undergoes a defined postnatal developmental program of assembly over the first 2-3 years of life that is perturbed in children with undernutrition and is not durably repaired by existing therapeutic foods. While these studies have identified a link between microbiota maturity and anthropometric measures of healthy growth in early childhood, the relationship between histopathologically defined Environmental Enteric Dysfunction and the configuration/maturation of the microbiota in the small and large intestines has not been studied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lactulose and rhamnose permeability test</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The lactulose and rhamnose permeability test will be used to measure intestinal permeability. The synthetic disaccharide, lactulose, is minimally absorbed via the paracellular route and then excreted unchanged in the urine, while the monosaccharide sugar rhamnose, being smaller is usually completely absorbed in the small intestine and excreted unchanged in the urine. An elevated lactulose: rhamnose ratio indicates increased permeability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood C-reactive protein level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase protein and can be detected during infection. It is a measurement of enteric permeability across the gut membrane. A commercial ELISA kit will be used to measure the levels of CRP in plasma samples.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein is an acute phase protein. Increased levels are found in the serum during systemic tissue injury, inflammation and infection. A commercial ELISA kit will be utilized to measure the levels of alpha-1-acid glycoprotein in plasma specimens.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood sCD14 level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>sCD14 is a protein receptor for lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similar to the principle behind the anti-LPS antibody assay, once the LPS or endotoxin containing particles enters the bloodstream from the intestinal mucosa, they are bound to sCD14. An increase in sCD14 indicates an increase in endotoxin or LPS entering the bloodstream from the intestinal mucosa .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood kynurenine Tryptophan ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Tryptophan is an essential amino acid that is central to cellular respiration and neurotransmission, and is a key immune mediator. During inflammation, tryptophan is metabolized by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to the toxic metabolite kynurenine. IDO activity is measured by the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan. IDO activity correlates with disease severity in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases .</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood Glucagon-like peptide-2 level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a newly discovered gastrointestinal peptide with 33% sequence homology to glucagon. GLP-2 has attracted interest because of its potent endocrine/paracrine actions. The peptide results from expression of the glucagon gene in the intestinal mucosa, from where it is released mainly in response to luminal contact with unabsorbed nutrients. In addition to mucosal growth, GLP-2 enhances activities of several intestinal brush-border enzymes, and it delays gastric transit, thereby increasing the intestinal capacity for nutrient absorption. Thus, it appears that GLP-2 serves to ensure an optimal intestinal capacity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood ferritin level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Serum ferritin is widely recognized as an acute phase reactant and marker of acute and chronic inflammation, and is nonspecifically elevated in a wide range of inflammatory conditions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood zinc level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Scientists have explored the overlapping nature of zinc deficiency and environmental enteropathy, and presented evidence for their interaction. Environmental Enteropathy (EE) leads to impaired zinc homeostasis, predominantly due to reduced absorptive capacity arising from disturbed intestinal architecture, and zinc deficiency exacerbates several of the proposed pathways that underlie EE, including intestinal permeability, enteric infection, and chronic inflammation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood pepsinogen I &amp; II level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gastric acid has an important pathophysiological role in human beings. Appropriate levels of gastric acid are needed to adequately absorb many nutrients including minerals and vitamins. It is also a crucial part of the immune system. The hypochlorhydria induced by H. pylori infection may also result in alterations in the gut microbiota and contribute to small intestinal permeability changes and malabsorption,In this study, we also want to investigate serum pepsinogen I &amp; II to see their association with Environmental Enteric Dysfunction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in blood Low density lipoprotein related receptor 1 (LRP1) level</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>LRP1 is an endocytic receptor involved in trafficking at least 100 different molecules, including lipids and proteins/peptides involved in immune system function (e.g. antigen presentation) as well as viral proteins and toxins. The epigenetic data strongly suggest that LRP1 expression is reduced in stunted children compared to controls.</description>

    <measure>Change in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) status</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is measured noninvasively by a hydrogen breath test, where oral glucose is administered and an increase of hydrogen in the breath SIBO of at least 12 parts per million is detected. Traditionally, SIBO has been considered a secondary condition that develops in the setting of altered intestinal anatomy, slowed intestinal motility, or aberrant gastrointestinal function.</description>
