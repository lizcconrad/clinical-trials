    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, first-in-human Phase 1 study evaluating the anti-TIM-3 (T
      cell immunoglobulin and mucin containing protein-3) antibody TSR-022, as a monotherapy and in
      combination with an anti-PD-1 antibody, in patients with advanced solid tumors who have
      limited available treatment options. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: dose escalation
      and cohort expansion.
