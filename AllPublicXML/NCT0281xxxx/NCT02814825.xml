  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post-market study is to collect data on ViviGen and how its use affects
      fusion rates in the cervical spine when used as additional grafting material to fill the
      cervical spacer. The patient population of interest is patients who have already elected to
      undergo a 2-3 level ACDF surgical procedure using ViviGen, per standard of care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Candidates who satisfy ALL of the following inclusion criteria and consent to participate
        in the study may be considered eligible for enrollment:

          1. Diagnosed by the investigator with at least one (1) of the following:

               -  Symptomatic cervical spondylosis;

               -  Degenerative disc disease (DDD), defined as discogenic pain with degeneration of
                  the disc confirmed by history and imaging studies;

               -  Herniated nucleus pulposus (HNP)

          2. Subjects who are candidates and have already elected to undergo contiguous two or
             three-level ACDF surgery between C2-C7 of the cervical spine

          3. Skeletally mature adults between 21 and 75 years of age

          4. Subjects, who, in the opinion of the Investigator, are able to understand the purpose
             of the study and are willing to return for all the required post-operative standard of
             care follow-up visits and have their data collected.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Candidates who meet ANY of the following exclusion criteria are not considered eligible for
        study participation:

          1. Posterior instrumentation necessary at same levels being treated

          2. Instability associated with major reconstructive surgery for primary tumors or
             metastatic malignant tumors of the cervical spine

          3. Instability associated with cervical spine trauma

          4. Acute or chronic systemic or localized spinal infections

          5. Previous deep anterior cervical surgeries such as thyroid, carotid, or high thoracic
             surgery (T5 and above)

          6. History of previous cervical fusion surgery at greater than one level

          7. Previous pseudoarthrosis at any level of the cervical spine

          8. Nursing mothers or women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant during the time
             of the study

          9. Severe osteoporosis (per the Investigator's diagnosis or per a T-score greater than or
             equal to 2.5 SD below the mean for a young, healthy adult) that may prevent adequate
             fixation of screws and thus preclude the use of a cervical plate system

         10. Subjects who have a known or suspected allergy to any of the following antibiotics
             and/or reagents: Gentamicin Sulfate, Meropenem, Vancomycin, Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO),
             and Human Serum Albumin (HSA)

         11. Immune compromised subjects

         12. Pre-existing neurological abnormalities other than deficits produced by the spinal
             fusion (e.g. MS, Parkinson's, CVA, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy)

         13. Conditions that could preclude the possibility of fusion in the Investigator's opinion
             (e.g. cancer, kidney dialysis, smoking, uncontrolled diabetes, osteopenia)

         14. History of pre-operative dysphagia

         15. Symptomatic shoulder pathologies under active treatment

         16. Known sensitivity to device materials

         17. Subjects who, in the opinion of the Investigator, have any other existing condition
             that would compromise their participation and follow-up in this clinical study

             Intraoperative exclusion criteria:

         18. Intraoperative decision by the surgeon to use implants not compatible or cleared for
             use with ViviGen

         19. Intraoperative decision by the surgeon to use other bone grafts substitutes such as
             DBM or rhBMP
