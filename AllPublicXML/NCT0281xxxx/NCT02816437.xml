      This is a pilot feasibility study to determine whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT)
      can suppress or reverse gastrointestinal carriage of MDROs in hospitalized solid organ
      transplant recipients with a history of one or more MDRO infections.

      Study participants who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide written, informed
      consent will provide a pre-FMT stool sample. Participants will be followed from the time of
      enrollment up to 3 months post FMT.

      Specific organisms of interest that will be tested for by the stool cultures include
      vancomycin resistant enterococcus, carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae and carbapenem
      resistant Pseudomonas. Eligible patients who demonstrate colonization with a positive culture
      for a specific organism of interest will be given FMT.

      One FMT dose of a retention rectal enema (OpenBiome) will be administered by a nurse and
      supervised by our principal investigator and/or sub-investigators trained in performance of
      FMT.

      Stool samples of study participants will be collected and analyzed as follows:

        -  Pre-FMT: Stool collection &amp; storage in glycerol/flash frozen, to be shipped in dry ice

        -  48 hours post FMT: Stool collection using RNA later kit provided by OpenBiome (in
           hospital)

        -  Day 7: Stool collection &amp; storage in glycerol/flash frozen, to be shipped in dry ice

        -  Day 14: Stool collection using RNAlater kit (at home)

        -  Day 30: Stool collection &amp; storage in glycerol/flash frozen (in hospital or clinic), to
           be shipped in dry ice

        -  Day 90: follow-up visit in clinic, final sample collected using RNAlater kit
