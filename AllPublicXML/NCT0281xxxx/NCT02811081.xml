      The aim of this clinical trial is to estimate the efficacy and safety of combined
      intervention with the intra-peritoneal normal saline instillation and pulmonary recruitment
      maneuver for reducing post-laparoscopic shoulder pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain after laparoscopy is common and its probable mechanism is residual carbon
      dioxide gas after surgery. Both the intra-peritoneal normal saline instillation and pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver could effectively reduce post-laparoscopic shoulder pain. However, the
      efficacy and safety of combined intervention with normal saline instillation and pulmonary
      recruitment maneuver have not been investigated yet. The aim of this clinical trial is to
      estimate the effectiveness of combined intervention with the intra-peritoneal normal saline
      instillation and pulmonary recruitment maneuver for reducing post-laparoscopic shoulder pain.
