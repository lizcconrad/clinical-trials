    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this prospective, open-label, multi-center observational registry with
      all-comers enrollment is to report on the use of the MicroCutter Stapler in a real world
      setting in thoracic surgical procedures. Procedures may be open or video assisted thoracic
      surgery (VATS) including robotic surgical cases. Clinicians will provide objective and
      subjective evaluation of the use of the stapler in their procedures.

      The MATCH registry is a prospective, open label, multi-center observational registry with
      enrollment of patients requiring surgical stapling during a lobectomy or segmentectomy.
      Patients will be treated per the clinicians standard of care with medical history and
      demographic data collected pre-procedure, operative data including clinician's objective and
      subjective evaluation of the stapler and confirmation of any complications via query and data
      collection at hospital discharge and each clinician's standard post-operative contact.
