  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS), which allows the collection of
      Raman spectra through turbid media, is being applied to collect Raman spectra of bone. The
      principal aim to find ways to use Raman spectroscopy to assess bone quality in vivo.

    <description>Raman spectra will be collected non-invasively from patients using a lower power 830 nm laser. A probe is brought into gentle contact with the patients skin and measurements taken. The laser power has a pre-defined safe threshold of 30 mW into a 3.5 mm diameter aperture. Built in device safety features prevent this threshold from being exceeded. The probe that comes into patient contact is suitable for disinfecting.</description>

          -  Clinical features of bone disease

        Cohort 2: 40 patients with OI; Cohort 3: 40 patients with OA; Cohort 6: 20 patients with
        rickets/osteomalacia • Patients with more than 1 type of bone disease

        Cohorts 4, 5 and 6: receiving treatment

        • Patients who have been advised to stop treatment. If the treatment is a long-acting one
