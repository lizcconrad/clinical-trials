    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Written informed consent/assent obtained from subjects/subjects' parent(s) or legally
             acceptable representative indicating that they understand the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study and are willing to participate in it.

          -  Male or female, aged 2 through 75 years.

          -  Diagnosis of PID with impaired antibody production, i.e.:

        Diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) as defined by the European Society for
        Immunodeficiencies (ESID)/Pan American Group for Immunodeficiency (PAGID) diagnostic
        criteria.

        Or

          -  X linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) as defined by ESID/PAGID diagnostic criteria.

          -  Established replacement therapy with any intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) reference
             preparation during the previous 6 months, including documentation of immunoglobulin G
             (IgG) trough levels.

          -  Established replacement therapy with a single IVIg reference preparation for at least
             3 months prior to treatment start with BT595 at a 3 or 4 week schedule with a constant
             IVIg dose that did not change by ±20% of the mean dose, regular dosage intervals, and
             at least 1 IgG trough level of ≥5 g/L during the previous 3 months.

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known intolerance to immunoglobulins or comparable substances (e.g., vaccination
             reaction).

          -  Known intolerance to proteins of human origin or known allergic reactions to
             components of the study product.

          -  Acquired medical conditions known to cause secondary immune deficiency, such as
             chronic lymphatic leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, as well as protein losing
             enteropathies and hypoalbuminemia.

          -  Recent febrile illness that precludes or delays participation.

          -  Active infection and receiving antibiotic therapy for the treatment of this infection
             at the time of screening. Note: if the subject is deemed to be a screen failure due to
             a nonserious active infection requiring antibiotic therapy, the subject may be
             rescreened after the initial screening.

          -  Therapy with systemic steroids or other immunosuppressant drugs at the time of
             enrollment (current daily use of corticosteroids, i.e., &gt;10 mg prednisone
             equivalent/day for &gt;30 days. Intermittent corticosteroid use during the study is
             allowable, if medically necessary).

          -  History of thrombotic events (including myocardial infarction, cerebral vascular
             accident [including stroke], pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis) within the
             6 months before treatment start with BT595 or the presence of significant risk factors
             for thrombotic events.

          -  Therapy with live attenuated virus vaccines within 3 months before start of the study.

          -  Selective, absolute immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency or known antibodies to IgA.
