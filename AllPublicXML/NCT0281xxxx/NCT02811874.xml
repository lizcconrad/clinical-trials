      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a diabetes education program delivered to
      CHW in improving the metabolic control of patients with type 2 DM.

      The study is a randomized controlled trial conducted in a primary care unit. Eight CHW,
      providing care for 118 patients, are randomized in two groups to receive a one-month diabetes
      education program (intervention group, patients n= 62) or an education course in other health
      issues (control group, patients n= 56).

      Background: In Brazil, community health workers (CHW) are members of the community hired by
      the government to provide education and care for patients for a broad range of health issues,
      including diabetes mellitus (DM). However, few CHW are trained for diabetes education and
      little is known about the effectiveness of their interventions. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effect of a diabetes education program delivered to CHW in improving the
      metabolic control of patients with type 2 DM.

      Materials and methods: the study is a randomized controlled trial conducted in a primary care
      unit. Eight CHW, providing care for 118 patients, are randomized in two groups to receive a
      one-month diabetes education program (intervention group, patients n= 62) or an education
      course in other health issues (control group, patients n= 56). Each CHW is responsible for
      transmitting the acquired knowledge to patients from their respective working areas. The
      primary outcome is change in HbA1C three months after intervention.

    <description>Diabetes education program includes: 4 theoretical sessions, 60 minutes long, taught once a week for 4 weeks, developed in the form of group classes, and given by one of the authors. The educational program content comprises (1) definition of diabetes, and identification of modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes, (2) non-pharmacological treatment, with emphasis on diet and exercise, (3) pharmacological therapy, including mechanism of action and side effects of anti-diabetic medications provided by the Brazilian public health system and (4) an overview of chronic diabetes complications.</description>
