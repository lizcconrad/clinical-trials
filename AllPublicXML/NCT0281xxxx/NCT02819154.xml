  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are admitted to intensive care for serious diseases (sepsis, ARDS ...) burdened with
      a high mortality rate. Invasive methods of resuscitation and the diseases treated can lead to
      serious sequelae. Follow-up studies of patients at hospital discharge report most often the
      quality of life using validated quantitative scales. A recent consensus of the American
      Society of resuscitation an update on the physical, cognitive and psychological sequelae of
      ICU hospitalization for the family and the patient, grouped under the term &quot;post-intensive
      care syndrome.&quot; Social changes, emotional and professional are little studied and are not
      part of the information provided by the quality of life questionnaires. The investigators
      hypothesize that intensive care stay entails a profound effect on the lives of patients. This
      study will add additional data on a little known aspect of post resuscitation.

      Primary objective :

      To evaluate the social changes, emotional, professional a cohort of patients following ICU
      stay

      Secondary objective:

      Evaluate post traumatic stress disorder and quality of life of a cohort of patients following
      ICU stay

      Methods :

      Study design Study of bi-center cohort (ICUs of Saint Joseph and Bichat hospitals).

      prospective follow the consequences of the intensive use of patient already included in the
      Outcomerea database using quality of life questionnaires, independence and post-traumatic
      stress and a questionnaire constructed for the study.

      Patient selection in the database The database contains more than 10,000 visits.
      Investigators will select the patients in the two hospitals in the study. Then a second
      selection will be based on the inclusion criteria. The review of hospital records will not
      include patients with the first five criteria for non-inclusion. These patients appear in the
      flow chart
