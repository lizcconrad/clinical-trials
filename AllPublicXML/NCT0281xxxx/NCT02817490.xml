  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (SED) comprises a group of clinically and genetically
      heterogeneous, inherited connective tissue diseases. The hypermobility type is the most
      frequent. It is characterized by a generalized joint hypermobility and a hyperextension skin.

      Chronic pain syndrome is often present. Its psychological impact can be significant (anxiety,
      depression, impact on the quality of life of the patients). The disease also requires changes
      and a permanent adaptability (coping). It can lead to feelings of isolation and
      misunderstanding.

      The French association of the Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes and the rehabilitation center of the
      'Croix-Rouge Française des Massues' propose a patient education program for the patients with
      a hypermobility type SED (the PrEduSED program). This education program is open to patients
      and their caregivers located in France.

      The research hypothesis is that the PrEduSED program improves their coping and reduces
      patient anxiety at 6 months (these are the two clinical criteria on which the PrEduSED could
      have the most impact, given the results of the first sessions).

    <description>The PREDUSED patient education program aims to make the patient actor of his pathology by providing him a &quot;box of therapeutic tools&quot; in order to: improve his knowledge of the disease, improve the management of pain, fatigue and episodes of instability; learn to communicate about the disease; set realistic goals.
The program includes theoretical information, practical cases, and discussions between participants and professionals.
It is the first patient education program in France for the patients with hypermobility type Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. It is proposed two times a year. Six patients can participate at each session.</description>
