  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infiltrations from cannulation difficulties result in significant morbidity including loss of
      vascular access (VA) loss in hemodialysis (HD). Cannulation is reliant on personnel skill and
      VA characteristics. Surface marking of VA lacks real-time information and traditional
      ultrasound (US) devices are large, expensive and require skilled operator expertise. Sonic
      WindowÂ© (Analogic Ultrasound, Peabody, MA) is a coronal mode ultrasound device (CMUD)
      approved for VA cannulation. Study is a single center randomized, prospective pilot study
      comparing handheld US-guided cannulation of new arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to standard
      cannulation practices.

    <description>The study protocol involved similar up titration of needle size over a 3-week period, except that a pre-cannulation evaluation of the fistula was performed using the Sonic Window ultrasound device. The device was used to evaluate and identify the optimal site of cannulation (image 1). Depending upon the cannulator's preference, real-time guidance could be employed during cannulation (image 2, 3). The cannulations were performed by 4 selected personnel trained in device use and successfully completed a competency evaluation on simulator models and a mature dialysis fistula.</description>
