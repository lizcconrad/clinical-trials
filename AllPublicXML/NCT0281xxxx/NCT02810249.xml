  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), in the form of the anti-retroviral pill TruvadaÂ©, has
      been approved by the FDA as a method for reducing HIV transmission rates in the population,
      particularly young men who have sex with men (YMSM). This study will use a qualitative design
      to interview 20-30, HIV-negative, 16-24 year old African American YMSM to: 1) identify and
      understand African American YMSM's, aged 16-24, cognitive and emotional processes in response
      to using PrEP to reduce their risk for HIV and 2) identify what factors (sociocultural,
      individual, experiences in health care, socioeconomic) influence African American YMSM's
      likely use of PrEP as a coping strategy for HIV prevention. Demographic information will be
      collected and analyzed using Statistical Analysis Software version 9.3. Individual interviews
      will be audio recorded and transcribed by a vetted transcription service for analysis. This
      is minimal risk to participants.

      This study will use an exploratory, naturalistic qualitative design where participants will
      be interviewed to collect data on their emotional and cognitive processes (illness
      representation) in response to the threat of a potential HIV infection, and what factors
      (social, cultural, individual characteristics, and experiences in health care) influence
      their likely use of PrEP. The sample for this study will include 20 to 30 African American
      YMSM, aged 16-24, residing in Durham, Wake, and Orange counties of North Carolina.

      The in-depth interview guide and the 26-item descriptive survey PrEP Knowledge, Sexual
      History, and Demographic Instrument were developed for this study using a combination of the
      concepts from the adapted Common Sense Model of Illness Representation (CSM) and questions
      adapted from the Adolescent Trial Network's (ATN) 082 study's questionnaire. Participants
      will be asked questions relating to African American YMSM's likely use of HIV Pre-Exposure
      Prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV risk-reduction strategy. Once informed consent is obtained, the
      interview will commence and study participants will be individually interviewed to discuss
      what factors influence their likely use of PrEP. Each participant will complete the
      descriptive survey and the one-on-one interview.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  between the ages of 16-24

          -  self-identify as African-American, Black, or mixed race including African American or
             Black

          -  have been assigned male sex at birth

          -  self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer, or self-identify as a heterosexual male who
             has had a past voluntary sexual experience with another man or currently has sexual
             desires for men

          -  report being uninfected with HIV

          -  be mentally capable of providing informed consent

          -  be able to speak and read English

          -  not currently using PrEP for HIV.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-infected men are excluded because this study is focused on the prevention of HIV
             transmission

          -  Men who were not assigned male sex at birth are excluded from this study, because
             transgender men face very different and distinct issues with access to care compared
             to YMSM

          -  Men who are currently using PrEP are excluded from this study because this study is
             exploring the barriers and facilitators to use of PrEP in African American YMSM aged
             16-24. Men who are currently using PrEP may have a different illness representation
             compared to men who are not using PrEP.
