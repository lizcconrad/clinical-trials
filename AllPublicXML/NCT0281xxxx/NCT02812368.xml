  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disturbance has been reported in 44-86% of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
      and is the source of considerable stress for the affected individual and family. Sleep plays
      a role in development and learning processes; thus, the appropriate treatment of sleep
      disturbance is paramount to optimal outcomes. The empirical base for treatments to address
      sleep in ASD is sparse, despite wide use of pharmacologic agents such as clonidine (CLN) to
      target sleep disturbance. A randomized, controlled pilot investigation of CLN for sleep
      disturbance in children with ASD will allow investigators to evaluate the feasibility of
      conducting a much larger multisite trial to address the general lack of systematic data
      available to guide practitioners. Subjects will be 16 children, ages 6-14 years, inclusive,
      with sleep disturbance and ASD. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled (PBO),
      parallel groups study will test the efficacy of CLN following a brief sleep hygiene
      intervention. Outcome measures include: informant completed sleep questionnaires, daytime
      behavior questionnaires, and actigraphy. Biomarkers for medication response will include
      galvanic skin response and skin temperature. Side effects will be monitored throughout the
      study.

    <measure>Change in Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome measure for this study is clinical improvement on the CSHQ (defined as a 30% or greater reduction in the Total Score of the 33 Sleep Items) at 6 weeks compared to baseline. The CSHQ is the most commonly used parent-rated scale to assess sleep disturbance in pediatric populations. It includes 33 items and is rated retrospectively over the previous week by parents to screen for the most common sleep problems. The CSHQ incorporates items related to eight key sleep domains. The eight subscales include: (1) bedtime resistance (2) sleep onset latency, (3) sleep duration, (4) anxiety around sleep, (5) night awakenings, (6) sleep disordered breathing, (7) parasomnias and (8) morning waking/daytime sleepiness. A Total Score of 41 or greater on the CSHQ 33 items has been reported to be an appropriate clinical cut-off for identifying sleep problems in children.</description>
