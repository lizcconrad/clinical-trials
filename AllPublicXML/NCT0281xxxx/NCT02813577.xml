      The post approval study will enroll US female patients presenting with claudication or
      ischemic rest pain and an angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or
      popliteal artery. Subjects are treated per Instructions For Use (IFU) with the Lutonix®
      Catheter. Subjects will have a Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) and clinical follow-up through two (2)
      years.

      The Lutonix® 035 Drug Coated Balloon PTA Catheter (Lutonix® Catheter) has been approved by
      the Food and Drug Administration (P130024) for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, after
      appropriate vessel preparation of de novo, restenotic, or in-stent restenotic lesions up to
      300 mm in length in native superficial femoral or popliteal arteries with reference vessel
      diameters of 4-7 mm. The purpose of this post-approval study is to assess the safety and
      effectiveness of the Lutonix® Catheter in the US female population. This study will enroll
      approximately 165 female patients at a minimum of 10 US centers and a maximum of 25.
