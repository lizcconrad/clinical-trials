  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and how well pembrolizumab and imatinib
      mesylate work in treating patients with melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that
      has spread to nearby tissue or other places in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      pembrolizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Imatinib
      mesylate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell
      growth. Giving pembrolizumab and imatinib mesylate may work better in treating patients with
      melanoma with c-KIT mutation or amplification that has spread to nearby tissue or other
      places in the body.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the best overall response rate (BORR = complete response + partial response) of
      the combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib for treatment of melanomas harboring c-Kit
      mutation or amplification.

      II. To evaluate the safety and adverse effect profile of the combination of pembrolizumab and
      imatinib in patients with melanomas harboring c-KIT aberrations (mutations or
      amplifications).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the median time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and
      overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 expression in melanoma patients with
      c-KIT aberrations before and after combined therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and imatinib
      mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 9 weeks
      for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
