  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled neonates will be provided routine supportive care as per existing neonatal intensive
      care unit (NICU)protocols. This will be carried out in the initial 6 months (0-180 days) of
      study commencement. This group will serve as control group (group A). During subsequent 6
      months (181-360 days) of the study period, enrolled neonates fulfilling the inclusion
      criteria will be provided routine supportive care and the components of developmentally
      supportive care (DSC).

      Enrolled neonates will be provided routine supportive care as per existing NICU protocols.
      This will be carried out in the initial 6 months (0-180 days) of study commencement. This
      group will serve as control group (group A). During subsequent 6 months (181-360 days) of the
      study period, enrolled neonates fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be provided routine
      supportive care and the components of developmentally supportive care (DSC). DSC components
      will be strictly emphasized on protected sleep, pain and stress assessment and management,
      activities of daily living (positioning, feeding and skin care), the healing environment.
      This group will be designated as group B. Both the groups will receive appropriate management
      for their morbidities as per existing NICU protocols. Both the groups will be followed up
      till 37 weeks of gestation where in their neurobehavioral assessment will be performed using
      Neurobehavioural assessment of preterm infants score.

      In both the groups all the baseline data regarding antenatal factors will be recorded in a
      predesigned proforma such as age, gravid, Gestational age, Chorioamnionitis, Prenatal
      steroids, Multiple pregnancy, maternal comorbidities (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes
      mellitus), mode of delivery etc.
