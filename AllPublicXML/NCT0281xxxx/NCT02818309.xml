The serious adverse events are defined as following: 1. results in death; 2.
life-threatening; 3. requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation; 4. results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity</description>

             within 4 months.

          6. Continuously treated during the last 8 weeks before enrolment with daily optimised
             unchanged standard dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, such as esomeprazole 40
             mg, lansoprazole 30 mg, dexlansoprazole 60 mg, rabeprazole 30 mg and pantoprazole 40
             mg.

          8. To be eligible for the screening phase the patients must have reported in the Reflux
             Symptom Questionnaire 7 day recall (RESQ-7) using 7 days recall of symptoms, a minimum
             of 3 days with a rating of at least moderate intensity on at least 1 of the following
             items; a burning feeling behind the breastbone or unpleasant movement of material
             upwards from the stomach.

          9. To be eligible for randomisation the patients must have recorded in the Reflux Symptom
             Questionnaire electronic diary (RESQ-eD) on the last 7 days before randomisation, a
             minimum of 3 days with a symptom intensity of at least moderate on 1 of 2 items (a
             burning feeling behind the breastbone or an unpleasant movement of material upwards
             from the stomach), or any combination of both items (eg, 1 day on 1 item and 2 days on
             the other).

        Exclusion criteria

          1. Patients that had not experienced any GERD symptom improvement at all during PPI
             treatment.

          2. Unstable or clinically significant cardiovascular (ischemic heart disease, congestive

             depression, schizophrenia) , or gastrointestinal and esophageal disorders besides GERD
             (peptic ulcer, eosinophilic esophagitis).

          3. Current neurological disorders including nerve compression syndromes. Patients with
             well controlled migraine and other headache disorders could be included.

             effects of lesogaberan (such as baclofen or supplements containing GABA), alter
             gastrointestinal symptoms (such as type-2 histamine receptor agonists) or cause damage
             to the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract (such as nonsteroidal
