      In patients with otitis media presenting with otoscopy-confirmed otorrhea who had
      tympanostomy tube insertion or tympanic perforation, to evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      and the proportion of patients with cessation of otorrhea after ear-drop administration of
      YH1177 or YH1177-D for 14 days and therefore to determine the optimal clinical dose.
