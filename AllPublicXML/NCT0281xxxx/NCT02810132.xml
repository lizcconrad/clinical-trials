      The study evaluates the effects of metformin treatment on myocardial efficiency in heart
      failure patients. 36 patients will be randomized to three months of metformin or placebo
      treatment in addition to their regular therapy.

      Hypothesis: Treatment with metformin in patients with heart failure has direct or indirect
      beneficial effects on left ventricular myocardial oxidative metabolism, myocardial efficiency
      and contractile function.

      Background: Heart failure (HF) is a common disease and diabetes/insulin resistance are
      present in approximately 50 % of HF patients. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed oral
      anti-diabetic drug, and registry and experimental studies show beneficial effects of
      metformin in HF, but randomized trials are needed.

      Objectives: To investigate if treatment with metformin in patients with HF has beneficial
      effects on myocardial efficiency,

      Design: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center design. 36 patients
      with systolic heart failure will be randomized to either metformin (N = 18) or placebo (N=
      18) for 3 months.

      Methods: Patients will undergo echocardiography at rest and during exercise along with
      [11C]-acetate PET.

      Primary outcome parameter is changes in myocardial external efficiency from visit 1 to 3
      months of therapy.
