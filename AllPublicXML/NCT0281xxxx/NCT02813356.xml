  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the
      safety of naloxegol in patients aged 18 years and older who do not have a diagnosis of cancer
      and who are treated with opioids chronically
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the overall risk of major adverse cardiovascular events
      (MACE) among naloxegol-treated patients compared to that among patients on prescription
      non-peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonist (PAMORA) opioid induced constipation (OIC)
      treatment. The corresponding analysis is of a new-user cohort study that captures the
      occurrence of MACE in persons receiving naloxegol or comparison medications. The study takes
      place in actual-use settings in the US in which existing electronic data captures patient
      diagnoses, health care, and treatment. The occurrence of MACE in naloxegol-treated patients
      will be compared to the occurrence of MACE in medically-similar new users of other
      prescription-only treatments for OIC in the same settings, with both naloxegol-treated and
      comparison medication-treated patients being followed for as long as they continue on
      therapy.

      In further pursuit of the primary objective, there will be a self-controlled study that
      follows all members of the new-user cohorts, including both new naloxegol users and new users
      of comparator products, for as long as data are available as the patients may go on or off
      treatment. A self-controlled study offers a complementary approach to the statistical control
      for the possible confounding effects of personal characteristics. Using the same data
      sources, this self-controlled design follows individuals from the time they finish their
      first course of treatment as new users for as long as the study continues. Patient treatment
      statuses are continuously updated since the treatment choices exercised by patients and their
      caregivers create extended periods of study time on and off naloxegol and possibly on and off
      other therapies for OIC. Comparisons of the occurrence of MACE occur within individuals and
      so are unaffected by differences between individuals, as in a crossover trial.

      The first secondary objective is to assess the potential confounding effects of lifestyle
      risk factors on relative risk of MACE among naloxegol-treated patients compared with that
      among patients on other prescription non-PAMORA OIC treatment. The corresponding analysis is
      of a case-control study nested within the primary study population. All of the MACE &quot;cases&quot;
      will be matched to other members of the cohorts (&quot;controls&quot;). In cases and controls, the
      outpatient medical record will be abstracted for information on lifestyle risk factors. The
      case-control analysis will provide information on the presence and effect of lifestyle
      confounding factors that may be identifiable only by chart review.

      Further secondary analyses will investigate the relative risks analyzed under an
      intent-to-treat paradigm over fixed time periods of membership in the naloxegol and
      comparator cohorts, relative risks for specific components of MACE, relative risks associated
      with new oral PAMORA agents other than naloxegol (non-naloxegol oral PAMORAs [NNPAMORAs])
      that may come onto the US market during the course of the study, and an exploration of the
      possible variations in risk associated with variations in the dose and timing of naloxegol
      dispensing in the case-control study.

        All patients in this study will be 18 years of age or older, and they will have had at
        least 6 months of continuous data available before they enter one of the new-user cohorts.
        During the 6-month baseline period before cohort entry, they will have received at least 90
        days of dispensed opioids, of which in the 60 days before cohort entry there were at least
        30 days of opioids dispensed at an average of at least 30 morphine equivalent units (MEQ)
        per day. Patients will have no evidence of active cancer; they will have no evidence in the
        electronic record of MACE; they will not have received methylnatrexone bromide for
        subcutaneous injection. At the time of the index dispensing of naloxegol or comparison
        drug, cohort members will furthermore be current users of a dispensed opioid.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient receives a new dispensing of naloxegol, lubiprostone/linaclotide, or an oral
             NNPAMORA. A new dispensing is one that occurs with no dispensing for the same drug
             having occurred in the preceding 182 days. A patient only qualifies once under this
             criterion for any drug.

          2. Patients 18 years of age or older at the index date

          3. Continuous availability of data for at least 183 days immediately before and including
             the index date

          4. 90 days of opioid dispensed in the 183 days before and including the index date of
             which at least 30 days of opioid dispensed at at least 30 MEQ/day in the 60 days
             before and including index date

          5. Current users of a dispensed opioid, meaning that the interval between index study
             drug dispensing and at least 1 prior opioid dispensing is less than the days supply
             associated with the opioid dispensing

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any medical care associated with a diagnosis of cancer in the 183 days before and
             including the index date; a diagnosis of cancer for this purpose is any diagnostic
             code of International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9) in the range
             140-208 &quot;Malignant neoplasms â€¦&quot; or of the 10th revision (ICD-10) in the range C00-C96,
             &quot;Malignant neoplasms&quot;

          2. Dispensing of methylnaltrexone for subcutaneous injection in the 183 days before and
             including the index date

          3. Indication in the electronic records of the occurrence of MACE in the 183 days before
             and including the index date; see Section 9.3.2 &quot;MACE&quot; for screening criteria
