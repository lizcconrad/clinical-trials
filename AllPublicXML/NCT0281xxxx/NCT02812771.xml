        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects of any race, 6 to 16 years of age (inclusive). PK Subset: Male
             or female subjects of any race, 12 to 16 years of age (inclusive).

          -  Verbal and written informed consent/assent obtained from the subject and/or their
             parent or legal guardian.

          -  Good general health, as assessed by the investigator, based on the subject's medical
             history, physical examination, and safety laboratory tests.

          -  Target great toenail for all subjects, and both great toenails for subjects in the PK
             subset, must have evidence of toenail growth, per subject's report that monthly
             clipping is needed.

          -  Subjects and their parents/legal guardians are willing to comply with study
             instructions and return to the investigational center for all required visits (a visit
             schedule with the length of each visit will be provided to ensure that the subject can
             meet the requirements and have adequate transportation).

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who are pregnant, nursing an infant, or planning a pregnancy during the study
             period.

          -  History of immunosuppression and/or clinical signs indicative of possible
             immunosuppression, as determined by the investigator, or known human immunodeficiency
             virus infection.

          -  History of diabetes that is uncontrolled as determined by the investigator (diabetes
             that is controlled by diet or medication does not exclude a subject).

          -  Presence of any toenail infection other than or in addition to dermatophytes, such as
             Scytalidium as determined by the investigator (candidal onychomycosis infection,
             concurrent with a positive dermatophyte culture, is acceptable).
