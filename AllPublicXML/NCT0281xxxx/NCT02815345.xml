    <textblock>
      During the resuscitation of preterm infants, withdrawal of non-invasive ventilation is
      difficult. In a recent study in children gestational age &lt;30 weeks of amenorrhea (SA),
      definitive withdrawal rate from the first attempt to stop the non-invasive ventilation was
      32% . In the same study, the median number of attempts before achieving a final withdrawal
      was 3 for children born before 28 weeks. The reasons for weaning failure are multiple and
      little studied. It seems that the type of interface used, mask or cannula, having an
      influence on the effectiveness of non-invasive ventilation . The nasal lesions induced by
      non-invasive ventilation are not uncommon, regardless of the interface used . In a recent
      randomized trial, they ranged from 40% to 50% depending on the type of nasal cannula and
      non-invasive ventilation mode. It is in this case external damage. But we assume that the
      breakdown causes internal lesions dependent on the pressure, humidity and flow. These factors
      are likely to generate a nasal obstruction, source intervention nurses who aspire nasal
      passages more or less traumatic.

      The nasal cavities are often abused and, because of their key role in breathing, could be
      involved in the withdrawal of ventilatory failure

      The measurements of the nasal cavity dimensions are carried out by acoustic rhinometry (about
      10 seconds for an acquisition). Measurement of nasal resistance is performed by
      rhinomanometry earlier (about a minute to a measure). They may be made to wakefulness or
      sleep since they do not require their participation. These measures will be carried at birth
      and then every 7 to 10 days (before the age of 28 days), if the child is still hospitalized.

      During these measurements, the heart rate and oxygen saturation are collected by a measuring
      sensor transcutaneously.

    <description>Acoustic rhinometry is a functional non-invasive procedure based on the sound reflection of acoustic waves on the nasal cavities. This procedure allows determining the geometry and the size of nasal cavities. The device is composed by a wave tube connected to a sound generator emitting series of acoustic impulsions. On this wave tube are laterally connected 2 microphones, themselves connected with a computer which analyzes the acoustic signal. These microphones detect the acoustic reflected wave.</description>

Some included neonates will also have rhinomanometry measurements.</description>
