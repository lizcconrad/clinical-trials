  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with prostate cancer undergoing robot assisted radical laparoscopic prostatectomy
      (RALP) in steep Trendelenburg position (sTBURG) are noted to have elevated intraocular
      pressures (IOP) intraoperatively. One study showed an increase in IOP of 13 millimeters of
      mercury (mmHg) from baseline IOP levels intraoperatively. Other studies have shown the IOP to
      more than double intraoperatively during RALP in sTBURG. IOP is found to be directly related
      to angle of inclination and increases time dependently with sTBURG. The IOP may remain
      significantly elevated until the first postoperative day after RALP.

      There are no previously published data concerning the safe threshold for IOP elevation and
      the effects of this increased IOP on vision and on generalized eye health are still not
      entirely known. One study showed postoperative visual field defects in 28% (7/25) of patients
      who underwent RALP in sTBURG. It has been theorized that sTBURG and subsequent increased IOP
      are risk factors for postoperative vision loss (PVL). It is believed that the increased IOP
      decreases optic nerve perfusion pressure causing ischemic optic neuropathy. Some previously
      recommended ways to reduce the intraoperative IOP spike during RALP include shorter operating
      times, decreased angle of inclination, modified Trendelenburg position, use of Propofol for
      maintenance anaesthesia and intraoperative topical hypotensive agents to reduce IOP. Given
      the challenges with some of the above options, this study aims to evaluate the effect of
      pre-operative treatment with topical Brimonidine Tartrate 0.2% on the IOP of patients
      undergoing RALP with sTBURG. The goal is to prevent the anticipated IOP spike thereby
      reducing risk of postoperative vision loss.

      With completed informed consent, study participants will undergo a pre-operative
      comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation to document best corrected visual acuity (VA), IOP
      measurements, visual field assessments (VF), optical coherence tomography measurements (OCT)
      of the retinal nerve fiber layer, optic disc photography and screening for other
      ophthalmologic abnormalities. Height and weight measurements will also be recorded.

      Using opaque envelopes with the aid of Sequentially Numbered Opaque Sealed Envelopes (SNOSE)
      schemes, each patient will be randomized to either right eye or left eye. Thereafter patients
      will be randomized to placebo (carboxymethylcellulose) or drop (Brimonidine tartrate 0.2%)
      which will be given 30 minutes before the start of surgery with the patient in horizontal
      supine position. Eyes randomized to receive a drop will be treated with one drop of
      Brimonidine tartrate 0.2% while eyes randomized to receive placebo will receive one drop of
      Carboxymethylcellulose eye drops (Control group).

      IOP measurements will be recorded for both eyes pre-operatively in the upright seated
      position (baseline), pre-anaesthetized in supine horizontal position, intra-operatively in
      anaesthetized supine horizontal position, hourly intra-operatively in anaesthetized sTBURG,
      awake post-operatively in supine horizontal position and at 1 month postoperatively in the
      upright seated position. Three IOP measurements will be recorded, each with 5% confidence
      interval (CI). Blood pressure and end tidal carbon dioxide will be recorded hourly
      intra-operatively. The following surgical data will also be recorded: procedure duration,
      angle of inclination of surgical bed, anesthetic agents used, fluid volume given,
      transfusions given, blood loss volume and complications. Best corrected VA, IOP, VF, OCT and
      optic disc photography will also be recorded for each patient at the 1-month post-operative
      visit.
