  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fight against smoking is a public health priority. Without help, fewer than 5% of des
      smokers are abstinent at 12 months after smoking cessation.

      Despite well-managed attempts at smoking cessation with nicotine substitutes, the rate of
      success at 12 months in patients dependent on nicotine is only 18%. Moreover, other
      therapeutic strategies (acupuncture, hypnosis…) have not proved to be effective.

      The investigators propose a new therapeutic strategy for smoking cessation, which is based on
      associating nicotine substitutes (to reduce physical symptoms of weaning from nicotine) with
      rTMS at 1 Hz to the right DorsoLateral PreFrontal Cortex (DLPFC) for 2 weeks (to diminish
      craving for tobacco). The principal objective is to improve the success rate for smoking
      cessation attempts in patients who are highly dependent on nicotine, and who have failed
      using usual smoking cessation strategies.
