  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute stroke management represents a true medical emergency that requires prompt diagnosis
      and urgent treatment. In a previous exhaustive cohort study conducted in the Rhône region,
      France (AVC69) (Porthault et al. 2013) the investigators observed that only a small
      percentage of patients could access to thrombolysis in time. In this cohort of 1306 patients
      treated in one of the emergency department of the Rhone region for a suspected stroke, 84% of
      patients reached hospital through an emergency department instead of going directly to a
      stroke unit. Among those patients, only 2% were finally thrombolysed. A significant part of
      patients arrived in the emergency department too late to be thrombolysed. However, among the
      subset of ischemic stroke patients who reach emergency department less than 3 hours after
      symptoms onset, and who had no clinical or radiological exclusion criteria for thrombolysis,
      only 15 % were thrombolysed. The hypothesis was that an intervention designed to improve ED
      professional's knowledge and skills and to develop together efficient clinical pathway would
      decrease door-to imaging time and consequently door-to needle time and eventually improve
      overall thrombolysis rate.

      The investigators have conducted a cluster randomized controlled stepped wedge trial. All
      adult patients with suspected stroke arriving in one of the participating ED were included in
      the study along five successive four-month periods. The program featured: development of
      written materials (booklets) and video (film), and one day session of standardized training
      for trainers, at least one nurse and one physician of all EDs, with formal presentation to
      improve knowledge, and simulation to improve skills for using the &quot;FAST&quot; tool (nurses) and
      the &quot;NIHSS&quot; score (ED physicians). Additionally, a clinical pathway was developed to adapt
      general evidence based guidelines to the local organization. The primary outcome is the
      door-to imaging time.

    <description>The training program aiming at improving the timeliness of care of acute stroke patients in ED was designed for triage ED nurses and ED physicians and it was based on 3 sub-objectives:
Improving knowledge and skills of triage nurses to recognize patients with stroke symptoms
Improving knowledge and skills of ED physicians to recognize stroke symptoms, to realize a good quality neurological examination and be able to measure the NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Score), to have a better understanding of the physiopathology of ischemic stroke and thrombolysis, and to have a better understanding of the consequences of wasted time for patients Developing, together with other hospital professionals involved in acute stroke management, a clinical pathway adapted to the local characteristics an organization (ED organization optimization, management steps, connections between ED, radiology unit and stroke unit, thrombolysis organization).</description>
