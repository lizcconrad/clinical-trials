    <textblock>
      This study is a first in human study that will investigate the safety, tolerability and
      pharmacokinetics of ascending single doses of BAY1817080 using a placebo controlled,
      randomized, single center design. In addition the influence of itraconazole and food on the
      pharmacokinetics of BAY1817080 will be investigated.
