  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy premenopausal women were enrolled in a diet intervention study that examined the
      effect of a combination EPA/DHA supplement on risk factors associated with breast cancer. In
      a randomized cross-over design, women consumed their habitual diet with a supplement for
      three menstrual cycles, had three cycles of wash-out and then consumed a low-fat diet with
      the same supplement. Blood, urine and nipple aspirate fluid were collected periodically over
      the 10 month protocol and analyzed for biomarkers associated with supplementation and future
      risk of breast cancer.

      Non-pregnant, non-lactating women aged 18+ were recruited by way of posters, to take part in
      a dietary intervention study that was examining the effects of dietary fat level and fat type
      on risk factors associated with breast cancer. Women who were normally menstruating, consumed
      either their habitual diet or a low-fat diet for three menstrual cycles, along with a
      supplement containing 1.2 g DHA+EPA /day. This was followed by a 3-menstrual cycle washout,
      where the habitual diet was consumed without a supplement. Subsequently the participants
      consumed the other diet (either low-fat or habitual) for a further 3 menstrual cycles with
      the 1.2 g DHA/EPA supplement. Blood, urine and nipple aspirate fluid were collected at the
      beginning and end of each intervention period and analyzed for a variety of biomarkers. Diet
      records were collected continuously over the entire study period and periodic 7-day records
      examined for collection of detailed nutrition information. Anthropometry was completed at
      each study visit, and nutritional counselling provided throughout.
