  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of a mobile application that uses an Application
      Program Interface (API) to distribute evidence-based weight loss interventions. Half of the
      participants will receive this API-based application, and the other half of the participants
      will use a non API-based application.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test a weight loss app that uses an API to disseminate an
      evidence-based weight loss intervention. The investigators hypothesize that, over the course
      of 12 months, participants using the Leaner app will have lost more weight than those in the
      attention control group.

      Participants (n=206) will be randomly assigned to use either the intervention app
      (intervention arm; n=103) or a weight loss app of their choosing (attention control arm;
      n=103) for 12 months. Assessments will take place at baseline, and 3, 6, and 12 months.

      Statistical analysis: A linear mixed modeling approach will be used to test the hypothesis.
      Observed weight vs. time plots will be analyzed for all participants to discern general
      trends in weight change. The model will include an intervention effect, a time effect, an
      intervention by time interaction, and a random intercept.

      In exploratory analysis, investigators will examine weight change across subgroups of
      interest; investigators will add the subgroup variable and its interaction with the
      intervention indicator to the primary model. All analyses will be evaluated at the 0.05
      significance level.
