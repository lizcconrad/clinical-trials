  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate whether simple reminders about healthy lifestyle sent via mobile phone text
      messages can improve the liver cirrhosis severity and prognosis (as assessed by the MELD
      score supported by the Child-Pugh score) among patients with liver cirrhosis that have been
      through a 12-week supervised and facility-based physical exercise training program and
      in-patient rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise and other interventions focused on lifestyle factors have not only the
      potential to increase physical functioning and capacity, but also to affect fundamental
      aspects of disease, increase quality of life, and may even increase survival in patients with
      liver cirrhosis.

      Instruction and advice about a healthy lifestyle and physical activity are attractive as it
      limits time spent on supervised rehabilitation at an outpatient clinic. Further,
      self-management can be attractive to society as it can conserve health care resources.
      However, instructions and advice can only be effective if the patients adhere to them, and
      there is a need for initiatives that enhance the motivation to follow the advice and change
      undesirable behaviours.

      Mobile phone short-message service (SMS) messages are increasingly used to deliver
      interventions and enhance healthy behaviour. The technology is simple, cost-effective, can be
      automated, and can reach any mobile phone owner. In a recent systematic review, SMS-messages
      have been shown effective in a broad range of healthy behaviours, which was also highlighted
      in a randomized trial showing positive effects of lifestyle-focused SMS-messages on
      cardiovascular risk factors in patients with coronary heart disease. An SMS-message-based
      lifestyle intervention therefore seems like a feasible and effective means of enhancing
      motivation to follow advice about healthy lifestyle and physical activity among patients with
      liver cirrhosis.

    <time_frame>week -12, 0, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The MELD is a reliable measure of mortality risk in patients with end-stage liver disease. The MELD is based on a mathematical equation.
The MELD score is calculated using the following formula:
MELD Score = 9.57 x ln (creatinine mg/dL) + 3.78 x ln(bilirubin mg/dL) + 11.2 x ln(INR)+ 6.43</description>

    <description>The Six-Minute Walk-Test (6MWT) assesses general physical function. The test is performed in an undisturbed hospital corridor marked every 2 meters with coloured tape on the floor; starting and turning points marked by cones. Subjects are instructed to walk as fast as they can. They are allowed to stop or rest during the test if necessary and walking aids are allowed. The distance in meters covered during the 6 minutes is the outcome of the test.</description>

    <measure>30-seconds chair stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>week -12, 0, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The 30-seconds chair stand test (30-s CST) is performed in an undisturbed room with hands crossed against the chest. It is one of the most important functional evaluation clinical tests because it measures lower body strength and relates it to the most demanding daily life activities. A 30-s CST consists of standing up and sitting down from a chair as many times as possible within 30 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Muscle Power</measure>
    <time_frame>week -12, 0, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Leg Extensor Power Rig will be used to measure muscle power (force x velocity) in a non-invasive way. The participants will be in a seated position and a single explosive limb extension will accelerate a flywheel from rest. The participants will be instructed to kick the pedal as hard and fast as possible. Repeated kicks are performed, until a significant decline in power is observed. The kick with maximal power is the result of the text, and is recorded in Watts.</description>

    <description>As part of the usual assessment of the patients, standard blood samples (15ml) are drawn and analysed (4 visits x 15 ml = 60 ml per participant). The analyses include: Haemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cells, Bilirubin, ALAT, ASAT, INR, platelets, CRP, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, alkaline phosphatase albumin, coagulations factors II VII and X.</description>

    <description>Continuous Reaction Time (CRT) is a 10-minute computer-based test measuring the patient's reaction-time to a beep-sound and the patient's ability to concentrate. CRT-index below 1.9 is compatible with minimal hepatic encephalopathy .</description>

    <measure>Portosystemic Encephalopathy test</measure>
    <time_frame>week -12, 0, 12, 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Portosystemic Encephalopathy test (PSE) measures complex cognitive functions such as attention, accuracy, working speed, and visual orientation. It is a paper-and-pencil test consisting of five subtests: Digit Symbol test, Number Connection Test A, Number Connection Test B, Serial Dotting Test, and Line Tracing Test. Calculating the test score from the seconds spent on each subtest takes 5 minutes. The summed test score, the portosystemic hepatic encephalopathy score (PHES), ranges from 218 to 6, and a result below 24 is abnormal.</description>

    <description>A 12 week supervised and facility-based exercise training program. The program is facility based and supervised by a physiotherapist. The program runs 3 times weekly for 12 weeks. The exercise is group-based. The exercise program lasts approximately 1 hour and consists of a brief warm-up phase (bicycle ergometer at moderate intensity) followed by a circuit training program focusing on strength and endurance exercises of the large muscle groups (e.g. quadriceps).</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to usual care will receive instructions related to healthy living, alcohol absenteeism, and benefits of increased physical activity. The instructions will be provided by a physical therapist and/or a nurse, and will be given according to recommendations and local and national guidance. The participants are offered continued regular visits at the rehabilitation clinic, but no supervised physical exercise.</description>

    <description>Participants allocated to SMS-messages will receive the same intervention as usual care (see above) AND regular text messages via SMS over a 12-week period.
The text messages will be unidirectional and will serve as motivational information but will not allow two-way communication with a researcher or health professional about clinical management. The messages will provide information, motivation, and support to adhere to a healthy lifestyle, alcohol absenteeism, and physical activity and will reinforce the information and instructions received at the face-to-face information (usual care).</description>
