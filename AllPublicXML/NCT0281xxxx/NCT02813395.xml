      Objective: Investigating the immediate effects of Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) on
      neuromuscular performance in healthy subjects after an induced muscle fatigue protocol.
      Methods: Eighty volunteers of both genders aged between 18 and 28 years underwent a
      preliminary evaluation using surface electromyography and isokinetic dynamometer of the
      flexor muscles of the elbow. The subjects were randomly allocated into 4 groups: G1 was
      control group; G2 placebo; G3 laser applied before fatigue protocol; and G4 immediately
      after. Muscular fatigue protocol consisted of 30 maximal concentric isokinetic contractions
      at 120°/s of the elbow flexor muscles. An 808 nm equipment was used for applying laser
      therapy, with a power of 100 mW and total energy of 20 J. Volunteers were reassessed after
      interventions.

    <description>Low Level Laser Therapy was applied at four points to the dominant upper limb of the volunteers on the muscle belly of the biceps. Delineation was done using a measuring tape from the elbow joint line to the acromion marked at points corresponding to 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% of this distance, focusing the application on the muscle belly region, thereby excluding the tendinous region.
An 808 nm equipment was used for applying laser therapy, with a power of 100 mW and total energy of 20 J.</description>
