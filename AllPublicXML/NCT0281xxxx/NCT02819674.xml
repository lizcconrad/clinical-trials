  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HTN) is the most important cardiovascular risk factor which is responsible for
      50% of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and also a substantial public health problem
      affecting approximately 1/4 of the adult population in industrialized societies and over 1
      billion people worldwide. Chronically elevated blood pressure without well control puts
      people at increased risk of target organ damages, including stroke, myocardial infarction,
      congestive heart failure, end-stage renal disease, blindness, and death. Especially, these
      damages are dramatically more severe in the early-onset hypertensive population.

      In this study, the hypertensive individuals are consecutively recruited from multiple
      centers, with an early onset age (less than 40 when diagnosed). A complete clinical history
      (information on history of hypertension, demographic characteristics, personal and family
      medical history) are collected by a trained staff using a standardized questionnaire on the
      first day of baseline observation, and physical examination are also collected in a standard
      procedure. Blood samples are collected after 12-hour overnight fast and biological variables
      are determined. Genomic DNA is isolated from leukocytes according to a standard procedure.
      The individuals will receive follow-up in an ordinal system. The investigators will focus on
      the clinical and genetic features, genotype-phenotype correlations and influencing factors of
      prognosis in Chinese early-onset hypertension patients.
