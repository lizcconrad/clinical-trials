    <textblock>
      This post-authorization observational safety study (PASS) monitors clinically important
      identified and potential risks within a cohort of patients treated with naloxegol, including
      the occurrence of bowel perforation, acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, cardiovascular
      (CV)-specific mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal
      pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity. This study is part of a broader
      post-marketing commitment to augment routine evaluation of the safety profile of naloxegol in
      clinical practice.

      The overall research goal for this study is to provide additional data to characterize the
      safety of naloxegol in the indicated population and within at-risk vulnerable populations
      identified in the naloxegol risk management plan (RMP) by describing type and frequency of
      identified and potential risks (including bowel perforation, acute MI, stroke, CV-specific
      mortality, all-cause mortality, hypertension, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
      syncope, and change in pain severity) in patients ≥18 years of age diagnosed with non-cancer
      pain who were treated with opioids chronically and subsequently treated with naloxegol in
      routine post-authorization use.

      The primary objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of bowel perforation,
      acute MI, stroke, all-cause mortality, and hypertension in patients treated with naloxegol
      (Naloxegol Inception Cohort, (NIC)), a Concurrent Reference Cohort (CRC), and by
      pre-specified sub-populations that include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients,
      patients with prior cardiovascular risk, patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment,
      patients with concurrent methadone use, and patients with concurrent use of cytochrome P450
      (CYP) 3A inhibitors/inducer or P-glycoprotein (Pgp) modulators.

      An exploratory objective of the study is to assess the incidence risk of CV-specific
      mortality, opioid withdrawal, abdominal pain, diarrhea, syncope, and change in pain severity
      in patients treated with naloxegol (NIC), a CRC, and by pre-specified sub-populations that
      include patients aged ≥65 years, pregnant patients, patients with prior cardiovascular risk,
      patients with prior renal or hepatic impairment, patients with concurrent methadone use, and
      patients with concurrent use of CYP3A inhibitors/inducer or Pgp modulators.

        Patients in the targeted European countries who receive prescriptions for naloxegol will be
        identified for inclusion in the naloxegol inception cohort, while patients in these
