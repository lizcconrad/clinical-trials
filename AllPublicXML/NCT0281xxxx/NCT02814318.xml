  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to identify the duration of vancomycin administration at which
      group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization is eradicated from the vaginal and recto-vaginal
      mucosa. This will aid in labor management and delivery planning to ensure that the mother
      receives adequate GBS prophylaxis while also minimizing the duration of exposure to
      vancomycin. In addition, this could prevent unnecessary prolonged hospitalization or septic
      workup of neonates whose mothers received vancomycin intrapartum.

      This study aims to identify the time after administration of IV vancomycin at which GBS
      colonies are 100% eradicated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prophylaxis of group B streptococcus has been a major component of prenatal care in
      preventing early onset of neonatal sepsis. While penicillin remains the gold standard
      medication for prophylaxis, this medication is not an option in women who have high risk
      allergic reactions to this class of medications. Furthermore, with rising rates of antibiotic
      resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, more women are requiring vancomycin for GBS
      prophylaxis. While the CDC and ACOG recommend vancomycin as an alternative to penicillin for
      GBS prophylaxis, little research has been conducted investigating the transplacental passage
      of vancomycin.

      Because of the gap in knowledge regarding intrapartum effects of IV vancomycin on GBS
      colonization, neonates of women who received vancomycin are considered as inadequately
      treated for GBS prophylaxis, and subsequently undergo additional observation, prolonged
      hospitalization, and possible septic workup in the immediate postpartum period. Because of
      this gap in knowledge, this research study investigates how quickly vaginal and recto-vaginal
      GBS colonization is eradicated to aid in timing of delivery in patients with GBS colonization
      who require vancomycin intrapartum.

      In addition, the studies that investigated the duration of time of IV penicillin and IV
      clindamycin necessary for eradication of GBS colonization only investigated vaginal
      colonization, not recto-vaginal colonization. Their rationale was based on the assumption
      that most cases of neonatal GBS sepsis are caused by vaginal colonization. Given that the
      standard of care for GBS screening includes screening for colonization of both vaginal and
      rectal mucosa, investigators also plan to compare rates of eradication of GBS in vaginal
      colonies compared to recto-vaginal colonies.
