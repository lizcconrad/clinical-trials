  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, surgical removal remains the main clinical treatment for cardiac tumor patients.
      However, malignant tumors are hard to completely resect. Also, as thoracoscopic surgeries
      induce great operation trauma, some patients cannot tolerate or do not will to take the
      operation. Therefore, new methods and techniques are in urgent need.

      Our center have a 12-year experience of intervention treatment for solid tumors and has
      conducted several animal experiments to verify the effectiveness of transthoracic puncture
      ablation and radiofrequency ablation for ventricular muscle.

      The purpose of this study is to conduct new method of direct transthoracic cardiac
      tumor-targeted Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) and Laser induced Interstitial Thermotherapy
      (LITT), make minimally invasive treatment plans for cardiac tumor patients, and verify the
      safety and validity of intervention treatment in long term.

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use the peak velocity and of stenosis (by echocardiography) to quantify obstructive severity caused by the tumor. If the peak velocity increases, the symptom gets deteriorated; if the peak velocity decreases, the symptom gets relieved.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of cardiac function</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use ejection fraction(EF) to quantify the cardiac function. If EF is higher after the operation, the cardiac function gets recovered; if EF is lower after the operation,the cardiac function does't get recovered.</description>

    <measure>Quantification of tumor blood perfusion</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators use contrast-enhanced ultrasonography to quantify tumor blood perfusion. If there is no perfusion observed, the therapy is successful；if there is perfusion, the therapy is ineffective.</description>
