    <textblock>
      The multi-center study evaluates BrainPulse recordings from subjects with a suspected or
      confirmed concussion to improve a concussion detection algorithm. Subjects may also consent
      for a 5 additional follow-ups over a 21-day period to compare the progression of change in
      their BrainPulse recordings.

      The primary objective of this study is to collect un-blinded BrainPulse recordings from youth
      and adults that have a confirmed diagnosis of concussion per protocol guidelines in order to
      improve a concussion detection algorithm previously developed by Jan Medical, Inc. In order
      to gather sufficient variability, subjects with both confirmed concussion and suspected
      concussion will be included in the study as long as they meet eligibility criteria.
      BrainPulse recordings from subjects with suspected concussion will be compared to the
      recordings of subjects diagnosed with concussion. Subjects will be followed for 21 days after
      the initial injury with BrainPulse recordings to study the subject's recovery process. The
      symptomatic evaluation, physical examination, and BrainPulse recordings will be entered in a
      database to assess clinical outcome and device utilization.

    <description>The primary endpoint is to enroll and record BrainPulse signals from 500 subjects with a suspected concussion. To gather sufficiently diverse data, at least 300 participants will have had a confirmed diagnosis of concussion. The data will be used to improve the algorithm for aiding in the diagnosis of concussion.</description>

    <measure>Specificity: Percentage of BrainPulse recordings from suspected concussed subjects that do not have the signal pattern seen within BrainPulse recordings from confirmed concussed subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, expected to be 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary endpoint is to compare the BrainPulse readings from patients with confirmed concussion with patients with a suspected concussion in order to study the differences and similarities between the signals. The specific signal patterns observed from confirmed concussed subjects' BrainPulse recordings will be evaluated against the BrainPulse recordings from suspected concussed subjects who are later confirmed to not have a concussion and the percentage of such subjects will be evaluated as part of the secondary outcome. This can be seen as a specificity evaluation.</description>

    <description>The tertiary endpoint is to assess the differences in BrainPulse recordings between the initial visit and each subsequent follow-up visit to better understand the recovery process post concussion.</description>
