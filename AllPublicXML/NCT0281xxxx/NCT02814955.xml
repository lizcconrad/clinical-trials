  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmias with a constantly growing
      prevalence AF. The purpose of paroxysmal AF processing is to control outbreaks from these
      pulmonary veins, medicated way (antiarrhythmic) or interventional. Ablation (radiofrequency
      or cryotherapy) has become in this context recognized and effective treatment of AF. In
      addition, antithrombotic treatments in this context is a major treatments for the prevention
      of stroke (stroke). They are most often associated with antiarrhythmic treatment to prevent
      recurrence of AF or to slow it during a relapse.

      Recent experimental studies have highlighted the direct electrophysiological properties of
      dabigatran and rivaroxaban in the pulmonary veins and the left atrium. Dabigatran
      demonstrated in this study that it induced a prolongation of potential action in the
      pulmonary veins and the left atrium and it decreased the incidence of FA-induced by
      stimulation. Conversely, rivaroxaban induces shortening of the action potential in the left
      atrium (untested properties in the pulmonary veins). To our knowledge, apixaban and warfarin
      have not been studied in this context.

      It is therefore possible that some of the new oral anticoagulants (NACOS) or some AVK
      (fluindione and warfarin), have direct electrophysiological effects in the pulmonary veins
      and on the left atrium and could influence AF recurrences (with effect &quot; antiarrhythmic-like
      &quot;or rather a pro-arrhythmic effect) after ablation.A retrospective analysis conducted at the
      University Hospital of Caen on very low numbers suggest that patients on dabigatran would
      have less pulmonary veins connected in early ablation procedure that patients on warfarin or
      rivaroxaban. Despite the limitations inherent in this analysis (very low numbers,
      retrospective analysis, unique setting and having studied his own limits), these results are
      consistent with the fundamental studies, and thus encourage us to pursue our hypothesis to
      obtain more statistical power and reliability in our measurements and results.

      We therefore propose the study of the electrophysiological effects of NACOS (apixaban,
      dabigatran, rivaroxaban) and warfarin (warfarin and fluindione) on the pulmonary veins and
      the left atrium of patients referred for ablation of paroxysmal AF (radiofrequency or
      cryotherapy ) the CHU of Caen and Tours and clinic Saint Martin Caen.

        The study population corresponds to all patients referred for paroxysmal atrial
        fibrillation radiofrequency ablation , clinically stable, at Caen University Hospital,
        Tours and Saint-Martin clinic.
