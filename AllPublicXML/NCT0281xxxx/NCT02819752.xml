  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish whether the combination of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) and
      conventional cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy is tolerable and results in acceptable levels
      of acute and late toxicity in patients with stage IV LA-SCCHN. In particular, the study will
      provide data on the levels of mucosal and cutaneous toxicity within the radiation fields, as
      these are the primary acute toxicities associated with this treatment regimen. In addition,
      toxicity outside the radiation portals (which may theoretically be exacerbated by radiation)
      will be studied. However, all toxicity will be monitored. This study will also give an
      indication of the activity of pembrolizumab in LA-SCCHN because we are deliberately selecting
      a group of patients with high- and intermediate-risk disease who have a significant chance of
      experiencing loco-regional or systemic failure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single centre phase 1 dose-escalation study to confirm the safety of combining
      pembrolizumab with standard platin-based chemoradiotherapy in patients with stage IV high-
      and intermediate-risk locally-advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
      (LA-SCCHN). 6-36 patients (18 HPV+ve and 18 HPV-ve) will be recruited in a standard 3+3
      dose-escalation trial design with an expansion cohort at the maximum tolerated dose (or 200
      mg, if no DLT is defined). A pre-loading dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) of
      pembrolizumab will be given once the patient has completed the screening period. Patients
      will then return 2 weeks later to begin cycle 1 of a regimen of pembrolizumab 3 weekly at a
      dose of 100 or 200mg (dependent on dosing level) for a total of 7 cycles (3 during
      chemoradiotherapy and 4 after chemoradiotherapy).

      Parallel studies in HPV-ve and HPV +ve disease will be conducted (note these patients may
      have different patterns of co-morbidity and, hence, different treatment-related toxicities).
      The primary endpoint of the study will be safety and tolerability. Dose-limiting acute
      toxicity will be assessed during administration of study drug according to CTCAEv4.0. The
      maximum tolerated dose of study drug (or 200 mg in the absence of DLT) will be used in a
      subsequent randomised phase 2 study comparing standard-of-care therapy with standard-of-care
      therapy plus study drug.

          9. Female patient of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum
             pregnancy within 72 hours prior to confirmation of study eligibility. If the urine

             control or be surgically sterile, or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course
             of the study through 120 days after the last dose of study medication (Reference
             Section 6.7.2). Patient s of childbearing potential are those who have not been
             surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.

         11. Male patient s should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with

          1. Is currently participating in or has participated in a study of an investigational
             agent or using an investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of

             radiation therapy.

          5. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.

             meningitis. Patient s with previously treated brain metastases may participate
             provided they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four
             weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have
             returned to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are

             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the patient's
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of
             the patient to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.

         13. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.
