    <textblock>
      This study is to support the regulatory application of OneTouch Select® Plus test strips in
      China. The blood glucose test strip is regulated as an In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) product and
      China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) regulation of IVDs should be complied with. The
      result of this study will be used to support regulatory filing in China.

      Investigational Product:

      OneTouch Select® Plus test strips (test with OneTouch Select® Plus glucose meter)

      Objectives:

        1. Assess Lay User and Health Care Professional (HCP) fingertip test results obtained on
           OneTouch Select® Plus BGMS compared to a validated method (YSI 2300 glucose analyzer
           results), according to International Standards Organization( ISO) 15197:2003(E) section
           8.0 and ISO 15197:2013(E)

        2. Lay User System Use evaluation.

        3. Assess the effectiveness of the instructions for use of OneTouch Select® Plus BGMS
           (Owner's booklet) and insert of test strips for the lay user.

      Comparator(control) Product:

      YSI 2300 glucose analyser

      Acceptance Criteria:

      User Performance of the OneTouch Select® Plus Blood Glucose Monitoring system(described as
      OneTouch Select Plus below) is met if the lay user and HCP results obtained with OneTouch
      Select Plus meet the requirement stated in section 7.4.1 of ISO () 15197:2003(E). Further to
      meet the requirements of ISO 15197:2013(E) , the lay user results obtained with OneTouch
      Select Plus should meet the requirements stated in section 8.2 of ISO 15197:2013(E). The
      effectiveness of instructions for use is met , if for each item on the Instructions for Use
      Questionnaire, the 90% lower confidence limit (90% LCL) for the correct response rate is
      equal to or greater than 70%.

      Study Design and subject population:

      This study is an open, non-randomized clinical evaluation and will be conducted at a minimum
      of 2 sites in China. At least 240 evaluable diabetic subjects who meet the enrolment criteria
      will participate in this evaluation.

      Study procedures:

        1. Each potential Subject (or legally authorized representative) reads and signs the
           Informed Consent Form, and receives a signed copy.

        2. After completing an in-clinic familiarization session, the Subject lances a fingertip,
           obtains a drop of blood large enough for two meter tests, and performs a self-test using
           OneTouch Select Plus BGMS.

        3. Study staff immediately performs a blood glucose test from the same blood drop with a
           second set of OneTouch Select Plus BGMS with the same lot of test strips.

        4. Within 5 minutes of the Subject's self-lancing, study staff collects blood from the same
           finger puncture for hematocrit and reference plasma glucose testing (duplicate tests on
           the YSI 2300 performed by study staff).
