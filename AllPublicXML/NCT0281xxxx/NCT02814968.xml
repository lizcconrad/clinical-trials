  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the clinical utility of 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose Positron
      Emission Tomography (PET)/Computed Tomography (CT) and Whole Body Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) versus conventional bone scan and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements in
      response prediction to treatment with Enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer
      patients.

      The study will assess how these 2 imaging modalities perform compared to traditional serial
      PSA measurements and bone scan in assessing metastatic tumour load, progressive disease and
      response to treatment with Enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.

      In addition measurements of serially collected circulating tumour cell (CTC) samples,
      cell-free tumour DNA and RNA will be performed in order to evaluate their predictive value in
      terms of response measurement.

      Castration-resistant prostate cancer patients eligible for 2nd line hormonal treatment will
      undergo treatment with Enzalutamide (XTANDI). Subjects will receive 1dd 160 mg Enzalutamide
      orally continuously until progressive disease occurs.

      All subjects will undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 and 6, 9 and 12 months
      after starting androgen receptor-directed treatment. All subjects will undergo Whole Body MRI
      at baseline, 6, 9 and 12 months. Bone scans will be performed at baseline, 3 months, 6 and 12
      months. PSA will be measured at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter until at 12 months. CTC
      counts and characteristics will be measured at baseline and during Enzalutamide treatment.

    <description>Defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of radiological progression or death (patients will be followed beyond the fixed time point of 12 months for continued response cq recurrence, but 12 month is the last fixed primary endpoint assessment). Radiological progression is defined by any of the following criteria:
Soft tissue lesions: Progressive disease on 18F-FDG PET/CT or MRI by RECIST 1.1. Bone or bone marrow lesions: Progressive disease on PET/CT or MRI as evidenced by new lesions or an increase in size of 25% of the sum of target lesions.
Conversion of the 18F-FDG PET signal of the metastases at 2 weeks, 2 or 6 months compared to baseline PET which by comparing it to PFS at 6 and 12 months may be an indicator or drug response. Radiological PFS at 6 months will be compared to a) PET signal conversion and to b) PSA measurements, and changes in number of lesions on the bone scan (conventional work up).</description>
