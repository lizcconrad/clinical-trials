  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are two stages in the study. The major purpose of the Stage 1 is to study the safety
      and tolerability of the proposed dosage regimen of the study drug. The form of cannabidiol
      (CBD) used in this study is GWP42003, supplied by GW Pharmaceuticals. The dosage regime is
      based on their experience. This is an open label study in 10 subjects, during which the dose
      is gradually increased to the manufacturers recommended target dose, with tolerability being
      evaluated at each dose level. Based on the response of subjects in the Stage 1, a target dose
      is determined for the next stage. Standardized tools will be administered to study both
      tolerability and efficacy. Efficacy assessments are simply explorative, and are done to look
      for an effect that warrants specific or different evaluation in the next stage.

      The major purpose of Stage 2 is to assess the safety and tolerability of the GWP42003-P at
      the determined dose, and secondarily to study efficacy, particularly regarding tremor. Stage
      2 is a crossover, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 50 subjects.

    <textblock>
      Persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) have progressive disabling tremor, slowness, stiffness,
      balance impairment, cognitive deficits, psychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, fatigue
      and insomnia. Tremor may interfere with necessary daily and work functions. The disorder
      affects approximately seven million people globally. The total economic cost in the US is
      around 23 billion dollars. In addition to economic costs, PD reduces quality of life of those
      affected and their caregivers.

      Cognitive impairment is a common feature and ranges from delayed recall in early stages to
      global dementia in up to 80% at end stage. PD with dementia has been associated with reduced
      quality of life, shortened survival, and increased caregiver distress.

      Depression, anxiety and psychosis are also common and are particularly disabling in PD, even
      at the earliest stages. These symptoms have important consequences for quality of life and
      daily functioning, are associated with increased carer burden and risk for nursing home
      admission. Anxiety affects up to 40% of patients with PD, and may predate motor symptoms by
      several years. The most common anxiety disorders in PD are panic attacks (often during
      off-periods), generalized anxiety disorder, and simple and social phobias. Psychotic symptoms
      vary in frequency according to the definition used. If mild forms are included, these affect
      up to 50% of patients. Visual hallucinations are the most common type. However,
      hallucinations occur in all sensory domains and delusions of various types are also
      relatively common. The impact of psychosis is substantial in that it is associated with
      dementia, depression, earlier mortality, greater caregiver strain, and nursing home
      placement.

      Current therapies are inadequate. Medications have improved the prognosis of PD, but also
      have problematic adverse effects. Since treatment of PD is often unsatisfactory and since
      marijuana has recently become legal and readily available in Colorado, persons with PD have
      been trying it. Patients have heard from the internet, support groups and other sources that
      marijuana is helpful. Most are doing so on their own, without the supervision or even
      knowledge of their neurologist. In a survey conducted in the spring of 2014 in University of
      Colorado Movement Disorders Center (UCMDC) clinic about 5% of 207 PD patients, average age
      69, reported using marijuana. In the same clinic, about 30% of the PD patients have asked
      doctors during their visits over the past 6 months about marijuana. In another study Katerina
      Venderova and colleagues reported that 25% of PD patients had taken cannabis in the General
      University Hospital in Prague.

      PD mostly affects the elderly, and with the cognitive, psychiatric and motor problems,
      subjects are prone to falls. Cannabis is well documented to cause psychosis, slowness, and
      incoordination. Studies have also shown that chronic users have structural and functional CNS
      alterations. Thus cannabis is expected to be risky in persons with PD. Further, there are
      many components of cannabis, and the cannabis preparations being sold in Colorado vary widely
      in composition. There are no definitive data regarding the benefits and risks of these
      various preparations in PD. Studies on safety and efficacy are greatly needed to protect this
      fragile Colorado population.

      Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid that is present to a lesser extent in street marijuana,
      and limits delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)'s psychoactive effect. CBD acts in some
      experimental models as an anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti-oxidant, anti-emetic,
      anxiolytic and antipsychotic agent, and therefore has potential beneficial medical uses.
      Further, animal studies suggest that CBD is neuroprotective, perhaps due to reported
      anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory actions.

      Human trials report that CBD decreases anxiety and causes sedation in healthy individuals,
      decreases psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia and PD, and improves motor and non-motor
      symptoms and alleviates levodopa-induced dyskinesia in PD. The ratio of THC to CBD plays a
      role in the preparation's therapeutic outcome: strains of cannabis with higher concentrations
      of CBD did not produce short-term memory impairment vs. strains with higher concentrations of
      THC and lower concentrations of CBD.

      Many clinicians who suspect cannabis may have a positive effective upon a particular patient
      group have no idea of the cannabinoid profile that is being used. Without knowing the
      composition, it is impossible to draw any conclusions simply because of the huge variety of
      strains utilised.

      Given the current literature regarding CBD: possible neuroprotective effect, good
      tolerability, anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects and general lack of be well tolerated in
      PD, including its effect on tremor, the investigators hypothesize that CBD would be well
      tolerated and would reduce tremor, anxiety and psychosis, and would stabilize cognitive
      decline in PD. First the investigators will perform an open label study to determine a
      reasonable dose, and then a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to
      evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral CBD on tremor and other important aspects of
      PD. A strength of the study is that it uses well defined form or CBD.

      Stage 1: Open Label Dose Escalation Tolerability Study

      Primary Specific Aim: To confirm that the dosage regimen of CBD, in the form of GWP42003-P
      recommended by the study drug manufacturer is safe and tolerated in 10 subjects with PD.
      GWP42003-P is started at 5 mg/kg/day and is increased by 5 mg/kg at 3 day intervals to a
      target dose of 25 mg/kg/day.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To examine the effect of CBD on severity &amp; duration of tremor and
      other conditions that are problematic in PD.

      Stage 2: Randomized, Controlled Trial

      Primary Specific Aim: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CBD, in the form of
      GWP42003-P, in PD.

      Secondary Specific Aim: To examine the effect of CBD on severity &amp; duration of intractable
      tremor in PD.

      Exploratory Aims:

        1. To study the effects of CBD on cognition, anxiety, psychosis, sleep, daytime sleepiness,
           mood, fatigue, pain, impulsivity, other motor and non-motor PD signs, restless legs
           syndrome and REM sleep behavior disorder.

        2. To evaluate the effects of CBD on these same conditions at a low dose.

      The dose escalation tolerability study will be conducted in 10 subjects (the investigators
      will be recruiting up to 15 subjects to end up with 10) as an open label study lasting
      approximately 3 weeks followed by a 2-week safety follow up. Subjects are closely monitored
      as the dose is titrated. Subjects will have a screening visit, a baseline visit within the
      next three weeks, a visit when subjects are on 20 mg/kg/day, a final assessment visit when
      subjects have been on the maximal tolerated or the targeted dose for 10-15 days, and a safety
      visit 2 weeks later. The subject is to be on the maximal tolerated or targeted dose for 10-15
      days. Subjects will be called on the 3rd day of each dose. During phone calls subjects are
      monitored for adverse events, especially excessive daytime sleepiness, symptoms of
      hepatotoxicity, as well as changes in medical history and concomitant medications. Subjects
      are also called 3 days after stopping the study drug to check for signs of withdrawal.

      The main study is a randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind crossover design with two
      treatment phases, each of approximately 7 weeks duration separated by a 3-week washout phase.
      In each 7 week treatment phase subjects will start study drug and titrated up to the maximum
      tolerated or targeted dose (25 mg/kg/day). Each subject will have a screening visit, baseline
      visit within 3 weeks, a low dose visit (when on 5 mg/kg/day for 10-15 days), a visit when on
      20 mg/kg/day, a first end of 7 weeks treatment phase visit (subject reaches maximum tolerated
      or targeted dose), a start of second 7-week treatment phase visit, a low dose visit (when on
      5 mg/kg/day for 10-15 days), a visit when on 20 mg/kg/day, a second end of 7 weeks treatment
      phase visit and a safety visit (10 visits total). At the start of second 7-week treatment
      phase, subjects are dispensed and instructed to take study drug for the next treatment phase.
      Subjects will be called every 3rd day during dose escalation and every 10th day during the
      dose maintenance period (up to 25 mg/kg/day). During phone calls subjects are monitored for
      adverse events, symptoms of hepatotoxicity, and changes in medical history and concomitant
      medications. Subjects are also called 3 days after stopping the study drug to check for signs
      of withdrawal. Further, in case CBD alters the reliability of self - report, repeated
      measures will be taken of a set of tests three times: at baseline, low dose and high dose.
      During the 10 days that subjects are on a low dose the measurements will be taken on the 3rd
      and 9th day by phone and at the visit on the 10th to 15th day. During the 28 days on high
      dose the measurements will be taken on the 12th and 22nd day by phone and at the visit on the
      28th +/- 4 days. The phone assessments include the primary outcome (assessment of
      tolerability), SCOPA-sleep, Anxiety short form, Depression short form, Emotional and
      behavioral dyscontrol short form, and EQ-5D-5L.

    <description>Adverse events are measured primarily by a standardized phone script administered at each dose level. The phone script starts with an open ended question (Do you notice any effects, good or bad, of the study drug?) and followed by a series of yes/no questions regarding adverse effects (including previously reported adverse effects of CBD and general common adverse effects of medications), and all the effects we hypothesize in the study. For each adverse and beneficial reported effect, further questions will be asked, such as when did the effect start and how is it progressing, etc. In addition, since a major dose limiting effect, per GW, is somnolence, the daytime sleepiness part of the SCOPA-sleep is included in the phone script.</description>

A component of cannabis that has evidence suggesting it is relatively safe and perhaps neuroprotective, reduces tremor, anxiety and psychosis and is well tolerated in PD. Besides limiting the psychoactive effect of THC, studies support that CBD has anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, anti-oxidant, anxiolytic and antipsychotic properties.</description>
