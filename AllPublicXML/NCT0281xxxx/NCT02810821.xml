    <textblock>
      Deficiency in gonadal hormone has been considered to play a role in ageing related increased
      incidence of cardiovascular events. But the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. On the
      other hand, the dramatic increase in gonadotropin level didn't drew much attention when
      talking about the increased risk of cardiovascular disease during menopausal transition. This
      study aim to investigate the association between gonadal hormone, gonadotropin and long-term
      cardiovascular events.

        Adults aged of 18 to 75 years old. Part of the subjects (aged 40 years or more) were
        selected from REACTION study that was conducted from April,1, 2011 through May 30, 2012,
        aiming to investigate the epidemiology of metabolic diseases across China. The younger
        participants were recruited since July 1, 2014.
