  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop a SmarToyGym where sensitized, wireless toys are strategically hung
      and placed within reach of infants to elicit toy-oriented body and arm/hand movements. Each
      toy will be equipped with sensors capable of measuring the infant's grasping actions such as
      squeezing, pinching, tilting, etc.

      A low-cost 3D motion capture system will be used to collect video data and the infants'
      reaching and body kinematics in response to the toys. A pressure mat will be used to measure
      postural changes to detect weight shifts, rolling, crawling and other movements away from the
      initial posture. By capitalizing on these wireless and low-cost technologies, it will permit
      the regular and non-invasive monitoring of infants, which can lead to detailed,
      non-obtrusive, quantitative evaluation of motor development. In this vein, the investigators
      also aim to conduct proof-of-concept testing of the SmarToyGym with atypical and typical
      developing infants. The investigators will include infants' ages 3 to 11 months who are
      categorized as high-risk or low-risk using the Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener.

      The proposed research is specifically designed to investigate the ability of a novel tool to
      identify atypically developing infants from their typically developing peers. Twenty-four
      infants will be recruited to participate, including 12 who are developing typically and 12
      who are identified as at-risk for neuromotor delay. Infants with typical development will be
      at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age, score in the low-risk category on the
      Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS), score a greater than 85 on all sub-scales
      of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-II), have no history of significant cardiac,
      orthopedic, or neurological condition, and gestational age at least 37 weeks. Infants at risk
      for neuromotor delay will be at least 3 months and less than 11 months of age (corrected for
      preterm birth if applicable), score in the moderate or high risk categories on the BINS, and
      score an 85 or less on the motor sub-scales of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development
      (BSID-II). In an effort to decrease variability of the data, infants in each group will be
      further stratified into an older group (8-10+ months) and a younger group (3-5 months).
