      The purpose of the current feasibility study is to test whether the blood pressure level of
      the study patients can be effectively and safely managed according to the intensive
      antihypertensive treatment protocol. Furthermore, the study will also examine the effect of
      intensive antihypertensive treatment on the intermediate cardiovascular diseases outcomes,
      including CIMT, carotid plaques, PWV ABI, and kidney function, etc.

      The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT, NCT00794885) found that among hypertensive
      adults in China without a history of stroke or myocardial infarction, the combined use of
      enalapril and folic acid, compared with enalapril alone, significantly reduced the risk of
      first stroke. The mean systolic blood pressures were highly comparable between the two groups
      over the course of the trial (139.7mmHg and 139.8mmHg, respectively, in the enalapril-folic
      acid and the enalapril group). In the further analysis, lower systolic blood pressures seemed
      to be associated with greater reduction in cardiovascular outcomes in both of the treatment
      groups.

      However, due to inconsistencies in the results of the ACCORD and SPRINT trials, the
      appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure in effectively reducing cardiovascular events
      among hypertensive patients remain uncertain.

      The proposed trial aims to test the hypothesis that among hypertensive patients aged 60 years
      or older, a lower systolic blood pressure goal will lead to greater reduction in stroke
      incidence.

      The current feasibility study aims to test whether the blood pressure level of the study
      patients can be effectively and safely managed according to the intensive antihypertensive
      treatment protocol. Furthermore, the study will also examine the effect of intensive
      antihypertensive treatment on the intermediate cardiovascular diseases outcomes, including
      CIMT, carotid plaques, PWV ABI, and kidney function, etc.

      The current feasibility study will enroll approximately 100 patients with H-type hypertension
      (hypertensive patients with hyperhomocysteinemia) aged 60 years or older, and without a
      history of major cardiovascular diseases.

      Eligible patients will randomly assigned to one of three different systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) target groups (Group A, SBP: 140 - &lt;150 mmHg; Group B, SBP: 130 - &lt; 140 mmHg; and Group
      C, SBP &lt; 130 mmHg).
