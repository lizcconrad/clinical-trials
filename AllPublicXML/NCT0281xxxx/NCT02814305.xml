    <textblock>
      Background: Overdose deaths from prescription opioid analgesics quadrupled from 4,000 cases
      to nearly 17,000 cases annually during 1999-2011. Most people who misuse or abuse
      prescription opioids obtain these pills from friends or family members who have surplus
      medication left over from prior prescriptions. There is little published data on surplus
      opioid analgesics remaining after patients recover from painful procedures. Even less is
      known about patients' willingness to dispose of these leftover pills.

      Aims: 1) Measure the impact of a risk education intervention and a financial incentive
      intervention on patients' willingness to dispose of surplus opioids left over after
      outpatient dental surgery. 2) Measure the number and proportion of opioid pills left unused
      after outpatient dental surgery.

      Methods: The study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial. Adult patients at the Penn
      Dental Care Center will be enrolled prior to elective outpatient dental surgery. Patients
      will be randomized to a control group, an educational intervention, or a financial incentive
      intervention. The primary outcome of the trial is the proportion of patients in each arm that
      express willingness to return their unused opioids. Secondary outcomes include patient use of
      prescribed opioids and their number of unused pills. These outcomes will be measured using
      novel text-message based data collection software that patients will interact with using a
      web-enabled cellular telephone or tablet.
