  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the leak pressure of the recently
      introduced laryngeal mask airway, Ambu AuraGain performs superior to the established
      laryngeal mask LMA Supreme in surgical patients undergoing general anesthesia. This leak
      pressure is the pressure at which a gas leaks around the airway, which is a key marker of
      efficacy and safety of its use; a higher leak pressure suggests a better seal between the
      artificial airway and patient's airway.

    <measure>Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1 hr, 2hr and 24 hrs after the surgery</time_frame>
    <description>PONV in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU)- PONV will be recorded as only None for No PONV and Yes for present. Severity grading will not be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction of patient and the anesthesiologist with the device</measure>
    <time_frame>After 1hr in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU)</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction (5 point scale)- 0 for very dissatisfied to 5 for very satisfied Anesthesiologist satisfaction scale- Low, Moderate and High</description>
