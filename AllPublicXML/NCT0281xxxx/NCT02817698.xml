  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' project has two overarching goals. 1) The investigators will use newly
      developed positron emission tomography (PET) technology to investigate the dopaminergic
      neurochemistry of drugs of abuse including marijuana, traditional cigarettes, and cocaine,
      and 2) The investigators will extend PET technology to an additional neurotransmitter system
      - namely, the opioid-ergic system, using the same drugs of abuse.

      Aim 1. To examine the magnitude, location and timing of drug-induced dopamine release.

        1. Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight
           abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during
           the PET scan.

        2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight
           abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET
           scan.

        3. Cocaine users (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight abstinence
           from cocaine. Subjects will be administered cocaine during the PET scan.

      Aim 2. To examine the magnitude, location and timing of drug-induced beta-endorphin release.
      *The Investigators will attempt to use the same subjects from Aim 1 for Aim 2.

        1. Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during
           the PET scan.

        2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET
           scan.

        3. Cocaine users (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from cocaine. Subjects will be administered cocaine during the PET scan.
