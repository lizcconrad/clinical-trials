  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether protein intake during the first days of
      intensive care admission, in relation to body composition at intensive care admission as
      assessed on computed tomography scans made during routine care, is are related to clinical
      outcome in critically ill patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optimal protein and energy intake have been shown to be relevant for reducing mortality in
      prospective observational studies in mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the
      intensive care unit. However, nutritional status (protein mass, muscle mass) of patients at
      admission and possible consequences for clinical outcome are largely unknown. Computerized
      tomography scans can be used to assess muscle mass as a proxy for body protein mass.

      The investigators are especially interested in the effect of protein intake on clinical
      outcome in intensive care patients with different body protein mass at admission. This is
      relevant for appropriate formulation of clinical (protein) nutrition in this patient group.
      Therefore, the relationship between protein intake and patient outcome is evaluated in
      intensive care patients with low muscle and normal muscle area, using muscle area from
      computed tomography scans as a proxy of body protein mass.

      Additionally, data from computed tomography scans regarding muscle quality and muscle- and
      fat quantity are used to evaluate the prognostic value of body composition at intensive care
      admission. Finally, abdominal computed tomography scans are compared with thoracic computed
      tomography scans.
