      Importance: Currently the gold standard treatment for ambulant patients is corticosteroids.
      Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been reported to exert the proliferation of
      satellite cells, the regulation of myoblast proliferation, and the differentiation and
      promotion of muscle regeneration and repair.

      Objectives To evaluate the safety and efficacy of G-CSF in children and adolescents with
      muscular dystrophies Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy ,
      Fascioscapulohumeral dystrophy.

      Design, Setting, and Participants: Patients aged 5-15 with diagnosed muscular dystrophies
      will be included in an open study. Patients wheelchair-bound and and mobile and
      self-independent can participate in the study. Patients also treated with steroids can
      participate in this study. Clinical examination and physiotherapeutic and laboratory tests
      will be perform. G-CSF (5mcg/kg/body/d) is given subcutaneously for five consecutive days
      during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 6th and 12th months. Manual muscle testing (Lovett test) of the
      upper and lower extremities, isometric force with the hand dynamometer, and the 6MWT (six
      minute walk test) are measured before and after therapy.

      during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd. 6th and 12th months. Blood is sampled before G-CSF administration
      and on the 5th day of each treatment cycle.

      During each cycle of G-CSF administration physical therapy is also applied. Abdominal
      ultrasonography with a spleen assessment is performed before and after 7 days of G-CSF
      administration. Spirometry and electrocardiographic record are also performed. Side effects
      of G-CSF treatment will be assessed.

      Manual muscle testing (Lovett test) of the upper and lower extremities, isometric force with
      the hand dynamometer, and the 6MWT (six minute walk test) are measured before and after
      therapy. MRI of the gastrocnemius muscles will performed at the beginning and at the end of
      therapy.
