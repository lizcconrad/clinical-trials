  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles, even after adequate triggering, some patients present
      a high rate of immature oocytes retrieved after controlled ovarian stimulation. In vitro
      oocyte maturation is still an experimental technique, with poorer results than conventional
      IVF. For that reason improve in in vivo maturation could have a better impact on reproductive
      outcome.

      Investigators performed an observational study analyzing the difference in the percentage of
      mature oocytes retrieved in patients with more than 50% immature oocytes in a previous IVF
      cycle triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG) compared to the rate of mature
      oocytes retrieved in subsequent cycles, triggered with both gonadotropin-releasing hormone
      agonist (GnRHa) and (hCG). The main outcome measure was the number and percentage of mature
      oocytes retrieved.

    <description>Patients were scheduled by prescribing oral contraceptive (OC) for 12-16 days and recombinant FSH and/or highly purified u-hMG according to the patient`s age, BMI, antral follicular count, AMH and previous responses to ovarian controlled stimulation. GnRH antagonist was added when at least one follicle reached 13 mm. Ovulation was induced by hCG when at least 2 follicles had a mean diameter of 17 mm.</description>
