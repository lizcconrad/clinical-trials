  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of craniotomy in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage remains
      controversial. Two main types of minimally invasive surgery, endoscopic evacuation and
      stereotactic aspiration, have been attempted for hematoma removal and show some advantages.
      However, prospective and controlled studies are still lacking. This is a multi-center
      randomized controlled trial designed to determine whether minimally invasive surgeries will
      improve the outcome in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage compared with
      craniotomy. Patients will be randomly assigned to endoscopy group, stereotactic aspiration
      group and craniotomy group in a 1:1:1 ratio.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) is the most common hemorrhagic stroke. The
      morbidity and mortality exceed 60% and only 12% patients could live independently. The choice
      of surgical or conservative treatment for patients with HICH is controversial.

      Some minimally invasive neurosurgeries have been applied to hematoma evacuation and may
      improve prognosis to some extent. In endoscopic evacuation, a small burr hole is created and
      hematoma is removed through suction and irrigation under neuroendoscope. Endoscopic surgical
      evacuation promise to maximize hematoma evacuation while minimizing damage to normal tissue.
      Stereotactic aspiration uses image guidance to place a catheter into the main body of the
      hematoma and aspirate blood. In this study, about 900 patients will receive endoscopic
      evacuation, stereotactic aspiration or craniotomy according to the results of randomization.
      Patients will be followed up at 7 days, 30 days and 6 months.

      Outcomes of different groups of patients will be collected and compared. The study is
      designed to find a best surgical method for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.
