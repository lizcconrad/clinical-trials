      The purpose of this study is:

      To assess the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of ranolazine PR in healthy Korean and
      Caucasian volunteers after oral administration of Ranolazine at the doses of 375, 500, 750mg
      after single and repeated oral administrations.

      Ranolazine is an antianginal drug that exerts its effects by inhibition of the late sodium
      current in cardiac cells. This action reduces intracellular sodium accumulation and
      consequently decreases intracellular calcium overload which is expected to reduce myocardial
      stiffness, oxygen consumption and ATP utilization and improve blood flow to the
      microvasculature.These effects of ranolazine do not depend upon reductions in heart rate or
      blood pressure or vasodilation.

      Ranolazine PR, approved for treatment of chronic angina in 56 countries and currently
      marketed in 21 countries including the US shows clinical efficacy and tolerability in the
      proposed therapeutic dose range from 375 mg to 750mg. Factors that may affect ranolazine
      pharmacokinetics including demographics, drug-drug interactions, disease state, CYP2D6
      metabolizer genotype status and impaired renal or hepatic functions have been studied. The
      relationship between ranolazine plasma concentration and clinical effects has been also
      well-established. This PK study has been designed as a bridging study for Ranolazine PR
      registration in Korea.
