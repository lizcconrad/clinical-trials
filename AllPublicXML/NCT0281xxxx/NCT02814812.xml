  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatectomy represents the classic approach for resectable lesions of the pancreas,
      duodenum and periampullary region. Due to the technical skills required, the complex anatomy
      and the extreme fragility of the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic resection is still
      considered to be at risk of postoperative complication mainly due to pancreatic juice leaks.
      Anastomotic leaks are the major cause of morbidity and in-hospital mortality due to the
      activation of pancreatic enzymes and the following infectious and hemorrhagic complications.
      Severe complications negatively affect postoperative outcomes, long-term survival, quality of
      life, and costs. Operative mortality traditionally has been defined as the rate within 30
      days or during the initial hospitalization. But in pancreatic surgery mortality rates within
      90 days after pancreatic resection are double those at 30 days. In the present study, the
      investigators sought to evaluate the usefulness of postoperative CT-scan on the seventh
      postoperative day before discharging the patients to detect undiagnosed postoperative
      complication.
