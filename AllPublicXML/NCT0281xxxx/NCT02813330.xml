      Study sample:

      The convenience sample will be recruited randomly on the basic of odd number will have saline
      injection and even number will be given a placebo (Sterile water injection)

      Setting:

      Labor ward in Women's health center at Assiut university hospital

      Study design:

      Experimental Randomized control study

      Sample size:

      The sample size was calculated using the formula N= (Zα+Zβ)2 x 2p(1-p)÷d2 ,taking the level
      of significance as 5%, Zα=1.96 and power of the test as 80%, Zβ=0.84. p=0.113. A sample size
      of 165 in each group was calculated. Total of 330 women will be studied (165 in each arm)
