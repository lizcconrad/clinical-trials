      The aim of this study is to understand the epigenetic and transcriptomic mechanisms that
      regulate the fetal origin of adult diseases (FOAD), either for the presence of metabolic
      disorders in the future mothers, such as obesity or for the exposure to certain contaminants
      such as tobacco.

      To do that, the miRNAs profiles secreted to the endometrial fluid in obese women vs
      normoweight women during the window of implantation will be identified. Likewise, it will be
      studied how that miRNA signature is normalized once a substantial loss of weight is produced
      by the patients involved in the studied. In parallel, a comparison of the miRNA expression
      profiles secreted in the endometrial fluid in smoker women vs nonsmoker women will be
      performed. As in the previous case, it will be studied if after the exposure to these
      contaminant, the normalization of the miRNA expression signature occurs. Finally, an in
      silico analysis will be carried out in order to define the target genes and the metabolic
      pathways affected by the miRNAs profile secreted in both pathological conditions

      The developmental origins of adult disease are now recognized to be related to intrauterine
      conditions during embryonic and fetal life. Pregnancy begins with embryo implantation and its
      impact in adult life remains unknown. It has been demonstrated that human endometrial
      epithelium secretes specific microRNAs (miRNAs) during the time frame when the embryo enters
      the uterine cavity and initiates its adhesion to the uterine wall. Maternal miRNAs are
      secreted to the endometrial fluid, transported through exosomes or bound to proteins and
      consequently uptaken by the preimplantation embryo, before implantation occurs. As a
      consequence they suffer transcriptomic modifications that induce profound molecular and
      functional changes. The data already published demonstrate a novel paradigm: the
      transcriptomic maternal endometrial regulation of the pre-implantation embryo in health.

      Here, this novel maternal endometrium-based mechanism will be applied in order to understand
      and prevent the developmental origin of adult diseases induced during embryonic implantation
      either by metabolic disorders of future mothers who have developed obesity or by the exposure
      to certain contaminants such as tobacco. In this project, the expression profiles of secreted
      miRNAs will be identified in the endometrial fluid in obese women compared to normo-weight
      women. Also, it will be studied how this &quot;obese&quot; endometrial miRNA pattern is reversed after
      weight-loss. In parallel, murine models of obesity will be used to proof this concept. In
      addition, the expression profiles of secreted endometrial miRNAs will be identified in
      smokers versus future non-smokers mothers. As in the previous case, the reversion of this
      signature will be analysed after stopping the exposure to this contaminant.

      Then, &quot;in silico&quot; analysis will be done to select putative genes and functional pathways
      targeted by the signature of secreted endometrial miRNAs in the human and murine models in
      both pathological conditions. The determination of the transcriptomic and/or epigenome
      modifications induced by &quot;obese&quot; or/and &quot;smoker&quot; endometrial miRNAs in preimplantation mouse
      embryos is expected. As preliminary results, to support this project our accepted model of
      transcriptomic maternal endometrial regulation of the pre-implantation embryo in health, and
      the identification of a differential pattern of secreted miRNAs in the endometrial fluid of
      obese women compared to normo-weight counterparts is presented. In consequence, the
      application of this novel endometrium-based mechanism to the understanding and prevention of
      the origin of adult diseases related to obesity and/or tobacco exposure is proposed.

    <description>Endometrial fluid (EF) will be obtained from non-smokers normo-weight and obese patients in the receptive state. Samples will be collected 7 days after Luteinizing Hormone (LH) peak. They will be classified following the guidelines of the obesity classification system by the World Human Organization (WHO). Patients will be subjected to a fitness program during a year with the aim to achieve a weight reduction to normal values (19-24.9 kg/m2). The modifications in the miRNAs expression will be studied. After the weight loss, new EF will be collected from these patients.</description>

    <description>EF will be obtained from non-smokers and smokers normo-weight in the receptive state. Samples will be collected 7 days after Luteinizing Hormone (LH) peak. Smokers patients will be urge to give up smoking during at least one year. After this time, new samples will be collected to determine if the non-exposition to this contaminant could exert any effect in the miRNAs signature. A regular control will be done in this group of patients to ensure that they have not been exposed to tobacco in 12 months. Professional support will be given in the same centre of the study to help the patient to accomplish its objective.</description>

        Endometrial fluids from non-smoker obese and normoweight samples will be analysed in the
        window of implantation. In turn, endometrial fluids from normoweight smoker and non-smoker
        patients will be analysed in the window of implantation.

        These participants will be recruited in just one centre: IVI Valencia. Their recruitment
        will be done through a routine consultation carried out by the research team from the
        centre, as well as through the revision and daily evaluation of the medical reports and
        subsequent contact with those patients who could accomplish with the criteria selection and
