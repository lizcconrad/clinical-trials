      Our research project is to use a new microbiological diagnostic strategy of uveitis, allowing
      detection of the fastidious pathogens of infectious Uveitis who are not diagnosed by
      laboratory methods used in diagnostic routine. This new diagnostic strategy is to
      automatically detect the presence of a pathogen fastidious in cell culture using the same
      patient's serum to reveal a positive culture, based on the assumption that this serum
      contains antibodies specific pathogen tedious.

      Finally, the main purpose of this study is to improve the etiological diagnosis of Uveitis by
      establishing a new diagnostic strategy.

      The Mediterranean Infection microbiology laboratory is the national Reference Laboratory for
      the diagnosis of infectious Uveitis. The essential problem of the Uveitis is the etiological
      diagnosis since currently in 60% of cases no etiological diagnosis is brought out despite the
      deployment of routine diagnostic tests. The prognosis of the Uveitis is generally good but
      15% approximately of Uveitis are evolving on a chronic mode which decreased faster than the
      Visual acuity of the eye reached that can lead to blindness in bilateral cases of Uveitis.
      Different works of the literature identified a few pathogenic microorganisms, viruses and
      bacteria as being responsible for uveitis, including within the particular framework of the
      endophtalmies. Recent work allowed to highlight the place of fastidious bacteria (Bartonella
      spp., Tropheryma whipplei, Rickettsia spp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia spp.) in these
      Uveitis. Despite all his investigations, is estimated that 20-30% of Uveitis likely to be of
      infectious origin are not documented by the methods used in routine. Our research project is
      to use a new microbiological diagnostic strategy of uveitis, allowing detection of the
      fastidious pathogens of infectious Uveitis who are not diagnosed by laboratory methods used
      in diagnostic routine. This new diagnostic strategy is to automatically detect the presence
      of a pathogen fastidious in cell culture using the same patient's serum to reveal a positive
      culture, based on the assumption that this serum contains antibodies specific pathogen
      tedious.
