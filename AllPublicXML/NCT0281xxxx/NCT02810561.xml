  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is twofold. First the investigators would like to determine the
      trajectory of troponin leaks; if it can be shown that the participants who have only minimal
      elevations of their repeat troponin universally decrease on the 3rd level then future
      patients may see significantly improved length of stay. Second, given conflicting results in
      the literature, the investigators would like to determine if elevated troponin levels
      correlate to later cardiovascular complications. These complications will be defined as
      Death, Myocardial Infarction, Cardiovascular intervention (such as coronary artery stenting
      or bypass). As the investigator is a single hospital system in this county it is uniquely
      positioned to be able to review this retrospectively.

      The investigators therefore propose retrospectively studying participants diagnosed with
      Supraventricular Tachycardia who had troponin(s) checked in the ED between January 1, 2012
      and May 31, 2016 to allow a minimum of a year follow-up for our combined endpoint. The
      investigators will record the participants troponin value(s) in addition to the age, sex,
      race, heart rate, creatinine value. The investigators will compare the participants with
      positive troponins (and hopefully participants with strongly positive troponins) with those
      who are negative for troponin for presence of the combined end point via chart review.
