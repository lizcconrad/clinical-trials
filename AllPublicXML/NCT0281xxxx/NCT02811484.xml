  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see what the effects of using one or two additional diabetes
      drugs (dapagliflozin and exenatide-LAR) are on blood sugar levels in patients who are taking
      insulin. This research study is being done to investigate which of these commonly-used
      medications, medication combinations or increasing insulin dose is better.

    <textblock>
      This is a single center prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in overweight/obese
      patients with insulin treated uncontrolled type 2 diabetes

      Eligible subjects willing to participate in the study will be randomized to one of 3
      treatment groups:

      Group 1: Insulin titration + behavioral therapy Basal insulin titration upto 12 weeks with 2
      U increment every 3 days (Fasting glucose goal &lt;110) based on self-monitored blood glucose.

      After 12 weeks, patients with HbA1c &gt;8% will switch to a basal bolus regimen.

      Group 2: Exenatide-LAR 2mg q week x 24 weeks + Dapagliflozin placebo x 52 weeks + titrated
      basal insulin +behavioral therapy.

      Group 3: Exenatide-LAR 2mg q week x 24 weeks plus Dapagliflozin 5mg QD x 2 weeks followed by
      10mg QD x22 weeks +titrated basal insulin + behavioral therapy.

      Behavioral therapy will be delivered by registered dietitians and will include the BMIQ
      program -a web based medical weight loss program.
