    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assess the beneficial effect of a spirulina water
      extract (product named Spirulysat®) compared to a placebo in the blood level ratio of
      oxidized LDL / total LDL cholesterol in subjects with metabolic syndrome after 12 weeks of
      consumption
