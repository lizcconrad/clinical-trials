    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, gold standard observational trial designed to enroll consecutive,
      consenting ovarian cancer patients for the purpose of determining sensitivity of an assay
      that detects circulating tumor DNA. This observational pilot trial will also be used to
      examine the genetic variants/mutations present in the tumor tissue DNA.
