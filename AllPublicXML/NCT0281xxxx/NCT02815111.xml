  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to see if pain can be better controlled with fewer side
      effects. The new drug regimen will study several different medicines that have different ways
      of treating pain.

      The investigators plan to study an analgesic regimen of Ketamine and Lidocaine as infusions
      with Neurontin and acetaminophen delivered orally for postoperative analgesia and the
      subsequent effect on ventilator days and ICU stay. The investigators expect that pain scores
      will be either unchanged or better than historic controls. In addition, the investigators
      expect that ventilator days and ICU stay will be improved due to reduced incidence of
      delirium and bowel dysfunction.
