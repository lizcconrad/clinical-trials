  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel chemotherapy is commonly used in patients with breast cancer. With the widespread
      use of steroid premedication, the incidence of fluid retention and skin toxicity side effects
      has been minimal. Premedication with dexamethasone (8mg twice daily) is recommended starting
      the day before chemotherapy and continuing for three days. Patients may forget to take all or
      part of their premedication prior to docetaxel administration, and additional doses of
      steroids are frequently give in place of the forgotten oral dose. The processes around
      treating patients who have incorrectly taken their medication are cumbersome leading to
      significant delays in patients receiving their chemotherapy while the chemotherapy nurse
      tries to contact the patients treating physician for guidance on the dose and route of
      dexamethasone they want administered. Most importantly with the current standard of care
      procedure, by the time the chemotherapy nurse, pharmacist and medical oncologist have spoken
      and made a treatment plan, the patient has been waiting for on average of an additional 1-2
      hours before actually starting their chemotherapy.

      This study will randomize cancer patients to a standard dose of dexamethasone 8mg orally or
      to contact the physician to see what dose they recommend. The current trial proposal could
      therefore reduce the time for which patients are waiting to receive their chemotherapy,
      improving time patients need to spend in the hospital and significantly improving practice
      not just in Ottawa but globally.

    <description>The hospital cost for each patient encounter will be estimated using a standardized case-costing methodology that was developed by the Ontario Case Costing Initiatives. This case-costing method is based on the Canadian Institute for Health Information Management Information Systems guidelines. The case-costing system links financial, clinical and patient activity information stored within information systems of the data warehouse to define &quot;intermediate products&quot; (e.g., nursing time, medications, laboratory tests). Direct and indirect hospital costs for each intermediate product used during an encounter are then summed for each patient.</description>
