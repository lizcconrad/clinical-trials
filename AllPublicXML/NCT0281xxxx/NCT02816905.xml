    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effects of topical (Rimexolone versus Dexamethasone) on the
      IOP in children under 13 years of age who underwent bilateral strabismus surgery, and to
      compare the effects of topical (Rimexolone versus Fluorometholone) on the IOP in the children
      under 13 years of age who underwent bilateral strabismus surgery.

      Children under the age of 13 years undergoing bilateral strabismus surgery in Cairo
      University Hospitals (Cairo University Specialized Pediatric Hospital and Kasr Al Ainy
      Hospital). will be randomized using simple randomization method, computer software for
      randomization, into two equal groups:

        -  First group: One eye is randomized to receive topical 0.1% Dexamethasone, whereas the
           fellow eye will receive topical 1% Rimexolone four times per day for 2 weeks.

        -  Second group: One eye is randomized to receive topical 0.1% Fluorometholone, whereas the
           fellow eye will receive topical 1% Rimexolone four times per day for 2 weeks.

      IOP will be measured on the day before operation using the Tono-Pen®. Three reliable
      measurements will be obtained from each eye and the mean will be taken.

      IOP will be measured at postoperative weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 using the Tono-Pen®.
