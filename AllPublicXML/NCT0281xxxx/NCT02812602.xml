      Lidocaine patch is a safe and effective topical anesthetic agent for removal of metal staples
      after total knee replacement
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomised control trial. After informed consent, the patients who
      undergoes primary total knee replacement will be assigned to either control group or
      experimental group randomly. The effectiveness and complication will be analysed.

      If the patients are not medically fit for the study (including contraindications for
      lidocaine), they will be excluded.
