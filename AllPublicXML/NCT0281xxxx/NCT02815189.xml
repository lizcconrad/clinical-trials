      Aim to compare Incidence of flare-ups and apical healing after single-visit or two-visits
      treatment of teeth with necrotic pulp and apical periodontitis after a two-year control
      period.

      110 teeth with a diagnosis of pulp necrosis and apical radiolucency at the apex. Working
      length was established with EAL and confirmed radiographically. M4 system with Flex-R files
      were used to complete canal preparation. Level of discomfort were recorded and cases with
      severe postoperative pain and/or swelling were classified as flare-ups.

    <description>All treatment sessions were approximately 50 minutes in length to allow for acceptable time for completion of treatment and retreatment in one or two visits. All the clinical procedures were performed by the author. Following local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Septodont Saint-Maur des Fossés, France) and rubber dam isolation the tooth was disinfected with 5.25% NaOCl (Ultra bleach, Bentonville, AR, USA).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a) Radiographic evidence of apical periodontitis (minimum size ≥2.0 mm x 2.0 mm) and a
             diagnosis of pulpal necrosis confirmed by negative response to hot and cold tests and

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  patients without inclusion requirements or failure to obtain patient´s authorization.
             Patients, were excluded if they were younger than 18 years old, pregnant, had a
