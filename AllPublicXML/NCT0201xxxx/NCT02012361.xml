  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether breathing in helium reduces indications of
      injury to the skeletal muscle seen in blood tests after knee replacement surgery.

      The ability to reduce the risk of skeletal muscle injury may help improve patient safety by
      providing protection to the area of the body having its blood supply interrupted during a
      particular surgery.

      During hospitalization, beginning the day after surgery, additional tests will be added to
      the daily standard of care blood samples. When daily blood samples are not ordered as part of
      a study participants care after surgery, blood samples only for the study tests, may be done.

      Up to 60 study participants will be selected to be in one of two possible groups.

      After hospital discharge the study participants physical therapist will be contacted for
      copies of the notes and reports about the participants progress in physical therapy. This
      information will be used to evaluate if the different breathing gases have any impact on how
      quickly people recover after surgery.

    <description>This group will be treated with a single dose of inspired 75/25 heliox (75% helium 25% oxygen) breathed continuously for 15 minutes over any convenient window prior to the inflation of the surgical tourniquet. This will be the only change in their clinical care. Their anesthesia will be conducted as per routine and as the anesthesia team sees fit with a target FiO2 of 0.25, the only exception being that they will receive 75/25 heliox prior to the inflation of the tourniquet.</description>
