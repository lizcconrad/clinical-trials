    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of propranolol eye drops
      in preterm newborns with a precocious stage of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Preterm
      newborns (gestational age 23-32 weeks) with a stage 2 ROP (zone II without plus) will receive
      propranolol eye drops treatment until retinal vascularization will be completed.

      Propranolol concentrations will be measured on dried blood spots during the first 3 days of
      treatment and at the steady state. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters will be
      continuously monitored. Blood samplings checking metabolic, renal and liver functions will be
      performed periodically, as well as cardiac function, in order to verify the treatment safety.
      Serial ophthalmological evaluations will be planned to monitor the efficacy of the treatment,
      the ROP progression and the possible complications.

    <description>Eye drop propranolol is considered to be effective in counteracting the progression of ROP if the treatment decreases the incidence rate of progression from stage 2 ROP to more severe stage ROP (stage 2 or 3 with plus) from actual 38% to 19% or less.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the safety of eye drop propranolol we consider the plasma propranolol concentrations at the steady state. In particular it should be always less than 20 ng/ml, which is the plasma concentration, at the steady state, reported after oral administration of propranolol in the PROP-ROP study</description>

    <description>All the enrolled preterm newborns will receive propranolol as ophthalmic solution (0,1%): 3 microdrops of 6 microliters (μL) propranolol solution (= 6 μg propranolol/microdrop) will be topically applied with a calibrated pipette, in each eye, three times daily (every 8 hours).The treatment will continue until the complete development of retinal vascularization, but no more than 60 days.
The propranolol treatment will be always associated to the conventional approach adopted by the Early Treatment for Retinopathy of Prematurity Study (ETROP Cooperative Group.</description>
