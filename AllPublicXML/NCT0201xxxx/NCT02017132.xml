  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pomegranate has gained widespread popularity since the health effects of the whole fruit, as
      well as its juices and extracts, have been studied in relation to a variety of chronic
      conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, cancer and cardiovascular disease.

      The fruit consists of peel, seeds and berries or arils. The peel is rich in minerals and
      compounds such as polyphenols, but is not an edible part of the plant. In order to harness
      the benefits of all parts of the fruit, the whole fruit can be crushed and powdered and then
      easily consumed as pomegranate extract capsules.

      Pomegranate has been shown to be effective at reducing cardiovascular disease risk factors,
      particularly with respect to decreasing blood pressure and increasing insulin sensitivity.
      Dietary polyphenols may also suppress body fat growth. Recently, positive effects on fat
      reduction have been shown using pomegranate and its extracts. In animal models it has been
      shown for both extract and leaf that there were significant decrease in food consumption and
      body weight, inhibiting the development of obesity. In the few human studies, there appeared
      to be a trend towards a reduction in waist circumference and fat mass, plus a halt in body
      weight increase, for both juice and seed oil.

      This parallel, double blinded, randomised, placebo controlled trial aims to confirm previous
      results concerning the effect of whole pomegranate fruit on biochemical and physiological
      markers using a new pomegranate extract and to conduct original work to explore its effect on
      body weight, measurements and fat mass. Any similar interventions have not been double
      blinded or used pomegranate in extract form. Changes in physiological and biochemical markers
      will also be investigated.

      The study hypothesis is that pomegranate extract will reduce BMI and body weight, fat mass,
      body measurements and blood pressure.

      This is a parallel, double blinded, placebo controlled, randomised trial. It will be
      conducted over an 8 week intervention phase, plus a pre-intervention registration and
      preparation period. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the pomegranate extract
      or placebo groups. One capsule of Pomegranate or placebo will be taken after the same time
      daily meal with water for 8 weeks.

      Participants will be asked to visit the clinical lab three times. The first visit will be for
      baseline measurements and a 24 hour urine sample before the intervention begins; the second
      in week 4 for measurements only and the final visit in week 8 for measurements and the last
      urine collection. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements will be taken at each visit.
      Urine will only be collected pre and post intervention.

      The health related Quality of Life Questionnaire (Rand 36) will be administered at both the
      initial and final visits. This series of questions covers eight spheres of health and has
      been proven to be scientifically robust having been used in over 200 health related
      scientific trials.

      Three day diet diaries will be used for recording energy intake and to determine any
      fluctuations in dietary intake over the study period. These will be completed by participants
      in the pre-intervention week and then at week 4 of the intervention. Participants complete 2
      diet diaries in total.
