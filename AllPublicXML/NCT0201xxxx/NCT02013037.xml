  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All individuals who receive a heart transplant are at risk for developing antibody-mediated
      rejection (AMR). An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it
      detects a foreign substance, called an antigen. The mechanism of an antibody is to attack an
      antigen. In antibody mediated rejection, antibodies will attack the transplanted heart,
      causing injury to the heart. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if a study
      drug, called Eculizumab (Soliris), prevents antibody-mediated rejection in patients with high
      antibody production and prolongs long-term cardiac transplant survival.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The growing proportion of sensitized cardiac recipients presents an additional challenge to
      the transplant practitioner attempting to minimize the occurrence of antibody mediated
      rejection (AMR). Patients pre-exposed or &quot;sensitized&quot; to antigen exposing events (i.e.: blood
      transfusions, multiple pregnancies, prior organ transplantations, ventricular support
      devices) are more likely to both possess preformed and develop de-novo antibodies. Sensitized
      patients with panel reactive antibodies &gt; 25% are at risk for increased mortality after heart
      transplantation.

      A central component of antibody-mediated cell injury is complement activation. The inhibition
      of terminal complement activation may be the missing link to decreasing possibly both
      complement-mediated AMR and cellular rejection (CR) by inhibiting both the inflammatory
      effects of both circulating antibodies and cytokine induced cell death.

      Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to complement protein C5 with
      high affinity, thereby inhibiting its cleavage to C5a and C5b and preventing the generation
      of the terminal complement complex C5b-9. By this mechanism, Eculizumab (Soliris®) inhibits
      terminal complement mediated intravascular hemolysis in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
      patients.

      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, investigator-initiated safety and efficacy trial
      investigating the de-novo use of Eculizumab alongside conventional therapy to prevent
      antibody mediated rejection. The duration of the study will include an open enrollment period
      and at least 12 months of follow-up (post-transplant). The trial will enroll a total of 10
      &quot;sensitized&quot; patients with a panel reactive antibody score greater than 70%, who are not
      previously or currently enrolled in another ongoing trial. The use of Eculizumab will be
      un-blinded to all study and research practitioner participants. A historical cohort of 10
      additional patients will also be utilized for comparison.
