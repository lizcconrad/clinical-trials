      To compare radiographic and clinical outcomes and survival of mineral trioxide
      aggregate/ferric sulfate (MTA/FS) pulpotomy and root canal therapy (RCT) in carious vital
      primary maxillary incisors.

    <textblock>
      Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children. Caries of the primary maxillary
      incisors is common in young children; often necessitating either extraction or pulp therapy.
      The premature loss of primary maxillary incisors can adversely affect a child's dental
      occlusion, ability to properly size food boluses for swallowing, speech articulation, facial
      esthetics and psychosocial development. Pulp treatment of cariously exposed vital primary
      incisors may prevent premature tooth loss as well as eliminate pain. Currently, there is a
      paucity of outcome investigations with regard to pulp therapy in primary incisors.

    <description>Two disinterested pediatric dentists classified each treated incisor into one of three outcomes: N=incisor without pathologic change; Po=pathologic change present, follow-up recommended; and Px=pathologic change present, extract. Incisors rated N or Po were considered an acceptable radiographic outcome while incisors rated as Px were considered unacceptable.</description>

    <description>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for the MTA/FS pulpotomy and RCT treatment groups. One treated incisor was selected by random draw from each subject for survival analysis to preserve independence of observations.

          <title>MTA/FS Pulpotomy Group</title>
          <description>Children randomized to this arm will undergo a mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) pulpotomy after hemostasis is achieved using ferric sulfate (FS).
Mineral trioxide aggregate/ferric sulfate (MTA/FS) pulpotomy: After complete removal of all caries, if a pulp exposure is detected the pulp chamber will be opened and vital coronal pulp to a depth of 2mm below free gingival margin will be removed. A solution of ferric sulfate will be applied to the amputated pulp surface and then flushed with water. MTA paste is then used to cover over the exposed amputated pulp surface.</description>

          <title>RCT Group</title>
          <description>Children randomized to this group will undergo the root canal therapy (RCT) technique.
Root canal therapy (RCT): After complete removal of all caries, if a pulp exposure is detected the pulp chamber will be opened and the pulp tissue removed. The canal will be irrigated with water and then filled with non-reinforced ZOE.</description>
