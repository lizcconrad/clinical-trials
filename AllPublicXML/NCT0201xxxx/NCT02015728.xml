  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility clinical trial. In this trial, researchers are trying to
      figure out whether a medication can be chosen based on rapid testing done on tumor tissue.
      Information from a feasibility or pilot trial will hopefully help researchers plan larger
      trials in the future to determine the effect of this therapy.

      This research study will assign a specific drug treatment based on lab tests performed on the
      participant's tumor from tumor tissue taken from a biopsy done when he/she was first
      diagnosed or if taken when he/she relapsed or progressed. All participants will get
      Temozolomide and Etoposide to start. Then depending on review of the participant's tumor
      tissue he/she will also receive one of the following: Sorafenib, Everolimus, Erlotinib, or
      Dasatinib.

      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the feasibility of obtaining and using
      information from studies done on tumor tissue in order to help make treatment decisions for
      patients with relapsed or refractory pediatric brain tumors. The investigators also want to
      find out the effects this therapy has on the participant and the participant's brain tumor.

    <description>Tumor biology studies will be performed in a CLIA-approved clinical pathology laboratory using standard procedures. Immunohistochemical (IHC) testing will be performed on formalin fixed tumor obtained at the time of diagnosis and/or relapse. Results will be interpreted by a qualified pediatric pathologist and will be scored on a scale of 0 to 4+ commenting on both percentage of positive cells and intensity of staining. Results will further be reported as a binary result (positive/negative). If more than one tumor specimen is available from different surgical procedures (e.g. initial diagnosis and relapse), the results from the relapse specimen will be prioritized. Results will determine kinase inhibitor treatment arm assignment which will be administered in addition to the &quot;best available&quot; combination of low-dose oral cytotoxic agents, including temozolomide and etoposide.</description>
