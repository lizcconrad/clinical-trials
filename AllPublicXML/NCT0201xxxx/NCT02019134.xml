      Objective: To evaluate whether additional relaxation technique is more effective in the
      reduction of chronic neck pain compared to usual care alone.

      Study design: Open single-centered randomized two-armed pragmatic trial.

      Participants: 220 patients aged 18-65 years with chronic (&gt;12 weeks) neck pain and a mean
      pain score ≥ 4 on a Numeric Rating scale (NRS) in the last week before randomization who will
      be randomly allocated to two groups (relaxation, usual care alone as waiting list)

      Intervention: Participants apply either a daily 15-minute relaxation exercise guided by a
      smartphone application (&quot;app&quot;). or apply no additional intervention. The exercise should be
      applied daily, (minimally, five days per week) for 6 months. The app contains audios to guide
      autogenic training, muscle relaxation training and guided imagery. On a daily basis,
      participants can select one of the three exercises which they want to apply.

      Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean pain intensity after 3 months measured
      by the daily pain intensity on the NRS.
