  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents have an important role in child's diabetes management. Many studies show that
      parental psychological stress and family dynamics are associated with parental
      diabetes-related distress and treatment outcomes among children and adolescents with type 1
      diabetes.

      The aim of this study is to analyze diabetes distress (diabetes-related parenting burden and
      fear of hypoglycemia), parental psychological well-being (anxiety, satisfaction with life,
      positive and negative affect and adult attachment relationship pattern), family hardiness and
      characteristics of children with type 1 diabetes in a sample of mothers and fathers of
      children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes of ages up to 18 years.

      In this study it is hypothesized that:

        1. greater parental fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes-related burden are associated with
           lower family hardiness and worse psychological well-being parents and higher HbA1c
           levels in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes;

        2. mothers will report greater fear of hypoglycemia, diabetes-related burden and lower
           psychological well-being comparing to fathers.

        3. parents of children and adolescents with type 1diabetes will report greater anxiety,
           lower psychological well-being and family hardiness comparing to parents of children
           without diabetes.

      Standardized and validated questionnaires will be used to determine: parental fear of
      hypoglycemia, diabetes-related burden, parent level of anxiety, psychological well-being,
      adult attachment relationship pattern and family hardiness.

      The investigators will also measure parent daily involvement in child's diabetes management,
      frequency of blood glucose monitoring and parent general satisfaction with glycemic control.
      Objective measures such as child's HbA1c level and experience of severe hypoglycemia episode
      will also be obtained. These measures will be correlated with other research variables.
