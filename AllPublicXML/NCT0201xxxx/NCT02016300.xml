  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine clinical and radiographic outcomes of microfracture surgery (a common
      technique to address isolated areas of cartilage loss) in the knee used with or without
      unloader bracing. Randomly selected patients will wear an unloader brace, which is designed
      to take pressure off the area of the knee which underwent repair, for several weeks after
      surgery. Our hypothesis is that bracing may improve clinical and or radiographic outcomes.

      The surgery performed will be the same for all patients

      The length of follow up and schedule of post-operative MRI will be the same for all patients.

      The only difference in groups will be presence of absence of brace wear.

      The study will examine clinical and radiographic outcomes of microfracture surgery (a common
      technique to address isolated areas of cartilage loss) in the knee used with or without
      unloader bracing. Radiographic outcome will be assessed via MRI scans post-operatively.
      Randomly selected patients will wear an unloader brace, which is designed to take pressure
      off the area of the knee which underwent repair, for several weeks after surgery. Our
      hypothesis is that bracing may improve clinical and or radiographic outcomes.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome, Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>KOOS is a validated outcome score that evaluates knee symptoms, knee pain, knee use in activities of daily living, function in sport and recreation and knee-related quality of life. Statistical analysis will be applied to data at all time points including pre-operatively, 6 months post-surgery, 1 year post-surgery and 2 years post-surgery.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Outcome, Quantitative T1 Rho Analyisis on MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MRI will be performed at several time points up to 2 years after surgery. T1 Rho and T2 mapping will be performed at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. T1 rho examines cartilage health by quantifying glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content. Higher GAG concentrations are found in healthier cartilage.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome, Tegner score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple validated clinical outcome scores will be assessed at several points up to two years after surgery. The Tegner score establishes activity levels before and after surgery.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome, VR-12 score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple validated clinical outcome scores will be assessed at several points up to two years after surgery. The VR-12 score assesses quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Outcome, Lysholm Score</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple validated clinical outcome scores will be assessed at several points up to two years after surgery. The Lysholm score assesses symptoms with activities of daily living.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Outcome, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Multiple validated clinical outcome scores will be assessed at several points up to two years after surgery. The VAS is used to determine the patient's pain level at each visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Radiographic Outcome, MRI with Quantitative T2 Mapping</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>MRI will be performed at several time points up to 2 years after surgery. T1 Rho and T2 mapping will be performed at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after surgery. T2 imaging assesses hydration of cartilage as well as collagen fiber orientation and loss of type II collagen.</description>
