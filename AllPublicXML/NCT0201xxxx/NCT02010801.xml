  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver cancer including primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic liver cancers is
      one the most common malignancies in the world. Over 10000 new cases per year are diagnosed in
      Taiwan. Despite the many treatment options, the prognosis of HCC remains dismal. More than
      8000 people died of this cancer every year in Taiwan. A majority (70%to 85%) of patients
      present with advanced or unresectable disease. In contrast, small liver cancers can be cured
      with an appreciable frequency. Five-year disease-free survival exceeding 50% has been
      reported for surgical resection, and for the inoperable patients who do not have vascular
      invasion or extrahepatic spread. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is recommended as an
      alternative curative therapy. However, the main drawback of RFA is its limitation to tumor
      size and location. The tumors larger than 5 cm in diameter or located adjacent to vessels,
      could not be ablated completely.

      Irreversible electroporation (IRE), developed and manufactured by AngioDynamics US Ltd, can
      ablate tumor by fenestrating the cancer cell membrane by electric pulse. The anti-tumor
      effect does not result from thermotherapy, so is also not diminished by adjacent vessels.
      Several pre-clinical studies have already demonstrated IRE is a safe and effective treatment
      for live cancers. The system has received CE mark approval in 2008 and FDA approval in 2010.
      However, there is no experience in using IRE fro tumor ablation in Taiwan. In this study, the
      investigators will perform intraoperative IRE for the patients with liver cancers who are
      scheduled to receive hepatectomy in our hospital, and the investigators will evaluate the
      ablate effect of tumors on specimens, and the effect of adjacent vessels. The investigators
      will appraisal the clinical feasibility and advantage of the system by this study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The diagnosis of HCC or other cancers with hepatic metastatic with pathologic proven.

          -  The diagnosis of HCC will be made by pathology / cytology or according to the
             AASLD(2010) diagnostic criteria. In brief, Nodules larger than 1 cm found on
             ultrasound screening of a cirrhotic liver should be investigated further with either
             4-phase multidetector CT scan or dynamic contrast enhanced MRI. If the appearances are
             typical of HCC (i.e., hypervascular in the arterial phase with washout in the portal
             venous or delayed phase), the lesion should be treated as HCC. If the findings are not
             characteristic or the vascular profile is not typical, a second contrast enhanced
             study with the other imaging modality should be performed, or the lesion should be
             biopsied. Biopsies of small lesions should be evaluated by expert pathologists. Tissue
             that is not clearly HCC should be stained with all the available markers including
             CD34, CK7, glypican 3, HSP-70, and glutamine synthetase to improve diagnostic
             accuracy.

          -  Suitable for surgical resection, but the distance between tumors and preserved vessels
             is less than 5 mm. Adequate safe margin can not be obtained.

          -  There are at least one tumor, but less than or equal to 3 tumors,

          -  Each tumor must be ≤ 5 cm in diameter,

          -  Serum creatinine ≦ 1.5 x upper limit of normal

          -  Prior Informed Consent Form

             anti-arrhythmic therapy or requiring pace maker

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension

          -  Any active metal implanted device (eg Pacemaker),
