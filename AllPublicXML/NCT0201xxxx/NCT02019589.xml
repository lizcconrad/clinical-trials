      This study will be a Phase 3, randomized, three-cycle, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel group, multiple-dose design.

      The study design has four phases: Screening Period; Open-Label Estrogen-Priming Period
      (Run-In Period); Blinded Treatment Period; and Follow-Up. The Open Label Priming Period and
      Blinded Treatment Period cover a total of three 28-day cycles. Clinical evaluations will be
      performed at the following time points:

      Screening Period:

      • Screening Period (approximately 42 Days)

      Open-Label Estrogen Priming Period (Run In Period):

        -  Visit 1 Baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1)

        -  Telephone Interview (Cycle 1, Day 28 [- 3 d to ±1d])

      Blinded Treatment Period:

        -  Visit 2 Randomization (Cycle 2, Day 12 [±2d])

        -  Visit 3 Interim (Cycle 3, Day 12 [±2d])

        -  Visit 4 End of treatment (Cycle 3, Day 24 [±1d])

      Follow-Up Period:

        -  Visit 5 Follow-Up (Approximately 10 days after the last treatment)

        -  Telephone Interview (Approximately 2-4 weeks after completion of progestin course) (Only
           applies to subjects receiving an approved progestin therapy for proliferative
           endometrium, as determined by biopsy.)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be female, premenopausal, 18 to 40 years of age (inclusive, at the time of
             randomization)

          -  Have secondary amenorrhea, defined as the absence of menstruation for at least 90 days
             prior to Visit 1 (Cycle 1, Day 1).

          -  Have an intact uterus.

          -  Be otherwise healthy, as judged by the Investigator physician, based on a medical
             evaluation performed during the screening period prior to the initial dose of

               -  a normal or non-clinically significant physical examination, including vital
                  signs (sitting blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature).
                  Acceptable sitting systolic blood pressure is &lt;140 mmHg and diastolic blood
                  pressure is &lt;90 mmHg at screening. A subject may be taking up to two
                  antihypertensive medications.

                  during screening. An acceptable breast examination is defined as no masses,
                  adenopathy, or other findings identified that are suspicious of malignancy.

               -  a normal or non-clinically significant 12-lead ECG as determined by the Principal
                  Investigator (PI) or medical Sub-Investigator.

          -  Have a history of diabetes, thyroid disease or any other endocrine disease. (Subjects
             with diet-controlled diabetes or controlled hypothyroid disease at screening are not
             excluded.)

          -  Have a history of undiagnosed vaginal bleeding.

          -  Have any history of endometrial hyperplasia, uterine/endometrial, breast or ovarian
             cancer.
