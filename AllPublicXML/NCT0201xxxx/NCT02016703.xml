      Purpose of this study: assess the maximum tolerated bolus dose of erythritol, delivered in a
      clear beverage, compared with placebo (saccharose) in 4-6 year old children.

  <detailed_description>

      The study is a randomized placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over trial designed to
      determine the gastrointestinal (GI) responses and maximum tolerated dose of erythritol in
      young children as a single oral dose in a beverage in-between meals.

      The children were divided into 4 dose groups. In each group of children, only one dose level
      was tested such that each child was exposed to only a single dose level versus placebo. The
      erythritol dose started at 5 grams and was increased by 10 g between each group of children
      only if the preceding dose level was found to have no significant GI tolerance effects. The
      effects on faecal parameters and gastrointestinal complaints were recorded in order to
      determine the threshold dose. After finding a significant difference in tolerance between
      erythritol and placebo in the 25 g dose cohort, a protocol amendment was approved allowing
      the investigators to study a dose of 20 g.

      Test materials were prepared by Cargill, Vilvoorde, Belgium and supplied in bottles
      containing 250 mL of a noncarbonated fruit-flavoured (two flavours: strawberry and orange)
      clear drink sweetened with erythritol at four different dose levels: 5, 15, 20 and 25 g
      (equivalent to 2, 6, 8 and 10% w/v erythritol, respectively). Placebo was supplied in an
      identical manner but prepared with common nutritive carbohydrates (saccharose and
      maltodextrin) and providing an equivalent sweetness to that of the corresponding erythritol
      beverages (i.e.: 1.4, 4.2, 5.6 and 7% w/v).

      In total 185 healthy young children aged 4-6 years were recruited at three clinical
      investigation centres after informed consent of both parents; 184 completed the study.
