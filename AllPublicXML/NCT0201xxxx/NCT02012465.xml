  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are no guidelines for the management of glucocorticoid- (henceforth steroid) induced
      elevated blood sugars (henceforth hyperglycemia). Oncology ward patients have particularly
      high rates of hyperglycemia and are frequently exposed to high dose steroid therapy. A prior
      study by Muthala et al. (unpublished data) found a relationship between insulin requirements
      needed to maintain normal blood sugars, patient weight, and mg of steroid administered. In
      this pilot study, through an endocrine consult team, a weight-based, steroid dose-based
      insulin protocol will be implemented for the management of hyperglycemia in lymphoma patients
      requiring high dose steroid therapy, with the goal of reducing hyperglycemia incidence.

    <description>For diabetic patients, as part of the initial chemotherapy orders on admission, the following will be calculated by the primary oncologist to determine the amount of neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin needed to cover steroid use in prednisone equivalents (all insulin in this study is to be administered subcutaneously):
Use 0.1 (mg of prednisone equivalent - 20)/20 x weight (kg) to estimate total insulin in 24 hours (Total daily dose (TDD))
Total daily NPH dose will be divided equally based on the frequency of steroid administration, and given with each steroid dose.
For nondiabetic participants with hyperglycemia recruited during admission, the inpatient oncology team will consult the endocrine team within 24 hours of eligibility for NPH dosing as above.</description>

    <description>Within 24 hours of admission for diabetic participants, the inpatient oncology team will consult the endocrine team to apply the following part of the protocol, confirm NPH insulin dosing, and ensure that oral hypoglycemics are held.
The following basal-bolus protocol is standard of care for inpatient diabetics requiring insulin at Barnes Jewish Hospital. The alternative practice has been to use 60-80% of the home insulin regimen while patients are hospitalized. For patients using home insulin, the admitting oncology team will enact one of these methods while awaiting the endocrine service's formal recommendations.
Determine basal-bolus insulin requirement for the patient based on body weight: Patient weight (kg) x 0.5-0.7 Units/kg = Units of total insulin per 24 hours
The TDD can be divided into 50% basal (glargine) and 50% meal time (lispro) insulin, plus sliding scale insulin (lispro).</description>
