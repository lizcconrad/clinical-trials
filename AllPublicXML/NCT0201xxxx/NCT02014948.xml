    <textblock>
      The lumbar spine is currently one of the most affected areas by nociceptive processes ,
      referred back pain, which can be provided from a herniated intervertebral disc . Such
      conditions are considered a public health problem , since considerably affect the population
      , mainly young adults , which may lead to functional disability and absenteeism . Soon , his
      treatment involves high costs and rehabilitation time indefinite , generating great
      scientific interest focused on the search for new techniques that can provide an acceleration
      of functional recovery of these individuals .

      Thus , the establishment of evaluation protocols that provide quantitative data concerning
      the functional capacity is of utmost importance . From the electromyographic analysis , one
      can measure the electrical activity of muscle and identify abnormal patterns of response. For
      the identification of kinematic changes becomes useful equipment capable of recording the
      speed and angle of movement, as the accelerometer . Another evaluation method applicable to
      cases of herniated disc and back pain is the force platform to quantify the ground reaction
      force during the stance phase of the movement . Also , the quality of life should be taken
      into account as routinely observed psychological impairment involving issues related to
      vitality, emotional and social aspects , which can be identified through the questionnaire of
      quality of life ( SF -36 ) .

      With regard to physical therapy intervention , we seek to use resources to compose promising
      treatment program along with conventionalexercises. A novel therapy in the treatment of back
      pain is the whole body vibration , as it promotes increased range of muscle spindles via
      increasing the tonic vibration reflex and consequently improving the mechanism of involuntary
      muscle control . Thus , the association between an accurate assessment , exercises and
      therapy vibratory seeks early rehabilitate individuals affected by back pain or herniated
      disc , delaying or even avoiding surgery .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are currently various treatment techniques have been employed for the rehabilitation of
      patients with functional back pain in general. However , it is essential to search for
      resources to compose the therapeutic treatment program along with conventional exercises.

      With regard to the functional rehabilitation , physical therapy , has emphasized the muscles
      directly involved in the painful process (Richardson et al . , 1999) . Through exercises
      primarily used in functional rehabilitation , it is possible to treat and prevent impairments
      , restore function , promote physical and social well being . The therapeutic approach of the
      column follows the same principles as other structures , keeping up the proper precautions
      concerning the region's proximity to the spinal cord and nerve roots ( Kisner , Colby , 2005)
      . On this basis several treatments have been proposed , however , the most effective therapy
      is still a matter of controversy .

      It is known that back pain can result in neurological imbalances , mainly affecting the deep
      muscles of the trunk and paraspinal , multifidus and transversus abdominis ( LINDGREN et al .
      , 1993; HIDES ; Richardson , Jull , 1996; HODGES ; Richardson , Jull , 1996). We observe a
      reduction in these shooting action potential and changes in motor control , represented by
      weakness, atrophy and reduced functional capacity ( HODGES ; MOSELEY , 2003; MACDONALD ;
      MOSELEY ; HODGES , 2006; RENKAWITZ ; BOLUKI ; Grifka , 2006 , RICHARDSON ; HODGES ; HIDES ,
      2004; BARR ; GRIGGS ; Cadby , 2007) .

      Therefore, an appropriate exercise program should be able to provide muscular support ,
      minimizing the risk of disability by recovering the functionality of the spine ( McFeely ;
      GRACEY , 2006). For this purpose it is recommended to strengthen the abdominal muscles ,
      lower back and lower limbs ( HANDA et al . , 2000; CALMELS et al . , 2004; Lidder ; BAXTER ;
      GRACEY , 2004; HAYDEN et al . , 2005; McFeely ; GRACEY , 2006; RODACKI et al . , 2008) .

      Currently the lumbar stabilization is considered a beneficial technique in the treatment of
      patients with low back pain , because in addition to reduce painful symptoms , promotes
      strengthening the stabilizing muscles such as multifidus and transversus abdominis . (
      O'Sullivan , TWOMEY ; Allison 1997, Richardson et al. 1999; HIDES ; jull ; Richardson , 2001;
      YILMAZ et al. 2,003 ; Choi et al. 2005).

      In studies carried out by Kjellby - Wendt et al. (2001) , Mannion et al. (2007) Johansson et
      al. (2009 ) it was possible to prove that the lumbar stabilization associated with stretching
      and strengthening exercises for the lower back , abdominal and lower limbs was effective in
      reduction of pain of the patients concerned .

      Furthermore, there was a close relationship of low back pain with decreased range of motion
      and flexibility ( Takala , 2000) . Thus , another approach indispensable and complementary
      treatment for herniated disc is muscle stretching , it is able to provide a reduction in pain
      and decreased pressure within the core ( KUUKKANEN ; Malkia , 2000; HAKKINEN et al. 2,005 ;
      Kisner , Colby , 2005) .

      The vibration is considered an innovative feature in the treatment of chronic low back pain
      and herniated disc as many musculoskeletal effects are noticed from this . According to Silva
      (2011) for exposure to vibration, it is possible that the muscles produce a force about 15
      times higher than that produced in normal conditions, in order to oppose the action of
      gravitational force . Cardinale and Bosco (2003 ) stated that the vibration causes changes in
      muscle length , so in an attempt to mitigate this effect , the afferent influence the motor
      response , causing modulation of muscle stiffness . According to Bishop cited Barbosa (2009 )
      in response to stimulation of the muscle spindle is an isometric contraction known as the
      tonic vibration reflex ( RTV ) , which is accompanied by a reciprocal inhibition of the
      antagonist and blocking myotatic reflex .

      Thus , along with the voluntary contraction , this therapy provides improved motor control
      and strengthening exercises , to increase the range of activation of muscle spindles
      triggering the tonic vibration reflex ( BOSCO ; CARDINALE ; TSARPELA , 1999; Rittweger ;
      BELLER ; Felsenberg , 2003; Curry ; Clelland cited DIEEN ; SELEN ; CHOLEWICHI , 2003; SILVA ;
      Couto ; SZMUCHROWSKI , 2008) . For present inability to generate muscle strength needed to
      avoid instabilities in the affected segments , the vibration becomes a relevant resource in
      the treatment for chronic low back pain and disc herniation ( YILMAZ et al . , 2003) .

      Although they represent a major cause of pain and functional disability , does not observe
      the use of biomedical instrumentation for quantitative analysis in clinical practice , such
      as guiding therapeutic management.

      For the establishment of an appropriate physical therapy intervention becomes necessary to
      use equipment to assess that provide quantitative data regarding the patient's functional
      capacity , since the current legislation does not allow the physiotherapist to request tests
      such as MRI , CT and rays -X. It is believed that the association between an accurate
      assessment and appropriate treatment can guide the therapeutic making it more effective in
      attenuation of pain , allowing functional improvement of patients with disc herniation and
      low back pain in general.

      - Surface Electromyography

      As a result of the pain , it triggered a defense mechanism that results in a change in motor
      recruitment deficit represented by the generation of muscle strength and increased agonist
      antagonist activation ( DIEEN ; SELEN ; CHOLEWICHI , 2003; Larivière et al . , 2003; BASSANI
      et al . , 2008) . Aimed at quantifying motor function becomes useful a resource as surface
      electromyography , which enables the recording of muscle electrical activity in real time ,
      allowing the identification of abnormal patterns of response ( Portney , 2004) . The device
      comprises electrodes reference surface and connected to the unit via cables sealed , and
      sensor preamplifiers information leading to electrical activity , and also biofeedback unit .
      The collected data are stored in the computer for further analysis , normally made by means
      of the square root of the mean square value (RMS ) comprising the result of the signal
      amplitude by means of the average power in the time interval considered , containing
      information about the number of motor units fired at a given motion ( Hamill , Knutzen ,
      1999; DE LUCA , 2002; MACHADO , 2008; O ' SULLIVAN , SCHMITZ , 2010) .

      - Platform Power

      Another evaluation method applicable to cases of herniated disc is the force platform that
      consists of two rigid surfaces interconnected by means of sensors , allowing to quantify the
      ground reaction force during the stance phase of the movement ( BARELA ; DUARTE , 2011) .
      Thus , it is of great interest because patients tend to adopt an antalgic posture , reducing
      the weight bearing on the limb ipsilateral to the disc herniation .

      - Accelerometer

      It is known that patients with low back pain may suffer biomechanical changes that directly
      influence kinematic and kinetic parameters . Therefore , it is appropriate to examine the
      speed , amplitude and angle of movement . Therapists and patients can benefit from the use of
      a device able to provide such data in a simple and flexible , making it easy to conduct and
      providing greater comfort to both. Therefore , we developed a device called accelerometer ,
      which is composed of three parts , which are : sensor , receiver and software for data
      conversion on the computer .

      The sensor is part of the equipment positioned in the joint under consideration. Each sensor
      is constituted by a microcontroller, a three-axis accelerometer and a processor network . The
      microcontroller communicates with the accelerometer chip through a Serial Peripheral
      Interface ( SPI ) . When prompted , the accelerometer chip microcontroller sends the values
      of X , Y and Z corresponding to the force vector ( Gaino , 2010) . From these values the
      microcontroller assembles a data packet to be sent via wireless communication . The processor
      sensor network is restricted to connecting to the network , and is therefore called end
      device .

      The function of the receiver is receiving the sensor data and send them via serial
      communication to the computer . Finally , a software program is responsible for converting
      data received from the accelerometer sensor .

      To determine the angle of inclination of a certain body part, the program is designed to
      break the force vector of three vectors ( X , Y, Z ) , from which one can obtain the angle of
      each axis if the calculation the angles of the three vectors with their respective unit
      vectors . The system provides the angles for the three Cartesian axes every 0.5 seconds of
      exercise.

      The software also provides the function to calibrate , allowing to adopt the pertinent angles
      to each patient as a starting position , keeping the slope from this position . Data is
      written to a text file and automatically stored in a folder on the local disk C :/ , the
      identification data occurs by the date and time naming each file generated .

      - Questionnaire Short Form Health Survey ( SF -36 )

      Commonly , patients with chronic pain face psychological problems that directly affects their
      self-esteem and social interaction . Thus , we have the Short Form Health Survey ( SF -36 )
      widely used in assessing the quality of life of patients with low back pain ( MILANI et al .
      , 2009; VERESCIAGINA ; AMBROZAITIS ; AKAUSKAS , 2009; AHRENS ; SCHILTENWOLF ; WANG , 2010;
      Luedtke et al . , 2011; HAUGEN et al . , 2011) . It is a non-specific questionnaire
      consisting of 36 items divided into social function , mental health index , physical and
      social function , pain index , vitality , physical appearance and emotional and general
      health perceptions , which concludes the evaluation protocols volunteers in this study (
      Rosanova et al . , 2010) .
