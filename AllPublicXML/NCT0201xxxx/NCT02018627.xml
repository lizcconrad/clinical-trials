      This study will test the hypothesis that micro-doses of Xerisol Glucagon (Xeris
      Pharmaceuticals) will be non-inferior by pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic criteria vs.
      micro-doses of Glucagon for Injection (Eli Lilly).

      This study will test the hypothesis that micro-doses of a new formulation of stable glucagon,
      Xerisol Glucagon (Xeris Pharmaceuticals), will be non-inferior by pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic criteria vs. micro-doses of a freshly reconstituted formulation of glucagon
      that has poor stability in solution, Glucagon for Injection (Eli Lilly).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 21 to 80 years old with type 1 diabetes for at least one year.

          -  Diabetes managed using an insulin infusion pump using rapid-acting insulin such as
             insulin aspart (NovoLog), insulin lispro (Humalog), and insulin glulisine (Apidra) for
             at least one week prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.

          -  Unable to comply with study procedures.

          -  Current participation in another diabetes-related clinical trial that, in the judgment
             of the principle investigator, will compromise the results of the clamp study or the
             safety of the subject.

          -  Pregnancy (positive urine HCG), breast feeding, plan to become pregnant in the
             immediate future, or sexually active without use of contraception.

          -  End stage renal disease on dialysis (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis).

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 11.5 gm/dl.

          -  History of pheochromocytoma. Fractionated metanephrines will be tested in patients
             with history increasing the risk for a catecholamine secreting tumor (paroxysms of
             tachycardia, pallor, or headache; personal or family history of MEN 2A, MEN 2B,
             neurofibromatosis, or von Hippel-Lindau disease; episodic or treatment of refractory
             hypertension, defined as requiring 4 or more medications to achieve normotension).

          -  History of adverse reaction to glucagon (including allergy) besides nausea, vomiting,
             or headache.

          -  Inadequate venous access as determined by study nurse or physician at time of
             screening.

          -  Liver failure or cirrhosis.

          -  Any other factors that, in the judgment of the principal investigator, would interfere
             with the safe completion of the study procedures.
