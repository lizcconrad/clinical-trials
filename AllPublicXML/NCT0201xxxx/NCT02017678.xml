    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm open-label Phase 2 study in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of
      ovarian origin that are not eligible for curative treatments. Patients will receive 5 weekly
      IV infusions of JX-594 until radiographically determined progressive disease. Patients will
      be allotted in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a laparoscopy and tumor biopsy 10 days after dose 1 or
      10 days after Dose 5. Patients will be monitored on study until evidence of progression or
      death or for 12 months post treatment.

      This is a single-arm open-label Phase 2 study in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis of
      ovarian origin that are not eligible for curative treatments. Patients will receive 5 weekly
      IV infusions of JX-594 and will continue to receive IV infusion of JX-594 every 3 weeks until
      radiographically determined progressive disease. Using a 2 stage trial design, if 2 or more
      of the first 15 patients show a clinical response as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumors 1.10 criteria (or if 3 of the 15 have stable disease as defined by Modified
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or clinically), the arm will be expanded to
      a total of 25 patients (Stage 2).

      In Stage 1, patients will be allotted in a 1:1 ratio to undergo a laparoscopy and tumor
      biopsy 10 days after dose 1 or 10 days after Dose 5. A decision as to whether laparoscopy
      will be performed in Stage 2 will be reached at the conclusion of Stage 1.

      Patients will be monitored on study until evidence of progression or death or for 12 months
      post treatment
