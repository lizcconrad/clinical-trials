        Diagnosis of RA, according to the ACR/European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2010
        Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria with ≥ 3 months disease duration, ACR Class
        I-III functional status, based on 1991 revised criteria (Appendix B, 5).
        Moderate-to-severely active RA, defined as:

        o high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) ≥ 6 mg/L

        Laboratory parameters within the normal range (or defined screening threshold for the
        Investigator site), unless the Investigator considers an abnormality to be clinically
        irrelevant for RA patients; however following lab values must be met:

          -  Hemoglobin &gt;8.5 g/dL

          -  White blood cells &gt;3000/mm3

          -  Neutrophils &gt;2000/mm3

          -  Platelet count &gt;150 000 cells/mm3

        Exclusion criteria:

        Prior or current significant concomitant illness(es) that, according to Investigator's
        judgment, would adversely affect the patient's participation in the study.

        Women of childbearing potential not protected by highly-effective contraceptive method(s)
        of birth control (as defined in the informed consent form), and/or who are unwilling or
        unable to be tested for pregnancy.

        Participation in any clinical research study that evaluated an investigational drug or
        therapy within 5 half-lives or 60 days of the Screening, whichever is longer.

        Patients with active TB or a history of incompletely treated TB. History of chronic
        infection or active infection. History of, or current, autoimmune or inflammatory systemic
        or localized joint disease(s) other than RA.

        A systemic hypersensitivity reaction, other than localized injection site reaction, to any
        biologic drug.

        History or presence of drug or alcohol abuse. Prior or current interstitial lung disease
        diagnosed by high resolution computed tomography and/or lung biopsy with consistent
        findings on pulmonary function tests and corroborating clinical findings.

        Prior or current history of malignancy, including lymphoproliferative diseases, other than
        adequately-treated carcinoma in-situ of the cervix, nonmetastatic squamous cell or basal
        cell carcinoma of the skin, within 5 years prior to the screening visit.

        Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, defined as glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥9% at the
        screening visit.

        Current treatment with anti-TNF agents or other biologics. Current treatment with
        RA-directed biologic agents with non- TNF-α antagonist. Any contra-indications to
        simvastatin, according to the applicable labeling. Current treatment with a statin within
        14 days before inclusion.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a patient's
        potential participation in a clinical trial.
