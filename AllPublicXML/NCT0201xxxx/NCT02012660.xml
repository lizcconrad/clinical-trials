      The objective of this study is to explore the relationship between moderate to severe
      hyponatremia and heat.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will explore the relationship between heat wave and moderate and severe hyponatremia in a
      population of adult patients admitted in the emergency department of a primary and tertiary
      care teaching urban hospital. We will compare the prevalence of hyponatremia between summer
      and winter periods. We will describe the types of observed hyponatremia and describe the
      characteristics of the patients suffering of moderate to severe hyponatremia.
