  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The colonic microbiome is essential in health and disease, and is highly dynamic during the
      first several years of life. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and histamine-2 receptor
      antagonists (H2RAs) are widely used in children, but the effects of PPIs and H2RAs on the
      pediatric colonic microbiome are unknown. This study will determine whether acid suppression
      with these medications affects the microbiome of otherwise healthy children who are
      prescribed acid suppression for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and determine the
      duration and magnitude of microbiome changes.

    <textblock>
      Otherwise healthy children age 0-4 years old who are being considered for acid suppressive
      therapy for GERD will be eligible for this study. Subjects donate samples before and after
      being treated with PPIs or H2RAs (must donate at least 2 baseline pre-PPI samples to be
      eligible for final analysis). 30 total children who complete the study (anticipated 10 who
      receive lifestyle modification and 20 who receive PPIs or H2RAs). All children will donate 6
      stools on or about weeks 0, 4, 12, 20, 38, and 64. The primary outcome will be a significant
      change in the overall diversity of the colonic microbiome after 8 weeks of PPIs or H2RAs
      (i.e., from week 12 to week 4), compared to after 4 weeks of lifestyle management.
