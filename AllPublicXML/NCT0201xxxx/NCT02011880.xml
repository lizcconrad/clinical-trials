      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Evaluate the effect of the Chinese herbal medicine on relieving the bone pain for
           patients with breast cancer bone metastasis.

        -  Evaluate the effect of the Chinese herbal medicine on improving the quality of life and
           shrinking and slowing the growth of the cancer in women with breast cancer bone
           metastasis.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized,multicentric, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Patients
      are dynamic randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I:Patients receive traditional Chinese medicine(trial drugs) and endocrine therapy
           for 3 months.

        -  Arm II:Patients receive placebo and endocrine therapy for 3 months. All patients will be
           followed up for another 3 months with the trial drugs and endocrine therapy.

      According to the sample size estimate:There are 296 patients (148 per treatment arm)will be
      collected in this trial.
