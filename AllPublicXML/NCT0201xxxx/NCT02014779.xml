    <textblock>
      Objectives: This study will evaluate the efficacy of internet-based relapse prevention with
      therapist support, as compared to face-to-face therapy at an employee assistance program. The
      design is a two-armed randomized controlled design, and outcomes are measured in terms of
      changes in problematic alcohol use, as well as depression and quality of life.

      Method: Participants with problematic alcohol use who, after an initial evaluation consisting
      of five face-to-face sessions with a licensed psychologist where alcohol and collateral
      problems are extensively assessed, are recommended treatment for problematic alcohol use.
      Consenting participants will be randomized into one of two groups: 1. Internet delivered
      relapse prevention with therapist support or 2. Face-to-face therapy. Outcomes on alcohol
      use, depression and quality of life as well as information on user satisfaction will be
      gathered post treatment. Follow up will be at 3, 6 and 12 months after completion.

      Our hypothesis is that the internet-based program with therapist support and the face-to-face
      therapy will be equally effective in reducing alcohol use (non-inferiority).
