  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that 95% pure EGCG can protect brain cells in patients with Multiple
      Sclerosis. To test this hypothesis we are going to compare the changes in n-Acetyl-Aspartate
      (a chemical that reflects the number of neurons and their metabolism) over one six between
      people with MS treated with EGCG at a dose of 400mg twice a day and people with MS treated
      with a matching sugar pill.

      This will be a double blind placebo controlled trial of Theaphenon 95% (95% pure
      Epigallo-catechin-galleate [EGCG]) as a treatment for MS.

      The primary outcome will be the changes in N-Acety-Aspartate (NAA) levels over six months.
      Secondary outcomes will be changes in brain atrophy over over six months. As an exploratory
      outcome we will correlate changes in NAA levels with free Plasma levels of EGCG 8 hours after
      the morning dose.

      Exploratory outcomes include disability progression by Expanded Disability Status Scale
      (EDSS), multiple sclerosis functional composite components and a cognitive test battery.

All the voxels available for each subject where estimates have a standard deviation(SD) &lt;30 will be used. A spatial anisotropic exponential covariance structure will be used.</description>
