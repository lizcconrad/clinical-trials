  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preventing late onset of Cystinosis such as neurological complications and improving
      compliance to cysteamine treatment remain major challenges in management of subjects with
      cystinosis.

      This study is designed to describe the relationship between compliance of patients with
      cystinosis treated with cysteamine and treatment efficacy and to understand the
      pathophysiologic mechanism of neurological disorders. Is cysteamine crossing the blood brain
      barrier? What is the impact of cystine accumulation in Cerebro Spinal Fluid and Central
      Nervous System? Our Primary objective is to study the relationship between compliance of
      patients treated with cysteamine and the WBC cystine level.

      Secondary, the study will assess relationship between compliance to cysteamine and its
      neurological consequences.

      The expected duration of the study is 48 months. The enrolment period is 24 months and the
      study participation of each subject is 24 months. Eligible participants are male and female
      (age &gt; 4 years) with confirmed diagnosis of cystinosis and receiving any oral cysteamine
      treatment: Cystagon or RP103.

      The compliance under cysteamine is measured using electronic devices, accountability of study
      treatment, and information in patients' diary. Specific memory and visuoperceptual tests are
      performed at the beginning and at the end of patients'participation. Nuclear Magnetic
      Resonance spectroscopy is used to detect possible sites of cystine accumulation in the CNS
      and their relationship with compliance to cysteamine treatment. NMRS is also used to
      establish a relationship with the neuropsychological status of the subject.

      To describe absorption, distribution and elimination of cysteamine, and its metabolic
      pathways, and to determine the concentration effect and dose effect relationship, blood
      samples are performed at each study visit. A lumbar puncture is also proposed to participants
      to verify if cysteamine is crossing the blood brain barrier. New tools are used to compare
      metabonomic networks in patients with cystinosis and their controls.

    <description>PD measurements will be performed at D1, M1, M3, M6, M9, M12, M15, M18, M21 and M24.
Compliance under cysteamine will be measured from D1 to M24 using electronic devices (date and time of bottle opening are recorded), accountability of study treatment and information of patients' diary. Compliance measurement between two consecutive study visits will be expressed as the proportion of the observed number of opening compared to the expected number and the cumulated dose taken compared to the expected dose.Compliance will be first considered as a dichotomous variable, the compliance being described as satisfactory if greater than 95% during a specific period.Compliance will then be considered as a quantitative variable</description>
