    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the efficacy of triheptanoin oil in patients with
      GLUT1 deficiency syndrome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:

      - to evaluate the capacity of triheptanoïn to improve the condition of patients with GLUT1-DS

      The secondary objectives of the study are:

        -  to confirm the short-term safety of triheptanoïn therapy in patients with GLUT1-DS

        -  to evaluate the short-term effects of triheptanoïn treatment on motor function,
           autonomy, quality of life and clinical signs of patients with GLUT1-DS

        -  to evaluate the effect of triheptanoïn on brain energy metabolism using non-invasive
           31P-MRS spectroscopy after activation of the occipital cortex in order to measure the
           levels of high-energy phosphates (such as ATP and phosphocreatine)

    <description>Should the whole blood levels of propionylcarnitine increase above 8 μmol/l, the dose of triheptanoin will be reduced until the decrease of whole blood propionylcarnitine is below 8 μmol/l. Should an organic acid abnormality such as an excessive urinary excretion of propionate metabolites such as 3-hydroxypropionic, 2-methylcitric, propionylglycine, tiglylglycine and/or methylmalonic acid occur, the dose of triheptanoin will be reduced until normalization of the organic acid and acylcarnitine profile. If still abnormal, patient will be excluded from the study. For GI distress, the research dietitian will instruct the patient regarding taking the dose over a longer period of time (30 minutes). If GI distress persists, triheptanoin dose will be reduced by 50% and re-increased progressively as the problems resolve with the patients working closely with research dietitian until tolerance of the full dose is achieved.</description>
