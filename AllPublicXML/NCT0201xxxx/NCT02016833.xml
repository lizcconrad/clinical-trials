    <textblock>
      This study is a clinical study aiming at establishing immunological assays for the
      qualitative and quantitative evaluation of WT-1, Survivin and HPV16 E7-specific immune
      responses in cancer patients. Such a study will allow the development of suitable
      immunological tools to be used in assessing response in a subsequent phase I study aiming at
      evaluating therapeutic vaccine candidates targeting WT-1, Survivin and/or HPV16 E7-expressing
      tumors. In addition, this study will help defining the baseline cancer-associated immune
      responses in the selected patient population.

      Cervical and ovarian cancer patients, as well as leukemia patients, will be included in this
      study.

      WT-1, Survivin and HPV-specific immune responses will be monitored in these patients by ex
      vivo and cultured IFNg ELISpot as well as tetramer staining.

        Three type of patients will be enrolled in this study:

          -  Women with a confirmed diagnosis of serous or undifferentiated ovarian cancer

          -  Women with a confirmed diagnosis of CIN3 or cervical cancer

          -  HLA-A2 positive men or women with a confirmed diagnosis of AML of CML All these
             patients will be less than 70 years of age and will show no evidence of active
             progressive disease on follow up. For ovarian cancer patients, a woman with a rising
             CA125 and negative imaging is acceptable.
