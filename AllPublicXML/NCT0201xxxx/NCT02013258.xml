  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) have been found to have a deficit of
      oxytocin-producing neurons and decreased oxytocin receptor gene function, so the purpose of
      this study is to determine if oxytocin (OT) administration will improve some of the aspects
      of Prader-Willi syndrome that are particularly troublesome for children and their families
      (the insatiable appetite and social behaviors).

      The research questions are:

        1. Does intranasal oxytocin cause any side effects in children with PWS?

        2. Does intranasal oxytocin administration alter appetite or behaviors in PWS?

      This study is to investigate if intranasal oxytocin will improve hyperphagia, social skills,
      and behaviors in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome. This will be a randomized placebo
      controlled pilot study. The primary outcome measure is to determine if intranasal
      administration of oxytocin will cause any adverse events in subjects with Prader-Willi
      syndrome. Secondarily, the investigators will also perform evaluations to determine if
      intranasal oxytocin has any effect on social skills, behaviors, or appetite in children with
      Prader-Willi syndrome.

    <description>Quantitative evaluation of hyperphagia via the Hyperphagia Questionnaire obtained on days 1, 4 and 6 during the 7 day study protocol and conducted in the evening on these days. Score will range from 0 (no hyperphagia behaviors) to 96 (most severe hyperphagia behaviors). Additionally quantity of food consumed will be recorded on Days 1,4, and 6.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of anxiety, food issues, irritability, social communication and behavioral issues will be measured on days 1, 4 and 6 using:
Aberrant Behavior Checklist: Behavior rating scale used to measure behavior problems of children and adults with intellectual disabilities ages 6 - 54 years. Scores will range from 0 (no problem behaviors) to 174 (severe aberrant behaviors).
Social Responsiveness Scale:designed to measure the breadth of repetitive behaviors. Scores will range from 64 (no repetitive behaviors) to 260 (severe repetitive behaviors).
Repetitive Behavior Scales-Revised: Designed to measure the breadth of repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorder including: Ritualistic/Sameness Behavior; Stereotypic Behavior; Self-injurious Behavior; Compulsive Behavior; and Restricted Interests. Scores will range from 0 (no autistic behaviors) to 100 (severe autistic behaviors).</description>
