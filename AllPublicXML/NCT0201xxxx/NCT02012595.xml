      AIM: Investigate wether there are differences in the parasympathetic nervous system in
      Parkinsons patients compared to controls.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use the tracer [11C]donepezil to image the parasympathetic nervous
      system. The Investigators will include 20 Parkinsons patients and 20 healthy controls aged
      40-80 in our study. The participants will receive a careful medical examination, including a
      neurological examination, as part of the inclusion process. The subjects also have an MRI
      scan of the brain. Then PET/CT scans with [11C]donepezil are conducted - once for the upper
      abdominal region and once for the head region. For evaluating the function of the
      parasympathetic nervous system gastric emptying time, heart rate variability and salivary
      flow will be measured. These measureless will be correlated to the PET findings.

      PERSPECTIVES: The study will potentially result in the development of a PET ligand for
      imaging the parasympathetic nervous system. This will have applications for research in
      Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease and other disorders, in which the autonomic
      nervous system is involved
