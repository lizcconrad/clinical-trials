  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) is a common neuropathic disorder in patients with end stage renal
      disease (ESRD). Study Design: Because micronutrient depletion has been associated with RLS in
      ESRD and because the vitamin biotin is dialyzable, the investigators examined the
      relationship between biotin status and RLS in ESRD. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of
      biotin deficiency in those with and without RLS (Study 1) and to determine the effect of
      biotin supplementation on RLS symptoms (Study 2) in patients receiving chronic dialysis due
      to ESRD.

      Setting and Participants: ESRD patients receiving chronic dialysis as outpatients at Saint

    <description>Biotin status is measured using Propionyl CoA carboxylase and Propionyl CoA carboxylase activation coefficients that are from isolated lymphocyte samples. This is a measurement that is independent of kidney function.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis therapy for a duration of at least
             3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of consumption of more than 300 micrograms daily of biotin

          -  Oral contraceptive therapy containing high amounts of estrogen because studies in rats
             provide evidence that high doses of steroid hormones reduce biotin status {Wang, 1997
             #1634}

          -  Women of childbearing age because of concern that biotin deficiency may be teratogenic
             {Mock, 2009 #2568}.
