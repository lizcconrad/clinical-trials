  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as inhaled inert contrast agents to image the airway
      spaces in subjects who have undergone single or double lung transplantation. This is an open
      label study expanding on current work here at Duke. Images will be obtained using 19F MRI
      during wash-in and washout for evaluation of ventilation efficiency.

      This is an open label study in up to 10 lung transplant recipients post lung transplantation
      whose post-transplant status is being monitored according to local standard of care. Each
      subject will receive up to 20 liters of PFP/oxygen gas mixtures as a contrast agent to
      visualize the airway and alveolar spaces in their lungs using 19F magnetic resonance imaging
      of inert gas/oxygen mixtures.

      The goal of this study is to evaluate the utilization of conventional 'thermally' polarized
      perfluorinated gases mixed with oxygen as an exogenous inert contrast agent to image the
      airway spaces in subjects with transplanted lungs. This is an open label proof of concept
      study expanding on work here at Duke.

      The central hypothesis and current observation is that PFx gases, when used as contrast
      agents, provide functional images of the lung airways including important regional
      ventilation information such as ventilation defect severity and gas trapping. We will test
      the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective by addressing the following
      specific aims:

      Primary Study Aims/Secondary Aims Aim 1: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of
      lung ventilation performance in terms of ventilation efficiency during wash-in evaluation of
      the 19F images of lung airspaces.

      Aim 2: Determine qualitative and quantitative measures of lung ventilation performance in
      terms of direct measures of gas trapping measured during washout of the perfluorinated gas
      mixture.

      The outcomes of the work proposed in the aims is expected to demonstrate a non-invasive novel
      quantitative approach for evaluation of regional lung function in subjects with lung
      transplants that would allow repeated evaluation of lung function post-transplant to monitor
      for chronic allograft rejection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             enrollment into the trial:

          -  Subjects must be â‰¥ 18 years of age;

          -  Post single or double lung transplant;

          -  Subjects who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits and other trial
             procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the trial:

          -  Unable to undergo a 3.0-Tesla MRI exam of the lungs and chest because of
             contraindications (e.g. metal in the eye, claustrophobia);

          -  Unable to receive gas mixture by breathing because of contraindications;

          -  Participation in a clinical trial with a study drug that may impact lung function in
             the past 14 days; or

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation or may
             interfere with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would make the subject inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Female; women at risk of pregnancy are required to have a confirmed negative blood
             pregnancy test at Screening if of childbearing potential prior to the MRI scan.
