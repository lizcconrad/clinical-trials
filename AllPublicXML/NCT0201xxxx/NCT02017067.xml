    <textblock>
      Previous studies have demonstrated that resistance training (RT) is beneficial to increase
      muscle strength, improve functional ability and the ability to rapidly produce force, known
      as the contractile rate of force development (RFD) in older adults. However, much less
      research has focused on the effect of RT on the lower extremity muscle strength, contractile
      RFD and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions, especially
      for osteoporosis (OP) (or osteopenia) or knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Therefore, the purpose of
      this study was to investigate the effect of RT on the lower extremity muscle strength, RFD
      and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions, especially for
      OP and knee OA (KOA). The investigators hypothesized that such a training program would lead
      to induce not only specific muscle strength enhancement but also an increment in contractile
      RFD and impulse.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoporosis (OP) and osteoarthritis (OA) are the two most common musculoskeletal conditions
      in older adults, causing high healthcare costs and negative effects on quality of life.
      Previous studies have reported that OP and OA has a strong association with sarcopenia, a
      term defined as age-related involuntary loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength or
      function.A decline of muscle mass and strength in older adults may limit a variety of
      activities of daily living (ADLs) and increase morbidity and mortality. However, many ADLs
      often involve faster limb movements with contraction times of 50 - 200 ms (i.e. sit-to-stand
      performance and avoiding falls). Therefore, in addition to muscle mass and strength, the
      ability to rapidly produce force, known as the contractile rate of force development (RFD),
      and the area under the force-time curve, defined as contractile impulse, seem to be important
      to adequately characterize the performance of ADLs in older adults. Typically, resistance
      training (RT) is often prescribed to increase muscle strength, improve functional ability and
      eliminate much of age-associated muscle atrophy and weakness in a healthy population. Other
      studies have also shown that implementation of RT can help improve RFD in healthy young and
      elderly individuals following RT. However, it still unclear that the effect of RT on
      contractile RFD and impulse in middle-aged and older people with musculoskeletal conditions.
      Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effects on the lower extremity muscle
      strength, contractile rate of force development (RFD), impulse in middle-aged and older
      people with osteoporosis (OP)(or osteopenia) or knee osteoarthritis (KOA) after 12 weeks of
      resistance training.
