      Objective: Objective of this pilot feasibility study is to monitor crSO2 using NIRS INVOS
      5100 (Somanetics, USA) in addition to SpO2 monitoring to guide supplemental oxygen delivery
      and respiratory support based on both measurements in preterm neonates during the first 15
      minutes after birth.

      Patients: Preterm neonates &lt;34+0 weeks of gestation born via caesarean section and/or who
      require respiratory support will be eligible for the study.

      Design: A prospective two-centre randomized controlled pilot feasibility study

      Methods: Study group: Pulse oximetry will be used to measure SpO2 and heart rate as routine
      non-invasive monitoring in the first minutes of resuscitation. In addition during the first
      15 minutes NIRS measurements will be recorded. crSO2 measurements in addition SpO2
      measurements will be used to guide supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support during
      the first 15 minutes after birth. Control group: Only SpO2 measurements will be used to guide
      supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support during the first 15 minutes after birth.

      Hypothesis: Supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support guided by crSO2 and SpO2
      measurements will reduce the time in % minutes of crSO2 &lt;10th or &gt;90th centile in preterm
      neonates during the first 15 minutes after birth

      Outcome Parameter: Primary outcome parameter will be duration in % minute of crSO2 &lt;10th or
      &gt;90th centile.
