    <textblock>
      The primary objective was to estimate the proportion of participants with detectable
      talimogene laherparepvec deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the blood and urine at any time after
      administration of talimogene laherparepvec within the first 3 cycles.

A serious adverse event was defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria: • fatal • life threatening • requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • congenital anomaly/birth defect • other medically important serious event Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) are defined as adverse events possibly caused by talimogene laherparepvec, as assessed by the investigator.</description>

Stable disease: Neither sufficient tumor shrinkage of index lesion to qualify for response nor sufficient tumor increase of index lesion to qualify for progressive disease, assessed a minimum interval of 77 days from the first dose of study drug.

      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
