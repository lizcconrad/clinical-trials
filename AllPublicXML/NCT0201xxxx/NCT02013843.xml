    <textblock>
      In the present study the effect of a community-based treatment of overweight and obese
      children is analyzed. The treatment-method is based on the principals and the method used in
      the Children Obesity Clinic in the Pediatric department i Holbaek. The effect is evaluated by
      the change in body mass index standard deviation score, change in blood pressure standard
      deviation score, quality of life and concentration of fasting blood lipids and glucose during
      one year of treatment.

      In the present study the effect of a community-based treatment of overweight and obese
      children is analyzed. The treatment-method is based on the principals and the method used in
      the Children Obesity Clinic in the Pediatric department i Holbaek and the care providers in
      each of the eight municipalities included are thought thoroughly to use this method.

      The treatment effect is evaluated after one year, and the effect is assessed by the change in
      body mass index standard deviation score, change in blood pressure standard deviation score,
      quality of life (PedsQL), body composition and concentration of fasting blood lipids and
      glucose.
