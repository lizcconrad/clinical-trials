  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a epidemiological survey of the adult population in
      Hungary to calculate the seroprevalence of pertussis.

    <textblock>
      The protocol posting was amended to correct the detailed title. Since a sample of blood will
      be collected from all subjects (outside of routine hospital procedure), the study does not
      meet GSK's definition of an observational study and hence the term &quot;observational&quot; was
      deleted from the detailed title.
