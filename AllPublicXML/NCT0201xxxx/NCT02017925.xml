      This randomized clinical trial studies pulmonary rehabilitation in improving lung function in
      patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing chemoradiation.
      Individualized exercise rehabilitation programs may reduce breathing problems and improve
      quality of life in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. It is not yet known whether
      pulmonary rehabilitation is more effective when started during or after cancer treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine feasibility of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in patients with locally
      advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing definite chemotherapy and
      radiation therapy.

      II. To measure exercise capacity and respiratory symptoms in lung cancer patients receiving
      chemotherapy and radiation before and after pulmonary rehabilitation.

      III. To compare if there are any differences in symptom relief, exercise capacity, and cancer
      treatment tolerability between performing pulmonary rehabilitation during chemo-radiation
      versus after completion of lung cancer treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 2 weeks of starting chemoradiation, patients undergo an
      individualized rehabilitation program comprising aerobic exercise and strength training,
      including treadmill walking, stationary bicycle, NU-Step, upper body resistance training and
      breathing retraining, 3 times per week for 8 weeks (36 sessions).

      ARM II: Beginning 1 month after completion of chemoradiation, patients undergo an
      individualized exercise rehabilitation program as in Arm I.

    <description>Either a two-sided t-test or a Wilcoxon-rank sum test will be used to test the difference in the improvement of the 6 minute walk depending on the distribution. This test will be used to compare the difference in improvement between PR during chemo-radiation of NSCLC patients and PR 8 weeks post chemo-radiation. Linear regression will be used to estimate which clinical characteristics and patient demographics are associated with improvement in 6 minute walk. The study population will be described using means and standard deviations or medians and the interquartile range.</description>
