  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of features of the New York State
      Immunization Information System (NYSIIS) by various types of primary care practices and
      determine how best to promote the use of IIS features and functionality. The primary goal is
      to promote the use of NYSIIS for immunization quality improvement (QI) in the practice
      setting. Customized training sessions will be conducted by study staff to educate practices
      on NYSIIS' enhanced features.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>NYSIIS report usage</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>Practice NYSIIS administrators will monitor the number of reports their practice generates throughout the 12 month post-training period. These measures for control and intervention practices will be compared in bivariate and multivariate analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>HPV Vaccination Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>One Year</time_frame>
    <description>HPV Vaccination rates will be measured to determine the change in the practice's immunization levels (for the pre-determined immunization QI goal) over the 12-month period following their initial training. Statistical comparisons of control and intervention practice will be performed using bivariate analyses, while multivariate analyses will be used to account for the effects of practice characteristics.</description>

    <description>Practices (administrators) that are randomized to this intervention will receive training in how to run reminder recall reports for patients due to receive any dose of HPV vaccine.

    <description>Practices (administrators) that are randomized to this intervention will receive training in how to run audit-feedback/immunization forecasting reports for patients due to receive any dose of HPV vaccine and to determine the % of patients in their practice who have received at least one dose of HPV vaccine within the study period. After the training has been completed, administrators will be asked to continue running regularly scheduled reports over the course of one year. A tracking log will be sent regularly to the research team.</description>
