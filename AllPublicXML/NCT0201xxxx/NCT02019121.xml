    <textblock>
      Investigators aim to retrospectively research patients undergoing renal transplants that
      received dexmedetomidine perioperatively to see if dexmedetomidine use protects renal
      function. Investigators hope to elucidate any association between renal transplant patients
      and perioperative dexmedetomidine administration, these include (but are not limited to) UOP,
      Cr/GFR, morbidity, mortality, in hospital complications and failure rate. Investigators will
      research both living and cadaveric renal transplants.
