  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effects of a special type of a cancer
      vaccine called a 'dendritic cell vaccine' in patients with either newly diagnosed or
      recurrent glioblastoma. The goal of this dendritic cell vaccine is to activate a patient's
      own immune system against their tumor. This study utilizes a patient's own immune-stimulating
      dendritic cells that are isolated in a procedure called leukapheresis. In a laboratory, these
      dendritic cells are treated in a way that is designed to promote an immune response against
      cancer stem cells. Then the dendritic cells are injected under the skin in a series of
      vaccinations, with the goal of activating an immune response against cancer stem cells in the
      tumor.

      To qualify for this study, patients must have very little to no residual tumor visible on a
      recent MRI. In addition to the vaccines, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will
      receive standard temozolomide chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Patients with recurrent
      glioblastoma will not receive any treatment other than the vaccines as long as they are
      participating in this study, unless they were previously treated with bevacizumab, in which
      case they will be allowed to continue receiving bevacizumab.

      This phase I study for patients with either newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma with
      minimal residual tumor utilizes a dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic
      cells that have been pulsed with a lysate derived from an allogeneic glioblastoma stem-like
      cell line cultured under neurosphere-forming conditions.

      Patients will receive a series of four vaccines given weekly during the Induction phase,
      followed by vaccinations every 8 weeks during the Maintenance phase for as long as patients
      remain on the study or until the vaccine supply is depleted. In addition to the investigative
      treatment, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will receive standard temozolomide
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment, with the Induction phase beginning at the conclusion of
      radiation. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma will not receive treatment other than the
      investigative treatment, unless they were previously treated with bevacizumab, in which case
      they will be allowed to continue receiving bevacizumab.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Cohort A: Newly diagnosed glioblastoma Patients with an initial biopsy or partial
             resection can qualify for Cohort A if the second surgery (to achieve gross total
             resection) occurs within 30 days of the initial surgery, without any interval
             treatment using radiation or chemotherapy between the two surgeries.

             Cohort B: Glioblastoma up to and including third recurrence To qualify for Cohort B,
             patients must have previously been treated with involved-field radiation therapy with
             concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy, and pathology from the resection that qualifies
             the patient for the trial must be consistent with recurrent disease (ie, patients with
             predominantly pseudoprogression or radiation necrosis are not eligible). Patients who
             were initially diagnosed with low-grade glioma (ie, WHO grade 2 glioma) with
             subsequent progression to high-grade glioma are eligible for Cohort B provided they
             meet all other eligibility criteria. Patients with recurrent high-grade glioma are
             eligible up to and including third recurrence, and therefore are permitted to have
             been treated with up to three distinct chemotherapy regimens prior to trial
             enrollment. Prior and/or continued bevacizumab therapy is allowed.

          2. Complete resection of tumor: gross total resection consisting of no gadolinium
             enhancement or linear gadolinium enhancement along the resection cavity; or subtotal
             resection consisting of linear enhancement with nodular gadolinium enhancement of less
             than 1cm x 1cm x 1cm total volume. The qualifying surgical resection must have been
             performed at Cedars-Sinai in order to allow for tumor stem cell antigen testing.

          3. ≥ 18 years of age

          4. Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS) of ≥ 70%

          5. Baseline hematologic studies and chemistry profiles must meet the following criteria:
             hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 9.9 g/dL, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1000/mm3, platelet
             count &gt; 100,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) &lt; 30 mg/dL, creatinine &lt; 1.4 mg/dL,
             alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 4x upper limit of normal (ULN), prothrombin time (PT) and
             activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT) ≤ 1.6 x control unless therapeutically
             warranted

          6. Female patients of child bearing potential must have negative serum pregnancy test

          7. If not surgically sterile, male and female patients of childbearing age must use
             double barrier contraception (hormonal; intrauterine device; barrier)

          8. Written informed consent, Release of Medical Records Form and HIPAA reviewed and
             signed by patient or legally authorized representatives

          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

         10. Any Grade 3 or 4 toxicities (according to NCI CTCAE) resolved for at least 2 weeks to
             Grade 1 or less

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of any other active malignancy or prior history of malignancy that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of vaccine or
             interpretation of patient safety or study results.

          2. Clinically significant pulmonary, cardiac or other systemic disease that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of vaccine or
             interpretation of patient safety or study results - for example:

               1. New York Heart Association &gt; Grade 2 congestive heart failure within 6 months
                  prior to study entry;

               2. Uncontrolled or significant cardiovascular disease, including:

                    -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months prior to enrollment

                    -  Uncontrolled angina within 6 months

                    -  Diagnosed or suspected congenital long QT syndrome

          3. Pulmonary disease including or greater than grade 2 dyspnea, laryngeal edema, grade 3
             pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension according to CTCAE 4.03

          4. Severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition that could increase the risk
             associated with trial participation or trial drug administration or could interfere
             with the interpretation of trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator,
             would make the patient inappropriate for entry into the trial. This includes but is
             not limited to the following: (a) Immunosuppressive disease, (b) Chronic renal disease
             / failure, (c) Concurrent neurodegenerative disease, (d) Dementia or significantly
             altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed
             consent and compliance with the requirements of the protocol.

          5. Presence of an acute infection requiring active treatment with antibiotics/antivirals;
             prophylactic administration is allowed

          6. Active autoimmune disorder or known history of an autoimmune neurologic condition
             (e.g. Guillain-Barre syndrome). Patients with vitiligo, type 1 diabetes mellitus,
             hypothyroidism due to autoimmune condition only requiring hormone replacement therapy,
             psoriasis not requiring systemic therapy, or conditions not expected to recur in the
             absence of an external trigger are permitted to enroll.

          9. Received any other therapeutic investigational agent within 30 days of enrollment

         10. Contraindication to MRI

         11. Foreseeable condition which would preclude the reduction of steroids (dexamethasone)
             to a maximum of 2 mg BID within a week prior to apheresis.

         12. Any foreseeable scheduling constraint that would prevent a patient in Cohort A from
             starting chemoradiation within 7 weeks of surgery, and any foreseeable scheduling
             constraint that would prevent a patient in Cohort B from starting the Vaccine
             Induction Phase within 7 weeks of surgery.

         13. Any concomitant chemotherapy other than standard-dose temozolomide for patients in
             Cohort A; any concomitant chemotherapy for patients in Cohort B, with the exception of
             the antiangiogenic humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, which is allowed for
             patients treated with bevacizumab prior to enrollment in the trial.
