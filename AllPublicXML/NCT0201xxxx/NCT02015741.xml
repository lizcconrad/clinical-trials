  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of anesthesia depth was based, until recently, on the evolution of hemodynamic
      parameters. Nowadays it can be evaluated by several monitoring methods, derived from
      electroencephalogram analysis, namely the Bispectral Index (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton,
      USA). A new modality is currently under development: the NeuroSENSE (Cleveland Medical
      Devices Inc., Cleveland, OH 44103, USA).

      Use of such devices is discussed in aged patients. The purpose of this study is to compare
      Bispectral Index and NeuroSENSE during awake periods and during natural sleep.
