  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of combining
      cyclin B1/WT-1/CEF (antigen)-loaded DC vaccination with preoperative chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives of this trial are to determine pathologic complete response rates;
      disease-free survival; to assess immune biomarkers of immunity (antigen-specific CD8+ T cell
      immunity and TH2 T cells) in breast cancer biopsy specimens and blood samples in patients
      receiving DC vaccinations; and to assess the feasibility of immunizing LA TNBC and ER+/HER2-
      BC patients with patient-specific tumor antigens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that human breast cancers can be immunogenic, and that enhancing
      the immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of standard
      therapies.

      vaccination remains the most attractive strategy because of its expected inducement of both
      therapeutic T cell immunity (effector T cells) and protective T cell immunity (tumor-specific
      memory T cells that can control tumor relapse). Several clinical studies have now
      demonstrated that immunity against tumor antigens can be enhanced in cancer patients by
      vaccination with ex vivo-generated tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs). This strategy
      capitalizes on the unique capacity of DCs to prime lymphocytes and to regulate and maintain
      immune responses.

      Our goals are to boost T cell immunity targeted against breast cancer utilizing a tumor
      antigen-loaded DC vaccine, to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness and decrease tumor
      metastagenicity, and to decrease the recurrence rates of LA TNBC and ER+/HER2- BC. Patients
      will be treated with a combination of antigen-loaded DC vaccinations along with standard
      preoperative chemotherapy, to improve immunogenicity and to increase the pCR rate achieved
      with standard therapy. The trial will consist of 2 patient cohorts: TNBC and ER+/HER2- BC.
