  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine

        1. if it is practical to treat moderately to severely brain injured patients who have
           problems with their balance and mobility in a group &quot;boot camp&quot; (3 days a week, 6
           hours/day for 4 weeks) exercise class.

        2. If they show improvements compared to 4 weeks of not receiving this treatment

        3. If electronic daily monitoring of their center of foot pressure during a standardized
           balance task will allow us to see small changes in ability.

      A baseline assessment of all outcome measures will be performed. This will be repeated 4
      weeks later. The intervention will be delivered (4 weeks) and a follow up assessment of all
      outcome measures will be performed one week later. A follow up of the Primary outcome
      measure, the PART-O participation questionnaire will be done 12 weeks later.

      Participants will attend group therapy consisting of a variety of exercises designed
      specifically to target balance and mobility deficits and based on the concept that through
      Repetitive Functional Task Practice (RFTP), recovery of function can occur as the result of
      neural adaptation. Exercises will be both individualized (delivered in a circuit) and group
      activities. Supervision and guidance will be provided by a registered Physical Therapist and
      a Rehabilitation Assistant. During the intervention, the amount and type of RFTP, any adverse
      events, and any need for extra staff will be recorded on a daily basis. As well, a
      standardized individualized task will be performed with center of foot pressure recording on
      a daily basis.

      Analysis: changes in outcome measures immediately after the non-intervention compared to the
      after the intervention period will be statistically determined to estimate efficacy of this
      treatment model. Descriptive measures of RFTP time/day, staffing levels/day and adverse
      events will be used to support feasibility and safety of this model.
