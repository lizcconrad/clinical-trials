      Null hypothesis: There is no difference in the efficacy of IVPR and EPR during an episode of
      hypokalemia.

      Alternate Hypothesis: There is a mean difference of 15% in Serum Potassium levels between the
      two groups.

      Objective: To compare the efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalemia (measured as
      change in serum potassium levels in milliequivalent/L after potassium replacement)

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypokalemia is frequently encountered in daily clinical practices of cardiac intensive care
      unit (CICU). The development of ventricular arrhythmias related to hypokalemia can lead to
      sudden cardiac death. Thus, potassium replacement therapy is the cornerstone therapy for
      hypokalemia.Though intravenous potassium replacement (IVPR) in hypokalemia is the preferred
      route in most intensive care settings, it is associated with known safety risks.
      Inappropriately administered, IVPR can lead to arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and death 1, 7, 8.
      Given these risks, IVPR is considered a &quot;high-alert medication&quot; by Institute of Safe
      Medication practice.

      Enteral potassium replacement (EPR), with its superior safety profile may be a better
      alternative to IVPR. A retrospective review showed that the efficacy of EPR was comparable to
      IVPR in pediatric patients after congenital heart disease.

      The investigators seek to explore this comparison between EPR and IVPR in a randomized
      prospective trial

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The efficacy EPR and IVPR for treatment of hypokalemia (measured as change in serum potassium levels in milliequivalent/liter (mEq/L) after potassium replacement</measure>
    <time_frame>The primary endpoint will be assessed every 1 hour in the IVPR group and every 2 hour in the EPR group after replacement of potassium. The patients will be followed for the duration of CICU stay which will be around 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>The intervention arms will be blocked randomized as alternate week for I/V and enteral potassium replacement for trial's operational feasibility. Recruited patients will receive treatment accordingly.
In case where a patient develops side effects such as diarrhea or vomiting, even though he will be changed to IV route of potassium supplement, he will be considered enteral supplementation during data analysis till the point when the patient had received enteral replacement.
In the IVPR group, potassium will be given according to the hospital protocol through a central line. As per a previously established protocol, repeat serum potassium will be sent 1 hour after replacement in the IVPR group and 2 hours after replacement in the EPR group. Replacement and serum level monitoring will be done till the episode of hypokalemia is resolved.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of adverse effects after EPR and IVPR.</measure>
    <time_frame>Adverse events will be monitored every 2 hours after potassium supplementation. The patients will be followed for the duration of CICU stay which will be around 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse effects that will be monitored are hyperkalemia (defined as potassium levels &gt; 5 mEq/L, arrhythmias (defined as any rhythm other than sinus during or within 2 hours of potassium replacement), diarrhea (described as &gt; 2 loose stools or a single watery stool, during or within 2 hours of potassium replacement , GI bleeds, nausea and vomiting (during or within 2 hours of potassium replacement). These adverse events will be monitored on hourly bases by the CICU nursing staff as per CICU protocol. These adverse events will be documented on the CICU nursing sheet (as per routine) and the data gathered every morning by the principal or co-investigators. The on-call physician will be contacted, as per routine, by the nursing to determine any change in mode/dose of potassium replacement if adverse events occur. The on-call physician will in-turn contact either the principal or one of the co-investigators to further discuss the plan.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of number of dose/s required to achieve resolution of hypokalemia</measure>
    <time_frame>Dose administration(one hour after IV and two hours after enteral) will be continued till the episode of hypokalemia resolves. Each episode will last ~ 5 hours. The patients will be followed for the duration of CICU stay which will be around 1 week.</time_frame>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy of EPR and IVPR for various degrees of severity of hypokalemia for each episode of hypokalemia</measure>
    <time_frame>An episode of hypokalemia would last ~ 5 hours. The patients will be followed for the duration of CICU stay which will be around 1 week.</time_frame>
    <description>Degree of severity: Mild, moderate or severe as determined by the protocol.</description>
