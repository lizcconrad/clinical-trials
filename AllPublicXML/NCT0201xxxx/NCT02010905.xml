  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The prevalence of adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) has steadily
      increased over the last decades, due to the advances in cardiac surgery. A large number of
      these patients cope with right ventricular (RV) volume or pressure overload, largely caused
      by residual lesions after cardiac surgery in childhood. Previous RV overload due to pulmonary
      regurgitation in Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) can lead to RV dysfunction. These findings warrant
      close surveillance of RV function, and adequate and evidence-based pharmacological therapy to
      reduce both morbidity and mortality in this young patient group. The
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is activated in patients with ventricular
      failure, irrespective of the effected (left or right) ventricle. Angiotensin converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB's) are drugs which act as
      inhibitors of RAAS. Previously, large trials have demonstrated the beneficial effect of
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors on morbidity and mortality in patients with
      acquired left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. ARB's have a similar effect as ACE inhibitors in
      patients with acquired LV dysfunction but discontinuation because of side effects such as
      cough is less frequent. In TOF patients with RV overload due to pulmonary regurgitation,
      pulmonary valve replacement leads to a decrease in RV size and pulmonary regurgitation.
      Current guidelines advise empiric use of RAAS inhibitors for right ventricular dysfunction in
      adult patients with congenital heart disease. However, the actual effect of RAAS inhibition
      on right ventricular dysfunction in adult TOF patients without severe valvular lesions has
      not been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, we set-up the proposed study, and hypothesize
      that ARB's have a beneficial effect on RV ejection fraction in adult TOF patients with RV
      dysfunction without severe valvular lesions.

      Objective: to improve RV ejection fraction in adult TOF patients with RV dysfunction without
      severe valvular lesions.

      Study design: a prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
      Follow up two years Study population: adult patients with Tetralogy of Fallot with right
      ventricular dysfunction, defined as right ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% and without
      severe valvular lesions Intervention: patients are randomized to receive either losartan 150
      mg once daily, or placebo in the same regimen. Main study parameters/endpoints: the primary
      endpoint is difference in change in RV ejection fraction, determined by cardiovascular
      magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), between the treatment and the control group at two years
      follow-up.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: All investigations, except blood analysis, are non-invasive and free of risk.
      The burden for the patients mainly consists of the time that is consumed by the visits to the
      clinic. At these visits time will be consumed by: history taking and physical investigation
      (15 minutes); quality of life score (15 minutes); laboratory tests (6 times venopuncture,
      total amount of blood withdrawn approximately 90ml). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing
      (1hour), echocardiography (15 minutes) and CMR (45 minutes) are part of regular medical care.
      Adverse effects from losartan are usually limited and consist of dizziness due to
      hypotension, renal impairment, hyperkalemia and liver impairment. We expect no change or an
      increase in RV function in the intervention group compared to the control group over the
      two-year follow up period, which would be a great benefit for this young study population.
