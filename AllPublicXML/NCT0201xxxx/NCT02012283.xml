  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine the differences in liking of vegetables between
      individuals based on a variety of variables, and to see if flavoring various vegetables
      differently with spices changes the intake of those vegetables.

    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of the present study is that carefully designed spice mixtures can
      override any taste aversion to brassica vegetables, increase acceptance (liking and intention
      to consume), and measured consumption of mixed vegetable dishes which include brassica
      vegetables using a modified Universal Eating Monitor and hedonic testing. In order to examine
      this hypothesis we will achieve the following specific aims:

        1. To measure the liking of vegetables; intentions to consume vegetables; differences in
           responses by baseline eating restraint; the perceived tastes (sweet, salt, sour, bitter,
           umami) and overall flavor intensity of Brassica vegetables and five individual
           vegetables include the following brassica vegetables: broccoli florets, cauliflower,
           spinach, squash and tomato . Therefore, hedonics of brassica vegetables will be measured
           in the same individuals.

        2. To measure attitudes towards foods for health, pleasure and reward using a validated set
           of questionnaires (Health and Taste Attitudes Scale).

        3. To measure level of restrained eating using the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire since
           this will affect eating behaviors measured objectively.

        4. Measure simultaneously meal hedonics and the actual intake of cooked dishes of
           vegetables using a modified Universal Eating Monitor when dishes are eaten plain or with
           added spices in random order.

      These will be the first studies to our knowledge of the ability of spices to aid in
      increasing vegetable consumption to meet USDA dietary recommendations. If successful, this
      study will provide important guidelines for research on prevention through nutrition as well
      as public health recommendations for diet and chronic disease prevention.
