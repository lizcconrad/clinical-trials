    <description>The primary efficacy outcome will be excessive toxicity, which will be defined as a score of 2 or higher using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) Acute scale of radiation-toxicity criteria when scored on either the 12-day or 30-day assessment time.
The RTOG scale ranges from 0-4 with 0 being defined as &quot;no change&quot;.</description>
