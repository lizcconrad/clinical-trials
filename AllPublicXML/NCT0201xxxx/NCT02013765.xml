  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous Herceptin in patients with
      metastatic urothelial cancer with disease progression during platinum-based chemotherapy. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression.

    <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal [(short axis less than (&lt;)10 millimeters (mm)]. No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD).</description>

        <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. Complete response (CR) was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the exception of nodal disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal [(short axis less than (&lt;)10 millimeters (mm)]. No new lesions. Partial response (PR) was defined as greater than or equal to (≥)30% decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target nodes, while the longest diameter was used in the sum for all other target lesions. No unequivocal progression of non-target disease. No new lesions. Stable disease (SD) was defined as not qualifying for CR, PR, or progressive disease (PD).</description>
