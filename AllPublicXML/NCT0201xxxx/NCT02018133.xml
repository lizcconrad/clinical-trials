      The purpose of this study is to identify genes that are responsive to paricalcitol (active
      vitamin D) therapy. Scientists have found that over 30 different types of cells in the body
      respond to vitamin D therapy, including blood vessels. Low levels of vitamin D may reduce the
      amount of calcium in the blood, increase the amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and cause
      the parathyroid gland (small gland located in the neck) to get bigger which is called
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). Also, low levels of vitamin D may worsen the heart
      disease seen in dialysis patients. Paricalcitol, a man-made active vitamin D, is a
      replacement for vitamin D for preventing and treating SHPT. Studies that followed patients on
      dialysis have found: (1) differences in death rates between those who received active vitamin
      D compared with no activated vitamin D, and (2) a survival benefit in chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) patients receiving paricalcitol, over calcitriol (natural active vitamin D).
      Researchers have considered that giving paricalcitol to people with (CKD) may also prevent or
      slow the progression of heart disease.

      Currently, physicians can only tell how well the vitamin D is working by measuring PTH
      concentrations. This study aims to identify markers in the blood that can be used to
      determine the efficacy of Vitamin D therapy.

      After baseline information and laboratory tests are obtained, subjects will be randomized to
      receive either oral paricalcitol at 2 mcg daily for 2 weeks or placebo. After a washout
      period of 4 weeks, those subjects who received paricalcitol will receive placebo for 2 weeks
      and those who received placebo will receive paricalcitol for 2 weeks. A simple blood draw
      will be obtained from the patient on days 0, 1, and 14 of each treatment arm, and they will
      also be assessed for side effects at the end of each treatment.

      The blood obtained during these visits will be analyzed for any changes that may have
      occurred in the white blood cells (WBC) and/or plasma. These samples will be tested to see if
      there are any markers in the blood that changed after treatment with vitamin D. The samples
      collected will be temporarily stored in the research laboratory and subsequently sent to a
      separate laboratory (Genus Systems Company) in batches for analysis.
