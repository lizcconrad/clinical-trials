      This study is a 12-month, double-blind randomized placebo controlled trial in 200 older
      (65-89 yrs) men and women with initial 25(OH)D concentrations of 18-&lt;30 ng/mL to determine
      the effect of increasing 25(OH)D concentrations to ≥30 ng/mL through vitamin D3
      supplementation on 1) change in neuromuscular functions that are established risk-factors for
      falls in older adults; and 2) changes in the underlying physiological mechanisms over 4
      months in a subset of 40 randomly selected participants. Participants will be randomized to
      2000 IU/d of vitamin D3 or placebo. Lower extremity muscle strength and power, physical
      performance, and postural sway will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 12 months and falls
      assessed monthly. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be taken at baseline and 4
      months to assess muscle fiber type, contractility, and denervation, and number and
      differentiation stage of satellite cells.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in percentage of type II (fast-twitch) muscle fibers over 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>This will be examined in muscle biopsies collected at baseline and 4-month follow-up using the ATPase, pH 9.4 and 4.6 technique, combined with laminin immunostaining in 10 micrometer muscle sections and the absolute and relative number of type I, IIA, IIX fiber subtypes and their cross-sectional area quantified.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lower extremity muscle power over 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity muscle power will be measured at baseline, 4- and 12-month follow-up using the Nottingham Power Rig, a safe, convenient method for assessing power output from the lower limb which has been used reliably in older adults. Participants will sit in a chair and unilaterally depress a foot lever attached to a flywheel as hard and as fast as they can. Power output, derived from the acceleration of the flywheel, will be recorded in Watts. Power will be averaged for each leg following five trials at maximal effort.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in lower extremity muscle strength over 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Lower extremity muscle strength will be measured using an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex) at one speed (60°/sec) with the participant sitting and the hips and knee flexed at 90°. The dynamometer will be adjusted for each participant and all adjustments will be recorded to duplicate the position for subsequent assessments. Start and stop angles will be set at 90° and 30°. Participants will be asked to extend the knee and push as hard as possible against the resistance pad. Strength is expressed as peak torque in Newton-meters (Nm). The best performance of 3 trials will be selected for each side, and the averages of the left and right leg will be used in analyses.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the expanded physical performance battery over 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The expanded physical performance battery consists of 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance (semi- and full-tandem stands and a single leg stand for 30 seconds), a 4-m walk to assess usual gait speed, and a narrow 4-m walk test of balance (walking at usual pace within lines of tape spaced 20 cm apart).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in postural sway over 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4- and 12-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Postural sway during quiet stance will be assessed from Center-of-Pressure (COP) trajectory data collected at 100 Hz using an Advanced Mechanical Technology Incorporated (AMTI) AccuSway biomechanics force platform. Participants will be barefoot in an upright stance with arms relaxed comfortably at their sides, feet abducted 10 degrees, and heels separated medio-laterally by 6 cm. COP data will be collected in a series of 10 30-sec trials standing on the force plate alone followed by 5 30-sec trials standing on the force plate with a 3 inch Airex foam pad placed on top.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in single muscle fiber contractility over 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Single type I and type II muscle fiber contraction force, shortening velocity, and power will be examined in 10-15 fibers per muscle biopsy sample.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in type I and type II denervated myofibers over 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Type I and type II denervated myofibers will be identified using ATPase pH 9 plus NCAM immunostaining analysis. The whole muscle biopsy will be cryosectioned and 10-12 slices will be mounted per slide. Alternate slides will be stained for NCAM and positive fibers and their expression pattern (perimeter or whole cross section) will be reported as a percent of the total number of fibers.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in satellite cell differentiation over 4 months</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Satellite cell differentiation will be assessed in serial muscle cross sections immunostained for Pax7/NCAM and myogenin together with the DNA marker Hoechst to quantify the percent of quiescent (Pax7+/ myogenin-) and terminal differentiated (Pax7-/myogenin+) SCs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Number of falls over 12 months</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be provided monthly fall calendars and asked to mark any falls (defined as an event whereby an individual unexpectedly comes to rest on the ground or another lower level) that occur on the monthly calendar.</description>
