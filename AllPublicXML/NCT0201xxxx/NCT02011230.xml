  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after tonsillectomy remains a key barrier during the post operative period. The
      published return rate to the emergency department for hydration and pain control is
      approximately 4%. If we can demonstrate decreased pain or decreased visits to the emergency
      department post tonsillectomy, patient experiences will be improved and health care dollars
      spent will be decreased. We will attempt to improve hydration status by encouraging
      consumption of a novel isotonic hydration solution that is currently commercially available.

      Our study hypothesis is that patients provided an isotonic hydration solution and
      instructions on avoiding dehydration post operatively will have improved pain control and
      decreased emergency department visits.

      Improvement in hydration status has the potential of decreasing emergency room visits and
      subsequent decrease in spending of healthcare dollars. Additional benefits of post-operative
      hydration may include decrease in pain and decrease in post-operative bleeding rates.

      A new isotonic hydration solution with an improved flavor profile (Hoist®) has recently
      become commercially available. Itis very similar to that of Pedialyte, a commonly used
      rehydration solution. Pedialyte was designed for rehydration of infants and small children.
      It has a taste that is not acceptable to many adults and older children.

      This study will implement the use of Hoist as suitable rehydration solution. This study is
      designed to define the relationship between improvement of patient's hydration through
      provision of a rehydration solution during the post operative period and decrease in
      complications requiring return to the emergency room, including dehydration and bleeding, as
      well as improvement in overall pain control.

    <description>Patients in the Hoist group will be given a 10 day supply of Hoist (22 bottles). Patients will self-administer the Hoist solution (Parents will administer the Hoist in the case of minor study participants) Pain will be measured during the recovery phase for ten days. Patients will be asked to rate their pain level each day post op (days 0-10) using a numeric pain intensity scale in addition, children ages 4-12 will also receive a Wong-Baker FACES pain scale.</description>

    <description>Patients will take a survey for up to 10 days after tonsillectomy to rate their level of pain each day. This will be used to see a correlation between reported pain level and amount of fluid intake each day</description>
