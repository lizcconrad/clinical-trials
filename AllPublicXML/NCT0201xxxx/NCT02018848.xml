  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate an attention training program for participants with
      Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. The attention training consists of a modified dot probe task
      with picture stimuli related to washing and checking paired with neutral pictures.

      Participants are randomly assigned to an experimental and a placebo-control group. After a
      minimum of 4 weeks of attention training we expect to find differences between participants
      of the experimental and the control group in terms of attention bias, OCD symptoms, anxiety
      and depression.

    <measure>Attention bias towards OCD-relevant stimuli at T1 measured with a dot-probe task.</measure>
    <time_frame>after T1 questionnaires and pre-treatment, estimated: between day 1 and 3 after T1 questionnaires (no time limit set)</time_frame>
    <description>Attention bias is measured using a dot-probe task. In this task pairs of pictures (OCD-relevant/neutral) are presented briefly on a computer screen. Next, a probe randomly appears on one of the two former picture locations. Participants have to react to that probe by pressing the corresponding button on the keyboard.
Attention bias is calculated as the mean difference in reaction times between trials in which the probe appears at the OCD-relevant location vs. trials in which it appears at the neutral location. The bias assessment session is masked as first training sessions in both groups.</description>

    <description>Same procedure, stimulus material, frequency and duration as in experimental group.
The only difference: In the placebo group the probe randomly appears at one of the two locations on the screen so as not to train attention in any direction.
Thus, the placebo training sessions are identical to the bias assessment sessions.</description>

    <description>The Attention Training consists of a modified dot-probe task. In this task pairs of pictures (OCD-relevant/neutral) are presented for 500 ms on a computer screen. Next, a probe appears on one of the two former picture locations. Participants have to react to that probe by pressing the corresponding button on the keyboard. One training session takes approximately 10 minutes in which 160 stimulus pairs are shown.
In the experimental group the probe always appears at the location of the neutral picture so as to train attention away from OCD-relevant stimuli.
Participants are asked to complete at least 2 training sessions per week over a period of 5 weeks. The first and last session are bias assessment sessions (see outcome measures), but participants stay blind to this.</description>

          -  suicidal

          -  substance abuse or addiction

          -  psychotic symptoms

          -  visual impairment if not compensated with optical aid

        Current treatment is not an exclusion criterion, but data on treatment status (current
