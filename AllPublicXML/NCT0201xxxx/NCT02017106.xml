  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Varicose veins of the leg often have superficial tributaries, which are often symptomatic and
      a major reason for coming to the doctor. When treating the main varicose vein inside the leg,
      some doctors prefer to remove these tributaries while others prefer to leave them. This trial
      aims to see if it is better to remove these veins at the time of the first laser procedure or
      better to leave them and only remove them when asked.

    <textblock>
      Endovenous laser therapy (EVLT) for varicose veins is associated with high initial occlusion
      rates, minimal complications and low recurrence rates at 5 years. Randomized trials and
      meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy of EVLT in comparison with surgery and other
      endovenous techniques. There is also evidence that it may be associated with early quality of
      life (QoL) benefits compared with surgery. The general efficacy of EVLT has therefore been
      demonstrated and current research focuses on refinement of the procedure. A fundamental
      question concerns the management of residual varicosities following truncal laser ablation.
      One approach is to leave these varicosities to regress untouched, minimizing the procedure
      time and surgical trauma6. This approach, however, is associated with a significant number of
      secondary and tertiary interventions (sclerotherapy and/or ambulatory phlebectomy). Another
      option is to combine in a single procedure ambulatory phlebectomy with initial truncal laser
      ablation (EVLTAP). The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the advantages
      of performing ambulatory phlebectomy as a concomitant procedure to truncal laser ablation.
