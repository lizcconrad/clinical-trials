    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, randomized, cross-over, multicenter trial to
      evaluate ease-of-use with Rebif® Rebidose® and Rebiject II® autoinjectors in subjects with
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Subjects will participate in the study for up
      to 10 weeks (including screening and treatment periods). The treatment period will last 8
      weeks and include 12 self-injections using the Rebif® Rebidose® device and 12 self-injections
      using the Rebiject II® device.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) Scores to Week 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, up to Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The MusiQoL is a validated 31-item questionnaire describing 9 dimensions named according to its constitutive items:activities of daily living (8 items);psychological well-being (4 items);symptoms (3 items);friends relationships (4 items);family relationships (3 items);satisfaction with health care (RHCS 3 items);sentimental and sexual life (2 items);coping (2 items);and rejection (2 items). Each of the questions was answered using a 6-point Likert scale, defined as 1-Never/Not at all, 2-Rarely/A little, 3-Sometimes/Somewhat, 4-Often/A lot, 5-Always/Very much and 6-Not applicable. The scores of each dimension were obtained by computing mean of the item scores of dimension with negatively worded item scores reversed so that higher scores indicated higher health-related QoL. All 9 dimension scores were linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale,where higher score=higher health-related QoL. Global index score was computed as mean of the 9 dimension scores (range 0-100;higher score=higher QoL).</description>

Subjects were asked to assess their overall experience with using the device as “very difficult”, “difficult”, “neither easy nor difficult”, “easy”, or “very easy”. Percentage of subjects who rated the overall use of device as “easy” or “very easy” were reported. Here results are presented by device sequence.</description>
          <population>FAS included all relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis subjects who received at least 1 injection of Rebif using either Rebif Rebidose or Rebiject II and had at least 1 post-baseline evaluation/assessment. Here “Number of Participants Analyzed” signifies those subjects who were evaluable for this outcome.</population>

        <description>The UTQ is a tool used to assess the ease-of-use of a device by the subject. Subjects were asked to assess their level of satisfaction with using the device while traveling (defined as being away from home overnight).

        <description>The UTQ is a tool used to assess the ease-of-use of a device by the subject. Subjects were asked to assess their level of satisfaction with respect to the amount of time it took to complete injection with the device. Subjects assessed if they were satisfied as “Strongly disagree”, “Disagree”, “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, “Strongly agree”. Here results are presented by device sequence.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Subjects Rating Each Device on Ease of Holding Based on User Trial Questionnaire (UTQ)</title>
        <description>The UTQ is a tool used to assess the ease-of-use of a device by the subject. Subjects were asked to assess their overall experience with holding the device as “very difficult”, “difficult”, “neither easy nor difficult”, “easy”, or “very easy”. Here results are presented by device sequence.</description>

        <description>The UTQ is a tool used to assess the ease-of-use of a device by the subject. Subjects were asked to assess their overall satisfaction with using the device. Subjects responded as “Strongly disagree”, “Disagree”, “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, “Strongly agree” that they were satisfied with the device. Here results are presented by device sequence.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) Scores to Week 8</title>
        <description>The MusiQoL is a validated 31-item questionnaire describing 9 dimensions named according to its constitutive items:activities of daily living (8 items);psychological well-being (4 items);symptoms (3 items);friends relationships (4 items);family relationships (3 items);satisfaction with health care (RHCS 3 items);sentimental and sexual life (2 items);coping (2 items);and rejection (2 items). Each of the questions was answered using a 6-point Likert scale, defined as 1–Never/Not at all, 2–Rarely/A little, 3–Sometimes/Somewhat, 4–Often/A lot, 5–Always/Very much and 6–Not applicable. The scores of each dimension were obtained by computing mean of the item scores of dimension with negatively worded item scores reversed so that higher scores indicated higher health-related QoL. All 9 dimension scores were linearly transformed to a 0–100 scale,where higher score=higher health-related QoL. Global index score was computed as mean of the 9 dimension scores (range 0-100;higher score=higher QoL).</description>
