      Purpose: The purpose of this study is to see whether a text-message reminder system will
      increase the number of women who complete their diabetes screening after delivery.

      Study Design: Prospective randomized control trial

      Hypothesis: Gestational diabetics will be significantly more likely to follow up with their
      postpartum screening for diabetes if they receive text-message reminders to set up their lab
      appointment compared to those who receive usual care.

      Eligible participants will be recruited after delivery while on the postpartum ward.
      Recruitment will be conducted by the PI or a member of the study team. After informed consent
      is obtained, the patients will be randomized into one of two study groups: the intervention
      group or the control group. Women in the intervention group will receive a test text-message
      reminder at the time of enrollment. They will then receive a text-reminder to schedule their
      oral glucose tolerance test at 6 weeks postpartum, with further reminders at 3 months and 6
      months if they have not completed their testing. Women in the control group will only receive
      the test text-message reminder. The PI or member of the study team obtaining the informed
      consent will verify the participant has received the text-message prior to completing
      enrollment. A computer-generated randomization list will be generated according to
      intervention vs. control group. Simple randomization will be used for the purposes of this
      study. 316 participants will be recruited based on the sample size calculations already
      performed. One group of 316 randomized opaque envelopes will be prepared. These sealed
      envelopes will be stored in a secured designated area at Tampa General Hospital. Once a
      patient has agreed to participate and is consented an envelope will be selected from the next
      sequentially numbered envelope and the number on the envelope will be recorded on their study
      sheet. Enrollment will continue until 316 participants have been recruited.
