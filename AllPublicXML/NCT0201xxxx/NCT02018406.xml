  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of our study is to determine the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factors (G-CSF) in patients with
      neurological diseases. To be specific, our clinical study is expected that the combination
      injection of EPO and G-CSF shows neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects by facilitating
      endogenous repair process in patients with neurological diseases including stroke, cerebral
      palsy, or atypical parkinsonism. Therefore, we will apply our original treatment technique in
      patients with neurological diseases, which is expected to overcome current ethical and
      technical limitations of less evidenced functional recovery, hematological changes, and side
      effects. Eventually, We will establish a comprehensive clinical background about neurotrophic
      and neuroprotective effects of this hematopoietic growth factors therapy.
