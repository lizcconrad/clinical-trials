  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, multicenter study will assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics
      of intravenous (IV) dosing of atezolizumab in combination with oral erlotinib or alectinib in
      participants with NSCLC.

      This study has two stages. In the erlotinib group, the combination treatment will be given to
      participants with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
      (TKI)-treatment-naive, advanced (nonresectable) NSCLC in a safety-evaluation stage and to
      participants with previously untreated EGFR mutation-positive, advanced NSCLC in an expansion
      stage (Stage 2). In the alectinib group, for both the safety-evaluation and expansion stages
      (Stages 1 and 2), the combination will be given to participants who are treatment-naive with
      anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced NSCLC.

      In Stage 1, erlotinib will be given at a starting dose of 150 milligrams (mg) by mouth (PO)
      once daily (QD) and the starting dose of alectinib will be 600 mg twice daily (BID), for 28
      consecutive days during Cycle 1 and on Days 1 through 21 of each cycle thereafter. The
      starting dose of atezolizumab will be 1200 mg, administered every 3 weeks (q3W) starting on
      Day 8 of Cycle 1. If the starting regimen for a combination treatment is not tolerated,
      alternative doses and/or schedules of erlotinib and atezolizumab or alectinib and
      atezolizumab may be tested to determine potential recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for that
      combination treatment. In Stage 2, a potential RP2D and schedule for each combination
      treatment will be investigated in an expansion cohort.

      For both stages, continuation of treatment beyond Cycle 1 will be at the discretion of the
      treating investigator. Study treatment will be discontinued in participants who experience
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, are not compliant with the study protocol, or,
      in their opinion or in the opinion of the investigator, are not benefiting from study
      treatment. However, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, participants with second-line or
      greater NSCLC who are still receiving atezolizumab at the time of radiographic disease
      progression may be permitted to continue study treatment. Time in the study is expected to be
      approximately 15 months.
