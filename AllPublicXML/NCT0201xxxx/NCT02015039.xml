  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective: Writer s cramp (WC) is a form of focal hand dystonia (FHD). Focal injections of
      botulinum toxin (BoNT) are the current best therapy. Past studies showed that some types of
      rehabilitative therapy can be useful. The hypothesis of this study is that BoNT together with
      a specific type of occupational therapy will be better than BoNT alone for treating these
      patients. Additionally, studies on WC were hampered by the lack of objective, validated
      rating scales. In this pilot study, we will assess the value of a new scale compared with
      older scales.

      Study population: The study population will consist of 12 WC patients (accrual ceiling of
      16).

      Design: Patients will be randomized so that 6 patients will receive just BoNT therapy and 6
      patients will receive BoNT therapy plus occupational therapy. The physical therapy will
      involve specific exercises of finger movements in the direction opposite to the patient s own
      dystonic movements, during the writing task. The movements will be isometric against splints
      made to suit the individual patient. The final outcome will be assessed after 20 weeks of
      treatment. Patients will be evaluated on several scales, including the writer s cramp rating
      scale (WCRS) and writer s cramp impairment scale (WCIS), and will also be videotaped. The
      primary outcome will be based on patient reported subjective scale and the secondary outcomes
      will be assessed by four blinded raters of the videotapes, done both before and after
      treatment.

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome is to show additional improvement from baseline with
      BoNT therapy plus occupational therapy compared to BoNT alone at 20 weeks using a
      patient-rated subjective scale. The secondary outcomes are to show improvement in scores of
      WCRS, WCIS, WCDS, and writing parameters with a new handwriting analysis program.
      Additionally, the scores obtained from WCRS and WCIS will be compared.

    <measure>Using a Patient Rated Subjective Scale (Visual Analogue Scale), Change From Baseline With Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy Compared to Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone at 20 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale was used to rate patient's subjective rating of the severity of their writer's cramp at each visit. Patients were asked to mark the location on a 10 centimeter line corresponding to the severity of their writer's cramp. Ratings ranged from &quot;mild&quot; disease severity to &quot;severe&quot; disease severity. The mark was measured on the 10 centimeter line, ranging from 0 to 10. The percent change in the patient rated subject scale was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) From Baseline to Week 20 in Participants Receiving Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone Compared With Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) is a tool used to quantify the treatment effect of local botulinum toxin injections in writer's cramp using writing performance and a computer assisted analysis of writing speed. The WCRS consists of two parts. Part A provides a writing movement score measuring 1) dystonic posture elbow score (ES: 0-2), 2) wrist score (WRS: 0-4), 3) finger score (FS: 0-6), 4) latency of dystonia (L: 1-2) and 5) writing tremor (WT: 0-2). The writing movement sub-score is calculated as (ES + WRS + FS) x L + (WT x 2) (0-28). Part B provides an assessment of writing speed (WS: 0-2). The WCRS score is the total of the writing movement sub-score and the writing speed sub-score. The total WCRS range is between &quot;0&quot; indicating absent residual writer's cramp symptoms to &quot;30&quot; indicating severe writer's cramp symptoms. The percentage change in the WCRS was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Change on the Writer's Cramp Impairment Scale (WCIS) Score From Baseline to 20 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Writer's Cramp Impairment Scale (WCIS) scale assesses the speed of writing, the number of breaks during writing, the occurrence and intensity of involuntary (pathological) postures/abnormal movements (while writing, while performing repetitive wrist movements), the degree of tremor that occurs while performing repetitive spiral movements, and the presence of mirror movements. The scale ranges from 0-180 with 0 representing &quot;no impairment&quot; and 180 representing &quot;severe impairment&quot;. The percent change in the WCIS was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change on the Writer's Cramp Disability Scale (WCDS) Score From Baseline to 20 Weeks.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Writer's Cramp Disability Scale (WCDS) is a self-reported questionnaire which queries patients regarding problems they experience with writing and other every day activities due to writer's cramp. The scale ranges from 0-42 with 0 representing &quot;no difficulty&quot; and 42 representing &quot;marked difficulty&quot;. The percent change in the WCDS was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in Hand Grip Strength From Baseline to 20 Weeks Following Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone and Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Hand grip strength was measured using a commercially available dynamometer. The dynamometer instrument measures maximum isometric strength of the hand and forearm muscles. Hand grip strength was measured with the dynamometer during each visit. The percent change in hand grip strength between baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

    <measure>Change in Quantitative Writing Metrics Obtained Via Numerical Analyses of Writing Samples Using a Digitizing Tablet.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 20 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects with writer's cramp were instructed to draw with their dominant hand between the lines of a 5-loop Archimedes spiral presented on a paper placed over the surface of a digitizing tablet sampling pen tip position at a 100 Hz. The deviation of the drawn spiral to the ideal spiral was calculated at each sampled point. The root mean square of the total spiral error was used as a measure of dysfunctional pen control in subjects with writer's cramp compared with normative data. The percent change of the root mean square was calculated at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

        <title>Using a Patient Rated Subjective Scale (Visual Analogue Scale), Change From Baseline With Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy Compared to Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone at 20 Weeks.</title>
        <description>A visual analogue scale was used to rate patient's subjective rating of the severity of their writer's cramp at each visit. Patients were asked to mark the location on a 10 centimeter line corresponding to the severity of their writer's cramp. Ratings ranged from &quot;mild&quot; disease severity to &quot;severe&quot; disease severity. The mark was measured on the 10 centimeter line, ranging from 0 to 10. The percent change in the patient rated subject scale was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

        <title>Change in the Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) From Baseline to Week 20 in Participants Receiving Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone Compared With Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy.</title>
        <description>The Writers Cramp Rating Scale (WCRS) is a tool used to quantify the treatment effect of local botulinum toxin injections in writer's cramp using writing performance and a computer assisted analysis of writing speed. The WCRS consists of two parts. Part A provides a writing movement score measuring 1) dystonic posture elbow score (ES: 0-2), 2) wrist score (WRS: 0-4), 3) finger score (FS: 0-6), 4) latency of dystonia (L: 1-2) and 5) writing tremor (WT: 0-2). The writing movement sub-score is calculated as (ES + WRS + FS) x L + (WT x 2) (0-28). Part B provides an assessment of writing speed (WS: 0-2). The WCRS score is the total of the writing movement sub-score and the writing speed sub-score. The total WCRS range is between &quot;0&quot; indicating absent residual writer's cramp symptoms to &quot;30&quot; indicating severe writer's cramp symptoms. The percentage change in the WCRS was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

        <title>Change in Quantitative Writing Metrics Obtained Via Numerical Analyses of Writing Samples Using a Digitizing Tablet.</title>
        <description>Subjects with writer's cramp were instructed to draw with their dominant hand between the lines of a 5-loop Archimedes spiral presented on a paper placed over the surface of a digitizing tablet sampling pen tip position at a 100 Hz. The deviation of the drawn spiral to the ideal spiral was calculated at each sampled point. The root mean square of the total spiral error was used as a measure of dysfunctional pen control in subjects with writer's cramp compared with normative data. The percent change of the root mean square was calculated at baseline (Visit 1) and 20 weeks (Visit 8) in the two groups.</description>

        <title>Using a Patient Rated Subjective Scale (Visual Analogue Scale), Change From Baseline With Botulinum Toxin Therapy Plus Occupational Therapy Compared to Botulinum Toxin Therapy Alone at 24 Weeks.</title>
        <description>A visual analogue scale was used to rate patient's subjective rating of the severity of their writer's cramp at each visit. Patients were asked to mark the location on a 10 centimeter line corresponding to the severity of their writer's cramp. Ratings ranged from &quot;mild&quot; disease severity to &quot;severe&quot; disease severity. The mark was measured on the 10 centimeter line, ranging from 0 to 10. The percent change in the patient rated subject scale was measured at baseline (Visit 1) and 24 weeks (Visit 9) in the two groups.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and 24 weeks</time_frame>
        <population>The patient rated subjective scale was not administered at baseline in two subjects, i.e., one subject in each group, therefore these subjects were not included in the analysis.</population>
