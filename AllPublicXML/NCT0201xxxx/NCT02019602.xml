  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose is to assess whether there is transfer of Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) from
      pregnant women receiving treatment with Cimzia® across the placenta to infants by evaluating
      the concentration of CZP in the plasma of infants at birth.

             consent

          -  Subject is being treated with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) per the current approved
             prescribing Information

          -  Subject started or decided to continue treatment with CZP independently from and prior
             to participating in this study and in accordance with the treating physician

          -  Subject expects to receive CZP until at least 35 days prior to expected delivery (date
             of injection counted as Day 1)

        Additional criteria to be confirmed prior to first sample from infant at Visit 2
        (delivery/birth):

          -  Subject delivers a live born infant(s) at or near term (≥34 weeks gestation )

          -  Subject received CZP within 35 days before delivery (date of injection counted as Day
             1)

          -  Subject has not received contraindicated medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has participated in a study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) or
             medical device within the previous 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) prior
             to Screening or is currently participating in another study of an IMP or medical
             device - unless the study is UCB UP0016 [NCT02154425] or a registry study

          -  Subject has any obstetrical or psychiatric condition, or she or her infant(s) has any
             medical condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, could jeopardize or would
             compromise the subject's ability to participate in this study or the outcome of the
             pregnancy

          -  Subject has history of chronic alcohol abuse or drug abuse during pregnancy

          -  Subject has any pregnancy-related clinically significant abnormality noted on
             obstetric ultrasound, or other imaging assessment, or the subject has significant
             laboratory abnormalities during her pregnancy, as judged by the Investigator

          -  Subject is taking or has taken any medication with strong positive evidence of a human
             fetal risk of teratogenicity (e.g., methotrexate or leflunomide) during pregnancy

          -  Subject has evidence of a condition suggesting chronic or acute uteroplacental
             insufficiency such as intrauterine growth restriction, severe maternal hypertensive
             disorders of pregnancy, or abruption

          -  Subject has previously participated in this study

          -  Subject has a positive or indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD In Tube test at
             Screening. In case of indeterminate result, a retest is allowed if time permits; 2
             results of indeterminate require exclusion of the subject

          -  Subject with known tuberculosis (TB) infection, at high risk of acquiring TB
             infection, or latent TB infection (LTB). If tested within the 6 months prior to

             clinical status, nor social, family, or travel history, there is no need for an
             additional TB testing at Screening
