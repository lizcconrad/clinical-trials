  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of raxibacumab in
      healthy adult male and female subjects. Subjects who have received raxibacumab &gt;= 4 months
      ago will be enrolled and dosed as follows: A maximum of 25 subjects (to include 3 evaluable
      female subjects) will receive a second dose of raxibacumab equal to that of the previous dose
      &gt;= 4 months following the first dose. Subjects will remain in house from Day 0 until Day 1
      and will be followed for 70 days after receiving the second dose of raxibacumab. Raxibacumab
      has been shown to provide improved survival in rabbit and monkey anthrax spore challenge
      studies. Preliminary data from our rabbit pivotal efficacy study showed significant survival
      benefit for raxibacumab over placebo. Exposure to anthrax and resulting clinical disease can
      occur more than once, especially in individuals who do not develop protective immunity.
      Hence, if clinically indicated for the treatment of anthrax, there may be a requirement for
      the repeat administration of raxibacumab. The rationale of the study is to evaluate the
      immunogenicity and safety of repeat administration of raxibacumab with a &gt;= 4 month interval
      between dosing.

    <description>Number of participants who developed an positive anti-raxibacumab antibody response during the study were assessed.The antibody response to raxibacumab was assessed using a screening assay (i.e. by electrochemiluminescence counts). Positive samples would be further tested in an inhibition of binding assay to confirm the specificity of binding.</description>

    <time_frame>From the date of the dose administration of study agent for this study (Day 0) until Day 70</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency or severity) of pre-existing conditions. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

             at undue risk.

          -  Prior immunization with anthrax vaccine adsorbed (AVA), prior treatment with
             investigational anthrax therapies (other than raxibacumab &gt;= 4 months ago), prior
             treatment for anthrax exposure, or a confirmed anthrax infection.

          -  History of Type I hypersensitivity reaction to food or drugs, intravenous (IV)
             contrast dye, or history of urticaria.

          -  Previous hypersensitivity to raxibacumab.

          -  Previous serious or Grade 3 or greater raxibacumab related adverse event (AE).

          -  Drug or alcohol addiction within the last 12 months. Subjects who have documented
             addiction free period of at least 12 months and in the clinical judgement of the

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Event (AE) or Any Serious Adverse Event (SAE) During the Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. This includes worsening (eg, increase in frequency or severity) of pre-existing conditions. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose, results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations. Refer to the General Adverse AE/SAE module for a complete list of AEs and SAEs.</description>

        <description>The number of participants with at least a 2-grade worsening from Baseline in hematological toxicities is presented. Clinical hematological parameters were assessed using the modified Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) toxicity tables, version 2.0. Grade 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort (&lt; 48 hours); no medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalizations possible. Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable. Baseline is defined as the value of the variable measured at Day 0 prior to dosing.</description>

          <description>Liver function parameters were assessed using the modified Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) toxicity tables, version 2.0. Grade 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort (&lt; 48 hours); no medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalizations possible. Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable.</description>

Liver function parameters were assessed using the modified Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) toxicity tables, version 2.0. Grade 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort (&lt; 48 hours); no medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalizations possible.

        <description>The number of participants with at least a 2-grade worsening from Baseline in electrolyte toxicities is presented. Electrolyte function parameters were assessed using the modified Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) toxicity tables, version 2.0.Grade 1 (Mild): Transient or mild discomfort (&lt; 48 hours); no medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 2 (Moderate): Mild to moderate limitation in activity, some assistance may be needed; no or minimal medical intervention or therapy required. Grade 3 (Severe): Marked limitation in activity, some assistance usually required; medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalizations possible. Grade 4 (Life-threatening): Extreme limitation in activity, significant assistance required; significant medical intervention or therapy required, hospitalization or hospice care probable. Baseline is defined as the value of the variable measured at Day 0 prior to dosing.</description>
