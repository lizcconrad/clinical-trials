  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being initiated to create a normal database including measures of optic nerve
      head (ONH), peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and macula using the Heidelberg
      Spectralis OCT device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, prospective, observational (non-interventional) study is the third in a
      series to measure structural parameters of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary retinal
      nerve fiber layer, and the macula using the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT device. This study is
      conducted in normal volunteers of various non-Caucasian ethnic group, and data will be
      combined with Caucasian subjects to be representative of the US population: (1) Hispanic
      Descent, (2) Black or African American Descent, (3) Asian Descent, (4) American Indian or
      Alaskan Native Descent. This study will complement the previous study S-2012-1 NORM-cc, in
      which normal data from Caucasian individuals were collected.

      The main goal of the study is to provide the range of these structural parameters in normal
      eyes. The study will include at least 87 (enrollment target: 135) normal volunteers; each
      study site will recruit at least 29 (target: 45) subjects with an age range of 18 to 90 years
      and an approximately equal number of females and males. All subjects will undergo Spectralis
      OCT imaging, biometric and ophthalmoscopic examination, disc photography and visual field
      testing in one single visit. All examinations performed on the subjects are non-significant
      risk procedures because the medical devices are cleared for marketing in Europe and in the
      U.S. Total study duration including IRB approval is anticipated to not exceed 4 months.

    <description>This normal database will be used to determine if an unknown subject has measurement values &quot;within normal limits&quot; or &quot;outside normal limits.&quot; It is planned to classify an eye &quot;within normal limits&quot; if the measurement value is greater than or equal to the 5th percentile of the normal distribution (or less than or equal to the 95th percentile), and as &quot;outside normal limits&quot; if the measurement value is smaller than the 1st percentile (or larger than 99th percentile) of the normal distribution. Thus, the sample size must be large enough to ensure that the 1st and the 5th percentiles of the distribution are distinct.</description>

        Recruitment will be from persons who respond to recruitment initiatives at the individual
        centers or have signed a release saying that they are willing to be approached for
        participation in research.

        At least 87 subjects (enrollment target: 135 subjects) will be selected from qualifying
        normal volunteers. Age range will be from ≥18 to 90 years. The age of the subjects will be
        defined by their month of birth versus the month of giving consent to participate in this
        study. A subject who is 40 years and 11 months old will be counted as being in the age
        group &quot;31 to 40 years&quot;. Each site will attempt to recruit subjects in about equal numbers
        in each age group. The distribution in the age groups should be fairly equal among subjects
        in each ethnic group alone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is not an employee of the eye clinic.

          -  Age ≥18 to 90.

          -  Able and willing to undergo the test procedures, give consent, and to follow
             instructions.

          -  Healthy eye without prior intraocular surgery (except cataract surgery) and without
             clinically significant vitreal, retinal or choroidal diseases, clinically significant
             diabetic retinopathy (subject may have diabetes), or disease of the optic nerve. Small
             Drusen are acceptable in older subjects.

          -  Hispanic Descent, Black or African American Descent, Asian Descent, American Indian or
             Alaskan Native Descent

          -  Negative history of glaucoma.

          -  Intraocular pressure ≤21mmHg.

          -  Best corrected visual acuity ≥0.5.

          -  Refraction between +6 and -6 diopters and astigmatism ≤ 2 diopters.

          -  Normal visual field with Glaucoma Hemifield Test and Mean Deviation within normal
             limits, or not abnormal visual field by judgment of the ophthalmologist.

          -  Clinically normal appearance of the optic disc, with normal appearing neuroretinal rim
             with respect to color and shape. The optic disc is examined ophthalmoscopically and by
             evaluation of stereo photographs.

          -  When both eyes are eligible, both eyes enter the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unreliable visual field. The reliability indices should be used as guide as well as
             the perimetrist's notes.

          -  Unusable disc stereo photos.

          -  Inability to undergo the tests.

          -  Insufficient quality of Spectralis OCT images (this is not determined until after
             Spectralis OCT examination, and is an unusual circumstance). Minimum requirements are:

               -  Retina completely included in image frame,

               -  Quality Score ≥ 20 in the stored ART mean images, and

               -  For ONH-R scan: Center position error ≤ 100 μm.

          -  Note: Inability of a subject to perform one of the two scan patterns or insufficient
             image quality in one scan pattern does not exclude the subject or eye from the study.
