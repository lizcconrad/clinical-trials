  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is used to treat preterm infants with an immature
      respiratory center and having respiratory distress. CPAP requires intensive care monitoring
      and special qualified staff. Continuous positive pressure makes a constant noise around the
      child and can lead to an uncomfortable environment.The fixture of the binasal prongs can
      cause nasal trauma after to tight attachment.Minimizing the time on CPAP is considered
      important for the child.

      Recently High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has become widely used in modern newborn intensive
      care units.HFNC is considered to be easy to apply and a more comfortable respiratory support
      for the preterm infant with mild and moderate respiratory distress. HFNC gives warm humified
      air with high flow through a nasal cannulae. HFNC is used as part of withdrawal from
      intensive respiratory support, to prevent respiratory distress and as a respiratory support
      after extubation.

      There is still uncertainty about safety and effectiveness of HFNC. The aim of this study is
      to investigate the preterm infants respiratory effort by measuring electrical activity in
      diaphragm (Edi max and Edi min), respiratory parameters and a clinical observation using a
      scoring system inspired by Silverman- Andersen retraction score. It is expected that measured
      electrical activity in the diaphragm, measured respiratory parameters combined with bedside
      observations provide applicable knowledge about preterm infants respiratory effort in
      transition from CPAP to HFNC.

      Data material will be stored on a separate computer in a sheltered home Directory. All data
      will be anonymous. Edi signals are transported from Servo-I ventilator with neural access
      through a communication port to a personal computer.Respiratory parameters will be stored in
      Picis (High Performance Hospital Information System). For the Statistical analyzes a T-test
      will be carried out, and data from the pilot study will decide the power to see whether we
      reject or retain the 0 hypothesis: &quot; There are no changes in the preterm infants respiratory
      effort in transition from CPAP to HFNC&quot;.
