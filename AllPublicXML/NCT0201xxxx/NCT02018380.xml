  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive, chronic disease affecting more than 20 million
      Americans. There is no known cure for OA and management includes pain control and prevention
      of functional decline.

      Purpose: To investigate the immediate effects of a shock absorbing insole (SAI) placed in the
      shoe on knee pain, functional mobility and lower extremity biomechanics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty adults (age 50+) with knee OA and pain will be recruited. A physician will diagnose the
      severity of knee OA through radiographs. Participants will be tested in the KBR Human
      Performance Lab on the campus of Winston Salem State University (WSSU). Participants will
      complete a demographic form and a survey about their knee pain and function. Participants
      will be evaluated under two conditions: 1) with SAI placed inside the shoe and 2) shoes
      alone. There are three walking tasks: 1) walking 25 feet at their usual pace; 2) walking 25
      feet at a fast pace; 3) walking six minutes for distance; and a 4) biomechanical gait
      analysis. After each of the walks, participants will rate the amount of knee pain they
      experienced. During the biomechanical analysis, participants will walk down a 20 foot walkway
      while wearing reflective markers. Eight cameras and a force plate embedded in the walkway
      will measure the amount of body movement and the forces applied to the leg joints during
      walking.

    <description>The shock absorbing insole used in this study was the SofSole Athletes Plus, (Implus Inc, Durham, NC), recommended by the manufacturer for repetitive activities such as running and walking. It is readily available in most athletic shoe stores, retailing for under $20.00. The insole is full-length with a curved last made of Implus XP that has a shore A durometer reading of 60 (0 = softest to 100 = hardest).</description>
