      BACKGROUND: Obesity is a global epidemic and Canada has one of the highest obesity rates in
      westernized countries. Obesity has many health related complications, including high blood
      pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis. Bariatric surgery is
      the most effective way of achieving long-term weight loss and treating the complications of
      obesity. There is good evidence to support the relationship between physical activity and
      weight loss following bariatric surgery. While the period leading up to surgery is considered
      an important opportunity for lifestyle modification, evidence to support recommendations for
      a supervised preoperative exercise intervention is lacking.

      OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to measure the short and intermediate-term
      benefits of a preoperative exercise intervention on patients awaiting publicly funded
      bariatric surgery in Manitoba. The primary outcome will be improvement in general exercise
      capacity as measured by change in 6-minute walk test (how far a person can walk on a flat
      surface in 6 minutes). Other outcomes will include excess weight loss, change in body
      composition, strength testing and irisin bloodwork &amp; muscle biopsy.

      HYPOTHESIS: It is hypothesized that preoperative exercise will result in improved exercise
      capacity and general fitness in the short and intermediate-term post-bariatric surgery.

      METHODS: Patients who are awaiting publicly funded bariatric surgery in Manitoba will be
      offered the opportunity to participate in a randomized study between usual preoperative care
      (n=35) and usual care plus a supervised exercise program (n=35). Usual care will involve
      multidisciplinary evaluation and preoperative counseling with a kinesiologist. In the
      intervention group, patients will participate in a 12-week supervised exercise program at the
      Reh-fit Centre.

      RESULTS: The study will determine the short and intermediate-term benefits of a preoperative
      exercise intervention on general fitness and exercise capacity as well as weight loss
      post-bariatric surgery. It is an important opportunity for collaboration between a
      multidisciplinary health care team and a medically-certified community fitness centre.
      Currently there are approximately 200 patients undergoing public bariatric surgery annually
      in Manitoba. If this study demonstrates a benefit to preoperative exercise, the results will
      be used to support an application to Manitoba Health for routine implementation of a similar
      intervention for all patients awaiting publicly funded bariatric surgery. It will also be
      used to support an application for a larger multi-institutional study of preoperative
      exercise at several Canadian bariatric centres.

    <time_frame>At study enrollment/pre-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Irisin is a recently discovered peptide secreted by the skeletal muscle. It has been proposed that this novel peptide is secreted by muscle in response to exercise training and trigger cross talk between skeletal muscle and other organs. In fact, the beneficial effects of irisin would be elicited through an up-regulation of energy consumption within adipocytes, which results in glucose tolerance improvement and increase in endurance performance. Until now, one study investigated the predictor of changes in irisin following a bariatric surgery. However, no study has yet investigated whether a pre-surgery physical activity program contributes to the change in irisin level in severely obese patients.</description>

    <description>Following randomization, the control group will receive usual preoperative care consisting of two to four multidisciplinary visits over six months. During this time, patients will be provided with exercise counseling through the team kinesiologist. They will complete a behavior modification program called Craving ChangeTM and must achieve usual goals of lifestyle and dietary modification, along with modest weight loss of approximately 5%, in order to be scheduled for surgery. Patients will also complete a liquid diet consisting of 900 calories per day for two weeks prior to their procedure in order to reduce intra-abdominal obesity and facilitate the procedure.</description>

    <description>The intervention group will undergo standard pre-operative care and will also be enrolled in a 12-week exercise program at the Reh-Fit Centre in Winnipeg. The Reh-Fit Centre is a non-profit organization with the mission to enhance the health and wellbeing of its members and the community by providing innovative health and fitness services. The intervention will be offered at no cost to the patient. It will involve regular supervised exercise sessions at the Reh-fit centre three times per week. Most patients will complete the intervention prior to commencing the liquid diet but will otherwise discontinue the program while on the diet two weeks prior to surgery.</description>

    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>12 week Exercise Program</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will be provided with a tour of the Reh-Fit Centre, exercise prescription, and supervised exercise session. The exercise prescription consists of 3 weekly 60-minute sessions, each with 10 minutes warm-up, 30 minutes endurance, 20 minutes strength training and 5 minutes cool-down. The program is overseen by an accredited Exercise Physiologist. Initial exercise intensity is determined by the kinesiologist and based on the patient's baseline fitness level. Goal intensity of endurance activity is based on the heart rate reserve (HRR) method. This is captured with a heart rate monitor at initial assessment and recorded on exercise logs. There are check-ins at each exercise session to determine progress (time, reps, weight, sets, etc). Endurance activities include treadmill, elliptical, walking, and aerobics. Strength training includes upper body, lower body, and trunk circuits. Patients will be asked to attend three weekly sessions at the Reh-Fit Centre.</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Orthopedic, neurologic or cardiopulmonary conditions that preclude moderately
             strenuous exercise

          -  In general, patients are not considered candidates for bariatric surgery if they are
             wheelchair bound or cannot tolerate moderate physical activity.

          -  Patients will also be excluded if they are unable to commit to attending regular
             sessions.
