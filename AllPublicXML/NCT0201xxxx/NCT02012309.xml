  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is complicated by high rates of infections and cancers which are often the
      cause of death rather than the HIV/AIDS virus itself. Treatment of HIV with antiretroviral
      medications has decreased the frequency of many complications by over 90%, but bacterial
      pneumonia remains extremely high. Current vaccines are not very effective in preventing these
      infections in patients with HIV infection. The investigators are studying the cells (B cells)
      that make antibodies to fight infection by binding to and killing bacteria. The goal is to
      understand how HIV impairs the ability of B cells to make antibodies in sufficient quantity
      and of sufficient quality to protect patients with HIV to learn how to enhance protection
      against these infections. The investigators also seek to understand the role of the bacteria
      (specifically Streptococcus pneumoniae) that normally live in the nose and throat in the
      development of pneumonia and other infections.
