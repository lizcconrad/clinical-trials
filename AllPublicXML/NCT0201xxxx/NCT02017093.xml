  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study was to explore the impact of enhancement of the velocity
      component error in the course of reaching movements of the impaired/hemiparetic limb in an
      acute stroke subject. We hypothesized that the method would shift velocity profiles toward
      the optimal, resulting in a reduction in error. A prototype robot. This robotic device system
      has a two-dimensional motor, basic measurement capacities, and a robotic arm which is engaged
      to the subject's upper-limb in a sitting position.

      The enhancement of the velocity component error would shift velocity profiles toward the
      optimal, resulting in a reduction in error.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The wrist of the subject is connected to the robotic arm by a strip which supports the arm
      but allows free movements of the wrist. This configuration allows subjects with impaired
      grasping ability to use the system. A bio-feedback system enables the subject to perform
      various functional motor tasks that are presented on the screen in front of him. The system's
      sensors detect motor errors or deviations from an optimal/proper movement trajectory or
      velocity profile. Any deviation in direction, velocity, acceleration or necessary force from
      the optimal trajectory results in applied robotic forces that enhance such errors/deviations.
      The sensors and the applied forces all work and compute in real time, so that the force
      measurements and the applied force are updated to the executed movement.

    <description>While reaching, people have typical movement pattern of trajectory, moving the end-effector (hand) in straight line. The abnormal motor control after a stroke may cause these patients to deviate from this pattern. Our robotic device enabled us to measure the magnitude of the deviation from the optimal profile of healthy people. This was followed by a calculation of the average error the paricipants made in each treatment session. So we finally recieved a score of the average magnitude of trajectory error the participants made through a treatment session. Each treatment seesoin composed of about 100 reaching movements. The outcome measure expresses the change in the movement error from T1 to T2.</description>

Error Enhancement deXtreme's prototype robot: The subjects were seated on comfortable chairs, individually adjusted, and connected to a manipulandum of deXtreme's prototype robot. We situated the chair so that the computer monitor could be clearly observed by the subject. Each subject's affected extremity was harnessed to a handle connected to a robotic arm accompanying the movement
Optimal Velocity Profile and Calculation of Error Enhancement: Fugl-Meyer (FM) and the Motor Assessment Scale (MAS) tests were included.</description>

          <title>Improvement in Average Movement Trajectory Error From T1 to T2</title>
          <description>While reaching, people have typical movement pattern of trajectory, moving the end-effector (hand) in straight line. The abnormal motor control after a stroke may cause these patients to deviate from this pattern. Our robotic device enabled us to measure the magnitude of the deviation from the optimal profile of healthy people. This was followed by a calculation of the average error the paricipants made in each treatment session. So we finally recieved a score of the average magnitude of trajectory error the participants made through a treatment session. Each treatment seesoin composed of about 100 reaching movements. The outcome measure expresses the change in the movement error from T1 to T2.</description>
