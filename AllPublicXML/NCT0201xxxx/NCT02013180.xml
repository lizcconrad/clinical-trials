  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is a useful marker for early detection of the
      prostate cancer, its specivity is not sufficient. Several PSA variations were defined in
      order to increase the specivity of the test, but they aren't much more effective than the PSA
      alone for detection of disease.

      In older studies reported that, serum and prostatic tissue zinc levels decreased in prostat
      cancer disease.

      In our study we aimed to establish the utility of serum zinc, PSA, free PSA/PSA (fPSA/tPSA),
      zinc/PSA, levels for early detection of the prostate cancer.
