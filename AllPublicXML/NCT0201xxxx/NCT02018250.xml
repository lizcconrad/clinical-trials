  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study will evaluate escalating dosages of MMB4 DMS to determine its safety when
      delivered intramuscularly (i.m.) to the anterior thigh.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess safety, tolerability, and PK of MMB4 DMS EF at up to six
      cohorts chosen to provide the range required for PK analyses, including assessment of dose
      proportionality.
