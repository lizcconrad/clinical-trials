  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among all the existing ways to treat obesity (lifestyle, pharmacological), Roux-en-Y gastric
      bypass (RYGB) surgery is currently the most effective. It results in long term weight loss
      maintenance, significant remission of obesity-related comorbidities and decreased overall
      mortality. It also induces changes in gastrointestinal hormones responses, with an increase
      of anorexigenic hormones GLP-1, and PYY.

      Although successful, the mechanisms for RYGB-induced weight loss are not completely
      understood. The RYGB does result in increased satiation, decreased calorie intake and
      decreased preferences for sweet and fatty foods. Previous work from our lab has shown using
      progressive ratio task (PRT) that RYGB specifically decreases the appetitive behaviour for
      sweet and fat stimuli but not for vegetables. The reasons for this change in appetitive
      behaviour after the surgery remain unknown. They may be triggered by changes in gut hormones,
      conditioned taste aversion (negative post-ingestive effects) or changes in serum bile acids
      levels.

      This study aims to assess whether RGYB-induced gut hormone changes contribute to the decrease
      in appetitive behaviour for sweet and fatty foods observed after the surgery.

      This is a double blind controlled study comparing the effect of blocking gut hormones with
      somatostatin analogue (octreotide) on the appetitive behaviour for sweet-fat candies will be
      carried out. Appetitive behaviour will be measured using the progressive ratio task.

      The investigators hypothesize that blocking the gut hormones in obese patients with RYGB will
      increase their appetitive behaviour for sweet-fat candies.

    <description>In the Progressive ratio task, the participants click a computer mouse in order to obtain a sweet/fat food reward. The effort required to obtain a reward is progressively increased. The breakpoint refers to the point at which the reward value of the food stimulus is lower than the effort necessary to obtain it and the participant stops pressing the button.</description>
