    <textblock>
      The hypothesis being tested is that inhibition of the enzyme known as elastase in the airways
      of patients with cystic fibrosis will help decrease the number of bacteria. Alpha1
      antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor, will be given to patients with cystic fibrosis by aerosol
      therapy twice in 1 day and sputum will be collected to measure the density of bacteria

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis is usually characterized by chronic bacterial infections of the airways.
      Neutrophils release the enzyme elastase in the airways and this enzyme can prevent the
      ingestion and killing of bacteria by the airway phagocytic cells. The hypothesis being tested
      is that inhibition of elastase in the airways will help neutrophils decrease the number of
      bacteria. Each subject with cystic fibrosis will first undergo aerosol therapy with a sterile
      saline solution and sputum will be collected 2, 4 and 6 hours after the aerosol therapy to
      measure the density of bacteria. Subsequently, alpha1 antitrypsin, an elastase inhibitor,
      will be given to the same patients by aerosol therapy twice in 1 day and sputum will be
      collected at 2, 4 and 6 hours after treatment to measure the density of bacteria. The results
      will be compared to those obtained after after aerosol therapy with saline solution.
