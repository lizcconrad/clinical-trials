      This study is a feasibility study to validate magnetizatin transfer (MT)-weighted balanced
      steady state free precession (bSSFP) cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) against current
      clinical gold standard diagnostics, and to determine the applicability of MT-weighted bSSFP
      cine CMR for diagnosis of fibrotic remodeling in chronic kidney disease (CKD5) patients.
      Participants will not receive a study drug or placebo and will not be randomized. A total of
      250 participants will be enrolled into this study.

      This study had two treatment arms.

      Arm 1: Participants will be enrolled in this arm if they have been referred to the Gill Heart
      Institute MRI center for diagnostic late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) -CMR imaging of
      fibrosis, or if they are a healthy volunteer.

      If a participant is a Gill Heart Institute referral patient , they will receive an
      intravenous (through a vein in the arm) infusion of gadolinium as part of their clinical
      examination. Participants will also have electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform performed in order
      to gate the MRI scan. The MRI scan of the heart, for which the participant has been referred
      will last approximately 1 hour. Participants will have an additional 5-10 minutes of scans
      performed, none of which require additional infusions.

      If the participant is a healthy volunteer, they will have an ECG waveform performed in order
      to gate your MRI scan, and they will have approximately 30-45 minutes of scanning performed
      on their heart. Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium.

      Arm 2: Only participants who are already participating in a study being conducted by Dr.
      Harmut Malluche at the University of Kentucky, Department of Nephrology or, if you are a
      healthy volunteer, will be enrolled into this arm.

      In this arm participants will receive an MRI of their heart, lasting 30-45 minutes.
      Participants will not receive an infusion of gadolinium.
