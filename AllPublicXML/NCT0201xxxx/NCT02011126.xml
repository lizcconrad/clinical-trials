  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well imetelstat sodium works in treating
      younger patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Imetelstat sodium may stop the
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the objective response rate, defined as partial response or better, of
      imetelstat (imetelstat sodium) in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      II. To further define and describe the toxicities associated with imetelstat in children with
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time to progression following treatment with imetelstat in children with
      relapsed or refractory solid tumors.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure tumor telomere length in archival samples, and to correlate telomere length to
      the clinical outcome of the study.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive imetelstat sodium intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 36 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

    <time_frame>Up to 126 days (6 courses)</time_frame>

    <description>Toxicity tables will be constructed to summarize the observed incidence in each reporting period by type of toxicity and grade. The relative frequency of each type of toxicity will be quantified as the number of toxicity-evaluable cycles in which the adverse event (AE) was noted at grade 3 or higher considered by the treating physician to be possibly, probably or definitely related to one of the agents in the regimen divided by the number of toxicity-evaluable courses administered to patients enrolled on the trial.</description>
