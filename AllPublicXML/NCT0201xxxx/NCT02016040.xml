      To evaluate the rate of patients without cancer detected by biopsies performed six months
      after hemi-ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) (Ablatherm ®).

      Evaluate the impact of the HIFU treatment on continence, sexuality and quality of life at one
      year. Evaluate the cost of hemi-ablation HIFU treatment.

      A prospective single -centre phase II, single arm, cohort study (therapeutic confirmatory)
      offering focal therapy using HIFU (Ablatherm ®) to 25 men with histologically proven
      localised low to intermediate risk prostate cancer (PSA ≤10ng/ml, Gleason score ≤ 7 ,T1c or
      T2b ). Precise mapping and characterisation of the disease will be established using
      multi-parametric (mp)-MRI and prostate biopsies. Only the lobe with disease will be treated.
