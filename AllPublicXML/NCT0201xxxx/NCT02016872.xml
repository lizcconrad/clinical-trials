  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help researchers investigate if a new imaging agent named
      18F-FMISO can predict if patients with lung cancer will respond to standard therapy, as well
      as whether disease will reoccur in the future. The study will also investigate whether a
      18F-FDG PET scan in the middle of radiation treatment can predict if lung cancer will respond
      to standard therapy. Information obtained from this study may help doctors design future
      studies in which they may target tumor areas that do not respond to therapy or may likely
      reoccur in the future.

    <description>All enrolled patients will undergo a baseline 18F-FDG PET scan as part of their standard clinical treatment for NSCLC. Dynamic 18F-FMISO PET scans will be performed on one of the GE PET/CT scanners in 3D mode, at least one day after the baseline 18F-FDG PET scan. The dynamic baseline 18F-FMISO studies may precede the 18F-FDG study if the patient had a CT or PET/CT scan within the last 30 days that would permit the investigators to localize the tumor of interest during the 18F-FMISO study. In a group of 5 patients, the feasibility of simultaneous imaging of 18F-FMISO and 18F-FDG will be assessed. The patient will have an IV line placed for radiotracer injection and for venous blood sampling. All dynamic PET scans will be performed over one PET FOV centered at the lesion position. The 18F-FDG mid-treatment PET/CT scan will be performed over only one bed position.</description>
