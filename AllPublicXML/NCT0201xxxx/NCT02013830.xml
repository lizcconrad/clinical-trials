  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Xeloda (capecitabine) plus
      intravenous Avastin (bevacizumab) in patients with advanced or metastatic liver cancer. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.

    <description>Percentage of participants with OR based on assessment of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. The best overall response achieved within the time from first drug administration to progressive disease or end of study was reported. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the normalization of tumor marker levels. No new lesions. PR was defined as greater than or equal to (≥) 30 percent (%) decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target lesions. Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits. No new lesions.</description>

    <description>The percentage of participants with disease control was based on assessment of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST criteria. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. The best overall response achieved within the time from first drug administration to progressive disease or end of study was reported. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the normalization of tumor marker levels. No new lesions. PR was defined as ≥ 30 % decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target lesions. Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits. No new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for PR or progressive disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Control</title>
        <description>The percentage of participants with disease control was based on assessment of confirmed CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) according to RECIST criteria. Confirmed responses were those that persisted on repeat imaging study at least 4 weeks after initial documentation of response. The best overall response achieved within the time from first drug administration to progressive disease or end of study was reported. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease, with the normalization of tumor marker levels. No new lesions. PR was defined as ≥ 30 % decrease under baseline of the sum of diameters of all target lesions. The short axis was used in the sum for target lesions. Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) or/and maintenance of tumor marker levels above the normal limits. No new lesions. SD was defined as not qualifying for PR or progressive disease.</description>

          <description>A cycle was defined as the following: Participants received 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab IV on Day 1 and 1600 mg/m^2/day capecitabine, tablets, PO, in a divided dose every 12 hours starting the evening of Day 1 and ending on the morning of Day 15, followed by 1 week of no treatment. This cycle was repeated every 3 weeks until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or for a maximum of 6 cycles. If all 6 cycles were tolerated without disease progression or development of unacceptable toxicity, participants then could have repeated the cycle until disease progression.</description>
