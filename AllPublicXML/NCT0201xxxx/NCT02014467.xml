    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study
      is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab (DMAb) in Chinese postmenopausal women
      with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture. The study design consists of two phases:
      Screening and 12-month Double-Blind treatment phase. Following the Screening phase, all
      eligible subjects will be randomized to receive Double-Blind DMAb (60 mg) or Placebo study
      medication in a 3:1 ratio. DMAb 60 mg and placebo will be administered as a single
      subcutaneous (SC) injection at the beginning of the Double-Blind phase and at 6 months
      following the initial dose. All subjects will receive daily supplementation of oral elemental
      calcium (at least 600 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 International Units [IU]). The primary
      objective is to determine the effects of DMAb compared to placebo with respect to mean
      percent change in BMD at the lumbar spine, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA), from Baseline to Month 12. Secondary objectives include the evaluation between the
      DMAb and placebo treatment groups: change in BMD: at the lumbar spine (Month 6), total hip
      (Months 6 and 12), femoral neck (Months 6 and 12) and trochanter (Months 6 and 12); and serum
      biomarkers of bone formation and resorption (Months 6 and 12). Clinical safety of denosumab
      will also be assessed in this population.

    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at the Lumbar Spine at Month 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. BMD scan was done using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). It is used to identify osteoporosis, determine risk for fractures, and measure response to osteoporosis treatment. The percentage change from Baseline for BMD was calcuated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value multiplied by 100 and divided by the Baseline value. The analysis was performed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted for treatment, region and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate for assessment. Region and treatment by region interaction was included in the model. Screening visit was considered as Baseline for BMD. For participants who withdrew early, the missing BMD assessments was estimated by the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), provided the assessment was taken on or after at least one month on-therapy.</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at the Lumbar Spine at Month 12</title>
        <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. BMD scan was done using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). It is used to identify osteoporosis, determine risk for fractures, and measure response to osteoporosis treatment. The percentage change from Baseline for BMD was calcuated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value multiplied by 100 and divided by the Baseline value. The analysis was performed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted for treatment, region and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate for assessment. Region and treatment by region interaction was included in the model. Screening visit was considered as Baseline for BMD. For participants who withdrew early, the missing BMD assessments was estimated by the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), provided the assessment was taken on or after at least one month on-therapy.</description>

          <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) at the Lumbar Spine at Month 12</title>
          <description>Bone mineral density (BMD) is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. BMD scan was done using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). It is used to identify osteoporosis, determine risk for fractures, and measure response to osteoporosis treatment. The percentage change from Baseline for BMD was calcuated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value multiplied by 100 and divided by the Baseline value. The analysis was performed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusted for treatment, region and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate for assessment. Region and treatment by region interaction was included in the model. Screening visit was considered as Baseline for BMD. For participants who withdrew early, the missing BMD assessments was estimated by the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF), provided the assessment was taken on or after at least one month on-therapy.</description>

        <description>BMD is the amount of bone mineral in bone tissue. BMD scan was done using DXA. It is used to identify osteoporosis, determine risk for fractures, and measure response to osteoporosis treatment. The percentage change from Baseline for BMD was calculated as the value at the indicated time point minus the Baseline value multiplied by 100 and divided by the Baseline value. ANCOVA model adjusted for treatment, center/region and Baseline BMD for the skeletal site under consideration as a continuous covariate for assessment. Region and treatment by region interaction was included in the model. Screening visit was considered as baseline for BMD. For participants who withdrew early, the missing BMD assessments was estimated by the LOCF, provided the assessment was taken on or after at least one month on-therapy.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Serum Carboxy-terminal Cross-linking Telopeptide of Type I Collagen (s-CTX) From Baseline to Month 6 and Month 12</title>
        <description>s-CTX is biomarker of bone resorption and formation. s-CTX was assessed during Screening, Month 6 and Month 12 in the Double-blind Treatment Phase. The value during Screening was considered as the Baseline value. Percent change from Baseline was assessed as the value at the indicated visit minus the Baseline value divided by the Baseline value x 100. A two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare percent change in s-CTX. Between group inferences is presented by p-values, Hodges-Lehmann estimates along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>
