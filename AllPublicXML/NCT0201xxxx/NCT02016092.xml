  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately one million Americans who live with Parkinson's disease with 50,000
      new cases per year and this rate is expected to rise with an aging population. The underlying
      pathophysiology and disease understanding of PD still remains elusive due to a combination of
      disease complexity and lack of predictive capability of existing models.

      The Berg Interrogative Biology™ discovery platform has demonstrated a unique capability in
      producing drug targets and biomarkers that truly represent a disease phenotype. It has been
      able to catalyze molecules now in late stage clinical trials in cancer and many pre-clinical
      candidate therapeutics and biomarkers in endocrinology and central nervous system (CNS)
      diseases. The platform is able to decipher normal versus disease signatures by integration of
      data sets from the genome, metabolome, proteome, and lipidome in an agnostic manner that is
      subjected to Bayesian Artificial Intelligence informatics. The resulting nodes are then put
      back into wet-lab validation before proceeding to proof-of-principle pre-clinical testing.

      By utilizing clinical data and specimens obtained by the medical specialists at The
      Parkinson's Institute, along with Berg's Interrogative Biology™, this study aims to discover
      a disease biomarker enabling the creation of a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease.

      Blood &amp; Urine Specimen Collection: Up to 20mL of venous blood samples will be collected for
      plasma multi-omic analysis, as well as optional genetic, analyses.

      Urine samples (~50ml) will be collected via sterile urine cup and transferred into
      appropriate urine tube for multi-omic analysis.

      All Samples may be saved for future studies, if consented.
