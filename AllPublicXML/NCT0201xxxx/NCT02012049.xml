    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to conduct the bioequivalence (biological equivalence of two
      preparations of a drug) test in healthy adults with &quot;Risperdal OD Tab. 2mg&quot; of Janssen Korea
      as the investigational drug and &quot;Risperdal Quicklet Tab. 2mg&quot; as the control drug.

      This was a randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance) and open labeled (all people
      know the identity of the intervention) study. All participants were hospitalized in research
      rooms and were subsequently restricted in exercise, eating, drinking, smoking and
      xanthine-beverages until the end of blood collection. Water was allowed to be taken until one
      hour before drug administration. Participants were randomly assigned into two groups, one
      group receiving Risperdal OD (investigational drug), and one group receiving Risperdal
      Quicklet (control drug). On the day of testing, blood was collected from all participants to
      provide baseline measurements. Subsequently, the study drug was orally administered to the
      participants, followed by blood collection of a total of 13 time points, up to 24 hours.
      After the blood collection was finished, participants were discharged after receiving proper
      guidance and being examined by a psychologist. Following a wash-out period (period when
      receiving no intervention) of one week, participants were hospitalized once more and crossed
      over to receive the study drugs following the same procedure above described. The approximate
      study duration (including the drug administration days and wash-out period) was approximately
      10 days.
