  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intention is to compare 60 patients with Achilles tendon rupture, who where randomized in
      1998-2001 preoperatively to receive end-to-end suturation by the Krackow locking loop
      technique either without augmentation or with one central down-turned gastrocnemius fascia
      flap (Silfverskjöld). Postoperative care was identical for both groups; A brace allowed free
      active plantar flexion of the ankle postoperatively, whereas dorsiflexion was restricted to
      neutral for the first three weeks. Weight bearing was limited for six weeks. To compare these
      treatments, we use 1998 published Leppilahti-score, Rand-36 quality of life-questionnaire and
      MRI. Mean follow-up time is 14 years.

      Hypothesis; Augmentation with a down-turned gastrocnemius fascia flap does not provide better
      result than would end-to-end suture repair with use of the Krackow locking loop surgical
      technique in long-term follow up.
