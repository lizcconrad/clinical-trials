  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Detecting abnormalities in the left ventricular mechanical and hemodynamic response to the
      stress of exercise may offer early diagnostic indicators in patients suffering from valvular
      disease such as mitral regurgitation. Ultrasound-based imaging methods have been gaining
      importance in providing prognosis among those patients. However, decreased signal to noise
      ratio in the images and increased motion-related artifacts during exercise stress
      echocardiography have been reported, with a lack of reproducibility of results and a the
      limitation of its availability only in reference centers. In our laboratory, we are able to
      perform supine bicycle exercise MRI (1.5 T) using the Lode ergometer mounted on the far end
      of the patient table, previously described in healthy volunteers.

      The first aim of our study is to demonstrate the safety and the feasibility of our MRI
      protocol in selected patients with asymptomatic severe organic mitral regurgitation, to
      assess left ventricular volumes and function, and regurgitant volume in comparison to
      exercise cardiac echography.

      Besides, few recent studies sustain the relevance of novel markers of central aortic function
      (compliance, distensibility and pulse wave velocity) assessed by noninvasive MRI to explore
      vascular aging. In monogenic connective tissue diseases, altered arterial stiffness is the
      premature signature of the disease in asymptomatic patients. Noninvasive evaluation of aortic
      stiffness would be useful for risk assessment and preventive follow-up strategies in young
      asymptomatic relatives of subjects with aortic inherited diseases, such as syndromic and
      non-syndromic familial forms of thoracic aortic aneurysm and /or dissection. Furthermore,
      this technique should be able to evaluate the effect of drugs on aortic stiffness change in
      trials, before and after drug therapy, more relevant than the classic change in aortic
      diameter measurement.

      The second aim of our study is 1) to provide the sensibility of our MRI protocol to estimate
      local and regional heterogeneity in aortic functional parameters (distensibility, compliance
      and PWV) 2) to evaluate the predictive value of these regional aortic parameters assessed by
      MRI to diagnose and to stratify the aortopathy related to presymptomatic Marfan patients and
      to bicuspid aortic valve in young adults, in comparison to carotids-femoral pulse wave
      velocity estimation by applanation tonometry.
