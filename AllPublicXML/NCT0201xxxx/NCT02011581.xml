  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn more about how our body produces sugar, breaks
      down fat for fuel, and makes insulin (the major hormone that controls the production of blood
      sugar and fat breakdown) during a 24-hour day and how body fat and muscle are involved in
      these processes.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there are diurnal differences in
      postprandial beta-cell function and hepatic insulin sensitivity and the factors that
      influence these metabolic functions, including insulin signaling, adipose tissue and systemic
      inflammation, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)-mediated nicotinamide adenine
      dinucleotide(NAD) biosynthesis, and sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2
      homolog 1 (SIRT1)) in overweight human subjects.

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Postprandial pancreatic beta-cell function will be evaluated by using a mixed meal labelled with stable isotope tracers, in conjunction with stable isotope tracer infusion. Metabolic outcomes from the breakfast meal will be compared with values obtained after dinner.</description>

    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>This muscle samples will be obtained two times (every 12 hours for 24 hours)to assess NAMPT and NAD+ concentrations, SIRT1 activity, and factors involved in insulin signaling.</description>
