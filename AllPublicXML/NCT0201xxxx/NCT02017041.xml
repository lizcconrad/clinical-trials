      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of a medication management aid for
      opioid dependence named SubAID. The SubAID system is a smartphone application and medication
      monitor designed to optimize adherence behaviors of an OD patient responsible for
      administering bup/nal maintenance therapy medication.

      Usability of the SubAID system will be tested utilizing a 3-Stage study design over a 5 week
      period among a cohort of subjects prescribed bup/nal and undergoing OST.

        -  Stage 1 - 1 week: Participants will use only an electronic medication monitor
           (MedSignals) in control mode to passively record baseline adherence to medication.

        -  Stage 2 - 2 weeks: Participants will use MedSignals in control mode and the smartphone
           application.

        -  Stage 3 - 2 weeks: Participants will use MedSignals in active mode and the smartphone
           application.

      After each stage usability assessments will be conducted to evaluate satisfaction with the
      products from participants.

    <description>MedSignals (www.medsignals.com) is a cellular communicating medication management device designed to improve adherence. It will be used to track when medication is removed from the device at dosing times and deliver audible and visual alerts at dosing times and to relay adherence data securely to patient files. Participants will use this device throughout the 5-week trial. It is a Class I device.</description>
