      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the use of I-Scan during colonoscopy leads to
      an increased yield of adenomas in the colon among a population at increased risk for CRC.

      Primary Outcome:

      Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR â€” No. of colonoscopies at which one or more histologically
      confirmed adenomas were found divided by the total no. of colonoscopies performed in the same
      time period) in the right colon using High Definition White Light Colonoscopy Versus I-Scan
      enhanced Colonoscopy.

      Secondary Outcomes:

        -  Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) of High Definition White Light Colonoscopy Versus I-Scan
           colonoscopy through out the entire colon.

        -  Adenoma Detection Rate (ADR) in the right colon during the &quot;Second look&quot;, irrespective
           of imaging modality.

        -  Polyp Detection Rate (PDR - No. of colonoscopies at which one or more polyps were
           found(regardless of the histological type) divided by the total no. of colonoscopies
           performed in the Same time period) for each arm of the study in Right colon and
           throughout the entire colon.

        -  Mean number of adenomas per procedure for each arm of the study in right colon and
           throughout the entire colon.

        -  Mean number of polyps per procedure for each arm of the study in right colon and
           throughout the entire colon.

        -  Number of neoplastic lesions for each arm of the study in the right colon and throughout
           the entire colon and number of neoplastic lesions missed on 1st pass of right colon.

        -  Proportion of patients with diminutive lesions (&lt; 5 mm) in each arm of the study

        -  Proportion of patients with Flat lesions (height &lt; 1/2 diameter) in each arm of the
           study

        -  Proportion of patients with Sessile Serrated Adenoma in each arm of the study

        -  Proportion of patients with invasive cancer in each arm of the study

        -  Presence or absence of learning effect while using this technology given that use of
           I-Scan may train the human eye to better identify adenomas even without image
           enhancement.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cause of cancer in Canada with an estimated
      lifetime risk of developing the disease of 6-7%. Each year there are approximately 21,000 new
      cases and 9,100 deaths attributable to this disease. Colonoscopy is one of several methods
      recommended for Colorectal Cancer (CRC) screening by current guidelines. While colonoscopy is
      the most invasive, it offers high diagnostic accuracy and ability for therapy (biopsy and
      removal of adenomas) compared to other modalities. The emerging evidence regarding missed
      neoplastic lesions with colonoscopy has resulted in quality initiatives designed to improve
      colonoscopy performance. I-Scan (Pentax, Montvale, NJ) is a new method that uses post
      processing computer algorithms to revise the standard white light to highlight pit patterns
      and vascular surface patterns.The relevant I-scan settings in the colon are I-scan 1 and
      I-scan 2. The primary objective of the study is to compare the adenoma detection rate in the
      right colon using High-definition white light colonoscopy versus I-scan enhanced colonoscopy.

      All patients referred for a screening colonoscopy at Forzani and MacPhail Colon Cancer Centre
      will be considered for enrollment.All eligible patients that are not part of another research
      study will be approached for enrollment into the study. During the pre-assessment at the
      clinic a study assistant will contact all the eligible patients to describe the study and
      provide an &quot;Invitation to participate in a Research study&quot; form. The study assistant will
      obtain a final consent if they agree. Those not interested will simply receive the Centre's
      standard protocol. There will be no coercion of any sort. Following Informed Consent,
      treatment allocation through computer generated randomization will be revealed. Patients will
      be allocated to one of the three study arms (HD Colon, I-scan 1 and I-Scan 2). Patients will
      receive a standard bowel preparation: Split dose Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) (2L at noon + 2L
      at 8 PM the day before) for morning procedures or (2L at 8Pm the day before and 2L at five
      hours before the procedure on the day of colonoscopy) for afternoon procedure. certified
      gastroenterologists will perform all of the procedures with the assistance of a nurse. The
      planned &quot;second look&quot; of the right colon will involve withdrawing from the Cecum to Hepatic
      flexure, then re-inserting to Cecum and finally withdrawing through the entire colon. The
      physician performing the procedure will then fill a &quot;Colonoscopy Report Form&quot; including the
      number of polyps detected, size, shape, polypectomy method and cleanliness of the bowel.

      The investigators did a pilot study with 150 subjects to check the mean no.of adenomas per
      colonoscopy, no.of adenomas detected in the right colon during the second look and to
      estimate the recruitment rate. Based on those results the investigators started this study
      with a large sample size. The investigators are planning to do an interim analysis after
      recruiting 450 subjects (30% of total enrollment). The results of the analysis will determine
      whether the investigators complete recruitment of the initially approved sample size of 1500
      subjects.
