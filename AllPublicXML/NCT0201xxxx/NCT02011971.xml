      Pilot studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with epilepsy to assess the potential
      efficacy and safety of different dosages of vinpocetine in improving cognition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive problems are common in patients with epilepsy, but there is currently no specific
      treatment available. Vinpocetine is a chemical obtained from the leaves of the Lesser
      Periwinkle. It has been shown to improve cerebral metabolism and memory in animals and
      humans. In addition, it has been shown to enhance long-term potentiation, which has been
      linked to memory mechanisms. Furthermore, vinpocetine has been shown to have anticonvulsant
      effects and is more potent than several commonly used antiepileptic drugs (i.e.,
      carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproate, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine and topiramate) in inhibiting
      both sodium and calcium channels, which control release of excitatory neurotransmitters that
      can lead to brain injury. Thus, vinpocetine might offer a unique drug to help cognition in
      patients with epilepsy. The investigators propose to conduct pilot studies in healthy
      volunteers and in patients with epilepsy to assess the potential efficacy and safety of
      different dosages of vinpocetine in improving cognition.

      Specific Aim 1a: To determine if vinpocetine enhances memory and other cognitive functions in
      healthy volunteers.

      Specific Aim 1b: To determine blood levels from 3 different acute oral doses of vinpocetine
      in healthy volunteers.

      Specific Aim 2a: To provide safety and preliminary of efficacy data that vinpocetine can
      enhance memory and other cognitive functions in patients with epilepsy.

      Specific Aim 2b: To determine blood levels from acute and chronic oral doses of vinpocetine
      in patients with epilepsy as well as effects on anticonvulsant blood levels.

      Specific Aim 2c: To provide preliminary of data that vinpocetine can reduce seizure frequency
      or duration in patients with epilepsy.
