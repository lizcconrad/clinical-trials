  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been reports suggesting that anti-epidermal growth factor antibody nimotuzumab is
      advantageous for advanced esophageal cancer patients in combination with chemotherapy or
      radiotherapy. However, whether maintenance therapy of nimotuzumab provides benefit to
      advanced esophageal cancer patients is not known.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We design this clinical trial to confirm the efficacy of maintenance treatment of nimotuzumab
      after initial treatment.
