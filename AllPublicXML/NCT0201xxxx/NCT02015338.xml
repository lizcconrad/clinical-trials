    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: In typically developing children (TDC), use of conventional EEG landmarks to
      determine the brain area that controls hand function will not differ from TMS-guided
      determination of individual motor hotspots. In children with hemiparesis, however, those two
      locations will diverge. The prediction is that TMS will best guide tDCS interventions

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital hemiparesis, mainly due to stroke, affects approximately 25% of children with
      cerebral palsy. Noninvasive brain stimulation has emerged to influence improvements in hand
      function specifically in children with congenital hemiparesis due to stroke.

      he use of one type of noninvasive brain stimulation, Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
      (tDCS), in conjunction with rehabilitation training intervention for a child with hemiparesis
      proposes a synergistic approach to improving hand function. Application of electrodes over
      certain targeted areas are placed with the intent to stimulate and influence neuronal
      activity.

      Our preliminary evidence suggests that in children with hemiparesis due to stroke, the area
      for placement is variable as noted by electroencephalogram (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS) measurement methods, influencing the site location of optimal stimulation
      for tDCS.

      Due to this variation, the optimal site of stimulation warrants investigation for the optimal
      placement of tDCS.
