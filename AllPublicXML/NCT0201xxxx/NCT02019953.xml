  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall approach to the study is to assess the feasibility of recruiting African
      Americans to participate in several health-promoting programs and to compare health outcomes
      among the three interventions.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The project is designed to achieve five specific aims: (1) To determine the feasibility of
      attracting African Americans into Health Promotion Research studies;(2) To determine whether
      clinically recorded information can be used as a guide for recruitment inclusion in Health
      Promotion Studies from an active epidemiological research cohort;(3) To measure the ability
      to retain African Americans recruited into Health Promotion Studies from an active research
      cohort;(4) To measure the adherence to various protocols within a Health promotion Study;
      and(5) To provide informed estimates of effect sizes for designing future Health Promotion
      Research.

      A total of 375 study participants from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) cohort, all of whom are
      African American, will be randomly assigned to one of five, equally-sized study arms: (1)
      practicing yoga three times per week; (2) practicing yoga two times per week; (3) practicing
      yoga one time per week; (4) walking briskly three times per week; and (5) attending a weekly
      healthy lifestyles class.

      All study arms will include a 24-week intervention. In addition, participants will have a
      total of four clinical visits with members of the study team baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks,
      and 48 weeks) in which the following measures will be recorded:

        1. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rates

        2. Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) - serum, fibrinogen - plasma (sodium
           citrate), homocysteine (plasma), and interleukin-6 levels (IL-6) (serum).

        3. Fasting total cholesterol, low density (LDL), direct high density lipoprotein (HDL), and
           triglyceride levels - all serum

        4. HbA1c level

        5. BMI, waist circumference

        6. Medication and supplement use and dosages

        7. Results of a study survey designed to measure participants' changes in their reported
           health-related quality of life, perceived stress, health behaviors, sleep patterns, and
           impact of pain on everyday life

      In addition, we will also record systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rates before
      and after each intervention session for all five study arms.

             COPD, uncontrolled moderate to severe hypertension, or a recent recipient of a
             pacemaker, and/or

             2. Change in blood pressure medicine or lipid-lowering medication up to 30 days prior
             to or plans for a change in the 30 days after enrollment in the study, and/or

             3. Already practicing yoga at least once per week or walking briskly for one hour at

             4. Inability to attend protocol sessions, and/or

             5. Diagnosis of an underlying medical illness that might be considered by the
             principal investigator to potentially impair one's safety or ability to complete the
             study protocol (example could possibly include uncontrolled asthma), and/or

             6. Current use of a prescription regimen that might be considered by the principal
             investigator to potentially impair one's safety or ability to complete the study
             protocol (examples could possibly include use of sedatives or other drugs that could
             affect a participant's ability to participate in any of the study arms).
