      Objectives:

      The disease being studied is asthma. The main objective of this study is to assess the
      feasibility of the recruitment goals and also the logistical issues related to use of
      tele-health technology in developing electronic asthma action plan (eAAP) and communicate
      with asthma patients in a time period of 24 months. The goals are: 1) enable asthma patients
      to self-manage their asthma symptoms. The secondary, 2) help care providers to intervene
      appropriately based on the patient's health status. The secondary objective is to explore the
      cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness of the proposed technology. Our research group proposes
      to complete a feasibility study, with an interim analysis for a formal power calculation and
      then acquire ethics to report these results and study design with anticipated publication
      prior to proceeding with a full randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this
      intervention. The outcome measure will be assessed and data will be presented in a 24-month
      time frame.

      Aims and goals:

      The main aim of our proposed study is to assist asthma patients to practice asthma
      self-management at home that will eventually enable them to control their asthma, and
      specifically, prevent asthma exacerbation. Therefore, the ultimate goal of our proposed study
      is to improve patient health outcome via enhancing patient-physician interaction and using a
      more practical asthma action plan model (eAAP) that could be followed easily by the patient
      and their doctor.

      Our hypothesis is that asthma patients who have access to the electronic online action plan
      complimented by weekly text messages to reinforce adherence will have a reduced rate of
      asthma exacerbation. We further hypothesize that these subjects will have an improvement in
      secondary measures including quality of life, better asthma control and patient satisfaction.
      We also anticipate that such an approach in asthma management will be cost-effective as
      outlined below.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our study design we propose to use a web-based application and inform asthma patients
      through weekly Text Message (SMS) reminders to take their controller medication regularly and
      also a message to visit the web-based e-AAP and assess the current level of asthma control.
      This will be a two-way interaction and personalized feedback protocol to monitor patients at
      home and during daily activities. We will use an adequate sample size to provide an interim
      analysis of efficacy and the subsequent total number of subjects that will need to be
      enrolled. Each patient (in the relevant group, as explained below) will have his/her own
      profile, which will enable us to send and receive personalized (exchange) information using a
      web application process via cell phones. This approach will allow interaction between patient
      and asthma care counselor/ provider aiming to improve asthma control.

      This study will test the hypothesis that using mobile phone reminder messages and web-based
      monitoring, as part of a structured care plan, will improve clinical outcomes; namely
      reduction in the rate of exacerbation, in patients with asthma. We also aim to explore the
      cost-effectiveness of this technology. Our research group proposes to complete a feasibility
      study, with an interim analysis for a formal power calculation and then acquire ethics to
      report these results and study design with anticipated publication prior to proceeding with a
      full randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of this intervention. We predict that
      using a combination of Internet and SMS messaging technology will empower patients to manage
      their asthma and eventually prevent asthma exacerbation based on their personalized action
      plan as well as a SMS application. We plan to compare the web-based/SMS reminder method with
      written action plan approach in a 24-month time frame, as explained later in this proposal.

    <description>Tracking outcomes: All subjects will be asked to contact the study coordinator in the event of an asthma exacerbation. Subjects will also be seen at six and 12 months post intervention for the evaluation of health care utilization and record their asthma exacerbations. In addition, at this time baseline questionnaires will be repeated. They will also receive a telephone contact at three and nine months to document any recent exacerbations which they may have failed to call in with regard.</description>

    <time_frame>Economic outcomes will be collected during the follow-up period (12 months after intervention). Cost-effectiveness will be assessed through decision-analytic modeling.</time_frame>
    <description>Economic evaluation of health technologies is concerned with the trade-off between the incremental costs and incremental effectiveness of technologies and therefore requires collecting information on both costs and effectiveness at the individual level. The interventions in each arm of the trial are based on getting feedback from patients and as such substantial amount of information on the use of controller medications and asthma exacerbations will be collected. At month 6 and 12 after the intervention, participants will be invited to the study center for a detailed interview during which we will collect information on asthma-related resource use in the previous 6 months and will estimate participants' quality of life. As a surrogate for adherence, we will track prescriptions refills before and during the study using access to patient's PharmaNET data; which is feasible in BC, Canada.</description>
