    <textblock>
      Rationale: Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide and is the most
      frequent cause of cancer death. Accurate staging is important because it directs treatment
      and prognosis. Mediastinal staging can be done by both EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA. These two
      techniques have a complementary diagnostic range and the combined procedure is suited for
      assessment of almost the entire mediastinum. In practice, when mediastinal tissue staging is
      indicated, endoscopists often perform either an EBUS or an EUS investigation (instead of the
      combined procedure). Second, frequently only one or two, by imaging suspected lymph node
      stations, are sampled (ie. targeted approach).

      Objectives: main and secondary:

        1. Complete endosonographic (combined endobronchial and esophageal) staging using a single
           EBUS scope improves locoregional staging (N2, N3, T4) versus EBUS staging alone.

        2. Systematic mediastinal staging results in improved locoregional staging compared to
           PET-CT directed assessment of the mediastinum (ie targeted approach).

      Study population: Patients with potentially operable and resectable NSCLC are eligible if
      there is an indication for mediastinal nodal sampling. Patients have an indication for
      EBUS-TBNA.

      Intervention: Patients will undergo an EBUS investigation followed by EUS-B in the same
      session. During this single scope procedure, lymph nodes that are suspected on prior CT-PET
      imaging and on subsequent ultrasound are sampled.

      Main study endpoint: The main study parameter is the sensitivity for locoregional disease
      (N2, N3, T4 disease) of complete endosonographic staging (by EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA) in
      comparison with EBUS staging alone.

    <description>Sensitivity is defined as number of true positives (pathologic proof of a nodal metastases) divided by the number of true positives and false negatives (thoracotomy with nodal dissection is the reference standard to detect false negatives).
The main study parameter is the sensitivity for locoregional disease (N2, N3, T4 disease) of complete endosonographic staging (by EBUS-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA) in comparison with EBUS staging alone.
In the event of pathological proof of mediastinal metastases (N2/N3) by endosonography patients are classified as having locally advanced disease (stage III) and the study stops. When no mediastinal metastases are found by endosonography, surgical verification will take place (reference standard).</description>
