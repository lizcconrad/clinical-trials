  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of pterygium is still quite controversial. Previous studies using a large
      incision for pterygium excision and a large graft and has reported a very low recurrence rate
      with the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique. However, the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique is a relatively
      lengthy procedure and may not be suitable for patient with limited conjunctival reserve.
      Thus, we try to evaluate the final outcome of a sutureless amniotic membrane transplant
      technique combining the extended pterygium excision in hope to avoid the complication of the
      P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique.

      The treatment of pterygium is still quite controversial. There is a lack of consensus in the
      ophthalmological community about the optimal surgical management of pterygia. The main
      challenge to successful surgical treatment of pterygium is recurrence, evidenced by
      fibrovascular growth across the limbus onto the cornea.

      Previous studies using a large incision for pterygium excision and a large graft and has
      reported a very low recurrence rate with the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique. However, the
      P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique is not that perfect since it is a lengthy procedure,
      requires meticulous handling of tissue, and is associated with significant postoperative pain
      and, frequently, transient diplopia. Therefore, we try to evaluate the final outcome of a
      sutureless amniotic membrane transplant technique combining the extended pterygium excision
      in hope to avoid the complication of the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique. This
      sutureless technique with the tissue glue may promote increased clinical use of amniotic
      membrane patch by alleviating patients' pain and shortening surgical time.
