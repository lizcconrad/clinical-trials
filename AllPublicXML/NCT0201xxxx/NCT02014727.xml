  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of 3 doses given at D0, W4, and W26 of 50 µg
      dosage of AMA1-DiCo adjuvanted either with GLA-SE or Alhydrogel® in healthy European adults
      not previously exposed to the parasite P.falciparum and in healthy African adults exposed to
      the parasite. The safety and the tolerability of the vaccine will be assessed on the rate of
      solicited and unsolicited events/reactions. The safety profile will include local and
      systemic reactions/events as well as the biological safety, based on a clinically significant
      change of the baseline value of the main biological criteria.

      The project aims are :

      -To evaluate the safety of 50 µg AMA1-DiCo malaria vaccine candidate with GLA-SE and
      Alhydrogel® as adjuvant, in healthy European adults not previously exposed to the parasite
      Plasmodium falciparum and in healthy African adults exposed to the parasite.

      T-o assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigens by measuring the level of IgG
      in all volunteers.

      To assess the cellular immune response by measuring the T cell cytokines IL-5 and IFNγ
      production following in vitro stimulation with the vaccine antigens in all volunteers.

      Design :

      This trial is a staggered Phase Ia/Ib, Randomised, Double-blind, Multi-center Centre trial.

      Two different adjuvants will be assessed, Alhydrogel® and GLA-SE. One dosage of 50 µg/3
      injections of AMA1-DiCo will be evaluated for each adjuvant.

      Sixty six (66) healthy volunteers will be included into the 2 following cohorts (A and B):

      Cohort A: 30 Non-exposed European Volunteers (France) Cohort B: 36 Malaria Exposed African
      Volunteers (Burkina Faso)

      The non-exposed European volunteers (cohort A) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into two
      groups of 15 volunteers per group.

      The malaria exposed African volunteers (cohort B) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio, into two
      groups of 18 volunteers per group.

      European Volunteers: Cohort A (30):

      Group A1 (15): 50µg AMA1-DiCo + Alhydrogel® Group A2 (15): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo+ GLA-SE

      African Volunteers Cohort B (36) :

      Group B1 (18): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo + GLA-SE Group B2 (18): Placebo (isotonic saline solution)

      In order to start recruitment in cohort B (Africa), the safety will be evaluated on the data
      of all European volunteers until Day 7 after 1st immunisation of the last European volunteer
      Data will be presented to an Independent Data safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will be
      appointed for this trial

    <measure>The quality of the cellular and humoral immune responses</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months after the last vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of the humoral immune response will be assessed by measuring:
IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses by ELISA on samples obtained at Day 0 and Week 30. IgG responses to four natural allelic variants by ELISA on samples obtained at Days 0 and Week 30.
An IFA will be employed to verify that the antibodies elicited by the vaccine recognize the native protein on merozoites on samples obtained Day 0 and Week 30.
Competition ELISA with AMA1 antigen added as competitor at Week 30. The ability to inhibit parasite growth in vitro by a Growth Inhibition Assay (GIA) against at least 3 parasite strains on samples obtained at Day 0, Week 30 and 52.
IgG avidity by ELISA on a panel of AMA1 alleles at Week 30.
The quality of the cellular immune response will be assessed by measuring the production of a panel of T cell cytokines in the ELISpot supernatants by multiplex cytokine assay on samples obtained at Day 0, Week 26, 30 and 52.</description>
