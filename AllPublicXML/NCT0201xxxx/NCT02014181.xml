  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Flaxseed (FS) is a safe and well tolerated supplement with an ability to fight inflammation
      and oxidative stress - a byproduct of daily stress the human body faces everyday and
      especially with chronic diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease resulting from a
      mutation in sodium and chloride transport channels that results in pancreatic insufficiency,
      chronic sinusitis and chronic lung infections. The investigators hypothesize that chronic
      inflammation and oxidative stress are a part of the chronic exacerbations that are a part of
      cystic fibrosis. The investigators believe that flaxseed with its anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidative properties can help dampen these stressors on the CF lung and potentially
      result in fewer exacerbations of CF, fewer antibiotics, fewer hospitalizations, and improved
      well-being.

    <textblock>
      Ten patients with steady-state cystic fibrosis (CF) - not hospitalized, not on intravenous
      antibiotics, with stable FEV1 40-100% predicted were enrolled in a four week long pilot study
      where-in each patient consumed 40 grams of flaxseed each day, in the form of finely ground
      flaxseed, however they wished. Prior to starting flaxseed, each week, and then four weeks
      after each patient had finished taking flaxseed, markers of inflammation and oxidative
      stress, as well as measurements of flaxseed metabolism were collected. F2-isoprostanes,
      8-oxo-dGuo, as well as cytokines including IL-6, TNF-a, IFN-g among others were measured to
      trend flaxseed effects. Enterolignans - enterodiol and enterolactone (products of flaxseed
      metabolism) were measured each week as well.

    <description>10 patients with cystic fibrosis were asked to consume 40 grams daily of finely ground flaxseed powder (however they wished) for one month. To assess side effects, each patient kept a journal to ascertain what side effects (if any) were most common among consumers of this dose of flaxseed. Side effects could include, but were not limited to, nausea, bloating, diarrhea or constipation. Other even rarer side effects could be bleeding, flushing, or anaphylaxis.</description>

    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>10 patients with CF who had consumed 40 grams daily of flaxseed had urine and blood collected once weekly to ascertain potential effects of flaxseed consumption on systemic biomarkers of oxidative stress, including F2-isoprostanes, 8-oxo-dGuo, TNFa, IL-6, IFNg.</description>
