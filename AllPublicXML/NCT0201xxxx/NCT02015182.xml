    <textblock>
      The aims of this study are to determine population PK parameters of bupivacaine in children
      following TAP block using a population-based PK approach, and to evaluate the influence of
      patient covariates on drug disposition.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The number of published pediatric studies on the use of transversus abdominis plane (TAP)
      block has increased in recent years. The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block has been
      used for postoperative analgesia for surgery to the abdominal wall and involves the injection
      of local anesthetic solution into a plane between internal oblique (IO) and transversus
      abdominis (TA) muscles. The TAP block has the advantage of providing unilateral analgesia in
      instances of non-midline abdominal incision and is particularly useful in cases where
      epidural blockade is either contraindicated or technically or logistically not feasible.
      Bupivacaine and ropivacaine have been used as local anesthetics for TAP blocks in published
      studies to date. However, no data exist regarding the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine after
      TAP block in children. The aims of this study are to determine population pharmacokinetic
      (PK) parameters of bupivacaine in children following a TAP block, using a population-based PK
      approach.

    <time_frame>0 - 360 minutes after the TAP block is performed</time_frame>
    <description>Blood will be drawn from an indwelling intravenous catheter. Each patient will have a total of 6 samples collected during each of the following time blocks: 0 - 10 minutes, 11 - 20 minutes, 21 - 30 minutes, 31 - 60 minutes, 61 - 180 minutes and 181 - 360 minutes after the TAP block is performed. Age, weight, sex, concomitant drugs (intravenous and inhalation anesthetics, muscle relaxants, and opioids), and kidney function data will be investigated as co-variables for each of the primary parameters. We will obtain estimates of total clearance (CL), volume of distribution, elimination half life (t1/2), estimates of clearance, and absorption rate constant.</description>

    <description>Bupivacaine levels will be measured with an assay developed on the 4000 QTrap Tandem Mass Spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/ MDS Sciex).
Data will be collected and analyzed using the Agilent ChemStation software (Rev A.10.02). The analytical column is an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 (4.6 x 150mm, 5µm).Quantification of bupivacaine is based on analyzing a six point calibration curve (0 to 4.0 mg/L). An internal standard (Prilocaine 221.2/86.1) is included with each calibrator, quality control or patient sample. Instrumentation and Chromatographic conditions: The HPLC system consists of a Specta-System P1000 Isocratic Pump and an AS3000 Autosampler (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham MA).</description>
