  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the PK (tesamorelin) and PD (IGF-1)
      profiles of tesamorelin after a single 2 mg subcutaneous administration and after repeated
      administration once daily for 14 consecutive days. Secondary objectives include the
      evaluation of the safety and tolerability of tesamorelin following multiple subcutaneous
      injections.
