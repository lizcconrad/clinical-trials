      The purpose of the study is to collect data regarding the aesthetic outcomes of patients who
      had breast reduction surgery and /or mastopexy in terms such as scaring, patient
      satisfaction, breast ptosis assessment including taking photographs and filling
      questionnaires.

      This is a prospective observational study, single center cohort to explore the aesthetic
      outcomes of patients who had breast reduction and / or mastopxy surgery. The surgical
      intervention will be determined by the clinician with no correlation to this study.

      The study will focus on the aesthetic aspects of the clinical outcome resultant from the
      breast surgery in par course of 5 years. Scar tissue assessment and patient's reported data
      (satisfaction and well-being) will be collected.

      Suitable patients will be assessed for study eligibility at a screening visit and, if
      eligible, will be scheduled for breast surgery according to the patient and surgeon
      discretion.

      At each follow up visit, patients will undergo clinical general examination, breast and
      ptosis endearments, scar appearance , aesthetic evaluation. Patients will fill satisfaction
      questionnaires
