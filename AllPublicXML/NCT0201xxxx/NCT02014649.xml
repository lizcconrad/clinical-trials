  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1/2 protocol is designed to collect safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic data
      of two doses of Laninamivir Octanoate in children and adolescents. The protocol will also
      explore virology and efficacy endpoints.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 48 subjects aged 5-17 years inclusive will be randomised into the study.

      Subjects with recent onset of presumptive influenza will have influenza A or B infection
      confirm by Rapid Antigen Test.

      The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis. The dose is administered in a single
      session in the clinic on Day 1. The subject will return to the clinic for assessments and
      follow up.
