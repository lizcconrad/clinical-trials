  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Methamphetamine (MA) abuse is a national public health concern. People who are dependent on
      MA have problems with mental functions (e.g., learning, remembering, focusing attention,
      solving problems). Such problems can interfere with their treatment for MA abuse, and thereby
      may promote continued drug use. While the effects of MA have been studied in rodents and
      non-human primates, its effects on the human brain have not been well characterized.

      This is a study of nontreatment seeking individuals who use MA compared to individuals who do
      not use MA(control participants). The study has three goals: 1. it aims to identify the brain
      regions and pathways that may contribute to the problems of MA abusers in performing mental
      tasks; 2. it will serve as a double-blind, placebocontrolled,within-subjects study to
      determine the safety and tolerability, and positive effects of MA in MA-abusing volunteers
      treated with atomoxetine or placebo; 3. It aims to compare the brain activity as measured by
      structuraland functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). These are noninvasive brain
      imaging procedures, that will be used to study brain function while control and MA using
      participants take atomoxetine or placebo and perform tests of memory and concentration.

      MA abusing participants will undergo a 1-day outpatient screening and if it is safe for the
      participants to proceed with the study they will participate in two inpatient phases of the
      study that will occur in the UCLA research setting, the General Clinical Research Center. The
      first inpatient stay will be 15 days, and the second will be a 9 days stay that includes drug
      administration and assessments. There will be at least a two week interval between inpatient
      phases. During the inpatient phases participants will receive alternating study drugs;
      atomoxetine or placebo and four sessions of IV MA administration or placebo.

      The study schedule for control participants will include a 1-day outpatient screening and two
      phases of outpatient administration of atomoxotime or placebo with a two week study drug free
      interval between the phases. Four to five of the outpatient study visits will involve
      cognitive tests and brain imaging studies.

      As a preliminary step, the investigators will screen the experimental data for normality and
      for potential associations between outcome variables with demographic variables at baseline.
      In cases of strong deviations from normality, log or power transformations will be used as
      appropriate. For the subjective effects questionnaires, the peak effect will be identified
      for each subject and used as the dependent variable. The primary analytical technique will be
      linear mixed effects regression. The general linear mixed model (GLMM) is equivalent to
      repeated measures ANOVA when all subjects have complete data but automatically handles
      missing observations, producing unbiased estimates as long as the values are missing at
      random. This approach will allow use of the data from subjects who complete only part of the
      protocol or who have invalid measurements on some tests, greatly enhancing our power.

      The sample size is as large or greater than those in the previous human laboratory studies
      assessing safety and initial efficacy of agonist-like pharmacotherapies for stimulant
      dependence. For example, these previous studies used samples of 7 (Herin et al., 2010; Stoops
      et al., 2008; Dackis et al., 2003), and 10 (Sofuoglu et al., 2009) subjects to obtain
      significant reductions in subjective effects of d-amphetamine by atomoxetine and those of
      cocaine by modafinil.

      To be conservative, the investigators base power estimates on completers but will use
      available data from all 30 subjects in GLMM analyses. This should substantially increase
      power (power for GLMM and repeated measures ANOVA are equivalent except that ANOVA cannot
      utilize incomplete data, while a GLMM can).

                  Bioeffects, Safety, and Patient Management72 ,supplemented by the current
                  information published on the International MR Safety Web Site:
                  http://www.mrisafety.com/safety_info.asp Criteria for Discontinuation Following
                  Initiation

        1. Positive urine drug screen or breath test indicating illicit use of cocaine, MA,
        alcohol, opiates, or other abused drugs not delivered as part of this protocol; 2.
        Inability to comply with study procedures; 3. Meet discontinuation criteria due to
        exaggerated response to MA, described below.

        Stopping Criteria Participants must continue to meet inclusion criteria in order to remain
        in the protocol. Thus, MA administration procedures will not be initiated if there are
        clinically significant arrhythmias or if vital signs are outside of acceptable ranges:
        Resting Pulse: 50-90 beats per minute. Systolic Blood Pressure: 105-140 mm Hg Diastolic
        Blood Pressure: 45-90 mm Hg In addition, repeated doses of MA will not be administered (and
        the study physician or nurse practitioner will halt continued MA delivery) if there are
        behavioral manifestations of MA toxicity (agitation, psychosis, inability to cooperate with
        study procedures). Note that participants remain eligible to remain in the study provided
        that vital signs do not exceed the limits below.

        Stopping Criteria for Further Participation

        Subject participation will be terminated if any of the following events occur:

          1. Systolic BP &gt; 200 mm Hg sustained;

          2. Diastolic BP &gt; 110 mm Hg sustained;

          3. Heart rate &gt; (220 - age) x 0.85 bpm.

          4. A clinically significant ECG abnormality, such as:

         10. Have a significant family history of early cardiovascular morbidity or mortality.

         11. Have a diagnosis of adult asthma, including those with a history of acute asthma
             within the past two years, and those with current or recent (past 2 years) treatment
             with inhaled or oral beta-agonist or steroid therapy (due to potential serious adverse
             interactions with atomoxetine).

         12. Be actively using albuterol or other beta agonist medications, regardless of formal
             diagnosis of asthma. If respiratory disease is excluded and the subject will consent
             to discontinue agonist use, s/he may be considered for inclusion.

         13. For subjects suspect for asthma but without formal diagnosis, 1) have a history of
             coughing and/or wheezing, 2) have a history of asthma and/or asthma treatment two or
             more years before, 3) have a history of other respiratory illness, e.g., complications
             of pulmonary disease (exclude if on beta agonists), 4) use over-the-counter agonist or
             allergy medication for respiratory problems (e.g., Primatene Mist): a detailed history
             and physical exam, pulmonary consult, and pulmonary function tests should be performed
             prior to including or excluding from the study or 5) have an FEV1 &lt;70 %.

         14. Have any illness, condition, and/or use of medications that in the opinion of the site
             Principal Investigator and the admitting physician would preclude safe and/or
             successful completion of the study.

         15. Have active syphilis that has not been treated or refuse treatment for syphilis (see
             note).

         16. Subjects who are HIV-positive will be excluded because HIV infection and the
             development of AIDS produce alterations in brain activity. Such effects on brain
             activity could confound the results of this study.

         17. Have a current or past history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia disorder.

         18. Have neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease.

         19. Have evidence of significant liver or kidney dysfunction.

         20. Have a history of urinary retention or bladder outlet obstruction.

         21. Be UCLA students or staff.

         22. Have evidence of active tuberculosis infection.

         23. Only for MRI Procedures:

               -  We will exclude any participant from MRI scanning procedures whose body contains
                  a ferromagnetic implanted device that might produce a safety hazard during fMRI.
                  We will follow guidelines found in the manual, Magnetic Resonance: Bioeffects,
                  Safety, and Patient Management72 ,supplemented by the current information
                  published on the International MR Safety Web Site:
                  http://www.mrisafety.com/safety_info.asp Note: Syphilis testing will not be
                  performed as part of this study and the study will rely solely on subjects' self
                  report.

        Criteria for Discontinuation Following Initiation

          1. Positive urine drug screen or breath test indicating illicit use of cocaine, MA,
             alcohol, opiates, or other abused drugs not delivered as part of this protocol;

          2. Inability to comply with study procedures. -
