  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that a single high dose of steroid before surgery may reduce pain the first
      48 hours after insertion of a new joint in the knee, a so called &quot;total knee arthroplasty&quot;
      (TKA). Consequently, this has been introduced as standard treatment of most patients at
      several Danish orthopedic departments. Although there are some concerns about the possibility
      of increased risk of prosthesis infections, this has not been proved in previous studies.
      However the studies are few, have limited number of patients and are not done using a
      standardized perioperative set-up.

      This study is made to monitor the safety of a single high dose steroid injection before TKA,
      with regards to prosthesis infection within one year of surgery.

      We hypothesize that there will be no increase in infections in patients receiving steroid
      injection before TKA compared to a historical cohort of patents who did not receive a steroid
      injection before their TKA.

      In order to reduce pain intensity as much as possible after surgical procedures, modern
      multimodal analgesic strategies using different analgetics targeting different mechanism of
      the pain reception system are used. At the same time this may reduce the use of opioids,
      which commonly cause sideeffects such as nausea, vomiting, obstipation,urinary retention,
      itching, respiratory suppression and sedation.

      In spite of the use of a wide perioperative multimodal analgesia, pain after total knee
      arthroplasty (TKA), is stil a considerable clinical problem and need for optimisation of the
      immediate postoperative pain treatment. There is evidence that &quot;high&quot;dose glucocorticoids
      administered preoperatively reduces the level of pain and the use of opioids after surgery. A
      recent review did not give cause for concern regarding use of glucocorticoids in TKA,but
      found that data on longterm safety aspects are lacking, why no recommendations could be made.

      As the limited evidence presently points to af benefit of glucocorticoids without serious
      side effects, the treatment has been introduced as standard treatment in TKA at several of
      the departments participating in the Lundbeck Foundation Centre for fast-track Hip and Knee
      Replacement collaboration.

      This study is made to monitor the safety of high dose steroid injection before TKA, with
      regards to prosthesis infection within one year of surgery.

      We hypothesize that there will be no increase in infections in patients receiving steroid
      injection before TKA compared to a historical cohort of patents who did not receive a steroid
      injection before their TKA.

    <description>Causes if infection are subdivided into the following:
Deep prosthesis related infection
Superficial infection (defined as surgery verified infection above level of the fascia)
Clinical / paraclinical suspicion of infection only treated with intravenous antibiotics (no surgical procedure)
Possible infection, but no clinical/paraclinical suspicion of infection, why the patient is discharged without intravenous antibiotic treatment/surgery.
Surgical wound revision (no clinical/paraclinical suspicion of infection)
Surgical knee manipulation due to limited range of movement (no clinical/paraclinical suspicion of infection).
Surgery due to aseptic non-traumatic loosening of the knee.
Surgery due to traumatic loosening of the knee</description>
