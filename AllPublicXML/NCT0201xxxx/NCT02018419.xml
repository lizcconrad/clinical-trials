  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II study is designed to compare different treatment schedules of a personalized
      anti-cancer vaccine protocol which combines the cryoablation of a selected metastatic lesion
      with intra-tumor immunotherapy. The cryoablation causes the tumor to release tumor-specific
      antigens into the surrounding environment. The injection of bioengineered allogeneic immune
      cells, AlloStim(TM), into the lesion is designed to modulate the immune response and educate
      the immune system to kill other tumor cells.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess three different dosing schedules. A standard 3 plus 3 study design will
      be used. The starting dose for each dosing schedule will be escalated in subsequent groups of
      patients. The study will evaluate safety of increased frequency of AlloStim (TM) dosing and
      anti-tumor effect of the new proposed dose and frequency schedule.
