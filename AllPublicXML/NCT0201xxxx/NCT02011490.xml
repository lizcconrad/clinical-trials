  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetics of a single 4 mg/kg
      intravenous (IV) dose of sugammadex in participants with moderate and severe renal
      insufficiency compared to that in participants with normal renal function. The study consists
      of two parts. In Part 1, participants with renal insufficiency and healthy participants will
      be administered study drug by IV bolus injection into a peripheral vein. In Part 2,
      participants with renal insufficiency and healthy participants will be administered study
      drug as an IV bolus into a peripheral vein, through an IV catheter connected to IV tubing
      with injection port. Subjects who participate in Part 1 of study may be enrolled in Part 2,
      which would reduce the overall number of participants enrolled for the study.

    <measure>Geometric Least Squares Mean Area Under the Plasma Drug Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-∞) Following a Single IV Dose of Sugammadex</measure>
    <time_frame>For participants with: normal renal function - up to 48 hours post-dose (Part 1 + Part 2); moderate renal insufficiency - up to Day 28 (Part 1) or Day 10 (Part 2); severe renal insufficiency - up to Day 35 (Part 1) or Day 14 (Part 2)</time_frame>
    <description>Plasma samples for determination of sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained pre-dose and at specified post-dose time points. AUC0-∞ was calculated as the sum of the AUC to the last time point with a detectable plasma concentration (AUC0-last, determined by trapezoidal method) and the extrapolated area given by Cest,last/λz, where Cest,last is the estimated concentration corresponding to the time of the last measurable concentration and λz is the apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant. For each subject, λz was calculated by regression of the terminal log-linear portion of the plasma concentration-time profile. The reported least squares mean is the geometric least squares mean, which is the back-transformed least squares mean from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) linear fixed-effect model performed on natural log-transformed values of AUC0-∞. This calculation also provides the associated 95% confidence interval.</description>

        <title>Geometric Least Squares Mean Area Under the Plasma Drug Concentration-time Curve From Time Zero to Infinity (AUC0-∞) Following a Single IV Dose of Sugammadex</title>
        <description>Plasma samples for determination of sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained pre-dose and at specified post-dose time points. AUC0-∞ was calculated as the sum of the AUC to the last time point with a detectable plasma concentration (AUC0-last, determined by trapezoidal method) and the extrapolated area given by Cest,last/λz, where Cest,last is the estimated concentration corresponding to the time of the last measurable concentration and λz is the apparent first-order terminal elimination rate constant. For each subject, λz was calculated by regression of the terminal log-linear portion of the plasma concentration-time profile. The reported least squares mean is the geometric least squares mean, which is the back-transformed least squares mean from the analysis of variance (ANOVA) linear fixed-effect model performed on natural log-transformed values of AUC0-∞. This calculation also provides the associated 95% confidence interval.</description>
        <time_frame>For participants with: normal renal function - up to 48 hours post-dose (Part 1 + Part 2); moderate renal insufficiency - up to Day 28 (Part 1) or Day 10 (Part 2); severe renal insufficiency - up to Day 35 (Part 1) or Day 14 (Part 2)</time_frame>
        <population>Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed only for Part 2 data for participants in Part 2. Analysis was not conducted for Part 1, as review of drug concentration data, and dosing issues noted at investigative sites, indicated that in some participants, doses may not have been administered directly into vein, and likely infiltrated surrounding tissue.</population>

        <title>Geometric Least Squares Mean Area Under the Plasma Concentration Versus Time Curve From Time Zero to the Last Measurable Concentration (AUC0-last) Following a Single IV Dose of Sugammadex</title>
        <description>Plasma samples for determination of sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained pre-dose and at specified post-dose time points. AUC0-last was determined by trapezoidal method. The reported least squares mean is the geometric least squares mean, which is the back-transformed least squares mean from the ANOVA linear fixed-effect model performed on natural log-transformed values of AUC0-last. This calculation also provides the associated 95% confidence interval.</description>

          <description>Plasma samples for determination of sugammadex pharmacokinetic parameters were obtained pre-dose and at specified post-dose time points. Vss is the theoretical volume that the total amount of administered drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it is in blood plasma at steady state, calculated as CL*MRT.</description>

Analysis was not conducted for Part 1, as review of drug concentration data, and dosing issues noted at investigative sites, indicated that in some participants, doses may not have been administered directly into vein, and likely infiltrated surrounding tissue.</population>
