  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of metabolic disorders (obesity, hyperglycemia,
      dyslipidemia and hypertension) and it is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes
      and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. There are several definitions for the metabolic
      syndrome. The AHA/NHLBI (American Heart association/National Heart Lung Blood Institution)and
      IDF (International Diabetes Federation)2009 criteria are frequently used to comparing data
      from studies. Prevention or reduction of obesity and lifestyle modification with physical
      activity is the main therapeutic goal in patients with metabolic syndrome. Recent studies
      have shown that exercise in moderate altitude or in moderate hypoxia improved glycemic
      parameters. The influence of training in moderate altitude on circulating metabolites and
      hormones in terms of substrate utilization is unclear. The adiponectin seems to play an
      important role in the homeostasis of adipose tissue and in the pathogenesis of the metabolic
      syndrome and physical activity seems to have a positive effect on adiponectin concentrations.
      In this study with randomized controlled pretest-posttest-design we want to investigate the
      effects of physical activity in moderate hypoxia on biomarkers of metabolic syndrome.

      Participate can subjects aged 40-70 years with metabolic syndrome according to the definition
      of AHA/NHLBI and IDF 2009 after declaring orally and written consent and if they authorize to
      process personal and sanitary data. The study involve 80 subjects with metabolic syndrome.
      They will be recruited by general practitioner, elect from the principal investigator and
      invited to participate in the trial. The 80 participants will be randomized in two groups.

      Group A, moderate altitude group, 1900 m, 40 participants Group B, low altitude group, 400m,
      40 participants Group A will spend 2 weeks at an altitude of 1900m and participants absolve a
      training program (3h, 4x a week, total training time 24h, training intensity 55-65% of
      maximal heart rate).

      Group B will spend spend 2 weeks at an altitude of 400m and participants absolve a training
      program (3h, 4x a week, total training time 24h, training intensity 55-65% of maximal heart
      rate).

      Nutrition does not follow any specific diet plan, both groups receive an equivalent balanced
      feeding.

      Clinical examinations at the beginning and at the end of the study laboratory tests well be
      documented and compared(fasting plasma glucose, triglycerides, HDL-C, LDL-C, insulin,
      C-peptid, free fatty acids, adiponectin, leptin, HbA1c, Metabolon cluster, c reactive
      protein, vit D3). Also BMI, BIA bioimpedance analysis, blood pressure, heart rate, egg,
      Physical status, exercise test.
