  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in medical therapy for diabetes, significant numbers of patients fail to
      achieve adequate blood glucose control. Diabetic patients who engage in more self-care
      behaviors have better glycemic control, as measured by HbA1C. Patient &quot;activation&quot;, defined
      as the knowledge, skills, beliefs, and behaviors to manage a chronic disease, is key to the
      performance of these self-care behaviors.

      There is a growing literature on diabetes behavioral change interventions; however
      interventions are often developed and implemented without consideration of patients readiness
      to engage in lifestyle changes. Additionally, patient-tailored interventions require
      intensive clinical and financial resources, making them difficult to integrate into clinical
      practice. Mobile text messaging (SMS) programs have been successfully used to promote smoking
      cessation, alcohol cessation, and weight loss in diverse patient populations. SMS
      interventions for diabetes have also been developed, but they have been designed primarily to
      provide feedback on blood glucose management, rather than to motivate behavioral change. The
      few studies that included motivational content as a primary feature, did not tailor their
      intervention to a patient's readiness for change or rigorously describe their motivational
      intervention, and show limited efficacy.

      To address these concerns, we will perform a three-month randomized controlled pilot study to
      develop and test a Motivational Interviewing (MI)-informed SMS intervention tailored to
      patient level of activation for patients with poorly controlled type II diabetes.
