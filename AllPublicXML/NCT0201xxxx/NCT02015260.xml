      Objective To assess the efficacy of the topical application of Nitric Oxide, delivered using
      acidified nitrite.

      Design Multicentre, randomized, controlled, dose ranging trial. A control arm and three doses
      of acidified nitrite applied topically for 12 weeks with a further 12 weeks of follow up.

      Setting The trial setting was in European genitourinary medicine clinics

      Participants Male and female volunteers over 18 years of age with between 2 and 50
      ano-genital warts, 328 were screened for eligibility and 299 subjects from 40 centres were
      randomised.

      Exclusions Pregnancy; concomitant Sexually Transmitted Disease; internal warts requiring
      treatment other than surgery /laser; diabetes ; Human Immunodeficiency Virus-positive,
      immunosuppressed and/or using immunosuppressive therapies; drug abuse.

      interventions compared

        -  Control Placebo nitrite cream and placebo citric acid cream twice daily

        -  A) 3% sodium nitrite + 4.5% citric acid creams twice daily

        -  B) 6% sodium nitrite + 9% citric acid creams once daily

        -  C) 6% sodium nitrite + 9% citric acid creams twice daily

      Outcomes

        -  Primary proportion of patients with complete clearance of target warts Secondary

        -  Time to clearance

        -  Wart area

        -  Wart count

        -  Patient and investigator assessment of efficacy

        -  Safety

        -  Tolerability

        -  Adherence

             the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with clinically relevant abnormal haematology or biochemistry results
             (determined from the sample taken at Visit 1).

          -  Patients who had used an active therapy for anogenital warts within 2 weeks of
             randomisation to study drug, i.e. Visit 2.

          -  Patients who had used any local supportive medication, including topical
             corticosteroids or beta-interferon, within 2 weeks of study entry.

          -  Patients who had used medication known to adversely affect their haematology profile,
             including local anaesthetics (benzocaine, lidocaine, etc), nitrofurantoin,
             sulphonylureas and sulphonamides within 2 weeks of study entry. [Word 'adversely'

          -  Patients who required treatment other than surgery or laser for internal warts.

          -  Male patients with intra-urethral warts [deleted by Protocol Amendment 2, 7 May 2002].
