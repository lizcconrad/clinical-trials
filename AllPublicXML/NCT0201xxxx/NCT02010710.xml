  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In women judged to require continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (EFM) during
      their labour, does the addition of decision support software to aid the interpretation of the
      intrapartum cardiotocogram (CTG) reduce the number of 'poor neonatal outcomes'? This study is
      not introducing a new form of labour monitoring; it is evaluating the addition of
      decision-support to CTGs displayed on the Guardian™ system. Specifically comparing: &quot;No
      decision-support&quot; - CTGs with no additional interpretation (UK standard care), compared with:
      &quot;Decision-support&quot; - CTGs with the decision support software running that will alert
      clinicians to the presence of abnormalities in the CTG in real time. How the labour is
      managed is entirely up to the recruiting unit and the woman; however the allocation of
      decision-support or no decision-support is determined randomly by the Guardian™ system.

    <description>The decision-support software to be evaluated in INFANT has been designed to run on the K2 data collection system (Guardian®). The data collection system (Guardian®) is a system for managing information from labour monitoring. It displays the CTG on a computer screen alongside other clinical data which are collected as part of routine clinical care. As such, it replaces conventional paper labour notes, the CTG machine and other recording systems for documenting care during labour.</description>
