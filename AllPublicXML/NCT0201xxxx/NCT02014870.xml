  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to determine the dose level of live, wild-type A/California/ H1N1
      2009 virus that has an appropriate safety and illness/infectivity profile to be used as an
      influenza virus, challenge strain in future intervention studies.

      Illness parameters were collected by subject symptom scores as well as by physical
      examination. Virus parameters were measured by PCR and cell culture assay (performed by
      VisMederi srl).
