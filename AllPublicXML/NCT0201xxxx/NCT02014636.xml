  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, 2 part study of pazopanib and/or MK 3475 in treatment na√Øve subjects
      with advanced RCC. Part 1 consists of a Phase I dose escalation of pazopanib + MK 3475
      followed by an expansion cohort to determine the maximum tolerated regimen and the
      recommended Phase II dose. Part 2 is a randomized 3-arm Phase II study to evaluate the
      clinical efficacy and safety of pazopanib + MK 3475 as compared to single-agent pazopanib and
      single-agent MK 3475. The objectives of this Phase I/II study are to test the safety and
      tolerability of pazopanib in combination with MK 3475, and study the clinical efficacy of
      pazopanib in combination with MK 3475 in subjects with advanced RCC as compared with
      single-agent pazopanib and single-agent MK 3475.

      Following the Urgent Safety Measure (USM) released on February 09, 2017, the phase II (Part
      2) portion of this study will not commence.
