  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical study that aims to evaluate a new strategy using the SYNTAX II Score calculator in
      the functional assessment of patients with new coronary 3-vessel-disease who undergo
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the SYNTAX II Trial is to investigate the management of de-novo
      3-vessel-disease in order to prospectively assess which patients would have at least
      comparable short and long term clinical outcomes between coronary artery bypass graft and
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), using contemporary PCI practice. In SYNTAX II the
      effectiveness of a contemporary stent (designed with thinner struts, biocompatible and
      biodegradable polymer, and a limus based drug), the use of pressure wire assessment of
      lesions to allow for ischemia-driven revascularisation, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)
      guidance to optimise drug eluting stent deployment, and the treatment of (chronic) total
      occlusion lesions with contemporary techniques, will be compared against PCI practice in the
      original SYNTAX trial. The proposed study would involve the SYNTAX Score II to prospectively
      recruit subjects on the grounds of patient safety
