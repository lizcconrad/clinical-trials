  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) need to undergo surgical bowel resection.
      Postoperative recurrence of the disease is virtually inevitable and continues to be one of
      the most challenging therapeutic problems in inflammatory bowel diseases. Medical treatments
      to prevent recurrence have had limited effect. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents appear
      promising but are hampered by immunogenicity, side effects and high cost.

      Vitamin D has recently received a lot of scientific attention and was found to have strong
      anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in gut and liver inflammation. Many CD patients
      appear to have deficiency in Vitamin D. A controlled trial to prevent relapse of CD in
      medical (not surgical) remission suggested a preventive effect for Vitamin D but marginally
      missed its endpoint because of lack of power.

      The ultimate proof of the anti-inflammatory effect of Vitamin D in CD can best be studied in
      the prevention of postoperative recurrence.

      Our objective is to study the prophylactic effect of Vitamin D3 to prevent post-operative
      recurrence of Crohn's disease (CD), with an endoscopic endpoint 6 months after surgery as the
      primary outcome. Endoscopy has been an established surrogate marker for future clinical
      relapse. Secondary objectives include clinical recurrence rates at 6 months, the difference
      in recurrence rates among patients with and without low Vitamin D levels at baseline, the
      effects of Vitamin D3 on quality of life parameters, resource use and related costs.

      ANTICIPATED OUTCOME This study will provide proof of the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin
      D, which to our opinion can best be studied in a post-operative setting. Since post-operative
      recurrence is frequent, a safe and cost-effective therapy is highly needed for this
      indication. The hypothesis is that patients who receive vitamin D treatment will have less
      frequent and less severe endoscopic recurrence.
