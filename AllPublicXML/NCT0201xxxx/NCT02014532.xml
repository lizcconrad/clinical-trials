  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The adjunctive use of Leukotriene Receptor Antagonist (Montelukast) along with scaling and
      root planing in patients with chronic periodontitis leads to host inflammatory response
      modulation and decrease in serum C reactive protein (CRP) levels. If proven this will open
      new vistas in treatment of chronic periodontitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A RCT was carried out to check the efficacy of Montelukast as an adjunct to scaling and root
      planing. The patients were randomised to either test group (SRP + Montelukast) and control
      group (SRP). Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Serum
      C-reactive protein levels were assessed at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks.

    <description>The biochemical parameter of serum C- reactive protein levels were checked at baseline, 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Montelukast therapy was started at baseline and continued for 3 weeks in test group and the post treatment levels were further checked at 6 weeks (i.e. 3 weeks after stoppage of Montelukast.) the change in C- reactive protein levels was analysed.</description>
