      The essential arterial hypotension and allostasis registry is a prospective, observational
      research that has the purpose of demonstrating that essential blood pressure (BP) disorders
      and the associated comorbidities are a result of the inappropriate allostatic response to
      daily life stress. This required a functioning brain orchestrating the evaluation of the
      threat and choosing the response, this is a mind-mediated phenomenon. If the response is
      excessive it contributes to high BP, if deficient to low BP, and the BP itself will identify
      the allostatic pattern, which in turn will play an important role in the development of the
      comorbidities.

      To do so, consecutive patients of any age and gender that visit a cardiologist's office in
      Medellin, Colombia, are recruited. Individuals are classified according to their arterial BP
      and allostasis and follow them in time to see what kind of diseases develops the most
      (including BP) in the follow up according to the categorization of the characteristic chosen
      and after adjustment for confounder's variables. In addition, stress events with their date
      are registered.

      HYPOTHESIS

      The causes of the diseases are multifactorial.

      Physical, biochemical, psychological, social, and cultural dimensions of development
      dynamically interact to shape the health development process.

      A person´s health depends on their:

        1. Biological and physiologic systems

        2. External and internal environment (a) physical, b) internal behavioural and arousal
           state as registered by the brain.

        3. Their interaction.

      The allostatic mechanisms to the internal and external stressors (allostatic load) involves a
      network composed by:

        1. Functional systems; mediated by:

             1. The Autonomic Nervous System

             2. The endocrine system

             3. The immune system

        2. Structural changes: whenever the internal and/or external stressors are long lasting
           and/or strength enough, they may induce changes in:

             1. Epigenetic, endophenotypes, polyphenism.

             2. Plasticity

        3. The interaction between a) and b).

      The network response do not affect exclusively the BP, propitiating the development of
      comorbidities, which may prompt strategies for prevention, recognition and ultimately,
      treatment.

      The allostatic model defines health as a state of responsiveness.

      The concept of psycho-biotype: The allostasis is the result of both: biological (allostasis)
      and psychological (psychostasis) abilities. It is proposed that both components behave in
      similar direction and magnitude.

      Immune disorders may be associated with the development of cancer. High BP population has a
      higher sympathetic and lower vagal tone, this has been associated with a decrease in the
      immune´s system function.

      Resources and energy depletion: Terms like weathering have been used to describe how
      exposures to different allostatic loads gradually scrape away at the protective coating that
      keeps people healthy. It is postulated that High BP individuals have more resources and
      energy.

      DEFINITIONS

      ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE CLASSIFICATION

      Arterial Blood Pressure (ABP) is a complex physiological variable in regard to its measure,
      behavior between BP taken in the same visit at the office and between these and ABPM,
      chronobiology (different day time BP levels), evolution in time, meaning and classification.

      Not appropriate approach or analysis may be addressed without taking into account all the BP
      characteristics that have demonstrated prognostic implications.

      In order to arrive to the most comprehensive analysis, BP classification takes into account
      the following characteristics:

      I. Cause of BP disorder

      A. Primary or Essential: Not clear causes may be identified. Multiple mechanisms may be
      involved, obvious players and contributors, but no definitive cause.

      B. Secondary: an identifiable cause is characterized.

      II. The supine BP and/or ABPM value

      A. High arterial BP (HBP):

        1. At the office: the two systolic and diastolic supine BP are considered. a) Office Supine
           SBP ≥140 mm Hg and/ or DPB ≥90 mmHg b) Diagnosis HBP: any value is HBP, as single
           criteria in the abscence of ABPM

        2. Ambulatory BP Monitoring (ABPM):

             1. 24 hrs: SBP ≥130; DBP ≥80 mmHg.

             2. Awake (06:00-22:00): SBP ≥135; DBP ≥85 mmHg.

             3. Night (22:00-06:00): SBP ≥125; DBP ≥70 mmHg.

        3. Both at the office and ABPM always predominate ABPM:

             1. HBP in ABPM at 24 hrs, awake or night time, regardless of the office BP

             2. Masked hypertension (MHBP): HBP in the ABPM and NBP or LBP at the office.

        4. Normal BP at the office and/or at the ABPM in presence of anti hypertensive treatment.

           B. Low BP (LBP) Since there are no clear limits in ABPM for LBP, only office supine SBP
           and/or DBP will be considered.

           SBP &lt;90 DBP &lt;60

           C. Normal BP (NBP) &gt; 90 SBP &lt;140 &gt; 60 DBP &lt;90 Include patients with HBP at the office
           but normal ABPM, White Coat Hypertension (WCHBP)

           III. The BP orthostatic response

           A. Orthostatic hypotension (OhypoT): Drop in BP upon standing

             -  20 mmHg if SBP is normal

             -  30 mmHg if SBP ≥140

             -  10 mmHg in DBP

           B. Orthostatic Hypertension (OhyperT) Rise in SBP upon standing ≥20 mmHg

           C. Orthostatic Normotension (ONT): No criteria for Ohypot or OhyperT .

           IV. The circadian component of BP

           A. Normal Dipper (NDBP): average decrease of SBP between day and night time greater than
           10% and less than 20%

           B. Extreme Dippers (EDBP): greater than 20% fall

           C. Nondippers (NonDBP): less than 10% fall

           D. Reverse dippers (RDBP): night time BP higher than daytime average

           E. Abnormal early Morning BP Surge (BPS): A rise ≥50 mmHg.

           V. BP response to treatment (requires office BP and ABPM)

           A. True Control HBP (TCHBP): NBP at the office and the ABPM

           B. True Resistant HBP (TRHBP): HBP at the office and the ABPM

           C. False Control HBP (FCHBP): NBP at the office and HBP in the ABPM

           D. False Resistant HBP (FRHBP): HBP at the office and NBP in the ABPM.

           Patients must be in the absence of medication for Essential hypotension diagnosis and
           hypotension must be dismissed as a secondary manifestation of another disease or other
           condition such as dehydration, medication causing hypotension for other conditions or
           secondary dysautonomia.

           There are 3 types of orthostatic hypotension Initial: in the first 30 sec. after
           assuming the standing position Classic: It occurs between the 1st and 3rd min. Late: It
           occurs between 5 and 45 min. later (no patients within this category)

           ESTIMATION OF TARGET-ORGAN DAMAGE Electrocardiogram, Doppler color echocardiogram,
           creatinine and urinalysis, lipid and metabolic profile and microalbuminuria are
           requested to the patients; carotid Doppler is also requested in patients with suspect of
           disorder.

           ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION TREATMENT. The treatment starts with a low-sodium diet (by
           nutritionist whenever possible), increase in fruits and vegetables intake, weight loss,
           aerobic exercise, stop smoking, and changes in lifestyle.

           The pharmacological first step is the use of IECAs (ARA II if there is cough), calcium
           channel blockers, the use of diuretics like the Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg (or up to
           25mg). If there is orthostatic hypotension, it is considered to start with Amlodipine.
           In those patients with tachyarrhythmia, heart failure or coronary disease Beta blockers
           are chosen. Alpha blockers are the last step therapy.

           ESSENTIAL HYPOTENSION TREATMENT The treatment starts with the use of non-pharmacological
           measures consisting of postural hygiene (avoid assuming the standing position abruptly,
           avoid staying in the standing position for too long), eat salty (10 g), drink more than
           2 liters of water per day, do aerobic exercises, and raise the head of the bed. If there
           is not improvement, the patient can wear gradient tights up to the waist. Next step is
           start Fludrocortisone 0.05 daily or every other day. The last step is Midodrine (from 5
           to 20mg daily, distributed at 06:00, 10:00 and 14:00 hrs or when needed, avoid it after
           6:00 pm). Counterpressure maneuvers are recommended if there is a threat of syncope.

           ALLOSTASIS

           For the effects of what is mentioned here, allostasis is defined as the ability to
           maintain homeostasis through the neuroendocrine and immune response to the stress of any
           type. There is experimental evidence, measuring the sympathetic nerve activity during
           the mathematical stress with microneurography of the peroneal nerve (muscle sympathetic
           nerve activity or MSNA) that the response may be increasing, neutral or decreasing.

           The alterations in blood pressure are considered objective, which may be the result of
           strategies and different responses to stress (adaptability), through the neuroendocrine
           system (mainly the sympathetic nervous system).

           The following variables are evaluated to describe the Allostasis:

        1. SYMPTOMS OF HYPOTENSION: postural dizziness, dizziness after squatting, dizziness during
           childhood or adolescence (in elementary school, high school and occasionally in college)
           during the mass, at public events, religious processions or military parades. It is also
           taken into account the previous diagnosis of low pressure or &quot;hypoglycemia&quot; (which in
           our culture mainly refers to symptoms of orthostatic hypotension).

        2. HISTORY OF NEURALLY MEDIATED SYNCOPE OR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE diagnosed by the scores of
           Calgary or Tilt-test; or vasovagal syncope (syncope caused by seeing blood, a
           venipuncture or donating blood; pain, by seeing or speaking about dramatic things, when
           coughing, swallowing, defecating, urinating, laughing, or other situations). If these
           situations occur with significant dizziness or pre-syncope, but not syncope itself, it
           is called vasovagal component.

        3. BLOOD PRESSURE: Low BP

      The allostasis is classified as:

        1. Hypo-allostasis: presence of at least one of the followings:

             1. Symptoms of hypotension and/or

             2. Neurally mediated syncope (clinical or at the tilt-test) or vasovagal syncope
                and/or

             3. Hypotension at the office or at the tilt-test

        2. Normal-allostasis: normal blood pressure and no symptoms of hypotension, no neurally
           mediated syncope or vasovagal syncope (spontaneous or induced in the tilt table test)
           and no presence of hypotension. Include those who develop permanent hypertension after
           65 yo. After this age, structural components mainly in the Windkessel vessels, may
           contribute more than the increased sympathetic tone to the hypertension phenomenon. For
           end points analysis, patients developing Hypertension after 65 yo are considered
           hypertensives in their BP group, but normal in the adaptability.

        3. Hyper-allostasis: Arterial hypertension starting before 66 yo, with no identifiable
           cause, no symptoms of hypotension, no neurally mediated syncope or vasovagal syncope.

      Allostasis scores (scores between 1 and 7 apply for hypo-allostasis only)

        1. Only symptoms

        2. Only essential hypotension

        3. Only neurally mediated syncope

        4. 1 and 2

        5. 1 and 3

        6. 2 and 3

        7. 1, 2 and 3

        8. Normotensive

        9. Hypertensive

       10. The patient does not remember

      Thus then, 3 groups of blood pressure are recognized at the moment of evaluating their impact
      on the comorbidities:

        1. Normotensive

        2. Hypotensive

        3. Hypertensive, that in turn can be:

             1. Hypertensive since the admission

             2. Previously hypotensive

             3. Previously normotensive

      METHODS

      Cohort.

      LABORATORY EXAMINATIONS

      Complete blood count Basal glycemia and 2 hr post-load 75 g glucose Insulinaemia Glycated
      hemoglobin Serum ferritin Thyroid stimulating hormone and sometimes free thyroxine Sodium and
      serum potassium Uric acid Lipid profile Creatinine Basal serum cortisol and/or
      post-Adrenocorticotropic hormone 24-hr urinary free cortisol Post-dexamethasone cortisol: in
      those with high cortisol with not recognized cause Microalbuminuria Others depending on the
      case, such as: 24-hr urine catecholamines (Epinephrine, Norepinephrine and Metanephrines),
      gliadin antibodies, vanillylmandelic acid, parathyroid hormone, vitamin B12, folic acid,
      ANAs, testosterone, creatinine clearance, antibodies against human hemoglobin in stool,
      hypersensitive reactive C protein, 24-hrs urinary sodium, brain natriuretic peptide, etc.

      There is not a single laboratory to make the blood tests, so there are different values of
      normality for some tests.

      PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

      ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS:

      In every medical consultation, the patient is weighed wearing trousers or skirt. The waist is
      measured at an equidistant level between the last rib and the iliac crest. The hip is
      measured at the level of the greater trochanter. Finally, the size that appears in the
      identity card of the patient, or the latest measurement is written down. After May 2016
      measurements are taken in the office.

      TAKING OF BLOOD PRESSURE:

      It is performed using a mercury sphygmomanometer from Tycos brand (it is revised annually in
      accordance with the current rules of the Ministry of Health), and it is controlled that the
      mercury column falls to 2 mm per second.

      The bracelet must cover approximately the 80% of the forearm. We have three sizes of
      bracelets as needed, including a pediatric bracelet. This should be positioned at heart
      level.

      The appearance of the first sound and the disappearance of Korotkoff sounds are taken as
      systolic and diastolic BP respectively.

      About 6 BP measurements are taken, two on supine position and the second one after 5 min.
      supine, this second supine value is the one used to calculate the BP drop upon standing.
      Later, and having the bracelet previously inflated, the BP is taken immediately once the
      up-right position is assumed (first 30 sec). Then, additional pressures are taken at the
      first, second and third min.

      Since November the 30th, 2017, two additional BPs will be taken in a seated position; these
      will be taken at the beginning of the BP taking session. The patient will be seated
      comfortably with their right arm resting at the heart level. The BPs, HRs, COs and SVRs will
      be taken first after one minute of having the patient sit comfortably and then again after
      two minutes. Later on, the patient will assume the first supine position and the protocol
      continues as explained previously; however, the interval between the two BPs taken at the
      supine position will be of one and three minutes.

      Starting on January 2018, an immediate standing BP after seated position will be taking.

      The same process is fulfilled for the HR, taken in 15 sec. During the taking of blood
      pressure neither the patient nor the doctor talk, and it is avoided making any comments that
      might alter the patient psychologically, and potentially modify their BP levels. The patient
      is asked to have an empty bladder and the Physician tries to support the patient´s arm at the
      heart level in every position.

      NON-INVASIVE BEAT TO BEAT BP MONITORING Non-invasive, beat to beat, BP monitoring and Cardiac
      Output (CO) and Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR) started to be used since May 2017 to
      measure BP, HR, CO, SVR. CNAP Monitor 500, CNSystems, is CE and FDA approved. It is intended
      to be use in every consecutive patient.

      Instructions:

        1. Rings, bracelets, and wristwatches should be withdrawn from the right arm.

        2. Fingers in the cuffs should not be bending since this could increase BP artificially.

        3. The arm will rest beside the body, relaxed.

        4. When standing, the physician or person taking BP should take the patient´s right arm and
           help him stand up in an attempt to decrease the arm´s movement and avoid interference on
           the recording.

        5. The forearm is kept at the heart level.

        6. A screen´s photography will be taken with the cellphone after every BP measure (8).

        7. A label is placed on the recording just after the seating position and before standing.

        8. If the immediate standing BP taken shows a drop in the BP but systemic vascular
           resistance (SVR) and cardiac output (CO) are those of the supine position then the BP
           won´t be registered and a picture should be taken immediately SVR and CO are
           recalculated.

        9. If BP starts to rise, review that fingers in the cuff are straight.

       10. If in doubt, make a manual measure of the BP.

       11. BP and HR date along with SVR and CO will be introduced in the fields of the BP and HR
           taken with the sphygmomanometer and usual physical examination. New fields were created
           for SVR and CO.

       12. The completed data is introduced as 3 attachment files for further analysis.

      ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (HEWLETT PACKARD AND MORTARA) A careful reading of each plot is made in
      which the HR, PR and cQT intervals, and QRS complex are recorded (automatic measurements).

      24 HOURS ECG MONITORING (HOLTER) It is specified the patient rhythm, if is under medication
      that may affect the heart rate variability (HRV) and, it is recorded the name and type of
      drug. The number of supraventricular and ventricular premature complexes are counted.

      The components of heart rate variability (HRV) allows calculating the sympathovagal balance
      (SVB) in 24 hrs, in the day (06:00 to 22:00) and at night (22:00 to 6:00).

      Low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), very low frequency (VLF), Total power (TP) LF or HF
      one = LF or HF x 100/ TP-VLF SVB = LFone/HFone

      AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING (ABPM) The systolic and diastolic BP and HR are
      registered in 24 hrs, in the day and at night, as in the 24-hr Holter monitoring. This test
      is requested for all patients in order to define the presence of white coat hypertension or
      masked hypertension and to define an effective treatment.

      Morning surge in SBP: It results from the difference between the averages of SBP taken in the
      first 2 hrs from awakening and the lower nighttime.

      COLOR DOPPLER ECHOCARDIOGRAM AND/OR STRESS ECHOCARDIOGRAM It is made the measurement of the
      heart and if the response to stress is positive or negative.

      The ejection fraction (EF) is usually measured by the technique of Simpson or in a
      qualitative way.

      Body surface area = (weight x height / 36) X 1/2 Cardiac mass = 1.05 [(LVDD + SW + PW)3 -
      LVDD3] - 14 Cardiac mass index = cardiac mass / body surface area

      ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND It is recorded the presence of fatty liver and abdominal aortic aneurysm

      UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY AND COLONOSCOPY The main findings are recorded

      CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY Indication: For those who belong to the protocol and will indicate it,
      it is tried that the indication belongs to a score between 7 and 9 (appropriate test for a
      specific indication) of the recommendation of the working group aforementioned.

        1. In patients with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome or positive test for myocardial
           ischemia in individuals with moderate or high cardiovascular risk

        2. In patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias with unidentifiable cause that
           stop spontaneously or require resuscitation

        3. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction at basal conditions (ejection fraction
           &lt;40%) and evidence of viability in the affected segments.

        4. Evidence of new segmental alteration of motility of unknown etiology.

        5. Suspected ischemic mitral regurgitation or interventricular septal defect.

        6. Presence on the CT scan of lesions &gt;50% on the left main trunk or other vessels, or
           possibly obstructive lesions of debatable severity in symptomatic patients (when in the
           left main trunk, also in asymptomatic patients)

      It is classified according to the obstruction to coronary flow as follows:

        -  Lesion &lt;50%, non-obstructive (if not the left main trunk)

        -  Between 50-69%, intermediate lesion (if not the left main trunk)

        -  &gt;70% or &gt;50% of the left main trunk, it is a significant obstructive lesion. It is
           neither specified the number of affected vessels nor the vessel diameter.

      ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY The patient must be in a fasting state and stop taking medications
      that affect the study for at least 5 half-lives. It is made by puncturing the right femoral
      vein, electro-catheters are placed in the high right atrium, in the bundle of His and in the
      right ventricular apex. It is stimulated the double of the thresholds to 3 cycle lengths
      (600, 500 and 430 ms) and three extra cycles, starting at 350 ms, and with successive
      decreases of 10 ms until the refractory period is found.

      The study is made at basal conditions and in presence of Isoproterenol up to 4
      micrograms/min; the sedation is obtained with Midazolam, administered 10 min. before starting
      the measurements.

      Sinus function tests: Sinoatrial conduction time (by Narula method), the sinus node recovery
      time (SNRT) and the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT)). For the SNRT, it is
      stimulated to several cycle lengths for one min, with decreases of 100 ms up to 430 ms, and
      the longest pause is considered as the recovery time; if greater than 1500 ms is considered
      abnormal.

      The CSNRT is the result of SNRT minus the cycle length of the patient. It is considered
      abnormal 500 ms or more (sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%). Additionally, at five
      min, it is evaluated the response of the HR to the infusion of 3 micrograms of Isoproterenol
      per min. (an increase of 25% from basal HR) and the intrinsic HR.

      This latter is made by administering Atropine 0.04 mg/kg and propranolol 0.2 mg/kg, the
      intrinsic HR is dependent on the age, and is calculated as follows:

      118.1 - (0.57 x age), for people under the age of 45 the value is adjusted +14% and for
      people over the age of 45 +18%.

      Indication:

        1. In patients with syncope and ischemic heart disease, when the initial evaluation
           suggests an arrhythmic cause.

        2. In patients with syncope and bundle branch block, when the noninvasive evaluation has
           not clarified the diagnosis.

        3. When brief and sudden palpitations precede syncope, when the noninvasive evaluation has
           not clarified the diagnosis.

        4. In some cases of Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and
           hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

        5. In high-risk patients in whom other methods have not clarified the diagnosis.

      TILT TABLE TEST The patient is connected to the noninvasive BP beat to beat monitor. (Task
      Force Monitor).

      The patient must be fasting for at least 4 hrs; should stay 5 min. in supine position and
      then is tilted at 60 degrees for 20 min. Then, it is administered 400 micrograms of
      sublingual nitroglycerin for 20 min. more. The tilt table test (TTT) is considered positive
      if the patient presents syncope or if the systolic blood pressure is lower than 60 mmHg. The
      hemodynamic variables, the HR variability, and the BP are written down for those patients who
      have these values available.

      Other diagnoses written down on the TTT are:

        -  Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS):

        -  Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST): It is defined as a HR greater than 90 bpm in
           supine position.

        -  Orthostatic hypotension (OH):

      Fall in the systolic BP ≥20 mmHg or in diastolic BP ≥10 mmHg, at any time of the TTT.

      . Orthostatic Hypertension: rise in SBP ≥20 mmHg.

        -  Asystole: Isoelectric line that last for more than 3 sec. on the electrocardiogram plot.
           The duration in sec. of the asystole is recorded.

        -  Chronotropic incompetence (CI):

      It refers to the inability of the heart to increase the HR more than 10% when standing up
      within the first 10 min, and if the HR in supine &lt;70 bpm. Also, if this criterion is not met
      but the HR to 60 degrees is lower than 65 bpm.

      Indication:

      Single syncope episode of unknown origin in high risk patients, or recurrent syncope in
      absence of organic heart disease; or in presence of organic heart disease if cardiac etiology
      was previously dismissed.

      To show to the patient that he/she has this mechanism of syncope. To discriminate between
      reflex and orthostatic syncope To differentiate syncope from epilepsy To diagnose patients
      with recurrent unexpected falls To evaluate patients with recurrent syncope and psychiatric
      disease Many patients referred by other colleagues already have the TTT.

      CAROTID SINUS MASSAGE (CSM) It is made during the TTT

      Contraindications for the accomplishment of the procedure:

        1. History of cerebrovascular disease

        2. Acute myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months, or

        3. Presence of carotid bruit during the neck auscultation. The test consists of doing
           pressure and circular movements during 10 sec. on each carotid sinus, allowing an
           interval of 1 min. between both sides. The massage is made at 0 and 60 degrees tilt. It
           is considered a vasodilatory response if the systolic BP falls at least 50 mmHg, and
           chronotropic response if an asystole last 3 or more sec. If this latter occurs, it is
           expected the patient to recover and the carotid massage is repeated after applying
           atropine 1 mg. If still positive for syncope it is considered a mixed response to the
           CSM.

           It refers to clinical, enzymatic, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic or
           angiographic findings, diagnosis of acute coronary disease. It should be dismissed the
           cocaine abuse, Prinzmetal's angina and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This latter is
           classified as such in a separate box.

        8. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI):

           Term used when there is evidence of myocardial tissue necrosis in the clinical spectrum
           of myocardial ischemia.

           Ischemic symptoms. New changes or presumed new in the ST segment and T wave, or a new
           LBBB. Development of new Q waves on the ECG Evidence by images of loss of viable
           myocardium, or the emergence of a segmental defect in the motility.

           Identification of an intracoronary thrombus in an angiography or autopsy.

           Criteria for prior myocardial infarction:

           Pathological Q waves on the ECG, with or without symptoms, in absence of non-ischemic
           causes.

        9. Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) or transient cerebral ischemia (TCI):

           The TCI has traditionally been considered as a deficit lower than 24 hrs in duration,
           and so it is considered in this protocol. Well-founded evidence suggests duration lower
           than 60 min, and no evidence of nerve damage proved by CT scan or MRI.

       10. Atrial fibrillation:

      Baseline low amplitude oscillations with irregular rhythm, with major episodes of 6 min. on
      the ECG, in presence or absence of symptoms, or associated with CHADS score &gt;=1.

      systolic if the ejection fraction is decreased, otherwise, it is considered diastolic. In
      case of being diastolic, it should be dismissed other causes of dyspnea, such as lung
      diseases. If the origin is cardiac, it must be present with increased brain natriuretic
      peptide, which is requested.

      14. Chronic fatigue syndrome or idiopathic chronic fatigue: Persistent or chronic fatigue,
      clinically evaluated, unexplained, which lasts for 6 or more consecutive months, of recent
      onset, not explained by exercising, not improved substantially with rest and that produces a
      substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, social, educational and personal
      activities.

      The patient must have 4 of the following symptoms, which must have persisted or be recurrent
      for 6 or more consecutive months of illness, and must have not been preceded by fatigue: a)
      self-reporting of poor short-term memory or decreased ability to concentrate, as severe as to
      alter the previous functional ability, b) dry throat, c) armpit and cervical adenopathies, d)
      muscle pain, joint pain without redness, deformity or swelling, de-novo headache, e)
      unrefreshing sleep, and malaise post exercise that lasts more than 24 hrs.

      Some individuals have fatigue for more than 6 months but they do not meet the criteria
      previously set out. For example, they have major depression (other less intense depressions
      do not exclude the diagnosis), so they better qualify for idiopathic chronic fatigue.

      15. Syncope: It refers to the transient loss of consciousness secondary to cerebral
      hypoperfusion, characterized by sudden onset, short duration, and spontaneous and complete
      recovery.

      autonomic activation prodromes (diaphoresis, pallor, nausea). It includes situational syncope
      and carotid sinus hypersensitivity.

      PSYCHO BIOTYPE EVALUATION

      Design to study in depth the Psycho Biotype hypothesis. It consist of consecutive patients of
      each BP group to whom the following test are apply:

        1. Big Five Questionary (BFQ) for personality.

        2. Modified Coping Scale (Scale of modified coping strategies)

        3. Zung questionary for depression and anxiety

        4. MINI in those patients with moderate or severe depression and/or anxiety at the Zung
           questionary, apply by a psychiatrist

      GENERAL OBJECTIVE To demonstrate if the essential arterial BP group and/or the adaptability
      are clinically important and try to identify the mechanism involve.

      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES To demonstrate that the three groups of blood pressure differ in the
      numbers taken as much in the doctor's office as in the ambulatory BP monitoring.

      To inquire what variables are different between the groups of BP. To inquire which
      comorbidities are more associated with each group of blood pressure and evaluate whether the
      differences persist after a multivariate analysis. The same will be done with the
      adaptability groups.

      To provide hypotheses or evidences to explain the findings of the study.

      DESIGN OF THE STUDY This is an observational, analytic, cohort type study that aims to
      compare the differences between groups of patients classified according to their BP numbers
      and their adaptability.

      To this end, variables of the clinical, paraclinical, imaging and comorbidities profile will
      be evaluated.

      The database is designed to be flexible. It allows choosing different conditions in different
      variables. The diagnoses have 3 options: No, New and Old. It is recorded the date of the
      physical examinations, the diagnoses and the paraclinical results to ensure accuracy in the
      calculation of the age and the relationship between the different variables during the
      analysis.

      The reports will be of prevalence (cross-sectional) and incidence (cohort). To evaluate the
      significance between the groups of blood pressure depending on morbidities and other
      variables, it is used a generalized linear model by adjusting the effect of the response
      variable based on the age, gender and tension group in all cases. In some cases, and when the
      response variable requires it, it is added the body mass index (BMI). When the response
      variable is qualitative, it is used a logit link function and it is obtained the
      corresponding Odds ratio with confidence intervals to 95%; while if the variable is
      quantitative it is used the identity function. Finally, the multiple comparison test of
      Tukey-Kramer is made in order to compare the groups of tension with a significance level of
      0.05.

      To evaluate the relationship between the blood pressure groups and the comorbidities, and
      other variables, the free events survival rates among participants using a Kaplan Meir
      survival curves, adjusted for age and other related variables.

      For the diagnosis of coronary disease, it was used a generalized linear model in which was
      evaluated the adjustment of the effect in the groups of tension by age, gender, and body mass
      index (BMI), diabetes mellitus (DM), systolic and diastolic blood pressure in supine, total
      cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking, and blood pressure group. Variables were selected by
      the method of Backward maintaining in the model those variables with a significance level of
      0.05.

      LIMITATIONS:

        1. Because patients were recruited at the doctor's office, some of them may decide not to
           take the required tests or decide not to come back.

        2. Some insurance companies may not provide some test, like the Ambulatory blood pressure
           monitoring.

        3. The attending practitioner may be busy with too much work and has not available time to
           see the patients opportunely.

        4. The blood tests can be done at different sites and by different operators.

        5. Black population is not represented in this sample.

    <measure>The role of high sodium intake in the development of essential hypertension. Comparison between essential hypotension (high sodium intake) vs normotension population (normal or low sodium intake) in the follow-up.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>High sodium intake in the diet is recognized as a risk factor for hypertension development.
Essential hypotension population is advised to increase the sodium (at least 10 grams a day) and water intake (at least 2 liters a day), or as much as possible, several have taken Fludrocortisone (is not a exclusion criteria). Normal blood pressure population are advised to have a normal or low sodium intake. Physical exercise is recommended in both groups.
This registry is a good opportunity to test how important sodium diet is to induce hypertension, or if by the contrary adaptability could prevail over high sodium intake in this registry.
Blood pressure groups: essential hypotension and normotension and those with new essential hypertension. Adaptability groups.
The results will be adjusted for age, gender and BMI.</description>

    <description>Consistent bradycardia in the ECG at the office and normal HR in the holter monitoring or the contrary.
There are patients with complaints that may be attributed to bradycardia, low blood pressure, hypothyroidism, or other entities.
Some patients very often have bradycardia in the ECG taken in the office and normal HR in the 24 Holter monitoring, the opposite is also possible.
Patients with bradycardia (without medication or physiological condition as exersice affecting heart rate) in at least 2 ECG (less 60 bpm) and at least 2 Holter monitoring will be analyzed,
Other variables to consider are:
Age, gender, blood pressure group, adaptability group, maximum HR in the treadmill test, white coat or masked hypertension, Tilt-Table-test result or syncope cause, Electrophysiological study if available.
The acknowledge of this phenomenon could have clinical implications in the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome and physiopathological ones.</description>
