  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a relationship between CSM and hypertension, probably a cause/effect relationship,
      and investigators term this type of hypertension &quot;cervicogenic hypertension&quot;. Abnormally
      functioning serotonergic pacemaker cells in the dorsal raphe nucleus inappropriately activate
      and inhibit parts of the central and autonomic nervous systems as part of a chronic stress
      response, which causes hypertension and migraine. This theory is now being expanded to
      encompass both CSM and essential hypertension, the idea being that these two conditions are
      intimately related.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and hypertension are both very common diseases in the
      general population.Investigators have also observed previously hypertensive patients with CSM
      become normotensive following decompressive cervical surgery and no longer need
      antihypertensive medications. Both observations are difficult to explain according to current
      theories of the two diseases.
