  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preoperative evaluation of future remnant liver function is critical for patients undergoing
      hepatic surgery. Overestimation of the remnant liver function can lead to life-threatening
      postoperative hepatic failure, and its underestimation can lead to a lost opportunity for
      potentially curative surgery. Conventionally, post-hepatectomy remnant liver function has
      been estimated preoperatively using computed tomography (CT) volumetry. CT can provide
      precise anatomical information, and the remnant liver volume, measured by CT volumetry, has
      been reported to be an effective predictor of hepatic dysfunction after hepatectomy. However,
      the indirect estimation of liver function by CT volumetry is reliable only when the function
      is assumed to be homogenous over the whole liver.

    <textblock>
      99mTc-galactosyl human serum albumin (99mTc-GSA) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) was
      developed to facilitate investigations of regional hepatic function. A disadvantage of
      conventional 99mTc-GSA SPECT was poor anatomical resolution, and this newly developed SPECT
      has a tremendously improved anatomical resolution owing to the fusion of CT and 99mTc-GSA
      SPECT. Recent reports have indicated that accurate regional function, based on precise
      anatomical information, could be evaluated using this technique.
