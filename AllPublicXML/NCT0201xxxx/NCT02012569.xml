  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the haemostatic efficacy of TT-173, reducing the
      bleeding time in the donor site of skin grafting.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As the TT-113 has been cleared for use as a topical hemostatic agent, the proposed study will
      further investigate the safety and efficacy of TT-113 in the donor site of sking grafting
