    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability, including the maximum
      tolerated dose, of ASP2215 in subjects with relapsed or treatment-refractory acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML). This study will also determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of
      ASP2215.
