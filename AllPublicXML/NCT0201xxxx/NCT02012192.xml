  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy causing 41900
      deaths annually in Europe. The predominance of aggressive Type II tumours, which are
      characterised by a high frequency of p53 mutations, and primary or acquired resistance to
      platinum-based chemotherapy profoundly contribute to the high mortality rate. With current
      standard therapy the median overall survival of metastatic platinum-resistant (Pt-R) ovarian
      cancer patients is only 14 month. There is a pressing need for more effective, innovative
      treatment strategies to particularly improve survival in this subgroup of EOC patients. This
      is a drug strategy targeting a central driver of tumour aggressiveness and metastatic
      ability, namely mutant p53, via an innovative new Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibition
      mechanism. The most advanced, second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor will be used, Ganetespib. The
      first part (Phase I) of the GANNET53 trial will test the safety of Ganetespib in a new
      combination with standard chemotherapy (Paclitaxel weekly) in Pt-R EOC patients. The second
      part (randomised Phase II) will examine the efficacy of Ganetespib in combination with
      standard chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy alone in EOC patients with Pt-R tumours.
