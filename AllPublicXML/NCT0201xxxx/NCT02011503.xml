        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Index ulcer characteristics:

               1. Full-thickness venous leg ulcer for ≥ 30 days

               2. Ulcer area after debridement is ≥ 1 cm² and ≤ 25 cm² at the randomization visit

               3. Has a clean, granulating base with minimal adherent slough

          2. Subject has completed 14 day run-in period with ≤ 25% wound area reduction
             post-debridement.

          3. Have one of the following:

               -  Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABI) &gt; 0.75. (Calculations will be made using
                  measurements from both posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries as well as
                  both arms) OR

               -  Have venous insufficiency confirmed by duplex ultrasound examination for valvular
                  or venous incompetence.

          4. Age ≥ 18.

          5. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of
             contraception (birth control pills, barriers, or abstinence).

          6. Ability to read/understand and sign Informed Consent and Release of Medical
             Information Forms.

          7. Ability to understand and comply with weekly visits and follow-up regimen.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Index Ulcer Assessment - Index ulcer meeting the following criteria will not be
             eligible for enrollment:

               1. Penetrates down to muscle, tendon, or bone

               2. Presence of another venous ulcer ≤ 2 cm from index ulcer

               3. Is deemed by the Investigator to be caused by a medical condition other than
                  venous insufficiency

               4. Exhibits clinical signs and symptoms of infection

               5. If in the opinion of the Investigator, the wound is suspicious for cancer, the
                  subject should undergo an ulcer biopsy to rule out carcinoma. If carcinoma is
                  ruled out, the subject may be re-screened.

               6. Located on the dorsum of the foot or with more than 50% of the ulcer below the
                  malleolus

          2. Prior therapies - Subjects receiving treatment with any of the following will not be
             eligible for enrollment:

               1. In the last 7 days - Negative pressure wound therapy of the index ulcer

               2. In the last 7 days - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy

               3. In the last 30 days - Treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, application of
                  topical steroids to the ulcer surface, or use of ≥ 14 days of immune-suppressants
                  (including systemic corticosteroids); or, subject is anticipated to require such
                  medications during the course of the study

               4. In the last 30 days - study ulcer treatment with any advanced therapy, including
                  EpiFix®, tissue engineered materials (e.g. Apligraf® or Dermagraft®), or other
                  scaffold materials (e.g. OASIS® Wound Matrix, MatriStem® Wound Matrix)

               5. In the last 30 days - Subject has been on any investigational drug(s) or
                  therapeutic device(s)

               6. In the last 8 weeks - Amputation or revascularization (surgical or stenting) to

               4. NYHA Class III and IV congestive heart failure (CHF), as defined by the following
                  criteria: Class III: Symptoms with moderate exertion; Class IV: Symptoms at rest

               5. Auto-immune disorders including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Fibromyalgia,
                  Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) or HIV
