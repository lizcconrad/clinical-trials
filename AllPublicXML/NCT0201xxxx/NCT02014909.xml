      Part I will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of KTN3379 over several doses
      with the objective of defining a Phase 2 dose in patients with advanced malignancies. Part II
      will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of KTN3379 in combination with other
      targeted agents and obtain preliminary evidence of anti tumor activity in specific types of
      cancer. Patients will continue receiving KTN3379 alone or in combination until disease
      progression or toxicity that necessitates discontinuation (whichever comes first).
