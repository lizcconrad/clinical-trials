      The purpose of this study is to evaluate to determine the effect of food on the PK(
      pharmacokinetics) of a single dose of 600 mg Volitinib and its two major metabolites in
      healthy subjects and to assess the safety and tolerability of single doses of 600mg in
      healthy subjects.This study will be an open-label, randomized, four-period, crossover PK food
      effect study of Volitinib administered orally at 600 mg. Subjects will be screened for
      eligibility up to 14 days prior to entry into the study,there will be 4 treatments,2 weeks
      follow-up.

             female sexual partner of an intrauterine device with spermicide, a female condom with
             spermicide, contraceptive sponge with spermicide, a diaphragm with spermicide, or use
             of a cervical cap with spermicide); a sterile sexual partner; a female sexual partner
