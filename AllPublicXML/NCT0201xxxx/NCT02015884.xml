  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the hospital, the attacks against health professionals are becoming commonplace, making
      working conditions difficult. The ophthalmological emergencies are a perfect testing ground
      to evaluate the effectiveness of a series of original actions to prevent the occurrence of
      violence against healthcare workers. The main objective is to measure the impact of an
      integrated prevention of the occurrence of antisocial behavior or attacks against the
      healthcare workers.

      The prevention program combines five interventions (steps): 1) a computer sorting algorithm
      and specific screens for calling patients in waiting rooms, 2) a clear signage to direct
      patients between waiting rooms, treatment rooms and administrative et medical offices, 3)
      Posts information on the activity of emergency services displayed on screens, in the waiting
      rooms, 4) a mediator/go-between/conciliator, 5) and a dummy surveillance camera.

      This is an interrupted time series study. All patients admitted to the ophthalmological
      emergency unit of a university hospital located in Lyon, France, are included in the study,
      from June 2013 to Sept 2015

    <description>When seeking to characterize the violent behavior, three levels of increasing aggressiveness are typically distinguished: a) incivility i.e. the lack of respect for others characterized by relatively mild acts, b) physical or verbal aggression (insults, threats, assault), and c) the violent act.</description>
