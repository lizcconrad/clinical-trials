  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of autologous (self) transplantation of Neurotrophic factors-secreting
      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC-NTF, NurOwn™) in patients with ALS .

      MSC-NTF cells are a novel cell-therapeutic approach which is expected to effectively deliver
      Neurotrophic factors, which are potent survival factors for neurons, directly to the site of
      damage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MSC-NTF cell therapy (NurOwn™) is based on transplantation of autologous bone marrow
      derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), which are enriched from the patients' own bone
      marrow, propagated ex vivo and induced to secrete NTFs. The autologous MSC-NTF cells are
      back-transplanted into the ALS patient into the sites of damage, the spinal cord and the
      muscles.

      NTFs are potent survival factors for embryonic, neonatal, and adult neurons and are
      considered potential therapeutic candidates for ALS. Delivery of appropriate NTFs to the
      immediate environment of afflicted neurons in ALS patients is expected to improve their
      survival and thus slow down disease progression and alleviate symptoms.

      Previous open-label clinical trials have shown that MSC-NTF cells treatment was well
      tolerated and appears to be generally safe. Some initials indications of clinical benefit
      were also observed in some patients.

      This multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study will evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of a single combined intramuscular and intrathecal administration of
      MSC-NTF cells in early-stage ALS patients. Patients will be followed for approximately three
      months before transplantation with their autologous MSC-NTF cells or placebo. During this
      period of time, patient bone-marrow will be harvested and mesenchymal stromal cells will be
      isolated and expanded. Following treatment patients will be followed for a total of six
      months at monthly visits.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. Males and females ages 18 to 75 years old, inclusive.

          2. ALS diagnosed as possible, laboratory-supported probable, probable, or definite as
             defined by revised El Escorial criteria.

          3. Disease onset, as defined by first reported occurrence of symptomatic weakness,
             spasticity, or bulbar symptoms, of more than 12 months and less than or equal to 24
             months.

          4. Current disease symptoms must include limb weakness.
