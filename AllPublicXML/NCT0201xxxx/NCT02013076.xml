  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the prospective cohort study is to: (1) document the magnitude of response to oral
      corticosteroids administered to children presenting to the emergency department with moderate
      or severe asthma and (2) quantify clinically available potential determinants of the response
      to corticosteroids, such as age, gender, triggers of the index exacerbation, environmental
      tobacco smoke (ETS), gene polymorphisms, and their interactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the large multicentre cohort study is to quantify the response to oral
      corticosteroids in children aged 1 to 17 years presenting to the ED with a moderate or severe
      asthma exacerbation.

      The main outcome is hospital admission within 72 hours of the oral corticosteroid
      administration.

      Secondary outcomes include the change in Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM),
      length of active treatment and other markers of response to therapy in the ED as well as
      markers of recovery over the next 10 days.
