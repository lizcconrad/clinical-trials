  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although thrombocytopenia has been reported as a risk factor for patent ductus arterioses,
      there is lack of data on the function of platelets in ductal closure. Information on
      functions of platelets in ductal closure may change the known model for ductus arterioses and
      may affect the treatment modalities.

    <textblock>
      Patent ductus arterioses is a common problem which involves both pulmonary and cardiac
      outcomes in preterm infants. Although thrombocytopenia has been reported as a risk factor for
      patent ductus arterioses, there is lack of data on the function of platelets in ductal
      closure.

      The investigators aim to investigate the relation between thrombocytopenia and platelet
      functions in pathogenesis of spontaneous ductal closure. The investigators hypothesize that
      Information on functions of platelets in ductal closure may change the known model for ductus
      arterioses and may affect the treatment modalities.
