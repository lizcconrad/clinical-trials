  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are a number of powerful anti-HIV drugs, which keep the virus at undetectable levels
      and enable HIV-infected individuals to live longer. However, some participants taking
      anti-HIV drugs do not achieve an adequate CD4 recovery and remain at risk for developing AIDS
      and non-AIDS-related complications.

      ER niacin (PrNiaspanFCT®) is an extended-released form of niacin, also known as vitamin B3.
      Niacin is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in the blood. This drug has been known for
      a long-time to treat dyslipidemia and it is used to improve favourably all the lipoprotein
      risk factors for artherosclerotic disease, particularly in HIV-infected patients. Recent
      scientific research shows that regular consumption of niacin-rich foods may also provide
      protection against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.

      The purpose of this study is to find out:

        1. If ER niacin combined with anti-HIV drugs, compared with anti-HIV drugs alone, could
           reduce T cell immune activation and enhance CD4 recovery;

        2. If ER niacin can improve your quality of life and your neurocognitive functions

      Primary objective

      • To assess the impact of extended-release niacin (ER niacin) supplementation +
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared to ART alone on T-cell immune activation as defined by
      CD8CD38 percentage

      Secondary objectives

        -  To assess the change in total CD4 T-cell count after ER niacin administration

        -  To explore the effect of ER niacin on regulatory T-cells (Th-17/Treg) in blood and gut
           mucosa samples

        -  To explore the effect of ER niacin on cytokines and inflammatory markers such as INF-α,
           IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, D-dimers, usCRP and LPS

        -  To assess the influence of ER niacin on tryptophan (Trp) plasmatic levels

        -  To assess changes in cholesterol and triglycerides

        -  To explore ER niacin tolerance

        -  To evaluate the impact of ER niacin on quality of life (QoL), fatigue, depression, and
           neurocognitive scores

      Population: All participants will have an undetectable HIV viral load (&lt; 50 copies/mL) for at
      least 3 months, current CD4 cell count of &lt; 350 cells/µL and be receiving ART for at least
      the previous 12 months.
