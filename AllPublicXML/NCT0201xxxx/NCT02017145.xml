    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current work is to determine the efficacy of the re-application of
      surgical prep solution in decreasing surgical site bacterial contamination following lower
      extremity surgery. Decreasing the extent of bacterial colonization of the skin surrounding
      the surgical site during the initial healing phases would theoretically decrease the rate of
      infection in high-risk persons.
