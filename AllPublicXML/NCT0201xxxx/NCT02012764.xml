  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month, prospective, observational cohort trial involving Primary Care Trusts
      (PCTs) wishing to take part in the study and the Early Arthritis Clinic (Anti-CCP sub-clinic)
      at Chapel Allerton Hospital. The approximate duration of subject participation will be 12
      months and the approximate total duration of the study will be 10 years. Patients who have
      not developed inflammatory arthritis within the 12 month period will have the opportunity to
      continue follow up within the clinic on an annual basis with additional visits as clinically
      indicated until the development of IA.

      There is accumulating evidence for the need to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) early. Damage occurs early and early treatment is effective. Clearly there is a need to
      improve ways of identifying these patients.

      It is recognised that patients with RA often have non-specific musculoskeletal complaints in
      the months or years prior to development of RA (unpublished observations). Family members of
      patients with RA are also at greater risk of developing RA.

      Given we know that earlier identification of patients enables earlier treatment and this
      leads to better long-term outcomes, we need a method of identifying patients at the
      pre-clinical stage of disease.

      C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute phase reactant, produced by the liver, primarily in
      response to stimulation by interleukin-6 (IL-6). The lower limit of detection of routine CRP
      is 8mg/dL (or higher), yet the mean CRP in the general population is &lt;2mg/dL11 (as measured
      by high sensitivity assays). Therefore, patients with early RA may have low-grade
      inflammation not detected by routine CRP. This has been demonstrated in patients with
      established disease12, but no studies have been done in early disease. Disease activity
      variables correlated with increases in highly-sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) and hs-CRP was better
      than ESR at predicting disease activity and severity12. Interestingly, on retrospective
      analysis of blood donor serum, increased levels of hs-CRP have been noted in RA patients
      during the pre-clinical phase, most commonly within the two years prior to symptom onset13.
      This suggests immunologic changes occur prior to the development of the symptomatic stage and
      provides an exciting tool for assisting in the diagnosis of very early inflammatory disease
