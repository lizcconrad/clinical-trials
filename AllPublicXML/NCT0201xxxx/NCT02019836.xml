  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal sepsis is a clinical syndrome characterized by signs and symptoms of infection with
      or without accompanying bacteremia in the first month of life which is still an important
      cause of morbidity and mortality. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone that primarily
      contributes to the maintenance of normal calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization. In
      addition to its classical role in bone metabolism, vitamin D also has immunomodulatory
      effects on immune function. Although some studies reported a link between vitamin D
      deficiency and critical illness in adults, a direct relationship has not been directly shown
      yet. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study evaluated the association between EOS
      and maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels. The objective of this prospective study is to
      determine the possible role of maternal and neonatal plasma vitamin D levels on EOS
      development in term infants. We also aim to evaluate possible effect of the severity of
      vitamin D deficiency on EOS development in the study population.

      Term infants with clinical and laboratory findings of early onset sepsis who are &gt;37 weeks of
      gestational age and will be admitted to Neonatal Care Unit of Kanuni Sultan Suleyman Training
      and Research Hospital will be included in this prospective study. The study group will
      consist of term neonates who are clinically suspected to have an early infection from the 1st
      day of life. Blood for neonatal and maternal vitamin D levels will be obtained from all
      infants and their mothers at the time of hospital admission. Only infants with high probable
      sepsis will consist the study group. The healthy infants who admit to our outpatient clinic
      for routine evaluation at postnatal day 3 with no signs of clinical and laboratory infection
      and are evaluated for hyperbilirubinemia will be referred to as the Control group. The
      Control group wll consist term infants with the same gestational and postnatal age of the
      infants that will be included in the study group. In both groups, maternal samples will be
      obtained at the postpartum period at the time of infant's hospitalization. Plasmas after
      separated and stored at -800C. Levels of 25-OHD were determined using Shimadzu LC-20AT model
      High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Data will be analyzed using SPSS
      software and appropriate statistical analyses will be performed.
