  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      The combined data from 3 studies outside the Unites States investigating the Lung Volume
      Reduction Coil system (RePneu LVRC) showed statistically significant improvements in
      pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life at both 6-Months and 12-Months post
      treatment. 24 months post treatment the improved pulmonary function and exercise capacity are
      slightly decreasing. Retreating the patient with the LVR coil system in other parts of the
      lung could potentially lead to new improvements in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity
      and quality of life and may reduce the rate of decline.

      Objective:

      To investigate the safety and feasibility of re-treating patients with severe Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the RePneu LVRC system.

    <description>Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction with the RePneu Lung Volume Reduction Coil system. The RePneu LVRC is an implantable device, delivered through a fiber-optic bronchoscope, designed specifically to treat patients suffering from emphysema. The Coil is intended to compress the most damaged parenchyma and tension the surrounding tissue, which increases elastic recoil, reduces hyperinflation and redirects air to healthier portions of the lung for more effective ventilation.</description>
