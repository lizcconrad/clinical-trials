  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineural injection of local anesthesic is currently the reference method for the treatment
      of post operative pain in a patient undergoing major orthopedic surgery. Postoperative pain
      is a dynamic phenomena in every patient. It is classified as intense during the first
      postoperative hours after surgery, and decreases in a non-linear manner over the days
      following the procedure. PCA (patient control analgesia) infusion of local anesthesic allows
      an adaptation of the local analgesia doses to the evaluated pain scores, as well as permit a
      decrease in adverse events related to the continuous infusion technique (motor or sensory
      blockade, paresthesia, etc.). The physician can also modify the pump settings according to
      the postoperative rehabilitation plan.The use of new communication techniques such as
      &quot;telemedecine&quot; may be of interest in reducing treatment onset time and optimizing pain
      management. The remote control consists to change the settings of the pump after if the
      anesthesiologist was informed in real time (via a smartphone or a tablet) on patient pain
      level, sensory and motor blockades. The physician goes to a dedicated website (Micrel
      CareTM). and makes the necessary changes by remote control via a GPRS (General Packet Radio
      Service) connexion. The aim of this prospective, comparative, multicentric trial is to
      compare the effectiveness of patient management through two communication modalities: remote
      control versus bedside care.

    <description>For patient randomized in arm &quot;Remote Control&quot;, the communication with anesthesiologist will be done by teletransmission. The intervention &quot;Remote control&quot; is assigned to this arm. When evaluated pain values, sensory or motricity blockades are over the selected threshold then, the patient enters the data in the PCA (Patient Control Analgesia) pump, the physician in charge of the patient for the protocol is alerted by SMS on a specific smart phone and makes the necessary settings changes by Remote Control on the Micrel CareTM site.</description>

    <description>For patient randomized in arm &quot;At bedside care&quot;, the communication with the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient will be done via the nurses and referent physician of the medical unit, as a routine procedures. The necessary changes of pump settings are doing by the anesthesiologist. The intervention &quot;at beside care&quot; is assigned to arm &quot;at bedside care&quot;.</description>

    <description>When pain or sensory and motor block evaluation exceed the thresholds, the patient enters the data in the PCA (patient Control Analgesia) pump. The investigator is alerted by SMS on his smartphone and makes the necessary programming changes by remote control on the Micrel Care TM site. Systematic assessments via the PCA pump are scheduled for 9:00, 13:00 and 19:00 every day during 48 to 72 hours. The patient can alert his physician through his PCA pump of any additional requests (pain, motor blockade, numbness). The anesthesiologist receives an SMS alert and can make any necessary programming changes to the pump via the remote control.</description>

    <description>When pain or sensory and motor block evaluation exceed the thresholds, the nurse contacts the physician and she will be able to modify the pump settings according to the anesthesiologist prescription. The delay between the call of the patient and the programming changes, the duration of the procedure are reported. Systematic evaluations via the PCA (Patient Control Analgesia) pump are done when the patient arrives in this surgical ward and at 9:00, 13:00 and 19:00 every day for 48 to 72 hours.Throughout the study, if necessary, the nurse or referring physician performs the programming changes directly on the PCA pump and notes the delay in treatment. All the reasons and the duration of any bedside visit are reported.</description>
