  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, investigators examine the impact of a mood treatment enhanced diabetes
      self-care intervention for depressed, low-income Latino diabetics. The investigators
      hypothesize that the mood treatment enhancement will lead to significant improvement in both
      diabetes and depression outcomes as compared with the self-care intervention alone.

      The Phase I pilot recruited older Latinos from Dr. Mangione's previous study (who agreed to
      participate in future research) and 10 participants from a community settings. Those with low
      mood and poor glycemic control were offered a 12-week intervention combining cognitive
      behavioral therapy mood management techniques and diabetes self-care into one seamless
      intervention. Drs. Mangione and Miranda supervised and reviewed (through audiotapes)
      well-trained health educators conducting the intervention sessions. The study manuals were
      modified following this Phase I pilot intervention.

      The final intervention manual was tested in a randomized trial in Phase II, compared the Mood
      and Diabetes Empowerment and Improvement Training intervention with enhanced care as usual
      (providing participants with a letter regarding their mood and hemoglobin (Hb)A1c with
      recommendations for improving care for their provider). The target population was low-income
      Latinos with depression and poor glycemic control. Both mood and diabetes outcomes are
      evaluated.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Hemoglobin A1c at 6 Months</measure>

    <description>Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measures glycemic control over the past three months. HbA1c was measured by a blood draw and laboratory test.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Depression Measures at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) measures depression in older adults. The short form we used consists of 15 yes or no questions. The scale range is 0 to 15, where higher scores indicate greater severity of depression.
The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) measures depression in patients. The questionnaire consists of 9 questions where patients self report how frequently they have depression symptoms over the past two weeks. The scale ranges is 0 to 27 where higher scores indicate greater severity of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in EQ-5D at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D measures general quality of life. The index score is based on 5 questions about mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status. The EuroQol Group provides a U.S. preference-weighted algorithm to calculate the index scores. A score of 1 indicates no problems while a score of -0.11 indicates severe problems.
The scale score is based on a visual analog of a thermostat, where 0 represents worst imaginable health and 100 represents best imaginable health. Patients mark a tick for where they feel their health is on that scale.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Yale Physical Activity Scale - Index Summary Score at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Yale Physical Activity Scale measures physical function and activities of daily living. Five activity indices (vigorous activity, leisurely walking, moving, standing and sitting) are calculated by multiplying the frequency of activity with the duration and a weighted factor. The 5 indices are then summed to create an index summary. Higher scores indicate more activity. The minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 142.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Self-Efficacy (Diabetes Empowerment Scale) at 6 Months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Diabetes Empowerment Scale Short Form (DES-SF) measures diabetes-related psychosocial self-efficacy. The questionnaire presents 8 statements on self-efficacy where participants rate how strongly they agree. The answers are summed to create a score where higher scores indicate more empowerment. The score range is 0 to 8.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Wait-listed Control Group will receive augmented access and communication with a primary care provider. The augmentation would consist of providing the participant with a letter to be shared with their primary care doctor indicating their Hb A1c level and depression score at the time of eligibility screening. The research team will also attach a list of local mental health service providers to the letter. The participants randomized to the wait-listed control group will also be offered access to the intervention after the trial is completed in the event that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has significant results.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend weekly 2-hour group Empowerment and CBT classes for 12 weeks led by two trained health educators. Participants will learn cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques to manage their mood. After CBT, participants will learn a diabetes education format that is grounded in empowerment theory that employs group problem solving, individualized goal setting, and personal behavioral change &quot;experiments&quot; designed to help patients set priorities and to become better self-managers of both diabetes and their mood. As part of the intervention activities, group members will be advised to monitor their blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and mood on a daily basis.</description>

          <title>EQ-5D</title>
          <description>The EQ-5D measures general quality of life. The index score is based on 5 questions about mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status. The EuroQol Group provides a U.S. preference-weighted algorithm to calculate the index scores. A score of 1 indicates no problems while a score of -0.11 indicates severe problems.
The scale score is based on a visual analog of a thermostat, where 0 represents worst imaginable health and 100 represents best imaginable health. Patients mark a tick for where they feel their health is on that scale.</description>

Five activity indices (vigorous activity, leisurely walking, moving, standing and sitting) are calculated by multiplying the frequency of activity with the duration and a weighted factor. The 5 indices are then summed to create an index summary. Higher scores indicate more activity. The minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 142.</description>

The augmentation consisted of providing the participant with a letter to be shared with their primary care doctor indicating their Hb A1c level and depression score at the time of eligibility screening. The research team also attached a list of local mental health service providers to the letter. The participants randomized to the wait-listed control group will be offered access to the intervention after the trial is completed in the event that the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has significant results.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D measures general quality of life. The index score is based on 5 questions about mobility, self-care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status. The EuroQol Group provides a U.S. preference-weighted algorithm to calculate the index scores. A score of 1 indicates no problems while a score of -0.11 indicates severe problems.
The scale score is based on a visual analog of a thermostat, where 0 represents worst imaginable health and 100 represents best imaginable health. Patients mark a tick for where they feel their health is on that scale.</description>

Five activity indices (vigorous activity, leisurely walking, moving, standing and sitting) are calculated by multiplying the frequency of activity with the duration and a weighted factor. The 5 indices are then summed to create an index summary. Higher scores indicate more activity. The minimum and maximum scores are 0 and 142.</description>
