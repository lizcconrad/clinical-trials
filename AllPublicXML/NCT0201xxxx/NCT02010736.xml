  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe the behavior of kinematic variables in children with
      spastic hemiparetic cerebral palsy (SHCP), immediately after treadmill gait training with
      ankle loading.

      The children underwent a single treadmill training session with ankle loading. The kinematic
      parameters were assessed in three phases: before training (PRE); immediately after training
      (POST); and 5 minutes after the end of training (FOLLOW UP).

      The investigators hypothesized that the treadmill gait training with additional lower limb
      loading would be a disturbance capable of modifying the locomotor strategy of children with
      SHCP, by the increase in kinematic parameters in the swing phase of gait.

    <description>Kinematic gait data were captured by Qualisys Track Manager 1.6.0.x - QTM software and exported to Visual3D processing software, to reconstruct the segments and create a biomechanical model. It was carried out in two stages: static and dynamic collection. The dynamic collection was performed while the children walked on the electric treadmill.
The primary outcome measure was the following spatiotemporal variables at the POST phase: cadence (steps/min), stride length (m), paretic step length (m), stance time (%), swing time (%) paretic lower limb (PLL), double stance (%), symmetry ratio and stance/swing time ratio. With respect to angular variables, the following parameters was analysed: angular displacement (maximum flexion, maximum extension and range of motion) of the hip and knee were investigated (º).</description>

The secundary outcome measure was the same spatiotemporal and angular variables investigated at the POST phase although in this condition they was analysed at FOLLOW UP phase.</description>
