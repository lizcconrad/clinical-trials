      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the switch from branded to generic warfarin or
      between different generic warfarin tablets may cause fluctuation in the results of
      coagulation tests (International Normalized Rate, acronym INR) in patients, thus predisposing
      them to unnecessary risks.

      [Changes to the protocol made until the stage of the statistical analysis plan, before data
      analysis and also before unblinding.]

        1. Objective

           1.1 Main Objective

           We aim to determine, through mean INR difference between formulations, whether there is
           therapeutic equivalency between the branded warfarin sodium (Marevan®) and the generic
           formulations in atrial fibrillation patients in Brazil.

           1.2 Specific Objective

           In order to achieve the objective, we aim to assess with each warfarin formulation :

             -  Delta INR [new primary outcome];

             -  mean INR [mean prothrombin time will not be analyzed since it will convey the same
                information as the mean INR];

             -  mean dosage needed for anticoagulation [new outcome];

             -  clinical events (the frequency of thromboembolic events, bleedings, deaths and
                adverse events);

             -  the time in therapeutic range;

             -  and compliance with treatment.

        2. Hypothesis

           Our hypothesis is that the delta INR of patients when using the generic tablets of
           warfarin sodium does not differ by more than 0.49 (two-sided) from the mean INR obtained
           when using the branded formulation, thereby demonstrating therapeutic equivalence. We
           will also assess this same outcome to assess therapeutic equivalence between the generic
           formulations to each other.

        3. Type of Study

           This study is a crossover randomized controlled equivalence trial. It comprises four
           phases, each one one-month long, being the first one a run-in period. Patients will use
           a different warfarin sodium tablet formulation in each one of the phases 2, 3 and 4:
           either the branded Marevan® (União Química/Farmoquímica, Brasil), or two generic drugs,
           (manufactured by União Química Farmacêutica Nacional S/A or Laboratório Teuto Brasileiro
           S/A, Brasil) purchased from Brazilian drugstores (not directly from the manufacturer).
           Every patient will use each one of the three formulations in a previously determined
           sequence (A, B, C, D, E or F) to which he was assigned by randomization.

           Since patients included in the study will already be using warfarin and it is not
           ethically acceptable to interrupt this treatment, we planned a run-in period equivalent
           to seven warfarin half-lives, long enough to washout any previous warfarin treatment.
           Then, in this first phase, patients will start treatment with the same warfarin
           formulation that will be used in the second phase thus avoiding the carry-over effect.
           This period will also be used to select patients compliant with treatment, accepting
           those that during the run-in have at least one of the three (including the baseline) INR
           results within 2.0 and 3.0 and a difference of INR results at the 3th and 4th week ≤
           ±0.8.

        4. Methods

           An independent investigator (initials TFCP) will use a computer random number generator
           to allocate patients to one of the six sequences of treatment [update: we opted to apply
           randomization through numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes in order to facilitate
           allocation concealment]. The principal investigator (initials CGF) will separate, repack
           and dispense drugs for patients in opaque drug containers of identical appearance
           [update: the step of repacking the drugs in opaque containers was made by two
           investigators external to the study, BR and MFST, instead of the principal
           investigator]. This process will be based on the initials of the patient and the
           alphanumeric code, maintaining the allocation concealment since TFCP will be responsible
           for assigning to the repacked drugs the patient initials and the alphanumeric code
           correlated with the formulation of warfarin utilized. TFCP will also be accountable to
           conceal the allocation until the statistical analysis at the end of the study [update:
           BR and MFST created the coding and maintained its concealment]. Due to the features of
           the drug containers, physicians and the principal investigator (that assess patients and
           collect outcomes) will be blinded. Patients may not be blinded depending on the
           appearance of the manufactured tablets, but the main outcome will be a laboratory result
           (INR).

        5. Sample Size

           Forty-eight patients (eight in each group) is the minimum necessary number of
           individuals to detect a clinically significant fluctuation of 0.49 in the mean INR, with
           a 90% power at a 5% level of significance, if one were present. This sample size was
           estimated considering the Pocock's statistical method for quantitative outcomes and an
           achieved mean INR and standard deviation with the branded warfarin of 2.45 and 0.29
           respectively [update: later we considered a more conservative standard deviation of
           0.34, which resulted in a sample size of 11 patients per group]. To compensate possible
           withdrawals or exclusions of patients we plan to recruit 60 patients.

        6. Statistical Analysis

           For the INR, PT and TTR outcomes paired t-test will be used at a two-sided 5% level of
           significance. These analysis will be per protocol, i.e., data from patients that during
           the follow-up start treatment with substances or drugs that interact either in a
           moderate or major way or are contraindicated when used with warfarin (Annex I) will be
           excluded [update: multiple t-tests would not be adequate because nominal significance
           levels would not reflect the actual alfa, and thus we decided to apply multilevel
           mixed-effects linear regression. We have new definitions for per protocol analyses.].

           Binary outcomes (thromboembolic or bleeding events) will be analysed by Mcnemar test at
           a 5% level of significance using intention to treat i.e. considering missing data as
           adverse outcomes. In this case sensibility analysis will be conducted [update: we
           decided for just presenting the events recorded during the trial without any hypothesis
           testing due to cross-over design limitations and lower power for these outcomes].
           Exploratory analysis for subgroup of patients are not intended.

    <measure>Difference between Delta INR</measure>
    <time_frame>At the fourth week of each period</time_frame>
    <description>INR: International normalized ratio. INR will be assessed twice a month during the 16 weeks of study.
Delta INR will be calculated by the difference, in absolute numbers (i.e. in module), between the two valid INR measurements due for each patient with each formulation at each period. Difference between the delta INRs will be the outcome. We will compare generic to branded warfarin (Marevan®) and the generic formulations to each other.</description>

    <description>The warfarin dosage will be calculated as the sum of the dosage taken in the week before the study visit, as referred by the patient. We will calculate the mean dosage for each formulation of warfarin; difference between the mean dosage will be the outcome.
We will compare generic to branded warfarin (Marevan®) and the generic formulations to each other.</description>

    <measure>Incidence of bleeding events</measure>

Major: intracranial hemorrhage, fatal bleeding, bleeding resulting in hemoglobin loss equal to or greater than 2.0 g / L, hemorrhage requiring transfusion, bleeding in sensitive areas such as the retina or pericardium.
