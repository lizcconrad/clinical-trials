      The purpose of the study is to assess additional detection of Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder
      Cancer (NMIBC) with hexyl aminolevulinate (HAL) cystoscopy based on lesions in patients
      undergoing TUR-B compared to white-light cystoscopy under the conditions of daily clinical
      practice.

    <description>As this is a non-interventional study, detection of NMIBC with Hexvix is in a pre-defined group, chosen prior to and independently from the decision to enrol the subject in this study.
The detection with Hexvix should be in accordance with local Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC].
Subjects will be treated in accordance with usual medical practice during their participation in this study, no additional assessment or tests will be required.</description>
