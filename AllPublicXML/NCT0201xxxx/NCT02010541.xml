    <textblock>
      The first purpose of this study is to is to compare metabolic control of type 1 diabetes
      among children under the age of 7 years who use an insulin pump and a real-time (RT) glucose
      sensor, and children who use only insulin pump; the investigators will also determine dietary
      habits, their knowledge of type 1 diabetes management and emotional aspects of experiencing
      illness in the family, in both groups of children.
