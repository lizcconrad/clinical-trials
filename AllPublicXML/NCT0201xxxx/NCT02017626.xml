  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of Subcutaneous
      Immunotherapy treatment (SCIT) with incremental doses of a modified recombinant fish
      parvalbumin (mCyp c 1) quantified in mass units:

      To establish a safe dose of the candidate hypo-allergen in human subjects and To study the
      pharmaco-dynamics of the hypo-allergen administered to human subjects.

      The study is performed as a placebo-controlled double-blinded randomized trial with 24 fish
      allergic patients allocated into three different groups of eight.

      The aim of the FAST project in general is to develop novel recombinant allergen-based
      therapeutics for the treatment of food allergy. The chosen approach is to modify recombinant
      allergens into hypo-allergenic molecules to decrease the risk of anaphylactic side-effects
      and to allow administration of higher doses leading to better efficacy.
