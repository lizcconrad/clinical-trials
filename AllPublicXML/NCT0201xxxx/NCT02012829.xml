  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Qualitative data were collected from 5 General Practionners (GPs) focus groups, 24 patient
      interviews and 35 recorded consultations from 9 GPs to explore colorectal cancer (CRC)
      screening in France The qualitative data indicated that improvement was needed in
      patient-centered communication. Educational material was developed based on these
      triangulated data with two different scenarios to improve communication with patients: one
      for a compliant patient, another for a non compliant patient The hypothesis is that a brief
      intervention on GPs can improve the patients' participation rate to colorectal screening

      Method : cluster randomized control trial (cluster unit : GPs practices) With a brief
      intervention on a randomized population of GPs in the district of Val d'Oise Inclusion
      criteria: GPs with a practice in the district of Val d'Oise and active in the colorectal mass
      screening

      a cluster randomized controlled parallel groups study was conducted in the Val d'Oise
      department in France All practices of the Val d'Oise department were eligible to participate.
      Among 585 practices, an independent biostatistician randomized 50 practices per arm in
      October 2011 according to a computer generated randomization list.Two team members phone
      called all the GPS of the randomized practices.

      GPs from practices in the control group are asked to continue their usual care, as if they
      were not participating in this trial. GPs of both groups had to send their patients list to
      the research team to calculate their eligible population. They were also asked to list all
      the gFOBT delivered during the six months period of the study.

      GPs of the intervention group received a four hours educational training focused on patients'
      centered care.

    <description>GPs of the intervention group received a four hours educational training focused on patients' centered care to improve GPs communication skills and enhance patients'participation in CRC mass screening . Triangulation of all qualitative data was performed in order to develop educational material and training based on the six components of the Patient-Centered Clinical Method . Two different scenarios were developed: one for a compliant patient, another for a non-compliant patient. Two videos were made with doctor and simulated patient. Interactive methods were used to elaborate educational training including role playing, the presentation of the video followed by an interactive discussion.</description>
