  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel in stabilized
      patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who performed percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with ticagrelor.

      In this study, 3,288 patients with AMI who underwent PCI with DES and took dual antiplatelet
      therapy as aspirin and ticagrelor during 1 month from index PCI will be randomized to aspirin
      and ticagrelor versus aspirin and clopidogrel during 11 months.
