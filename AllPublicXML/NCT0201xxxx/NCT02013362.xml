  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase I portion:

      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of pralatrexate with concurrent vitamin B12 and folic
      acid supplementation in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL and to determine
      the recommended dosage. Also, to evaluate pharmacokinetics.

      Phase II portion:

      To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of the recommended dosage regimen
      determined in the phase I portion. The primary efficacy endpoint shall be objective response
      rate (ORR).

    <description>The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Response will be determined according to International Workshop Criteria (IWC). Assessments will be done at week 7 (end of Cycle 1), subsequently every 14 weeks (end of odd-numbered cycle).</description>
