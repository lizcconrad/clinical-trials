        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  patients with Philadelphia-negative B-Precursor Acute Lyphmoblastic Leukemia in
             complete hematological remission defined as less than 5% blasts in bone marrow after
             at least 3 intensive chemotherapy blocks (i.e. any standard or investigational regimen
             according to adult protocols as long as 3 age appropriate chemotherapy blocks were
             given, this also includes relapse treatment

          -  detection of minimal residual disease (molecular failure or molecular relapse) at a
             level of greater than or equal to 10*(-4) by PCR or greater than or equal to 10*(-3)
             by flow cytometry at a reference lab

          -  Age 15 or greater at time of initial diagnosis with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. For
             patients aged 15-17 treatment according to adult protocols is required

          -  Initial diagnosis in the year 2000 or later

          -  History of acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment (including response to first
             therapy, number of prior relapses) is available

          -  Relapse status and disease follow up after timepoint of minimal residual disease
             detection is available

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with extramedullary disease at timepoint of minimal residual disease
             detection

          -  Use of Blinatumomab within 18 months of minimal residual disease detection

          -  Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation prior to minimal residual disease
             detection at the required level
