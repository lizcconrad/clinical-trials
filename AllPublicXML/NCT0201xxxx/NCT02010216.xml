  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Patients received RoActemra/Actemra 8
      mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks, alone or in combination with standard anti-rheumatic
      therapy, for 12 weeks.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity 28 (DAS28) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 score is a measure of the patient's disease activity calculated using the tender joint count (TJC) [28 joints], swollen joint count (SJC) [28 joints], patient's global assessment of disease activity [visual analog scale: 0=no disease activity to 100=maximum disease activity] and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for a total possible score of 0 to approximately 10. Scores below 2.6 indicate best disease control and scores above 5.1 indicate worse disease control. A negative change from Baseline indicated improvement.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving ACR20/50/70 Responses After the Third Infusion Categorized by Highest Response Achieved</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) ACR20, ACR50 or ACR70 response is defined as a ≥ 20% or 50% or 70% improvement (reduction) compared with Baseline for both total joint count-68 joints (TJC68) and swollen joint count-66 joints (SJC66), as well as for three of the additional five ACR core set variables: Patient's Assessment of Pain over the previous 24 hours: using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) left end of the line 0=no pain to right end of the line 100=unbearable pain; Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity and Physician's Global Assessment of Disease Activity over the previous 24 hours using a VAS where left end of the line 0=no disease activity to right end of the line 100=maximum disease activity; Health Assessment Questionnaire: 20 questions, 8 components: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities, 0=without difficulty to 3=unable to do; and acute-phase reactant [either C-reactive protein or Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate].</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Safety: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A SAE was any experience that suggested a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant.</description>

        <title>Safety: Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</title>
        <description>An AE was considered any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease associated with the use of the study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. Preexisting conditions that worsened during the study were reported as adverse events. A SAE was any experience that suggested a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect or precaution that: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was medically significant.</description>
