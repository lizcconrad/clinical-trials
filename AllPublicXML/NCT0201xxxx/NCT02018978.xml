  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-year Phase II trial of a HIV prevention strategy designed to significantly reduce
      population-level HIV incidence. The study design is a two-arm community randomized controlled
      trial of Comprehensive Triaged HIV Prevention (CTHP) which includes: (a) Access to an HIV
      center which will provide free HIV testing and counseling, (b) Educational activities related
      to HIV risk behavior, (c) Special counseling sessions for HIV-infected clients, (d) A onetime
      provision of a small amount of food or health products for sex partners of persons testing
      positive for HIV or reporting HIV risk behaviors when they come to receive HIV testing, (e) A
      post test support club for persons infected with HIV, (f) An income generation training
      program for people testing positive for HIV, (g) Transportation assistance in visiting the
      HIV Care and Treatment Clinic in the area for those who test positive for HIV, and, (h)
      Counseling and transportation support for those on medical treatment for HIV to assist them
      in attending scheduled appointments, and receiving and taking their medications as
      recommended by the clinic staff. The study will take place within two communities located in
      Kisarawe district, Tanzania. The intervention will occur over an 18-month period with
      outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The study hypothesis is that individuals
      in the intervention community will have a lower incidence of sexually transmitted infections
      (STIs) than those in the control community.
