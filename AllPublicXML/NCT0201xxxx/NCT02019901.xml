      Purpose: To compare a nurse-led clinic including person-centered care and tight control with
      &quot;care as usual&quot; in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and moderate/ high disease
      activity.

      Project description: Study population: Patients with RA, 18-80 yrs old, with moderate/ high
      Disease Activity Score of 28 joints (DAS28 &gt; 3.8) and disease duration &gt; 2 yrs in a 6-month
      randomized controlled study with a 6 month open follow-up. Intervention group (N=60):
      Nurse-led visits every 6th week, with structured person-centered care and evaluation of
      disease activity. If disease remission is not reached, pharmacological treatment including
      both short-term (intra-articular and oral steroids) and long-term alterations (DMARDs and
      biologics) is modified according to a predefined algorithm. The control group (N=60) is
      treated according to &quot;care as usual&quot; with visits to physician every 6th month. Outcome
      measures: Primary outcome measure is change in Diseases Activity Score (DAS). Secondary
      outcomes are quality of life, self-efficacy, disability, emotional well-being, pain, fatigue,
      sleep and satisfaction.
