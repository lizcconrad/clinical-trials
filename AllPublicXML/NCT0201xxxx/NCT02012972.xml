  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For national antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs, the most important health system goals in
      reducing morbidity and mortality among HIV-infection patients are to initiate treatment as
      early as eligibility criteria allow and to achieve the highest possible long-term retention
      of patients on ART. In South Africa, cohort data have consistently found high attrition among
      ART patients, with the combined cumulative outcomes of death and loss to follow up averaging
      25-40% over the first five years after ART initiation. Like many other middle income
      countries, South Africa also faces very high rates of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and
      NCD risks. Despite this, there are virtually no studies looking at interactions between ART
      and NCDs, and none that have considered the effect of NCDs and NCD risk factors on achieving
      the second health system goal mentioned above: long term retention on ART.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main RapIT study focuses on rapid initiation of ART, with short-term (6-month) attrition
      from treatment and viral suppression as the primary outcomes. In this supplemental study, we
      will evaluate the role of NCDs and NCD risk factors on long-term retention on ART, with
      outcomes including mortality, loss to follow up, viral suppression and immunologic
      improvement, and physical functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and
      economic productivity among patients already on ART. The study will enroll up to 400 adult
      patients already on ART for ≥ 12 months at the RapIT study site. At enrollment, consented
      subjects will be screened for elevated levels of several NCD risk factors including body mass
      index; glucose using HbA1c levels; blood pressure and cholesterol; as well as signs of
      abnormalities in hepatic, renal, and lung function. A medical history will be taken, and a
      questionnaire will gather information about chronic pain, alcohol use, smoking, physical
      functioning, ability to perform normal daily activities, and economic productivity. Referral
      for further NCD diagnosis and care will be offered as needed. Existing electronic medical
      records will be accessed to obtain retrospective data since ART initiation and to follow
      subjects prospectively for up to 24 months after the enrollment screening is completed. Six
      months after enrollment, subjects with NCDs or at high risk of NCDs will be re-screened at a
      routine ART medication pickup visit to assess uptake of referral and whether risks,
      conditions, or outcomes have changed. The study will help identify reasons for poor outcomes
      on ART and point to interventions that will help achieve the overall goals of the national
      ART program.

        The study population will be non-pregnant adults who initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART)
        for HIV at least 12 months prior to study enrollment and are at least 35 years old. The age
        restriction will allow the study to focus on older patients who are at greater risk of
        NCDs. Pregnant women will be excluded because they face a different set of NCD risks
        directly related to pregnancy; women less than 6 months post-partum are also excluded to
        allow for the remaining effects of pregnancy.
