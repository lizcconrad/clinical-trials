    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. At least 18 years of age at time of study entry

          2. Written informed consent and any locally required authorization (eg, Health Insurance
             Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] in the USA) obtained from the subject/legal
             representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including
             screening evaluations

          3. Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed melanoma or clear-cell RCC that are
             refractory to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exists

               1. Subjects must have failed, be intolerant to, or be ineligible for any potentially
                  curative approved treatment, irrespective of line of therapy

               2. No more than 3 prior lines of therapy

          4. At least 1 measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1; subjects whose only measurable lesion is
             a lymph node will be excluded

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score of 0 or 1

          6. For all tumor types, adequate organ and marrow function, as defined below:

               1. Hemoglobin ³ 9.0 g/dL within first 2 weeks prior to first dose of MEDI0680
                  (AMP-514)

               2. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ³ 1.5 × 109/L (1,500/mm3)

               3. Platelet count ³ 100 × 109/L (100,000/mm3)

               4. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except subjects with documented Gilbert's syndrome (&gt;
                  3 × ULN) or liver metastasis, who must have a baseline total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 mg/

               5. Alanine aminotransferase and AST ≤ 2.5 × ULN; for subjects with hepatic
                  metastases, ALT and AST ≤ 5 × ULN

               6. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN OR calculated creatinine clearance (CrCl) or 24-hour
                  urine CrCl ≥ 50 mL/minute ▪ Cockcroft-Gault formula will be used to calculate
                  CrCl; 24-hour urine CrCl will be derived using the measured creatinine clearance
                  formula

          7. Prior treatment toxicities must be ≤ Grade 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Concurrent enrollment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study

          2. Receipt of any BRAF inhibitor (in metastatic melanoma), or investigational anticancer
             therapy within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of MEDI0680 (AMP-514)

          3. Prior exposure to immunotherapy, such as, but not limited to, other anti-CTLA-4,
             anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, excluding therapeutic cancer vaccines

          4. Major surgery (as defined by the investigator) within 4 weeks prior to first dose of
             MEDI0680 (AMP-514) or still recovering from prior surgery

          5. Other invasive malignancy within 2 years except for noninvasive malignancies such as
             cervical carcinoma in situ, non-melanomatous carcinoma of the skin or ductal carcinoma
             in situ of the breast that has/have been surgically cured

          6. Prior allogeneic or autologous bone marrow or organ transplantation that requires use
             of immunosuppressives

          7. Unresolved toxicities from prior anticancer therapy, defined as having not resolved to
             NCI CTCAE v4.03 Grade 0 or 1, or to levels dictated in the inclusion/exclusion
             criteria with the exception of alopecia. Subjects with irreversible toxicity that is
             not reasonably expected to be exacerbated by MEDI0680 (AMP-514) may be included (eg,
             hearing loss) after consultation with the MedImmune medical monitor

          8. Active or prior documented autoimmune disease within the past 2 years
