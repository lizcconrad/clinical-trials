  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine a relationship between a person's flora/bacteria in
      their gut (the intestinal microbiome) and their risk of cardiovascular disease. Investigators
      will look at inflammatory markers in the blood and also look at the genome of the bacteria in
      the gut.

      Investigators will look at inflammatory markers in the blood and also look at the genome of
      the bacteria in the gut. This research is being done because Investigators believe that there
      is a connection between the way food is digested by a person's gut bacteria and the
      development of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) and cardiovascular disease. The
      ultimate goal of this research is to eventually determine if changes to the gut bacteria can
      prevent cardiovascular disease or disease progression.
