  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      500 patients with normal renal function will be prospectively studied and incidence, spectrum
      and natural history of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) will be observed in them and in 200 patients
      with abnormal renal function fulfilling AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) criteria will be
      prospectively studied for 1 year. Also biomarkers will be studied and validated as early
      predictors of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury).
