    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesised that a video based patient education will help patients
      understand the process of colon cleansing prior to a colonoscopy procedure and hence will
      result in clean colons that will may help physician perform a better quality examination.

    <textblock>
      After obtaining consent over phone, the investigators randomly assigned assigned participants
      to receive either the standard paper based instructions or receive an educational video in
      addition to the standard paper based instruction. Physicians performing the procedure were
      blinded to this assignment. The investigators obtained information relating to the
      cleanliness of the colon as noted during the colonoscopy examination. The investigators
      obtained this information from the colonoscopy reports. The investigators also obtained
      information regarding colon polyps,wanting to see if there is any difference in the number of
      patients in whom adenomatous polyps were detected.

      Outcome measures:

      Primary Out come:

      1.Quality of bowel preparation

      Secondary outcome:

        1. Adenoma detection rate

        2. Rate of incomplete procedures due to poor bowel prep.

    <description>An educational video was developed based on the current paper instructions for bowel preparation. The video included a physician explaining the process, using more images and short clip videos of the example. The script of the video was approved by the patient education department of the University Hospital and language adjusted to 6th grade level.</description>
