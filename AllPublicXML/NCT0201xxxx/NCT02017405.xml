  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the digestibility of serum-derived bovine
      immunoglobulin protein isolate in healthy adults. The information generated may help
      elucidate SBI's mechanism of action.

    <description>Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is a specially formulated light-colored protein powder composed of immunoglobulin (IgG) and other serum proteins similar to those found in colostrum and milk. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate does not contain any milk products such as lactose, casein, or whey. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is gluten-free, dye-free, and soy-free. Serum-derived bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate is manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) and FDA guidelines for medical food ingredients.</description>
