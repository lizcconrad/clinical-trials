  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and safety of using small beads
      (70-150 micron in place of 100-300 micron) to deliver chemotherapy into the liver to treat
      patients with liver lesions from colorectal cancer. The beads (LC-Bead M1) will be loaded
      with irinotecan (DEBIRI-M1), and used to administer transarterial chemoembolization (TACE).

      Eligibility:

      Patients with liver cancer from colorectal cancer.

      Study Overview/ Treatment:

      DEBIRI, loaded with irinotecan, is a device that utilizes tiny beads (70-150 microns) to
      deliver chemotherapy agents into liver tumor(s) via the hepatic artery. This device allows
      for continuous release of irinotecan into the liver tumor tissue(s) causing necrosis of the
      targeted tumor(s). The potential advantages of the smaller beads are deeper penetration into
      the tumor bed, while avoiding premature proximal occlusion of vessels feeding the tumor, and
      more consistent dosing. Response to therapy will be evaluated monthly by clinic visits and
      blood tests (to include assessment of liver function and tumor markers) and by imaging
      (usually MRIs) every 1-2 months. Patients will be on study for 6 months after which they will
      be exited from the study and followed for survival. Once exited from the study they will
      continue to be eligible to receive DEBIRI, should it be recommended.
