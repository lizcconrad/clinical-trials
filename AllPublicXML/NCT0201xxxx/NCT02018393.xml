      This study aims to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of FEIBA® in patients with severe
      haemophilia A and inhibitors.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, multicentric, case-control and one-single-visit study of patients
      with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors against FVIII in therapy with FEIBA®.

      Two subject groups will be included: Group 1 (cases) will be composed of patients with severe
      haemophilia A and inhibitors in prophylaxis with FEIBA®; Group 2 (controls) will be composed
      of patients with severe haemophilia A and inhibitors on-demand treatment with FEIBA®.

    <description>Prophylaxis with FEIBA is defined in this study as the regular infusion of FEIBA for the prevention of bleeding at a dose of ≥50 UF/kg on at least three non-consecutive days a week. Patients must have been on this modality for at least 6 months prior to the study visit</description>

    <description>On-demand Treatment is defined as the administration of FEIBA only to control bleeding. Patients must have been on this modality for at least 6 months prior to the study visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject has signed and dated the Informed Consent form for participation in this
             study.

          2. Age ≥ 18 years old.

          3. Patient with severe haemophilia A (FVIII &lt;1%) and high-responding inhibitor (titre &gt;5
             UB) at some point in their life, currently on therapy with FEIBA® to control bleeding.

          4. Group 1: Patients in prophylaxis with FEIBA®: The patient has been on prophylaxis
             regimen with FEIBA® for at least 6 months prior to the study visit. Group 2: Patients
             on-demand regimen with FEIBA®: The patient has been under on-demand treatment with
             FEIBA® for at 6 months prior to the study visit.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. The presence of any inflammatory condition at the time of the study visit or the
             previous 30 days that, according to the medical criterion, would affect the study
             objectives.

          2. The patient is under immune tolerance treatment or has been at any time during the 30
             days prior to the study visit.

          3. The administration of any anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drug 15 days before
             the study visit.

          4. Levels of CD4 &lt;200/l regardless of the HIV status.

          5. Altered hepatic or renal function defined by the presence of abnormal levels of
             alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) or serum creatinine, respectively.

          6. Administration of any haemostatic treatment to control bleeding within the 5 days
             prior to the study visit.
