    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Botox® (Onabotulinum Toxin A)
      versus Xeomin® (incobotulinum toxin A) for the treatment of forehead and glabellar (vertical
      lines between the eyebrows) wrinkles.

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened, photographed, assessed, and randomized to be injected with
      onabotulinum toxin A on one side and incobotulinum toxin A on the other side during their
      first clinic visit. Subjects will return for a 2 week, 2 month, 3 month, 4 month, 5 month,
      and 6 month follow-up to have photographs taken by the unblinded research assistant at
      relaxed and full contraction.

      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.
