  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and has a negative effect on
      the quality of life, functional ability, and mortality, with a prevalence rate as high as
      20-25%. However, it is hard to use anti-depressant due to the safety issue, and there has
      been little data so far particularly in terms of randomized clinical trials. Here, we
      investigate the effect of cognitive-behavioral group therapy for enhancing mental health and
      quality of life in patients with ESRD.
