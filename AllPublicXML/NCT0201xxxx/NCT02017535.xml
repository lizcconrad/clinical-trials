      The purpose of the study is:

        1. To find out how long teenagers getting talk therapy (interpersonal psychotherapy) for
           depression should get therapy before the therapist decides whether or not the teenager
           is improving enough, and

        2. To compare two ways of providing treatment to teenagers who have not improved enough.
