  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The central aim of this study is to assess mother-infant communication via behavioral,
      physiological, and affective indices under conditions where distal stressors may not be
      directly detectable by the infant.

      This investigation examines a distal maternal stressor on the quality of interaction in
      mother-infant dyadic communication. Assessments include behavioral, physiological, and
      affective indices under conditions where distal stressors may not be directly detectable by
      the infant. The present research examines mother-infant interactions to test the hypothesis
      of whether maternal stress may be transduced to their infants via multiple pathways. The
      secondary aim is to explore effective emotion regulation strategies for the mother as
      potential buffers to stress and additionally reducing early life stress effects on the
      infant's regulatory development.

      While the emotion regulation literature posits that reappraisal may be associated with
      decreased in physiological and psychological stress, this type of regulation strategy may be
      ineffective when interfacing with discrimination. The regulation strategy needs to be
      titrated to the stressor in order to be effective. These findings will have notable social,
      clinical, and psychological significance,

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary Cortisol</measure>
    <time_frame>One lab appointment for approximately 80 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary cortisol is a measure that indicates hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity. The study obtains 4 assessments with 20 minutes between each assessment. Participants chew on a cotton role for 2-minutes which is placed in a cortisol salivette tube (Sarstedt)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Salivary Amylase</measure>
    <time_frame>One lab appointment for approximately 80 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>Salivary amylase is an indicator of sympathetic nervous system activity. The same salivary salivette is used to later extract the amylase.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Mother-infant observations</measure>
    <time_frame>One lab appointment for approximately 80 minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>At four assessment occasions during the one time visit, the mother and infant are observed for a free 2-minute period. Observations include global affect, and (present or not) vocalizations, infant fussiness, and motor activity.</description>
