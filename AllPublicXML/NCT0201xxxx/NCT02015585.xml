  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The edentulism and use of inadequate dentures, unstable and with teeth worn because long
      period of usage can lead to an disharmony of the stomatognathic system due to gradual loss of
      occlusion vertical dimension resulting in inadequate mandibular movements and condyle-fossa
      relation. The reline of the denture base and the use of interocclusal appliance prior to
      definitive rehabilitation could have influence on these functional aspects. However, there
      are not Randomized Controlled clinical Trials (RCTs) testing the combined use of these two
      treatments in reestablishing these functional aspects. The, aim of this study is to evaluate
      whether the denture base reline and the use of interocclusal appliance prior to final
      rehabilitation have influence on mandibular movements and condyle-fossa relation, incomplete
      denture wearers. For this controlled, crossover, randomized and blinded clinical trial, 30
      volunteers, totally edentulous, complete denture wearer over a period of five year, will be
      selected. The volunteers will be randomly allocated into three subgroups (n= 10) and will
      receive the following treatments: Control (C)Volunteers will receive new complete denture
      without any previous intervention in their old complete denture; Relining Denture
      (RD)Volunteers will be submitted to the relining of the base of the their old complete
      denture and after 30 days of usage and before the replacement of the new complete denture, an
      evaluation will be performed; Interocclusal Appliance (IA) Volunteers will be submitted to
      the treatment with interocclusal appliance and after 30 days of usage and before the
      replacement of the new complete denture, an evaluation will be performed. Volunteers will be
      evaluated regarding the extent of mandibular movement by intraoral record of Gothic Gysi
      arch; condyle-fossa relation by cone-bean computed tomographic scan; occlusion vertical
      dimension by Willis compass and photographic record. These evaluations will be performed at
      three periods, T0 baseline; T1 after application of randomized treatment, reline denture and
      interocclusal appliance); T3 after final rehabilitation. The control group will be evaluated
      only at periods T0 and T3.
