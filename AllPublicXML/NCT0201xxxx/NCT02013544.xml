      The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of intravaginal prasterone (DHEA) on
      symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy due to menopause and to collect further data on subjects
      exposed to intravaginal DHEA in order to meet the ICH E1 guideline requirements.

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Percentage of Superficial Cells in the Maturation Index of the Vaginal Smear</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of superficial cells was determined from the vaginal smears collected during the study. A 100-cell count was performed by a central laboratory to classify cells as parabasal (P) (including basal), intermediate (I), and superficial (S) squamous cell types. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Vaginal pH</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A pH strip fixed on an Ayre spatula (or equivalent) was applied directly to the lateral wall of the vagina. The change in color of the pH indicator strip was compared to the color chart for pH evaluation. The corresponding pH value (with one decimal) was recorded. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Severity of the Most Bothersome Symptom of Dyspareunia</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of dyspareunia was evaluated by a questionnaire filled out by women. The severity of dyspareunia recorded as none, mild, moderate or severe was analyzed using the score values of 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Severity of Vaginal Dryness</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of vaginal dryness was evaluated by a questionnaire filled out by women. The severity of vaginal dryness recorded as none, mild, moderate or severe was analyzed using the score values of 0, 1, 2 or 3, respectively. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Severity of Vaginal Atrophy as Evaluated From Vaginal Secretions</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the aspect of the mucosa and the local tolerance to prasterone ovules, the vaginal secretions (one of the four main signs of vaginal atrophy) evaluated by the physician/gynecologist as corresponding to none, mild, moderate, or severe atrophy were analyzed using the score values of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Severity of Vaginal Atrophy as Evaluated From Vaginal Epithelial Integrity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the aspect of the mucosa and the local tolerance to prasterone ovules, the vaginal epithelial integrity (one of the four main signs of vaginal atrophy) evaluated by the physician/gynecologist as corresponding to none, mild, moderate, or severe atrophy was analyzed using the score values of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the aspect of the mucosa and the local tolerance to prasterone ovules, the vaginal epithelial surface thickness (one of the four main signs of vaginal atrophy) evaluated by the physician/gynecologist as corresponding to none, mild, moderate, or severe atrophy was analyzed using the score values of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

    <description>To evaluate the aspect of the mucosa and the local tolerance to prasterone ovules, the vaginal color (one of the four main signs of vaginal atrophy) evaluated by the physician/gynecologist as corresponding to none, mild, moderate, or severe atrophy was analyzed using the score values of 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>

A 100-cell count was performed by a central laboratory to classify cells as parabasal (P) (including basal), intermediate (I), and superficial (S) squamous cell types. Data obtained at Baseline and Week 12 as well as the change from Baseline to Week 12 are presented.</description>
