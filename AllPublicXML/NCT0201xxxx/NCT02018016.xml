      Background

      Appendicitis is a common condition which represents a significant resource burden for the
      Scottish National Health Service (NHS). It is unknown whether there are significant
      differences in Scottish appendicectomy (appendectomy) outcomes which may be explained by
      hospital volume. In many studies, hospital procedural volume has been shown to be predictive
      of surgical outcomes.

      Aims

      The aim of this study is to compare appendicectomy outcomes in Scotland as they vary by
      hospital procedural volume.

      Methods

      This research study is a retrospective observational enquiry which will utilise
      administrative data from the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services
      Scotland. Patient episodes will be identified by a procedure codes for appendicectomy. A 10
      year period will be studied, from January 2001 to December 2010.

      Primary outcome measures will be risk-adjusted 30 day/inpatient mortality, 30 day readmission
      rate, 30 day re-operation rate, length of stay and negative appendicectomy rate.

      The aim of this study is to explore the possibility of a hospital volume-outcome relationship
      in Scottish appendicectomy outcomes.

      This is a retrospective study of all appendicectomies performed in Scotland during the period
      from 1st January 2001 - 31st December 2010. It will use routinely collected administrative
      data from the Information Services Division (ISD) of NHS National Services Scotland.

      The registry which will supply the data for this study is the Scottish Morbidity Record 01
      (SMR01), the full title of which is the &quot;General / Acute Inpatient and Day Case dataset&quot; (see
      http://www.adls.ac.uk/nhs-scotland/general-acute-inpatient-day-case-smr01/?detail). SMR01 is
      collated and administered by ISD, and data submission is mandatory for all Scottish NHS
      providers of in-patient or day-case care. Approximately 1.4 million records are added each
      year. Diagnoses are coded according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10
      standards and procedures are coded according to the United Kingdom's Office of Population
      Census Statistics (OPCS) standards, the most recent of which is version 4.5. The data quality
      in SMR01 is high and is assured by regular internal audits. In the 2010 audit of accuracy,
      Main Condition was recorded with an accuracy of 88% and Main Procedure was recorded with an
      accuracy of 94%.

      Where data inconsistencies are identified in the extract supplied for this study, further
      clarification will be obtained where possible with ISD's data retrieval support team. Data
      completeness is very high in SMR01. However, where significant volumes of data are missing or
      unusable, the need for data imputation will be explored.

      The study period was decided on pragmatically by a desire to provide an assessment of current
      practice, fully within the era of widely practised laparoscopic surgery. A power calculation
      also suggested that this would provide an adequate sample size to demonstrate differences.

      Our power calculation- specific to length of stay- was based on Faiz O, Clark J, Brown T,
      Bottle A, Antoniou A, Farrands P, et al. Traditional and Laparoscopic Appendectomy in Adults.
      Ann Surg. 2008 Nov;248(5):800-6. In their cohort of 259,735 appendicectomies performed from
      1996-2006, the geometric mean length of stay was 3.52, with SD 1.8. We decided that a
      difference of 0.5 days would be 'clinically significant'. We specified alpha 0.05 and Power
      0.9, and an allocation ratio of 2 (allowing comparison of one tertile to two others). A
      two-sided t-test of difference between two independent means was performed in G*Power 3.1.7.
      This demonstrated that a total N of 616 was required to demonstrate this difference.
      According to ISD figures, there were 3,712 appendicectomy procedures performed in 2010/11, so
      we will be able to detect a clinically significant difference in length of stay.

      Hospitals will be placed into tertiles of high, medium and low volume, according to the
      number of procedures performed over the study period.

      In the absence of a literature standard appendicectomy outcome measure, the following will be
      assessed as primary outcome measures: 30 day/in-patient mortality, 30 day re-admission rate,
      30 day re-operation rate, post-operative length of stay and negative appendicectomy rates
      between these 3 groups. Potentially significant confounding variables such as age, gender,
      and co-morbidity will be studied for their predictive value in a univariate model and
      included in a multivariate model if they remain significant.
