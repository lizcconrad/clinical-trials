          -  ≥ 9 months after the study index procedure (planned)

          -  Previous intervention was distal to and &gt; 10 mm from the target lesion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a known diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within 72 hours
             preceding the index procedure and CK and CK-MB have not returned within normal limits
             at the time of procedure

          -  Patient is currently experiencing clinical symptoms consistent with AMI

          -  Patient requires the use of any rotablator intervention during the index procedure

          -  Patient has current unstable arrhythmias

          -  Patient has a known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt; 30%

             waiting list for any organ transplant

          -  Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30
             days prior to or after the procedure

          -  Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or
             autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus)

          -  Patient is receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g., heparin, Coumadin) that
             cannot be stopped and restarted according to local hospital standard procedures

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, Novolimus, PLLA polymers or contrast

          -  Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel

          -  Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
