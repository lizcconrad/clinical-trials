  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to demonstrate that tolvaptan effectively and safely increases
      and maintains serum sodium concentrations in children and adolescent subjects with euvolemic
      or hypervolemic hyponatremia.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Issues with subject recruitment &amp; enrolment which made the trial impossible or highly
    impracticable. The termination of this trial is not due to safety reasons.
