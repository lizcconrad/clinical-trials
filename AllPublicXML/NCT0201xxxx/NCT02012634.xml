      Chemotherapy After Standard Adjuvant Chemotherapy in Operable Triple Negative Breast Cancer

      Capecitabine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day (in the
      morning and in the evening) for 2 weeks, followed by a 1 week break before repeating the next
      dosage cycle. In this study, capecitabine will be prescribed as dosage of 900mg/m2, and
      maintain for a whole year after the standard treatment in operable triple negative breast
      cancer patients. DFS is set as the primary outcome, OS and DDFS are also observed as the
      secondary outcomes. Statistical analysis are made to see whether this metronomic therapy of
      capecitabine ( 900mg/m2) will bring benefit to any of the iterms above.
