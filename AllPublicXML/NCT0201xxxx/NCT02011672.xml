  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Recent advances in science have established a fundamental role for low grade
      chronic inflammation in mediating all stages of most of the non-communicable diseases
      associated with ageing. Pro-inflammatory effects of hyperglycemia have been described. Dairy
      and its components are known to exert beneficial effects on postprandial hyperglycemia. This
      study investigates if dairy, normal and enriched, can reduce chronic inflammation via
      improvement in glucose regulation.

      Objective: To compare the effect of a nutrient-enriched dairy drink on parameters of glucose
      regulation and postprandial inflammation with the effect of a standard milk drink, within a
      population of overweight, apparently healthy subjects.

      Study design: The study is designed as a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled parallel
      trial during 7 weeks, during which the test and reference products will be consumed at home.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The difference in absolute change in fasting blood plasma
      concentration of glucose, insulin and IL-6, from baseline to endpoint, and the difference in
      postprandial response of plasma concentration of glucose, insulin and IL-6 at the end of the
      treatment period, between subjects consuming the test and reference product.
