  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to collect the data of vital signs and anesthesia medications administered in a
      subcategory of patients coming for anesthesia for upper GI endoscopy. This data will be
      analyzed to see any relation between the preoperative risk factors, procedure, type of
      anesthesia and the airway intervention. The adverse events that will be automatically
      recorded and later analyzed will be number of apnea episodes (described as no respiration for
      at least 30 seconds) duration of each apnea, number and duration of each desaturation event
      (oxygen saturation as measured by the pulse oximeter). A pulse oximeter saturation of less
      than 93 percent and lasting 30 seconds will be considered as a desaturation event. The airway
      interventions that will be recorded will be anything other than considered being routine.
      This includes LMA insertion, endotracheal intubation and the need to withdraw gastroscope to
      facilitate face mask ventilation. We also propose to monitor their awareness/depth of
      sedation/depth of anesthesia levels. This will be done using a monitor that analyses brain
      waves and gives an idea of sleep (anesthesia) depth. We can then see any correlation between
      any unwanted events and the sleep depth.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All the patients considered as high risk (see above) or undergoing an advanced upper
             GI procedure (see above) will be included. This is the prospective analysis of the
             data that is collected and stored in the monitors. We will be using the massimo Pulse
             oximeter ,masimo acoustic respiratory monitor and Masimo SED line Brain function
             monitors that allows electronic storage and retrieval of information.

          -  Postprocedure analysis of the data will not influence the patient care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient who cannot give a valid consent will be excluded

          -  Children

          -  Pregnant women

          -  Fetuses and/or Neonates

          -  Prisoners
