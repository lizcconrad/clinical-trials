  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either 60 mg of ospemifene (Osphena,
      Shionogi, Florham, NJ) or placebo tablet. Placebo tablets will be identical in appearance and
      packaging will be identical for the two pills. The participants will be instructed to take
      one tablet in the morning with food for twelve weeks. Basic demographic information will be
      obtained on all participants. All women will undergo a pelvic examination, and questionnaires
      regarding pelvic floor dysfunction and sexual function before and three months after
      treatment. 3-D ultrasound with Doppler blood flow analysis will be performed before the
      patient is started on the treatment. 3 months after treatment, the 3-D ultrasound with
      Doppler blood flow analysis will be repeated. Four areas will be measured:

        1. The urethra in exactly the same section at the same level with the same setups.

        2. 3 and 9 O'clock position

        3. 6 o'clock position

        4. Clitoral blood flow Doppler blood flow will be visualized using the Doppler color mode
           of the ultrasound machine and will be applied for the assessment of the vascularity
           pattern. Additionally, we will record a film with the use of Color Doppler in a video
           file. The transducer will be immobilized at one selected section and record a ten
           seconds of film. This film will be further analyzed in special software called Pixel
           flux after the examination. Dr. Pawel Wieczorek and Dr. Magdalena Wozniak will read
           these deidentified video files in a randomized fashion based on their previous research
           experience with similar video interpretations of pelvic color Doppler imaging [8-11].
