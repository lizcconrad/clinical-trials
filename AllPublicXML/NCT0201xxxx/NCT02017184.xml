    <textblock>
      Soldiers are required to perform and maintain alertness in difficult environmental
      conditions. The sensor examined in this trail may indicate body core temperature elevation
      during exertion. 12 male volunteers will arrive to our lab and perform a protocol of sitting
      and walking in thermoneutral and hot environments with two core temperature sensors. The
      results obtained from them will be compared.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the protocol the volunteers will sit in thermoneutral condition for 30 minutes, than
      they will sit in hot chamber (40 celsius and 40% relative humidity). Afterwards, the
      participants will walk on a treadmill in 5 km/hr and 4% incline for one hour. The
      participants will be connected to rectal thermistor which is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot;
      and to the new noninvasive sensor which is attached to the skin surface.
