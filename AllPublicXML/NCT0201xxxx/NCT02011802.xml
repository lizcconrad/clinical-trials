  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sinus pilonidal concern 26/100 000 young adults. It manifests after puberty, presenting as an
      acute abscess in approximately 50% of patients or as a discharging painful sinus. Patients
      may experience lengthy healing times resulting in considerable morbidity and disruption to a
      young adult's life. Eradication of pilonidal sinus is based on a wide surgical excision and
      at the end of the procedure, the wound is dressed with an alginate dressing (Algosteril®).

      The objective is to show a better efficiency of Sorbact TM (trademark) dressings compared to
      Alginates that are standardized dressings after pilonidal sinus excision during a period of
      75 days. The main objective is to show a difference of 20% of wounds completely healed in 75
      days between the two types of dressing: 50% of wounds healed with Algosteril TM compared to
      70% of wounds healed with Sorbact TM.

    <description>Calcium alginate dressings are made from seaweed. Calcium alginate dressings form a natural gel of the exudates against the healing tissue that keeps it moist and supple, aiding in healing and tissue growth. In addition, this gel material forms a natural barrier to bacteria that may complicate healing with secondary infections of the wound. Alginates are the reference of dressing after sinus pilonidal excision.</description>

    <description>DACC (dialkylcarbamoyle chloride) is a main component of the bacterial binding wound dressing: Sorbact. DACC is a hydrophobic fatty acid derivative that can be used to coat dressing materials, resulting in a dressing with highly hydrophobic pathogen binding properties. This is a primary wound interface dressing and is effective when in close contact with the wound bed in a moist environment.</description>
