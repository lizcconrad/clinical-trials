      Purpose: To examine the impact of a personal health record (PHR) on medication use safety
      among older adults.

      Background: Online PHRs have potential as tools to manage health information. We know little
      about how to make PHRs accessible for older adults and what effects this will have.

      Methods: A PHR was designed and pretested with older adults and tested in a six-month
      randomized controlled trial. After completing mailed baseline questionnaires, eligible
      computer users aged 65 and over were randomized 3:1 to be given access to a PHR (n=802) or
      serve as a standard care control group (n=273). Follow-up questionnaires measured change from
      baseline medication use, medication reconciliation behaviors, and medication management
      problems.

    <description>Iowa PHR is a Web-based application that features a tabbed interface design. Users can enter, view, and print their current and past medicines, allergies, health conditions, and health event tracking over time. An embedded tutorial video provides assistance with the system. The PHR was developed and refined using participatory design and focus group sessions as well as evaluation in a usability laboratory. The resulting design emphasizes the reduction of physical and cognitive demands on users, focusing on simplicity, readability, and quick navigation.
Iowa PHR displayed a message when a user entered a medication with an associated Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders project (ACOVE‐3) safety concern. This included 16 safety issues for 12 drugs or drug classes with safety concerns. We also adapted four general medication use patient safety indicators from the ACOVE project and displayed them to all users on a rotating basis upon login.</description>
