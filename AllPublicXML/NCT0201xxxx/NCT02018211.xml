  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous techniques are reported to enhance recovery following intense exercise, however
      there is equivocal support for such claims. A novel technique of neuromuscular electrical
      stimulation (NMES) via the peroneal nerve has been shown to augment limb blood flow which
      could enhance recovery following exercise. The present study examined the effects of NMES,
      compared to graduated compression socks on muscle soreness, strength, and markers of muscle
      damage and inflammation following intense intermittent exercise.

    <description>All participants performed a modified version of the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test (LIST; Nicholas et al, 2000), an exercise protocol designed to simulate the activity pattern characteristics of intermittent sports such as soccer. The LIST was performed on three occasions, at the same time of day, each separated by approximately four weeks. Following each exercise trial, one of three recovery interventions were applied, the order of which were randomly allocated.</description>
