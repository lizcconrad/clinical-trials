    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are the most common forms of dementia.
      Yet, the cause of these diseases is still unknown. A potentially important initiating factor
      is a disrupted blood-brain barrier. This can initiate cerebral microangiopathy, which has
      frequently been associated with VaD. Nevertheless, also in most AD patients a substantial
      increase of vascular damage has been observed. The present study investigates the correlation
      between blood-brain-barrier breakdown and cognitive decline in AD and VaD. An innovative
      dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan that has recently been developed and tested at our
      institute, will be used to measure blood-brain barrier permeability.

      Objective: We will investigate the relationship between this permeability measure and (i)
      cognitive performance and (ii) the status of MRI visible cerebrovascular pathology (i.e.
      white matter hyperintensities, lacunar infarctions, microbleeds) in the most common forms of
      dementia.

        To obtain variation in macrovascular pathology and cognitive outcome measures, patients
        with AD, VaD, mixed AD and VaD, mild cognitive impairment (due to AD), vascular cognitive
        impairment and subjective cognitive impairment will be included. The total number of
        patients is 120, approximately 20 patients per disorder category as mentioned above. The
        patients will be recruited from the memory clinic of the Maastricht University Medical
        Center. Also a group of 20 age-matched healthy controls will be included. The total number
        of participants is thus 140.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients:

          -  Informed consent before participation in the study

          -  Age of 55 and older

          -  Diagnosed with AD, VaD, mixed AD and VaD, mild cognitive impairment, vascular
             cognitive impairment and subjective cognitive impairment

          -  MMSE ≥ 20 and patients are mentally competent (in general, individuals with an MMSE
             ≥18 are considered mentally competent)

        Healthy participants:

          -  Informed consent before participation in the study

          -  Age of 55 and older

          -  No Diagnosis of dementia, prodromal dementia, or mild cognitive impairment.

          -  MMSE ≥ 26

          -  No substantial memory complaints (according to participant)

          -  Average age, gender and education is similar to the patient groups.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contraindications for scanning (e.g. brain surgery, cardiac pacemaker, metal implants,
             claustrophobia, large body tattoos)

          -  Contraindications for contrast agent Gadovist (renal failure) as determined by the
             estimated Glomular Filtration Rate eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min; or known allergy to Gadovist. If
             participants have a low renal function as determined by &lt;30 GFR &lt;60, the PI will
             contact a radiologist (Paul Hofman). The radiologist will decide if this patient
             should be excluded.

          -  Major vascular disorders (e.g. stroke, heart disease)

          -  Psychiatric or neurological disorders: Major depression (&lt; 12 months); history of
             schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; psychotic disorder NOS or treatment for a psychotic
             disorder (&lt; 12 mnd); cognitive impairment due to alcohol abuse; epilepsy; Parkinson's
             disease; MS; brain surgery; brain trauma; electroshock therapy; kidney dialysis;
             Meniere's disease; and brain infections.

          -  Structural abnormalities of the brain

          -  Cognitive impairment due to alcohol/drug abuse or abuse of other substances.

          -  Absence of reliable informant (for patient groups)
