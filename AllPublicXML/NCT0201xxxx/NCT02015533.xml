      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics (what the body does to the
      drug) and immunogenicity (ability of a particular substance to provoke an immune response in
      the human body) of CR8020 in japanese healthy participants

      This study is a randomized (study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives),
      placebo-controlled (placebo comparator is compared with the study medication to evaluate
      safety profile of the study medication in clinical study), single-dose study in Japanese
      healthy adult male participants. The study will include screening phase (28 to 2 days prior
      to the study medication administration), treatment phase (Study medication will be
      administered on Day 1), and follow-up phase (up to 99 days). Twelve participants will be
      randomly assigned to CR8020 50 mg/kg or placebo groups in a 2:1 ratio and receive an assigned
      treatment on Day 1. Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events, clinical laboratory
      tests, 12-lead Electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination. Total maximum
      duration of participation of an individual participant will be 127 days.
