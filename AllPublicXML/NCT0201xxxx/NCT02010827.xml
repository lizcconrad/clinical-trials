  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We want to investigate how lack of glucagon suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test
      in patients with type 2 diabetes contributes to patients postprandial hyperglycemia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are not able to suppress their glucagon
      secretion after a meal or after ingestion of glucose. Previous studies have shown that
      gastrointestinal hormones might play a role in this phenomenon. However, it has not yet been
      possible to determine whether this lack of glucagon suppression postprandially results in an
      increased endogenous glucose secretion, and thus is a factor in the patients postprandial
      hyperglycemia.

      We aim to perform oral glucose tolerance tests and isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusions
      with and without a continuous glucagon infusion in patients with T2DM and healthy control
      subjects. The glucagon infusion is aiming at copying the inappropriate &quot;physiological&quot;
      glucagon response observed in patients with T2DM.
