  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Aim: This randomised controlled trial will systematically compare the efficacy of a 25%
           AgNO3 solution followed by 5% NaF varnish with that of a 38% SDF solution in arresting
           caries teeth among preschool children when applied at half-yearly intervals over a
           30-month period.

        -  Method: The extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 Statement
           will be followed for this 30-month, randomised, double-blinded, non-inferiority clinical
           trial. Approximately 2,400 kindergarten children will be screened and at least 826
           children with caries will be recruited. This sample size is sufficient for an
           appropriate statistical analysis (power at 90% [β=0.10] with a 2-sided type-I error of
           α=0.05), allowing for a 18% drop-out rate. The children will be randomly allocated into
           2 groups to treat their caries over a 30-month period: Group A - biannual application of
           a 25% AgNO3 solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish, and Group B - biannual application of
           a 38% SDF solution followed by a placebo varnish.Clinical examinations will be conducted
           at 6-month intervals to assess whether the caries are arrested. Information on
           confounding factors such as oral hygiene habits will be collected through a parental
           questionnaire.

        -  Possible results and implications: As the first of its kind, this study would help to
           determine whether AgNO3 followed by NaF is at least as effective as SDF in arresting
           childhood caries. If so, because 25% AgNO3 and 5% NaF contain less silver and fluoride,
           respectively, than 38% SDF, their use would be more favourable than SDF in young
           children.
