  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acupuncture is widely used for managing acute and chronic pain conditions. In the context of
      an emergency department (ED), patients often present with non-emergent acute pain symptoms.
      This may result in a delayed triage process and inefficient emergent management. An
      integrative patient-care approach in emergency departments has been explored that may improve
      patient satisfaction and promote efficient use of healthcare resources for non-emergent
      patients in the ED. This implies there is a potential role for acupuncture in such contexts.
      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture as an
      add-on intervention for patients with non-emergent acute musculoskeletal pain and primary
      headaches in an ED setting.

      Hypotheses of this study are as follows:

        1. A single session of add-on acupuncture, with standard ED management, can reduce pain
           levels in non-emergent acute pain, compared to standard ED management alone.

        2. A single session of add-on acupuncture to standard ED management can reduce additional
           consumption of healthcare resources for management of non-emergent acute pain, compared
           to standard ED management alone.

      This study aimed to include 40 participants, 20 in the acupuncture plus standard ED
      management group and 20 in the standard ED management alone group.

    <description>Radiographic and physical examinations to exclude fractures or other serious conditions will be performed for all patients before considering eligibility in the study. After completion of the examination, patients who have pain of at least a level 4, as measured by the Wong-Baker scale (ranges 0 to 10), will receive intravenous or intramuscular injections of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for immediate pain control. All patients will be observed 30 minutes after the administration of the NSAIDs. In patients with primary headaches who respond poorly to the initial NSAID injection, an intravenous injection of opioid analgesics will be provided. After these initial standard ED management interventions, patients who are still suffering from acute pain will be asked to participate in the trial. During the study, rescue medication for immediate pain control will be allowed for patients allocated to both groups.</description>
