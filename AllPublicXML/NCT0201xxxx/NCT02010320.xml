  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dosing of tacrolimus is challenging due to the large inter-individual variation in its
      pharmacokinetics. The investigators have developed a pharmacokinetics population model that
      can be used to estimate individual doses of tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients. The
      model will be prospective tested in a randomized clinical trial.

      The hypothesis is that the computer model is superior to experienced transplant physicians in
      reaching and keeping the patients in the target range of tacrolimus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be randomized to either computer or standard dosing strategies at time of
      transplantation or as early after transplantation as possible in case of deceased donor
      transplants.

      For patients in the computer arm the model will calculate the dose with the highest
      probability to reach the specified concentration target.

      For all concentrations a predictive error will be calculated and this will be the primary
      endpoint that the statistics will be calculated on.

      All patients will be followed for between 8 to 12 weeks post-transplant, according to center
      praxis.

    <description>Predictive error will be calculated as the computer predicted concentration minus the measured concentration over the first 8 to 12 weeks post-transplant in the computer group. The calculations will be binned into weekly assessments.</description>

    <measure>Influence of CYP3A5 genotyping</measure>
    <time_frame>8 to 12 weeks post-transplant</time_frame>
    <description>The model will be run without any information about patients CYP3A5 genotype as this is not clinical praxis at our center yet. All patients will however be genotyped after the study and a model including this covariate will be used to recalculate the data and see if this model is superior to the simple model, primary by comparing predictive errors in the computer arm.</description>
