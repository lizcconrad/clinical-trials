  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An isolated bout of unaccustomed maximal eccentric exercise is associated with muscle force
      loss for 2-4 days, mild reversible muscle tenderness, and ultra-structural damage to the
      muscle fibers, elevation of muscle proteins in serum, and a detriment in range of motion.
      This single center, pilot study is designed to optimize conditions for the robust measurement
      of functional deficits after muscle damage and to identify markers of repair over 22 days to
      inform future intervention studies. The primary measure will be limb force (assessed
      electronically from the ergometer), previous studies have demonstrated that functional
      measures return fairly rapidly, usually between 2-4 days. Additionally, several biomarkers of
      muscle function will be measured over 22 days, as well as changes in protein synthesis in
      biopsy samples Deuterium-labelled water (D2O) will be consumed by all study participants from
      Day-3 through Day 22 to aid in quantifying newly synthesized proteins.
