      The Family Hypercholesterolemia remains poorly diagnosed disease with an outlet sometimes
      suboptimal care. However, the Family Hypercholesterolemia exposes patients concerned at
      increased cardiovascular risk.

      The frequency of familial hypercholesterolemia in cardiologic is little studied and remains
      unknown, and there is little data on the profile of patients, diagnostic methods and
      management.

      Main objectives:

        -  Establish a monitoring patients with hypercholesterolemia Family cardiology in France

        -  Characterize the Family hypercholesterolemia in cardiology, including assessing the
           frequency of the most severe forms, which are at higher cardiovascular risk.

        The study is proposed to cardiology services hospitals. Aged 18 or more, seen in cardiology
        (USIC, Hospitalization, Consultation), who agreed to participate in the observatory, and
        coronary patients who have LDL-c levels

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  coronary patients

          -  who agreed to participate

          -  high LDL-c levels: * LDL-c&gt; = 1.9g / l without lipid lowering treatment according to
             the diagnostic score of Family Hypercholesterolemia these coronary patients with LDL&gt;
             1.9g / l may possibly or probably be achieved Hypercholesterolemia Family.

        or

        * LDL-c&gt; = 1.6g / l in lipid-lowering treatment, the reduction of LDL-c average expected
        under standard lipid-lowering therapy (statin alone) being 30-40% of these patients had
        therefore pretreatment levels greater than 2 g / l or greater than 2.5 g / l and may
        possibly or probably be achieved Family Hypercholesterolemia after the diagnostic score.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Expressed refusal to participate in the observatory
