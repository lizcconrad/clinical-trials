  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and disability in young
      adults. Patients can experience significant problems with concentration, attention, and
      memory (so called 'cognitive impairments') following TBI. These cognitive impairments can
      drastically impact on a patient's well-being, and can lead to significant economic and social
      consequences. Roughly a quarter of TBI patients improve but an equal number deteriorate over
      time. The investigators know little about why patients vary so much in how they recover.
      Crucially, the investigators have no treatments to improve brain functioning or recovery
      after TBI.

      Trials investigating ways of protecting the brain just after injury have been disappointing.
      An alternative strategy, however, is to improve the function of brain regions that remain
      intact, but that function inefficiently after TBI. The investigators know that dopamine (a
      chemical in the brain) is known to influence many brain functions and the investigators know
      that pathways in the brain that use dopamine are affected by TBI.

      In humans, drugs that increase dopamine in the brain, such as methylphenidate, are sometimes
      used to enhance cognitive function after TBI, but the response to treatment can be highly
      variable between patients. Therefore, what is needed in the clinic is a way to target the use
      of these drugs to patients who are likely to respond.

      In a single centre study, the investigators will use SPECT (Single Photon Emission
      Tomography) imaging to measure dopamine levels in the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
      scans will assess brain structure and function. The investigators will test whether treatment
      with methylphenidate improves cognitive functions in TBI patients who have ongoing cognitive
      problems, whether the mechanism involves a normalisation of brain functioning and whether
      brain dopamine levels can predict the magnitude of any improvement in symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  a diagnosis of a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (as defined by the Mayo TBI
             severity classification system) at least 3 months prior to recruitment into the study

          -  age between 20 and 65 years

          -  capable of giving written informed consent subjective complaint of cognitive
             difficulties by the participant, treating clinician, or caregiver

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  unwillingness or inability to follow the procedures required

          -  significant neurological or psychiatric illness diagnosed prior to the TBI

             screening

          -  use of any medication or substance that, in the opinion of the investigators, would
             interfere with the study or compromise participant safety

          -  history of a drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigators,
