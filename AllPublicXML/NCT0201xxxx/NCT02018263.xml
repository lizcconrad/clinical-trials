    <textblock>
      This study looks to explore the feasibility, sensitivity, validity, and specificity of a
      Remote Wireless Sensor Network (RWSN) approach to the detection of cocaine use/intoxication
      in the inpatient human laboratory, as well as in the outpatient setting (&quot;real world&quot;).
      Lastly, we look to design an algorithm for reliably detecting cocaine use in real-world
      settings and inference techniques for understanding the relationship between cocaine use and
      user contexts.

          4. DSM-IV criteria for Cocaine Abuse (305.60) or Cocaine Dependence (304.20)

          5. recent street cocaine use in excess of amounts to be administered in the current
             study,

          6. intravenous and/or smoked (crack/ freebase) use,

          7. positive urine toxicology screen for cocaine,

          8. for females, non-lactating, no longer of child-bearing potential (or agree to practice
             effective contraception during the study), and a negative serum pregnancy (β-HCG)
             test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Other drug dependence (except nicotine) as determined by urine toxicology or interview

          2. &lt; 1 year of cocaine dependence,

          3. a primary major DSM-IV psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc.),
             unrelated to cocaine,

          4. a history of significant medical (cardiovascular) or neurological illness, ie prior
             myocardial infarction, current active symptoms of cardiovascular disease / angina,
             evidence of cocaine-related cardiovascular symptoms, prior arrhythmias or need for
             cardiov ascular resuscitation, neurovascular events such as transient ischemic
             attacks, stroke, and/or seizures Parameters re: elevations in vital signs are now
             explicitly specified under &quot;Safety features built into our one-day self-administration
             paradigm).

          5. current use of psychotropic and/or potentially psychoactive prescription medication,

          6. seeking treatment for drug abuse/dependence (for experimental cocaine component),

          7. physical or laboratory (β-HCG) evidence of pregnancy.

          8. current use of any medication (prescription or over-the-counter) determined to cause
             potential drug interactions by the study physicians.
