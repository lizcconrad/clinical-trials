  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the comparative effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability
      of two telemonitoring interventions in reducing blood pressure and recurrent stroke among 450
      high-risk Black and Hispanic stroke patients. The primary hypothesis is that home blood
      pressure telemonitoring supplemented with individualized, culturally tailored telephone-based
      nurse case management will have greater effects on blood pressure reduction and stroke
      recurrence and, while it will be more costly, it will also be more cost-effective than home
      blood pressure telemonitoring alone. Results of this study will provide strong empirical
      evidence to inform clinical guidelines and practice, which may lead to reductions in stroke
      disparities in the United States.

    <description>Participants will take home BP readings 3 days per week (morning and evening), one week out of every month for 12 months. BP readings will be transmitted wirelessly to a secure server. Patients' physicians will receive home BP reports via secure email before every scheduled appointment for the duration of the study to facilitate necessary treatment intensification and medication adjustments.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete 20 counseling phone calls with a nurse case manager (NCM) during the 12-month intervention: weekly calls for Months 1-2; biweekly calls for Months 3-4; and monthly calls for Months 5-12. The NCMs will provide self-management education, medication and appointment reminders, and will facilitate patient-provider communication. They will counsel patients on specific self-management behaviors using problem solving and motivational interviewing techniques. Target behaviors will include dietary changes, physical activity, weight loss, medication adherence, and smoking cessation. NCMs will also review patients' clinical information and provide feedback about abnormal lab results, and will communicate with the patient's physician as needed (e.g., regarding barriers).</description>
