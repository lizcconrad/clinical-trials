Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring on or after the first treatment of the study medication and within 28 days after the last dose.</description>

Severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0): 1= Mild 2= Moderate 3= Severe 4= Life-threatening and 5= Death related to AE. Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring on or after the first treatment of the study medication and within 28 days after the last dose.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
          <description>Relation to study drug was assessed by the Investigator as either suspected or not suspected. Counts represent the suspected relationship. Severity was assessed using National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE v4.0): 1= Mild 2= Moderate 3= Severe 4= Life-threatening and 5= Death related to AE. Serious AEs (SAEs) were those that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly, or resulted in an important medical event that may have jeopardized the patient or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) was defined as any AE occurring on or after the first treatment of the study medication and within 28 days after the last dose.</description>
