  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to prove the superior performance of the Ranger™
      paclitaxel-coated PTA balloon catheter for angioplasty for femoropopliteal artery lesions
      when compared to non-coated balloons at six months post-procedure when comparing Late Lumen
      Loss (LLL). Study statistical hypothesis: The %-mean loss of luminal diameter as assessed by
      angiography at six months follow-up after treatment of the femoropopliteal artery with Ranger
      DCB study devices is lower than the %-mean loss of luminal diameter after treatment with
      uncoated PTA balloon control devices.
