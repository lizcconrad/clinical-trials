    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a new combination therapy
      for actinic keratosis. This study investigates a new indication for an FDA-approved topical
      medication, calcipotriol, for treatment of actinic keratosis, including how well it works and
      how safe it is when used in combination with the standard of care medication (5-fluorouracil)
      for the skin condition.

    <measure>percentage of change in the number of actinic keratoses from baseline</measure>

    <description>To compare the efficacy of topical 5-fluorouracil+calcipotriol vs. 5-fluorouracil alone in treatment of actinic keratosis in patients with multiple actinic keratoses at each of the four anatomical sites (scalp, face, right upper extremity and left upper extremity). The outcome of interest is percentage change from baseline number of actinic keratoses in the target treatment area on scalp, face, right upper extremity and left upper extremity at 8 weeks after treatment.</description>

             keratoses in 25 cm2 on any of the four anatomical sites: scalp, face, right upper
             extremity and left upper extremity

          -  Ability and willingness of the patient to participate in the study (Informed consent
