      Primary Phase I:To determine dose limiting toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the
      oral administration of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in conjunction with transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE) in treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A conventional 3+3
      design will be utilized. Primary Phase II: To evaluate the complete response rate in a cohort
      of patients treated at the MTD, A Simon's Optimal Two-stage design will be utilized.
