      Non invasive methods: maternal antithyroid antibodies and ultrasound measurement of the fetal
      thyroid gland could be an important tool for detecting fetal thyroid dysfunction in mothers
      with autoimmune thyroid disease.

      Autoimmune thyroid disease complicates 5-20% unselected pregnancies. The crucial impacting
      factor on the pregnancy outcomes in mothers with autoimmune thyroid disease is the thyroxine
      level changes.

      But, fetal hypo or hyperthyroidism can be found in treated pregnant women with autoimmune
      thyroid disease, even when their thyroid hormones are in normal range, because thyroid
      antibodies, antithyroid drugs and iodine pass the placenta.

      Our previous results show that high fetal free thyroxine (fT4) levels measured by
      cordocentesis are unexpectedly frequent in women with autoimmune thyroid disease, including
      maternal autoimmune hypo- and hyperthyroidism. Increasing awareness that even some mild fetal
      disorder can have an impact on later neurophysiologic development and the health of an
      individual makes the recognition and therapy of fetal hypo- or hyperthyroidism an
      increasingly significant domain of interest. According to our results, fetal fT4
      concentrations did not correlate neither with dose of medication nor with ultrasound
      biometric parameters; the range for maternal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) correlated
      predominantly with normal fT4 can not be marked off. The type and concentration of
      antithyroid antibodies might have some prognostic value.

      There is a growing list of publications referring to the ultrasound measurement of the fetal
      thyroid as an important tool for detecting fetal thyroid dysfunction. Fetal thyroid
      measurement became a part of the clinical guidelines for pregnancies complicated with
      maternal thyroid disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women diagnosed and treated for autoimmune hyper or hypothyroidism: - Disease
             diagnosed by an endocrinologist, based on clinical and laboratory tests and ultrasound
             thyroid examination.

          -  All of the hyper or hypothyroid women have to be positive for one or both thyroid
             antibodies when entering the study.

          -  Patients with autoimmune thyroid disease will be included into the study in the first
             half of pregnancy, but not later than 20th weeks of gestation

          -  For the pregnant women in control group:

          -  if they are euthyroid, with antithyroid antibodies within reference range, healthy and
             have uncomplicated pregnancy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with chronic diseases (except for thyroid disease) in their past medical
             history record. Pregnancy induced diseases are not a part of the exclusion criteria
             (gestational diabetes and pregnancy induced hypertension)

          -  all the patients whose pregnancies resulted from assisted reproductive technologies
             will be excluded from the study.

          -  mothers from the control group will be excluded, if the neonate have abnormal thyroid
             function
