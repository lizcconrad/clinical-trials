  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cattle less than 10% of the embryos develop to the blastocyst stage when embryos are
      cultured individually, however when bovine embryos are cultured in groups a typical 25-35% of
      blastocysts can be observed. This tendency, i.e. improved embryo development in group
      culture, has also been demonstrated in other mammalian species, such as mouse, cat and human.
      The main reason for this beneficial outcome of group culture has been ascribed to the
      presence of autocrine factors, which are factors secreted by preimplantation embryos that act
      upon the embryo itself or the neighboring embryos .

      Although group culture systems are common in in vitro production systems for animal embryos,
      it is rarely done in human settings, where individual follow-up of the embryo during the
      whole culture period is of utmost importance. Recently a CE-labelled culture device has been
      designed for human embryos, that allow to combine the benefits of both group culture
      approaches and individual culture. The WOW dish is commercially available by Primo Vision and
      consists of 9 small microwells on the bottom of the plate, so that the embryos can be
      cultivated individually in a microwell, but covered by the same drop of culture medium.

      In this clinical randomized trial, 158 patients will be included of which half of the
      fertilized oocytes will be cultured individually (standard culture system) and half of the
      fertilized oocytes will be cultured in group in a WOW dish, both during five days of culture.
      The aim of this study is to increase the number of blastocysts suitable for transfer or
      cryopreservation by culturing the embryos in WOW dishes.
