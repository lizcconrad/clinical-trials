    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Total Fingernail Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) 75 Response at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Each fingernail was assessed for psoriasis with mNAPSI, and the scores of all 10 fingernails were combined. Investigators assessed each nail abnormality for each of a participant's nails by grading 3 features or groups of features (pitting, onycholysis and oil-drop dyschromia, and crumbling) and noting the presence or absence of 4 features (leukonychia, splinter hemorrhages, hyperkeratosis, and red spots in the lunula). The range of possible scores was 0 to 130, with a score of 0 indicating absence of nail psoriasis and a score of 130 indicating the most severe nail psoriasis. A decrease in mNAPSI score indicates improvement. The mNAPSI 75 response is defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in mNAPSI.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Total Fingernail Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) 75 Response at Week 26</title>
        <description>Each fingernail was assessed for psoriasis with mNAPSI, and the scores of all 10 fingernails were combined. Investigators assessed each nail abnormality for each of a participant's nails by grading 3 features or groups of features (pitting, onycholysis and oil-drop dyschromia, and crumbling) and noting the presence or absence of 4 features (leukonychia, splinter hemorrhages, hyperkeratosis, and red spots in the lunula). The range of possible scores was 0 to 130, with a score of 0 indicating absence of nail psoriasis and a score of 130 indicating the most severe nail psoriasis. A decrease in mNAPSI score indicates improvement. The mNAPSI 75 response is defined as at least 75% reduction from baseline in mNAPSI.</description>

        <description>The PGA-F is a 5-point scale used to assess fingernails separately for nail bed signs and nail matrix signs of disease. A global score of between 0 indicating clear, and 4 indicating severe, was separately assigned for nail bed involvement and nail matrix involvement. A participant's overall global score was the worse of the nail bed and nail matrix score. Data presents the percentage of participants with a PGA-F overall global score that met the definition of “clear” (0) or “minimal&quot; (1) with at least a 2-grade improvement relative to Baseline at Week 26.</description>

The participant rated the severity of fingernail pain over the past 7 days on a scale from 0 indicating no pain, to 10 indicating severe pain. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement.</description>

The score ranges from 0 to 72, with 0 indicating no psoriasis and 72 indicating very severe psoriasis. PASI-75, 50, 90, and 100 responses are the percentage of participants with a Baseline PASI score ≥ 5 who achieved at least a 75%, 50%, 90%, or 100% reduction (improvement), respectively, from Baseline in PASI score at Week 26. A 100% reduction was considered complete clearance of psoriasis. Data presents the percentage of participants achieving PASI 75/50/90/100 responses at Week 26 among participants with a Baseline PASI score ≥ 5.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving PASI 75/50/90/100 Responses at Week 26</title>
          <description>PASI is a composite score based on the degree of effect on body surface area of psoriasis and the extension of erythema (reddening), induration (plaque thickness), desquamation (scaling) of the lesions and area affected as observed on the day of examination. The score ranges from 0 to 72, with 0 indicating no psoriasis and 72 indicating very severe psoriasis. PASI-75, 50, 90, and 100 responses are the percentage of participants with a Baseline PASI score ≥ 5 who achieved at least a 75%, 50%, 90%, or 100% reduction (improvement), respectively, from Baseline in PASI score at Week 26. A 100% reduction was considered complete clearance of psoriasis. Data presents the percentage of participants achieving PASI 75/50/90/100 responses at Week 26 among participants with a Baseline PASI score ≥ 5.</description>

A decrease in B-SNIPI score indicates improvement. Data presents the percentage of participants achieving 50% improvement in the inverse component of the B-SNIPI among participants with a Baseline inverse psoriasis score of ≥ 6.</description>
          <population>ITT Population in Period A: all participants who were randomized at Baseline and had Baseline inverse psoriasis score ≥ 6. Inverse psoriasis was assessed for participants enrolled under Protocol Amendment 1 in the US and Puerto Rico only. Multiple imputation.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Body Surface Area (BSA) at Week 26</title>
        <description>BSA affected by psoriasis was measured by the physician selecting the participant's right or left hand as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus 5 digits was to be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1% BSA. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the physician was aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimated the total area involved. A decrease in BSA affected by psoriasis indicates improvement.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Nail Psoriasis (WPAI:NPSO) at Week 26</title>
        <description>The WPAI: NPSO assessed impact of fingernail psoriasis on work productivity and non-work activity limitation. Participants were asked during the past 7 days, how many hours did you miss from work because of problems associated with your fingernail psoriasis (absenteeism), during the past seven days, how many hours did you miss from work because of any other reason, such as vacation, holidays, time off to participate in this study (presenteeism), how much did your fingernail psoriasis affect your productivity while you were working (overall work impairment), and much did your fingernail psoriasis affect your ability to do your regular daily activities, other than work at a job (activity impairment). Answers were rated on an 11-point scale, with 0 indicating &quot;fingernail psoriasis had no effect on this&quot; and 10 indicating &quot;fingernail psoriasis completely prevented me from this.&quot; A decrease in the WPAI:NPSO score indicates improvement.</description>

        <description>The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the subject's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. A unique EQ-5D-5L health state is defined by combining the numeric level scores for each of the 5 dimensions and the total score is normalized from –0.594 to 1.000, with higher scores representing a better health state. An increase in the EQ-5D-5L total score indicates improvement.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) at Week 26</title>
          <description>Participants rated their anxiety and depression over the past 7 days at Week 26. The range of possible scores was 0 to 21, with a score of 0 indicating absence of anxiety and depression and 21 indicating the most severe anxiety and depression. A decrease in HADS score indicates improvement.</description>
