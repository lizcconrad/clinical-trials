    <textblock>
      The present project is a multicenter, phase II trial which aims at evaluating if the
      administration of azacytidine (Vidaza®) combined to donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) could
      improve the response rate to DLI in the population of patients with relapsed acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation.

    <description>Azacytidine will be administered subcutaneously for 5 days. During the first cycle, a dose of 100mg/m2/day will be used and for the following cycles a dose of 35mg/m2/day will be administered. Each cycle will consist in 28 days. All patients will receive at least 6 cycles of Azacytidine and the total number of cycles will depend on the response to treatment.
Donor lymphocyte infusion will be performed on day 1 of cycle 2, 4 and 6 of Azacytidine. The amount of cells infused will depend on donor origin.</description>

    <description>On day 1 of cycle 2, 4 and 6 of Azacytidine, patients will be infused with donor lymphocytes (ideally on day 1 but in case of organizational problems, DLI can be administered until day 5) .
Patients with a sibling donor will receive:
5x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 2
5x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 4
10x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 6
Patients with an unrelated donor will receive:
1x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 2
5x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 4
10x10exp7 CD3+/kg on day 1 of cycle 6</description>

    <description>Cycle 1: Subcutaneous administration of 100mg/m2/day for 5 days.
Cycle 2: Subcutaneous administration of 35mg/m2/day for 5 days. Cycles will be administered every 28 days.
All patients will receive at least 6 cycles of Azacytidine except if progression requests additional disease-related treatment such as hydroxyurea or other chemotherapeutic agents. In such cases, the patient will be excluded from the study and only disease status and survival status will be reported during the 3-year follow-up period. In case of complete remission after cycle 5, 2 additional cycles will be administered after achievement of complete remission.
In case of stable disease or partial response, Azacytidine will be continued until progression.
In case of disease progression after cycle 6, Azacytidine will be stopped.</description>

               -  Allogeneic transplantation using a sibling or unrelated donor with matching in
                  10/10 alleles (HLA-A, B, C, DRB1, DQB1) or maximum of one allele or one antigen
                  or 1 antigen + 1 allele or 1 antigen + 1 DQB1 antigen or 2 alleles mismatches.

               -  Myeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning

               -  Second transplantation is allowed

               -  Donor is willing to donate lymphocytes

          4. Clinical situation:

               -  Cytological relapse after allo-SCT defined as the recurrence of more than 5%

                  (such as MLL-PTD, AML-ETO, CBFB-MYH11) are.

          5. Immunosuppressive therapy should have been stopped before inclusion.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  More than 30% marrow blasts at the time of inclusion
