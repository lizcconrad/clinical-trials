    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate if Complete Decongestive Therapy is equally
      effective whether it includes manual lymphatic drainage or not in the treatment of
      lymphoedema among patients with breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical therapy treatment of patients with lymphoedema includes treatment based on the
      principles of 'Complete Decongestive Therapy' (CDT). CDT consists of following components;
      skin care, manual lymphatic drainage, bandaging and exercises. Regarding what type of
      treatment of treatments is most effective, the scientific evidence is sparse. Studies have
      focused on the time-consuming manual lymphatic drainage, but the scientific evidence is not
      consistent.

      A randomized, single-blind, equivalence trial. A total of 160 breast cancer patients with
      lymphoedema will be recruited from 3 hospitals and randomised into one of two treatment
      groups: A: Complete Decongestive TherapyA (incl. manual drainage) or B: Complete Decongestive
      TherapyB (except manual lymphatic drainage
