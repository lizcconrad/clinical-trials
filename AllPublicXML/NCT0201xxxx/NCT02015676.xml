  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will define an optimal chemotherapy dose regimen of Myocet in combination with
      paclitaxel and intravenous Herceptin and will evaluate the efficacy and safety of this dose
      regimen in patients with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer and HER2
      overexpression. The anticipated time on study treatment is 3-12 months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving Complete Response (CR) or Partial Response (PR) According to World Health Organization (WHO) Handbook for Reporting Results of Cancer Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (BL), Weeks 7, 13, 19, every 8 weeks thereafter until end of study (for up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>For measurable disease, CR was defined as the disappearance of all clinically detectable disease determined by 2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart; and PR was defined as a 50 percent (%) decrease in the sum of the products of the 2 greatest diameters of all measurable lesions by 2 observations not less than 4 weeks apart, and no appearance of new lesions or progression of any lesion. For immeasurable disease, CR was defined as the complete disappearance of all known disease for at least 4 weeks; and PR was defined as an estimated decrease in tumor size of 50% or more for at least 4 weeks.</description>

    <time_frame>BL, Weeks 7, 13, 19, every 8 weeks thereafter until end of study (for up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Disease progression was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of the first recorded incident of disease progression, or the date of death due any cause. For measurable disease, disease progression was defined as a ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of diameters of 1 or more measurable lesions with a minimal area of greater than (&gt;)2 square centimeters (cm^2), or the appearance of new lesions; and for malignant lesions with a minimal area of 2 cm^2, an increase of ≥1 cm^2. For immeasurable disease, disease progression was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of ≥50% in existent lesions.</description>

    <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from date CR was first recorded to the date progressive disease (PD) was first noted. For measurable disease, PD was defined as a ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of diameters of 1 or more measurable lesions with a minimal area of &gt;2 cm^2, or the appearance of new lesions; and for malignant lesions with a minimal area of 2 cm^2, an increase of ≥1 cm^2.

    <description>Therapy failure was defined as the date of the start of therapy to the date of withdrawal due to adverse events, progressive disease/insufficient therapeutic response, death, failure to return, or refusal of treatment/lack of cooperation/withdrawal of consent. Participants were censored at the last dose of treatment if no event was recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>BL, Weeks 7, 13, 19, every 8 weeks thereafter until end of study (for up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from the date of the start of treatment to the date of death or the last date the participant was known to be alive.</description>

    <measure>Overall Survival</measure>
    <time_frame>BL, Weeks 7, 13, 19, every 8 weeks thereafter until end of study (for up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>The time, in months, from the start of treatment to OS event. The mean survival time and it's standard error were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time.</description>

For measurable disease, disease progression was defined as a ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of diameters of 1 or more measurable lesions with a minimal area of greater than (&gt;)2 square centimeters (cm^2), or the appearance of new lesions; and for malignant lesions with a minimal area of 2 cm^2, an increase of ≥1 cm^2.

        <title>Duration of Response - Percentage of Participants With an Event</title>
        <description>Duration of response was defined as the time from date CR was first recorded to the date progressive disease (PD) was first noted. For measurable disease, PD was defined as a ≥25% increase in the sum of the products of diameters of 1 or more measurable lesions with a minimal area of &gt;2 cm^2, or the appearance of new lesions; and for malignant lesions with a minimal area of 2 cm^2, an increase of ≥1 cm^2. For immeasurable disease, PD was defined as the appearance of any new lesion not previously identified or an estimated increase of ≥50% in existent lesions.</description>
