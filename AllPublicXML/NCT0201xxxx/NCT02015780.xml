      To evaluate the efficacy of fasiglifam 50 mg once daily compared to placebo on glycemic
      control as measured by glycosilated haemoglobin (HbA1c) over a 16-week treatment period in
      participants with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4 or
      5 on dialysis.

      The drug being tested in this study is called fasiglifam. Fasiglifam is being tested to treat
      people who have diabetes and chronic kidney disease. This study will look at glycemic control
      in people who take fasiglifam in addition to standard antihyperglycemic therapy.

      The study will enroll approximately 164 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Fasiglifam 50 mg;

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study in addition to their current antihyperglycemic therapy. All participants will be asked
      to record any time they have hypoglycemia signs and symptoms in a diary.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and European regions. The
      overall time to participate in this study is approximately 57 weeks.

      Participants will make 17 visits to the clinic. Due to potential concerns about liver safety,
      on balance, the benefits of treating patients with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the
      potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.

             mmol/L) at the Week -1 Visit. (If the subject does not qualify for randomization based
             on these criteria, the assessment may be repeated weekly, for a maximum of 2
             additional weeks.)

          -  The subject's compliance with the single-blind study medication during the placebo
             run-in period is at least 75% and does not exceed 125% based on tablet counts
