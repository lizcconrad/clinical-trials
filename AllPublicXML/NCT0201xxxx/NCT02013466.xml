    <textblock>
      In this study healthy older adults are requested to consume 4 different high-protein
      nutritional supplements. Each subject will visit the site 4 times and at every visit they
      will consume 1 of the 4 products after which a series of blood samples will be taken. The
      blood samples will be analyzed for amino acid bioavailability in the blood up to 4 hours
      after consumption.
