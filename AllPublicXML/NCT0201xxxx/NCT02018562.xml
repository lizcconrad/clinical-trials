  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Verbal communication is vital to critically ill mechanically ventilated patient's quality of
      life (Hess, 2005). Patients who have a tracheostomy tube may be able to communicate using a
      speaking valve, however, some patients may not be able to tolerate cuff deflation for use of
      speaking valve. There are talking tracheostomy tubes that do not require cuff deflation to
      facilitate speech in this population. Unfortunately, not all candidates are offered these
      options due to lack of awareness. Recently, at our institution, there has been an increase in
      the use of these tubes to facilitate speech. One of the talking tracheotomy tubes that has
      proven to be effective is the Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid (BLUSA).

      In 2010, we conducted a retrospective review of 4 cases and found that BLUSA tracheostomy
      helped facilitate communication in this unique population (IRB #: NA_00041547). We would now
      like to formally conduct a prospective pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of measuring
      outcomes of patients with a BLUSA using a pretest-posttest research design.

      Communication empowers patients and allows healthcare staff to obtain a more accurate
      assessment of patients' condition and tailor care accordingly. Identifying the predictors of
      speech intelligibility and the impact of BLUSA on quality of life will promote communication
      between patients and healthcare providers.

      Study Hypothesis: Determine the impact of a talking tracheostomy tube on quality of life in
      patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation in the hospital.

    <description>Quality of Life in Mechanically Ventilated Patients Questionnaire (QOL-MV) was used to measure quality of life. It is a 12-item scale with each items 0 - 10 and total score ranges from 0 - 120. Lower scores refers to lower quality of life and Higher scores refer to higher level quality of life. To be assessed at baseline and 2 weeks post Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid (BLUSA).</description>

    <description>The Speech Intelligibility Test has 11 randomly computer generated sentences that patients are asked to read aloud.

    <description>The talking tracheostomy trial involves placement of a talking tracheostomy tube (Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid Tracheostomy Tube) by respiratory therapist after obtaining an order from an authorized prescriber (Physician or Nurse Practitioner). The Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) sets up the tracheostomy tube for speech and then determines the optimal air flow required for voicing. This amount of air flow is communicated to the ICU staff for further use.
We will ensure that the SLP meets with the patient for a minimum of 3 sessions within a week to optimize the use of a talking tracheostomy tube.
i. SLP will also assess the duration of successful speech during each session
ii. Sentence intelligibility will also be assessed during the 3rd session. This session will be audio-taped and reviewed by a second rater for sentence intelligibility.
iii. SLP will determine the level of independence with talking tracheostomy during the 3rd session.</description>

        <title>Change in Quality of Life</title>
        <description>Quality of Life in Mechanically Ventilated Patients Questionnaire (QOL-MV) was used to measure quality of life. It is a 12-item scale with each items 0 - 10 and total score ranges from 0 - 120. Lower scores refers to lower quality of life and Higher scores refer to higher level quality of life. To be assessed at baseline and 2 weeks post Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid (BLUSA).</description>

            <title>Intervention</title>
            <description>This involves placement of a talking tracheostomy tube (Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid Tracheostomy Tube) by respiratory therapist after obtaining an order from an authorized prescriber (Physician or Nurse Practitioner). The Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) sets up the tracheostomy tube for speech and then determines the optimal air flow required for voicing. This amount of air flow is communicated to the ICU staff for further use.
We will ensure that the SLP meets with the patient for a minimum of 3 sessions within a week to optimize the use of a talking tracheostomy tube.
i. SLP will also assess the duration of successful speech during each session. ii. Sentence intelligibility will also be assessed during the 3rd session. This session will be audio-taped and reviewed by a second rater for sentence intelligibility.
iii. SLP will determine the level of independence with talking tracheostomy during the 3rd session.

            <title>Intervention</title>
            <description>This involves placement of a talking tracheostomy tube (Portex Blueline Ultra Suctionaid Tracheostomy Tube) by respiratory therapist after obtaining an order from an authorized prescriber (Physician or Nurse Practitioner). The Speech-Language Pathologist (SLP) sets up the tracheostomy tube for speech and then determines the optimal air flow required for voicing. This amount of air flow is communicated to the ICU staff for further use.
We will ensure that the SLP meets with the patient for a minimum of 3 sessions within a week to optimize the use of a talking tracheostomy tube.
i. SLP will also assess the duration of successful speech during each session. ii. Sentence intelligibility will also be assessed during the 3rd session. This session will be audio-taped and reviewed by a second rater for sentence intelligibility.
iii. SLP will determine the level of independence with talking tracheostomy during the 3rd session.
