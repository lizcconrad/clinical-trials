  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study will assess
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RO6864018 in healthy, male, Asian and
      Caucasian participants. Participants will be enrolled in cohorts and randomized 8:2 to
      receive a single oral administration of RO6864018 or placebo. Total study duration for each
      participant is up to 9 weeks.

    <description>Asian participants will receive a single oral dose of RO6864018 capsule on Day 1. The first dose escalation cohort will receive a single 400 mg oral dose. Dose will be escalated in subsequent cohorts (up to Cohort 4) up to a maximum of 1600 mg, based on safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data available from lower dose cohorts. The Cohort 5 will include Caucasian participants who will receive a single 1200 mg (or the highest dose well-tolerated by Asian participants, if lower than 1200 mg) oral dose of RO6864018 capsules on Day 1.</description>
