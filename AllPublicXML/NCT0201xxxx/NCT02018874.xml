  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the First-in-Human, JWAA trial, the LY2780301 displayed a favourable safety profile, a
      high pharmacokinetic exposure and the ability to decrease pS6. LY2780301 has shown
      synergistic activity in combination with targeted agents or chemotherapy including
      gemcitabine. We propose herein to combine LY2780301 with gemcitabine and to treat different
      tumor types with molecular alterations. This may validate the anti-tumor activity of the
      LY2780301 and it will increase our knowledge regarding molecular predictors of its efficacy.

    <description>Patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in successive cohorts of 3 to 6 patients. If no DLT is observed during the first 4 weeks of study treatment in 3 patients, the dose of LY2780301 will be escalated to the dose level (DL) immediately above. If One DLT is observed among 3 patients, the cohort will be expanded to 6 evaluable patients. If two patients out of 3 or 2 /6 patients experience a DLT, the dose will be considered intolerable and the DL immediately below will be further explored. The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) will be the highest DL in which no more than 1/6 patients experiences a DLT. If no DLT is observed at the highest planned DL, this DL will be deemed the RP2D. Intermediate DLs could be added, if clinically relevant.</description>
