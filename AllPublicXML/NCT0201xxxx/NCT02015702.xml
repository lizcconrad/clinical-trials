  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was intended to test the effects of adding a one-on-one educational intervention
      taught by a physician to a physician during their clinical work to improve their acceptance
      and satisfaction with a new inpatient electronic health record and ordering system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study was a randomized, parallel , non- blinded controlled trial of real-time, focused
      educational interventions in an intervention arm compared with usual training and support in
      the control arm. Improvement in performance, defined as the time between opening and closing
      a progress note, and number of notes completed after shift , were the primary outcomes.
      Physician satisfaction was a secondary outcome. Participants from one 550-bed Academic
      Independent Medical Center were invited to participate if they were full-time hospitalists or
      residents in internal medicine with no prior experience with the EPIC electronic health
      record.

    <description>the primary outcome measure will be time to complete a progress note. this is defined as the difference between the recorded time of opening the note and the recorded time the note was signed in the EPIC electronic health record system.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of notes completed after shift</measure>
    <time_frame>within 1 week of posting note</time_frame>
    <description>Shifts are 7 a.m. - 7 p.m for doctors assigned to daytime work. We defined a note completed after shift as any note with a signed time that is after 7 p.m. on the day of a shift worked.</description>

    <measure>Physician Satisfaction with EPIC Electronic Health Record</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, 15-20 shifts, and 35-40 shifts</time_frame>
    <description>We asked the participants this question:
How comfortable are you specifically using the EPIC program for inpatient practice?&quot; at baseline, midpoint (after working 15-20 shifts), and end of the study (after working 35-40 shifts).</description>

    <description>One-on-one physician training Physicians in the experimental arm were visited by a instructing physician at a computer while performing clinical duties who had observed others to identify best practices. Instructors watched subjects' work, looking for a specific tip that could be applied to the current work, then demonstrated the tip, and answered any questions the subject had about using or applying this new technique .</description>

    <description>Usual training. This group will get the usual specified training for learning to use our electronic health record. Both groups received 12 hours of EPIC classroom training, exposure to the EPIC e-learning modules, user acceptability testing classes, and unlimited time on the EPIC 'playground', a site to practice on virtual patients. All had 90 days of elbow support with an EPIC-training non-physician technician, who were visible and available on all inpatient wards, as well as access to a physician-only support line available at all hours.</description>
