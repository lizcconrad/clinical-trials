    <textblock>
      This double blind randomized controlled prospective clinical trial will compare the clinical
      success of two tooth colored resin composite dental filling materials - TPH3 (Dentsply Caulk)
      and an experimental urethane dimethacrylate resin based composite resin (Dentsply Caulk) for
      wear resistance, staining and marginal seal using modified Ryge criteria to evaluate the
      posterior restorations for 24 months in duration

      The purposes of this clinical trial is to evaluate two composite resins used to restore Class
      I and Class II cavities in teeth of adults. The clinical study will evaluate the resin
      composite restorations placed in Class I and Class II cavity preparations for anatomic form,
      color match, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, proximal contact, polishability,
      caries, sensitivity, gingival index, staining,wear, and thermal response for 24 months..

        Inclusion Criteria:â€¢ must have given written consent to participate in the trial

          -  must be in need of at least two restorations in natural tooth

          -  replacement restorations with or without caries are acceptable

          -  must be available for the required post-operative follow-up visits

          -  restorations to be in bicuspids, 1st or 2nd molars

          -  restorations to be in contact with opposing natural or crowned teeth

          -  class II restorations must have at least one proximal contact

          -  restorations must have a buccal to lingual/palatal width equal to or greater than 1/3
             the distance from buccal to lingual/palatal cusp tips

          -  75% of the restorations must be Class II

          -  all restorations must have at least one occlusal contact in habitual closure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  have severe medical complications (organ transplants, long term antibiotic or steroid
             treatment, cancer or immunocompromised) or disabilities who may not be able to
             tolerate the time required to complete the restorations or to provide adequate oral
             hygiene

          -  have xerostomia either by taking medications known to produce xerostomia or those with
             radiation induced or Sjogren's syndrome patients

          -  have chronic periodontitis, rampant caries or poor oral hygiene which may require
             extraction of the teeth to be restored

          -  have a history of chronic bruxism and those unavailable for long term recall

          -  can not tolerate the rubber dam required for tooth isolation during preparation and
             restoration.

          -  do not meet all inclusion criteria

          -  present with any systemic or local disorders that contra-indicate the dental
             procedures included in this study

          -  have an unstable occlusion

          -  have severe bruxing or clenching or need of TMJ related therapy

          -  have teeth with periapical pathology or expected pulp exposures

          -  have teeth that are non-vital or that exhibit signs of pulpal pathology

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Known sensitivity to methacrylates and/or acrylates
