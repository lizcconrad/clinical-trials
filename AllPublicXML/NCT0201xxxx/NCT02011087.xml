    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies bioelectrical impedance phase angle in predicting treatment
      outcome in patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer receiving first-line
      chemotherapy. Diagnostic procedures, such as bioelectrical impedance analysis, may help
      predict a patient's response to treatment for small cell lung cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between phase angle (PA) measurement and progression-free
      survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the association between PA measurement and treatment-related outcomes of
      treatment response, adverse treatment events, and overall survival (OS).

      II. To determine the feasibility of obtaining PA measurements at a single time point in
      patients undergoing evaluation in thoracic oncology clinics.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement on day 1 of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for two years.
