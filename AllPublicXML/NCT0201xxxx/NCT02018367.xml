  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to determine whether imaging with the low-cost High
      Resolution Microendoscope(HRME) will increase the efficiency and yield of the current
      standard of endoscopic surveillance of Barrett's esophagus. We believe the HRME will provide
      an in-vivo &quot;optical biopsy&quot; that will be comparable to gold standard histopathology and allow
      the endoscopist to make a more informed decision about whether to obtain a biopsy or even
      perform endoscopic therapy (i.e. endoscopic mucosal resection, EMR).

      Primary outcomes:

        -  the diagnostic yield (defined as the proportion of mucosal biopsy samples with
           neoplasia) of HRME with directed biopsy

           - compared to standard white-light endoscopy with 4-quadrant random biopsy (WL) for the
           diagnosis of BE-associated neoplasia in flat mucosa as well as mucosal lesions

        -  the clinical impact of HRME on the diagnosis and endoscopic surveillance of BE-
           associated neoplasia

             -  does HRME alter the decision to obtain a mucosal biopsy or perform endoscopic
                mucosal resection (EMR)

             -  the total number of total mucosal biopsies taken per procedure; does HRME alter the
                number of biopsies necessary?

      Secondary outcomes:

        -  sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of
           HRME for the in-vivo diagnosis of neoplasia in a routine surveillance population of
           patients with BE (using histopathologic diagnosis of mucosal biopsies as the reference
           standard)

        -  the total procedure time for imaging and mucosal biopsy acquisition of HRME - compared
           with WL, stratified by length of BE (&lt; 3 cm and &gt; 3cm)

    <description>5-10mL of proflavine hemisulfate (0.01%) will be sprayed on the esophageal mucosa. The HRME will then be inserted through the biopsy channel of the endoscope and gently placed against the mucosa. The endoscopist will image each discrete lesion observed during white light endoscopy. For each HRME imaged area, an optical read will be obtained followed by a tissue biopsy.</description>
