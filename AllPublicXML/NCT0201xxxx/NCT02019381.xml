  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently two distinguished committees, Institute of Medicine (IOM) and The Endocrine Society
      have proposed different intake guidelines for Calcium and Vitamin D. We wish to compare the
      effects of both of them on calcium metabolism and bone turnover. We propose a one year
      randomized double blinded study for the same.

      The specific aims of this study proposal are to determine the following:

        1. To compare the two different intake guidelines for Calcium and Vitamin D Supplementation
           at its recommended tolerable upper limit on serum and urinary calcium in white
           postmenopausal Women.

        2. Compare the effects above mentioned two intake guidelines on Vitamin D metabolism
           [25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D] and bone turnover.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to Group A or Group B based on different dosages of
      study medications.

      Group A: 10,000 IU (International Units)Vitamin D + Placebo (sugar pill) 600IU Vitamin D +
      Two pills Calcium containing 600mg calcium each.

      Group B: 600 IU Vitamin D + Placebo (sugar pill) 10,000 IU Vitamin D

      + Two pills Calcium containing 600mg calcium each.

      In addition to the calcium supplements, they will guide to include approximately 800mg of
      calcium in their daily diet.

      At visit 2, fasting blood and spot urine will be collected. A urinal will be dispensed for
      collection of 24-hour urine for urinary calcium to be brought in next day. Study medication
      will be dispensed and participants will be asked not to discard unused medications and to
      bring all study medications next study visit.

      Visit 3, 4, 5, 6 will essentially be the same as visit 2, with subjects returning unused
      study medication and given new tablets each visit. Except on visit 6 no further study
      medications will be dispensed, after collecting the previous supply.

      Food frequency questionnaires will be filled out at the initial visit and final visit. Diet
      will be assessed using 3-day diet history form and Nutrition Pro analysis software. Patients
      will be asked to refrain from taking other Vitamin D supplements and to continue their usual
      calcium intake.
