  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) is characterised by repeated episodes of upper
      airway occlusion during sleep.It can cause cycles of hypoxia reoxygenation. And it was
      postulated that intermittent hypoxia seems to resemble ischemia-reperfusion.Many study
      suggest that ischemia-reperfusion represents an oxidative stress causing increased generation
      of reactive oxygen species, especially superoxide anions.It is one of the most important
      mechanisms of cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, coronary artery disease and
      cerebrovascular accident complication with OSAS.So many individuals approve OSAS is an
      Oxidative Stress disease.

      Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the first-line of treatment method in
      moderate/severe OSA.But poor adherence to CPAP treatment is very common.The failure rate with
      CPAP treatment is more than 50%.So we are searching a new treatment for that patients.
      Carbocysteine is a antioxidant.It can not only scavenges the free radicals but also
      replenishes glutathione(GSH)which is has double antioxidant capacity. However, Carbocysteine
      is cheaper than other which has double antioxidant capacity drugs,such as
      N-acetylcysteine.The purpose is to evaluate efficacy of oral intake of Antioxidant
      Carbocysteine witch can reduce oxidative stress and improve the symptom of OSAS.It recover
      the imbalance in the oxidant-anti-oxidant status may reduce cardiovascular abnormalities in
      Patients with OSAS.

      OSAS patients are required to fill in questionnaire.And Inflammation biomarkers and Oxidative
      Stress biomarkers and ultrasonic will be tested.Then patients are randomly allocated to one
      of two groups. One group is treated with oral intake of Antioxidant Carbocysteine 500mg tid.
      The second group is treated with CPAP. After 6 weeks treatment, all patients will take the
      overnight polysomnogram test again, and take questionnaire, blood , ultrasonic test.
