      Our objective is to determine the requirement for the amino acid tryptophan in school age
      children using the indicator amino acid technique.

      Seven healthy children will participate in the study. The children will participate as an
      outpatient basis with study days carried out in the Physiological Research Unit at the
      Hospital of Sick Children, Toronto, Canada. Inclusion criteria include: being healthy, not
      taking any medications, no recent weight changes, no history of significant illness, willing
      to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria were the presence of illness, significant
      weight change, not acceptance of the diet. Prior to enrolment, each subject will have to fill
      3 days food record form to ensure his or her normal dietary behavior. The study will be
      explained to subjects and their parents/guardians, benefits and potential risks will be
      explained as well and written assent, from the children, and consent from parents will be
      obtained. Subjects will receive financial compensations. Each subject will receive
      compensation for participation. Each parent/guardian will be reimbursed for the
      transpiration/parking expenses and a meal each study day.
