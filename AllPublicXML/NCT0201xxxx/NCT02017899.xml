  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 1 clinical trial is aimed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of 3 doses of
      5 sequentially escalating dosages of a candidate vaccine against Shigella sonnei (1790GAHB
      vaccine) administered by intramuscular route in healthy adults (18 to 45 years of age at
      enrollment). The safety profile of the 1790GAHB vaccine is evaluated in comparison to that of
      placebo (GAHB-Placebo), constituted by an aluminum hydroxide suspension having the same
      concentration as study vaccine formulations. A total of 50 eligible subjects will be assigned
      to one of five sequential cohorts of 10 subjects each.

      Within each cohort, in an observer-blind fashion, subjects will be randomized to receive
      three vaccinations, four weeks apart, of either 1790GAHB vaccine (at five antigen
      concentrations) or GAHB placebo. A Data Safety Monitoring Board will be in place to receive a
      summary of all safety data obtained during one week follow-up post-first vaccination with the
      lower dose. Based on evaluation of the safety data, the Data Safety Monitoring Board will
      make a recommendation, as to whether the next cohort should be vaccinated with higher antigen
      concentration or not.

      Expected duration of the study for an individual subject is 9 months. Each subject will be
      followed-up for 6 months after the 3rd vaccination.

    <description>Seroresponse is defined as: If half of the baseline value is greater than 25 ELISA Unit (EU) then an increase of at least 50% in the post-vaccination sample as compared to baseline [i.e. ((Post-vac minus baseline)/baseline)100% ≥ 50%]. If half of the baseline value is less or equal to 25 EU then an increase of at least 25 EU in the post-vaccination sample as compared to baseline (i.e. [post-vac minus baseline] ≥25 EU)</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, at 28 days after each vaccination and at 168 days after last vaccination</time_frame>
    <description>High seroresponse is defined as a post vaccination titer ≥X anti-LPS serum IgG units in the GSK (former Novartis) ELISA that correspond to a titer of 1:800 in the ELISA method used by Cohen et al. (1989 J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:162). To determine the value for 'X' the GSK (former Novartis) anti-LPS ELISA was calibrated against the Cohen ELISA and it was found that a concentration of 121 EU EU/mL corresponds to a titer of 1:800 in the Cohen assay</description>
