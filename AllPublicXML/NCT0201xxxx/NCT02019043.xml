    <textblock>
      This study aims to enhance syphilis testing among HIV-positive men who have sex with men
      (MSM), so that more men will undergo testing, they will test more often, and more cases will
      be treated early. The intervention will combine syphilis tests with the standard HIV blood
      tests that are routinely done every 3-6 months for persons in care at hospital-based HIV
      clinics in Toronto and Ottawa, Canada.

    <textblock>
      A clinic-based intervention to incorporate syphilis testing with routine HIV bloodwork among
      HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) attending 4 hospital-based HIV clinics in
      Toronto and Ottawa will be conducted. The objectives are to determine to what degree the
      intervention: (1) increases the detection rate of untreated syphilis; (2) increases the
      proportion of men who undergo syphilis testing at least annually (increased screening
      coverage); (3) reduces the interval between syphilis tests (increased screening frequency);
      and (4) reaches men at highest risk according to sexual behaviours. The main hypotheses are
      that the intervention will increase screening coverage to a minimum of 85% of men undergoing
      syphilis testing annually, increase screening frequency to a median of 3 tests per person per
      year, and increase the case detection rate by 75% or more.

      The design of this study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial with stepped wedge design
      that will gradually introduce the intervention across clinics. This pragmatic approach
      incorporates a concurrent comparison group, allows for assessment of time trends, will be
      well-powered, and will generate more generalizable results due to its inclusion of multiple
      clinics. The intervention will be operationalized as standing orders for syphilis serology
      when there is an order for HIV viral load and/or CD4 cell count. Data sources include (1)
      syphilis tests submitted to the Public Health Ontario Laboratory; (2) a standardized clinical
      worksheet and medical chart review to validate diagnoses for screen test positives; and (3)
      data collected from a subset of patients via their participation in the ongoing Ontario HIV
      Treatment Network (OHTN) Cohort Study. The latter follows adults in HIV care and collects
      data using chart reviews and annual face-to-face interviews including measures of sexual
      behaviour.

    <description>We will use a cluster-randomized controlled trial (CRCT) using a stepped wedge design that will gradually introduce the intervention across four clinics. Each clinic will be randomized to one of the four roll-out periods, and will have at minimum one 6-month control period and one 6-month intervention period. The main hypothesis to be tested is H0: θ=0 versus Ha: θ= θa where θ represents the increase in the case detection rate due to the intervention and θa represents a 75% increase over the baseline rate.</description>

    <description>The intervention condition will be implemented as standing orders for syphilis serology whenever patients undergo their standard battery of follow-up bloodwork, i.e., when there is an order for HIV viral load or CD4 cell count. It is standard practice for HIV patients to undergo such tests every 3-6 months. We anticipate that the change in practice will be straightforward, involving minimal training of clinic staff. Team members who are physicians at these clinics will guide the specific approach that will be appropriate and sustainable for their setting. Options are quite simple. They include pre-printing a checkmark for 'syphilis serology' onto existing pre-printed requisitions for routine bloodwork; addition of the serology request form to the routine blood work package; or programming 'syphilis serology' into existing computerized routine order sets.</description>
