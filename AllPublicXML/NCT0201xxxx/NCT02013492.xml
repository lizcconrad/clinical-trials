      This pilot trial studies propranolol hydrochloride in treating patients with locally
      recurrent or metastatic solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Propranolol
      hydrochloride may slow the growth of tumor cells by blocking the use of hormones by the tumor
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and tolerability of beta-adrenergic blockade in patients with
      metastatic or locally advanced cancer.

      II. To determine the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on the tumor microenvironment and
      host immune system via a series of correlative laboratory studies using cancer tumor tissue
      and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the study patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the effects of beta-adrenergic blockade on progression-free survival and overall
      survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically-proven locally-recurrent or metastatic solid tumor;
             the first 10 patients may have cancer of any histology; preference will be given to
             patients with metastatic ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma, as
             these malignancies have been shown to be sensitive to manipulation of the
             beta-adrenergic receptor; the final twenty-five patients to be accrued must have
             locally-recurrent or metastatic malignant melanoma that is not surgically resectable.
             An additional cohort of 10 patients with BCLC stages A to C locally advanced or
             metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that is not surgically resectable will also
             be enrolled (See appendix for BCLC staging system). Patients with liver
             transplantation will not be eligible.

          -  The diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma may be made by one of the following methods:

               2. At least one solid liver lesion or vascular tumor thrombosis (involving portal
                  vein, IVC and/or hepatic vein) &gt; 1 cm with arterial enhancement and delayed
                  washout on multiphasic computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging

                  thrombosis (involving portal vein, IVC and/or hepatic vein) demonstrating early
                  arterial enhancement and delayed washout on multi-phasic CT or MRI, in a patient
                  with known HCC (diagnosed according to criteria in (a) or (b).

          -  Patients may have had any number of prior systemic therapies; patients need not have

          -  The effects of propranolol on the developing human fetus may be detrimental. For this
             reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study
             entry and for the duration of study participation; should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her
             treating physician immediately

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Patients with brain metastases may participate in this clinical study provided that
             symptoms have been controlled with standard therapies and/or appropriate medications;
             the principal investigator (P.I.) will carefully evaluate the suitability of patient
             participation when brain metastases are present

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Patients with significant lung disease, an ejection fraction less than 40%, or a
             resting heart rate less than 60/min will not be enrolled

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because propranolol is an agent with the
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects

          -  Patients who are currently receiving a beta-blocker for another medical condition will
             be excluded from this study; patients with extremes of blood pressure (e.g., systolic
             blood pressure [SBP] &gt; 150 or &lt; 100) may be excluded from participation if the
             treating physician feels that this medical condition has not been adequately addressed
             by the patient's primary care physician

          -  Patients with worsening depression that has not been addressed clinically will be
             excluded from this study
