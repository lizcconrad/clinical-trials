      Background:

        -  Papillary RCC is the second most common histologic subtype of kidney cancer, accounting
           for approximately 10-15% of cases

        -  Type 1 papillary RCC occurs in both sporadic and hereditary forms, which are
           histologically identical. Non familial type 1 papillary RCC can present as both solitary
           renal tumors and as bilateral, multifocal disease

        -  There are no standard agents of proven efficacy for patients with advanced papillary

      RCC.

        -  Patients with disease localized to the kidney are managed surgically while patients with
           advanced/unresectable disease are usually managed in the community with VEGF pathway
           antagonists or mTOR inhibitors.

        -  Activating mutations of MET were identified in the germline of affected HPRC patients,
           who have a predilection for the development of bilateral, multifocal type 1 papillary
           RCC. Somatic MET mutations have been found in a subset of patients with non-inherited,
           sporadic papillary renal carcinoma

        -  The investigational agent INC280 is a selective MET inhibitor lacking activity against
           the VEGF pathway

        -  This is a proof-of-concept study using INC280 in patients with papillary RCC to test the
           idea that effectively blocking the HGF/MET pathway will lead to clinical activity in
           patients with papillary renal cell cancer

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      -To determine the overall response rate (RECIST 1.1) in patients with papillary renal cell
      carcinoma treated with single agent INC280

      Eligibility:

        -  Diagnosis of hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) or sporadic papillary renal
           cell carcinoma (RCC)

             -  Patients with bilateral multifocal disease can have tumors localized to the kidney
                or have metastatic disease

             -  Patients with sporadic papillary RCC (but without multifocal disease) should have
                advanced disease that is considered unresectable

        -  ECOG 0-2

        -  Measurable disease

        -  Adequate organ function

        -  No active brain metastases

        -  Prior therapy

             -  No more than 3 prior lines of systemic therapy

             -  Prior therapy with a MET inhibitor is allowed as long as the patient has not had
                progressive disease while receiving the agent

      Design:

        -  This is a phase 2 single center non-randomized trial.

        -  The study will be conducted using a Simon 2 stage minimax design. Initially 13 evaluable
           subjects will be recruited. If there are no responses to therapy, the study will be
           terminated. If there is at least 1 response an additional 7 evaluable subjects will be
           accrued.

        -  The two-stage minimax design is based on assuming an ineffective response rate of 5% and
           a targeted effective response rate of 25%. We also assume that the probability of
           accepting an ineffective treatment and the probability of rejecting an effective
           treatment are each 10%.

        -  Subjects will be dosed orally at a starting dose of 600 mg twice daily.

        -  The overall response rate (complete response + partial response) will be determined.

        2.1.2.14 Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of
        becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during
        dosing and for 3 month days after stopping study drug. Highly effective contraception
        methods include:

          -  Total abstinence or

          -  Male or female sterilization or

          -  Combination of any two of the following (a+b or a+c or b+c):

               1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception

               2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS)

               3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository
                  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate
                  clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal
                  ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                  assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential.

        2.1.2.15 Sexually active males must use a condom during intercourse while taking the drug
        and for 3 months after stopping study drug and should not father a child in this period. A
        condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to prevent delivery of the
        drug via seminal fluid.

        2.1.2.16 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
        of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with INC280.

        2.1.2.17 Prior invasive malignancy of other histology currently requiring treatment.
