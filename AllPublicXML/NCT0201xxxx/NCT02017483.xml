  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lots of studies suggest that children with ADHD have deficits in facial emotion recognition,
      especially for the negative emotion. But there were arguments for this deficit is a secondary
      problem due to the general attention impairment in ADHD, or a specific social cognitive
      processing to ADHD. The objectives of this study are to investigate that association between
      the deficits in facial emotion recognition and the emotional attention processing in ADHD. In
      this study, the investigators use the emotion attentional bias and emotional go / no go
      paradigm to answer this question.

      The sample will consist of 100 children and adolescent with ADHD and 100 typical controls,
      ages 8-16. The ADHD group inclusion criteria are patients who have clinically diagnosis of
      DSM-IV ADHD confirmed by the K-SADS-E, and have IQ &gt; 80; and whose parents consent to this
      study.

      The measurements will be included:

        1. Diagnostic assessment tools:

             -  Chinese version of Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and
                Schizophrenia-Epidemiology version.

             -  Conners' Parent/Teacher Rating Scale- Revised: Short Form, CPRS-R:S/CTRS-R:S.

             -  Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham, Version Ⅳ（SNAP-Ⅳ）Rating Scale - Parent/ Teacher Form.

        2. Emotion assessment tools:

             -  Facial emotion recognition task.

             -  Emotional attentional bias task.

             -  Emotional Go/ No Go task.

        3. Cognitive assessment tool:

             -  Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Chinese Version.

      This study could offer the suggestion for the further intervention of social function in
      ADHD.

    <measure>The error rate in facial emotion judgements on computerized task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator used the e-prime program to assess the error rate in facial emotion judgements. Participants need to judge the emotion of the face stimuli presented on the laptop.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The reaction time of attentional bias for pairs of face stimuli(happy/neutral or angry/neutral faces) on dot-prob task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator presented pairs of face stimuli with emotional and neutral expressions and probed the allocation of attention to these stimuli for presentation times of 150 and 500 ms to assess the reaction time of attentional bias. Participants need to press the dot after the prob.</description>

    <measure>The attentional inhibition control(omission errors and commission errors) in emotional go/no go task</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Investigator used go/ no go task to assess participants' omission errors and commission errors, participants just need to press the keyboard and the number of errors were recorded.</description>
