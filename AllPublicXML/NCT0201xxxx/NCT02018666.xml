  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label study which compared two
      ventilation modes: spontaneous NAVA mode and spontaneous breathing with IPS mode (the latter
      is considered as the reference ventilatory mode) in patients admitted to the ICU for acute
      respiratory failure and ventilated with an endotracheal tube. NAVA mode allows to minimize
      patient-ventilator disharmony with acceptable tolerance and to preserve spontaneous
      ventilation.
