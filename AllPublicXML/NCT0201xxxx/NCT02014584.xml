  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of male pattern hair loss (MPHL) or androgenetic alopecia (AGA) with 5Î±-reductase
      inhibitor (5-ARIs) has been associated with sexual dysfunction including erectile dysfunction
      and loss of libido. This will be a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to assess the impact of dutasteride treatment on sexual function as well
      as subject satisfaction with hair growth and quality of life in men with AGA. This study will
      consist of a Screening Visit, a 4-week Placebo Run-in Phase, a Treatment Phase of 48 weeks,
      and a subsequent Follow-up Visit after 4 weeks. The treatment phase will include 24 weeks of
      double-blind, placebo controlled treatment and 24 weeks of open-label treatment with
      dutasteride. An extended 6-month Follow-up Visit will be conducted for any individuals with a
      change in erectile function at the end of treatment.

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The IIEF is a validated 15-item questionnaire with individual items of the questionnaire assigned to five separate domains of sexual function (i.e., erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction). The IIEF was employed to assess treatment-related changes in men with erectile dysfunction. The erectile function domain of the IIEF (IIEF-EF) includes Questions 1 through 5 and Question 15 (maximum score of 30). A clinically meaningful gradient of severity of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been developed, indicating that a score of greater than 25 represents an individual without ED while men scoring &lt;=25 may be classified as having ED. The values are presented for Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24. The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the DB treatment start.

          <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs related to sexual function are defined as: altered (decreased) libido, impotence, and ejaculation disorders. Duration is the total number of non-overlapping days for all events per subject. A duration is censored if there is at least one event with unknown start date or end date, in which case the censored duration is the minimum number of days that a subject has experienced any of these events. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles). NA=not applicable.</description>

        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.. SAE is defined as any untoward event resulting in death, life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect, any other situation according to medical or scientific judgment, all events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinemia, breast cancer in male participants, or spontaneous abortion in female partner of male participant. The PSRAE form was used in this study to collect detailed information on the circumstances of reported AEs which, in the investigator's opinion, were possibly suicidality-related.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With AEs of Special Interest in the Open-label Treatment Period</title>
        <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant, temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. AEs of special interest included those of sexual function: breast disorders (breast enlargement and breast tenderness), prostate cancer, cardiovascular events, and possible suicidality-related AEs (PSRAEs). Infrequent AEs of special interest included breast cancer, allergic reactions, depressed mood, hair changes, interference with formation of external genitalia in a male fetus, potential for decreased male fertility, and testicular pain and swelling. Special interest AEs are groups of MedDRA terms which have been defined in the analysis plan.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With a Change in Sexual Function Defined as a Negative Change From Baseline in the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Erectile Function Domain (IIEF-EF) Score of &gt;=4 Units in the Double-blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The IIEF is a validated 15-item questionnaire with individual items of the questionnaire assigned to five separate domains of sexual function (i.e., erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction). The IIEF was employed to assess treatment-related changes in men with erectile dysfunction. The erectile function domain of the IIEF (IIEF-EF) includes Questions 1 through 5 and Question 15 (maximum score of 30). A clinically meaningful gradient of severity of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been developed, indicating that a score of greater than 25 represents an individual without ED while men scoring &lt;=25 may be classified as having ED. The values are presented for Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24. The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the DB treatment start. Change from Baseline is post-Baseline value minus Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score of the IIEF in the Double-blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The IIEF is a validated 15-item questionnaire with individual items of the questionnaire assigned to five separate domains of sexual function (i.e., erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction). The IIEF was employed to assess treatment-related changes in men with erectile dysfunction. Overall score range is 0-75. The erectile function score range is 0-30, intercourse satisfaction score range is 0-15, orgasmic function score range is 0-10, sexual desire score range is 0-10, overall satisfaction score range is 0-10. A decrease from Baseline indicates a worsening. The change from Baseline values are presented for Week 4, Week 12 and Week 24. The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the DB treatment start. Change from Baseline is post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Individual Domain Scores (Erectile Function, Orgasmic Function, Sexual Desire, Intercourse Satisfaction and Overall Sexual Satisfaction) of the IIEF in the Open-label Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The IIEF is a validated 15-item questionnaire with individual items of the questionnaire assigned to five separate domains of sexual function (i.e., erectile function, orgasmic function, sexual desire, intercourse satisfaction, and overall satisfaction). The IIEF was employed to assess treatment-related changes in men with erectile dysfunction. Overall score range is 0-75. The erectile function score range is 0-30, intercourse satisfaction score range is 0-15, orgasmic function score range is 0-10, sexual desire score range is 0-10, overall satisfaction score range is 0-10. A decrease from Baseline indicates a worsening. The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the OL treatment start. Change from Baseline is post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Satisfaction With Hair Growth as Assessed by the Total Score of the Hair Growth Satisfaction Scale (HGSS) in the Double-blind Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The HGSS assessed participants satisfaction with hair appearance and growth by scoring 5 questions on a 7-point scale ranging from 1=very dissatisfied to 7= very satisfied with a maximum score of 35. The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the DB treatment start. Change from Baseline is post-Baseline value minus Baseline value. A decrease from Baseline indicates a worsening. Only those participants available at the specified time points were analyzed (represented by n=X, X in the category titles).</description>

        <description>The global assessment questions consist of 2 questions, recording how much the participant perceives his sexual life has changed and how he perceives his ability to achieve and maintain erections has changed, compared to how it was before he began receiving treatment in this study. The wording of these questions were based on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement questionnaire, which was validated for use in the assessment of improvement in stress urinary incontinence. The questions were scored on a 7-point scale.The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the DB treatment start.</description>

The questions were scored on a 7-point scale.The Baseline assessment was defined as the latest assessment on or before the OL treatment start.</description>
