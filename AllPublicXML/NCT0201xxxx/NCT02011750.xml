  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory study in Egypt that will combine a treatment trial among early course
      schizophrenia (ECSZ) patients with key analyses suggested by rodent studies. Specifically,
      the study will test the provocative results from animal studies indicating an impact of
      Toxoplasma Gondii (TOX) exposure on novelty seeking. The study will also test whether
      exposure to TOX is associated with other cognitive and behavioral changes, as well as changes
      in overall social function. We will also explore the relative efficacy of Sodium Valproate
      (Depakote, DEP) in improving clinical and overall social function among TOX exposed and
      unexposed patients.

      Hypotheses

        1. At baseline, TOX exposure is associated with increased novelty seeking, clinical
           severity, and impaired cognitive and overall social function in patients with SZ.

        2. Adjunctive DEP treatment improves clinical symptoms, cognitive and social function in
           SZ, particularly among TOX exposed SZ patients.

        3. Exploratory hypothesis: adjunctive DEP reduces serological indices of TOX infection (VIP
           and TH levels).

    <description>Cognitive domains will be assessed using the Arabic version of the Penn Computerized Neuropsychological Battery (CNB), which includes cognitive measures that distinguish SZ cases and relatives from controls. Accuracy and response time are recorded.</description>

    <measure>Social Functioning assessed via the Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Social functioning will be assessed during week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Social functioning will be assessed via the Short Form, a multi-item scale that consists of 8 scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight.</description>

    <description>Sodium Valproate treatment:During the entry period, all patients will have a placebo run-in for two weeks after which they will be evaluated for the outcome variables and then randomized to either Sodium Valproate (Depakote, DEP) or placebo (PLA) group in a 1:1 proportion. For the Sodium Valproate treatment grou, this will be followed by a two week period to adjust the dose of DEP and attain therapeutic levels (50-100 µg/mL). Then DEP treatment will continue for 16 more weeks, after which DEP will be discontinued. Subject will be followed up for four weeks post-DEP discontinuation to monitor delayed adverse side effects.</description>

For the PLA group, this will be followed by a two week period of placebo during which members of the experimental Sodium Valproate (Depakote/DEP) will have DEP dose adjusted to attain therapeutic levels (50-100 µg/mL). Then PLA treatment will continue for 16 more weeks. Subjects will be followed up for four weeks post PLA-discontinuation to monitor for delayed adverse side effects.</description>
