  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adrenal masses are highly prevalent and detected with high frequency by conventional imaging.
      Conventional imaging often fails to rule out a malignant lesion. Accordingly, most hormonally
      inactive adrenal masses removed by surgery are benign adenomas for which surgical removal is
      unnecessary and poses an avoidable risk to the patients. We hypothesize that the combination
      of FDG-PET and 123I-Iodometomidate imaging has the potential to noninvasively identify benign
      adrenocortical adenomas with high accuracy, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgery. Uptake of
      123I-Iodometomidate by the adrenal mass demonstrates the presence of CYP 11B enzymes which
      specifically bind metomidate with high avidity establishing the adrenocortical origin of the
      lesion, while low uptake of FDG-PET in an adrenocortical lesion establishes its benign nature
      and excludes the presence of adrenocortical cancer (ACC). The proposed trial will assess the
      sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of the combined imaging for
      the diagnosis of adrenocortical adenoma. A secondary focus is on the performance of the
      combined test for differentiating ACC from non-ACC lesions. We expect that the results of our
      trial will help to greatly reduce the need for surgery in hormonally inactive adrenal masses.

      Histopathology of a surgically removed adrenal mass by an expert surgeon is considered to be
      the gold standard for the differential diagnosis of an adrenal neoplasia. Thus we will only
      recruit patients scheduled for surgery for an adrenal mass of uncertain origin. Patients will
      be eligible for the trial when an adrenal mass has been discovered and standard imaging (CT
      and/or MRI) has not led to a clear characterization of the malignant potential of the lesion
      (Hounsfield units in unenhanced CT ≥10). In addition, patients with adrenal neoplasia will be
      only recruited when a hormonally active lesion has been excluded and surgery is planned
      because of a perceived risk of malignancy. Patients will be evaluated by both
      [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT. Computed tomography will be
      performed as low dose CT of the adrenal region. Imaging can be started with either
      [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT or [18F]fluoro- deoxyglucose PET/CT and can be performed at two
      consecutive days. The time interval between [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and
      [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT should not exceed 6 weeks. Patients will have a follow up
      visit 2-4 weeks after [123I]Iodometomidate SPECT/CT and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (or
      immediately before surgery, if earlier than 2 weeks post imaging). Thirty days after surgery
      patients will be contacted by phone for assessment of adverse events related to surgery.

    <description>Diagnostic study with combined FDG-PET and 123I-IMTO imaging in which an indeterminate adrenal mass with negative FDG-PET test (FDG-) and positive 123I-IMTO test (IMTO+) is diagnosed as a benign adrenocortical adenoma (AA+). Primary efficacy endpoint: Specificity (rate estimation) of the diagnostic AA test and likelihood ratio of a positive diagnostic test (using rate estimation of the sensitivity). The outcome measure does not assess a change but the diagnostic accuracy of both FDG-PET and IMTO imaging.</description>

    <description>Sensitivity of the diagnostic adrenocortical adenoma (AA) test and likelihood ratio of a negative diagnostic AA test, a priori rates of AA, adrenocortical cancer (ACC) and other benign as well as malignant indeterminate adrenal neoplasias. Detection rates similar to sensitivity and specificity for ACC and indeterminate adrenal neoplasias other than AA and ACC of combined 18F-FDG-PET imaging and 123I-Iodometomidate imaging in identifying ACC. Predictive values will be determined and economic analysis of cost effectiveness of diagnostic evaluation versus surgery for all indeterminate lesions will be performed.
