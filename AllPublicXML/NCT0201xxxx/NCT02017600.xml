  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator will assign 53 patients who had been histologically proven localized squamous
      cell carcinoma of esophagus to receive the induction chemotherapy regimen of ND-420 50 mg/m2
      on day 1, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day1, plus fluorouracil 700 mg/m2 daily, day1 to day4, every
      3 weeks for 2 cycles and then followed by surgical resection. The successful rate of complete
      treatment per protocol and complete resection will be the primary variant to evaluate in our
      study.

             angina, arrhythmia, acute myocardial disease or other types of heart disease requiring
             treatment) within 6 months period preceding entry into the study; Uncontrolled
             infection (e.g. active infection that uncontrolled for 2 weeks under antibiotic
             therapy); Retention of body fluid (e.g. pleural effusion, ascites, pericardial
             effusion, and edema needing treatment); History of other than esophageal cancer,
             except curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer or in situ carcinoma of the
             esophagus; and other conditions which will be judged by physician's discretion.
