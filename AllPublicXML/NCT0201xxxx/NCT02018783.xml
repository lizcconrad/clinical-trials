  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of three desensitizing toothpastes for
      immediate and intermediate-term relief of CDH, when compared with a control toothpaste. One
      hundred and thirty-eight hypersensitive teeth were diagnosed and randomized into four groups
      according to the therapeutic agent of each desensitizing cream tested: 1) strontium acetate
      and calcium carbonate, 2) calcium carbonate and arginine 8%, 3) calcium phosphate
      nanoparticles and 4) a control toothpaste. The desensitizing creams were applied according to
      the manufacturer's instructions. Cervical dentin hypersensitivity was assessed at baseline,
      immediately, 24 hours and 30 days after the treatment. Cold and evaporative tests were used
      to assess the sensitivity level.
