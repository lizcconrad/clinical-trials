  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, open-label, 3-group, fixed-sequence drug-drug interaction
      study to assess the effect of coadministration of multiple-dose itraconazole or diltiazem on
      the single-dose PK of AZD3293 and the effects of coadministration of single- and
      multiple-dose AZD3293 on the single-dose PK of midazolam. The study will also evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of single and multiple oral doses of AZD3293, alone and in
      combination with itraconazole, diltiazem, and midazolam in healthy young subjects.AZD3293 is
      being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease

    <description>In Group 1, serial blood samples for AZD3293 plasma concentrations will be collected from predose to 96 hours after administration of AZD3293 on Day 1 and from predose to 144 hours after study drug administration on Day 8.
