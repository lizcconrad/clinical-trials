    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate FebriDx, a point-of-care, non-invasive, rapid
      diagnostic test, at identifying an immune response to viral and bacterial infection related
      to an acute community acquired febrile upper respiratory infection, as compared to expert
      clinical reviewers' evaluation in conjunction with the results of clinical standardized
      microbiologic and laboratory testing.

    <description>Positive agreement is the proportion of true positive cases of the FebriDx test compared to expert clinical reviewers' evaluation and the results of clinical standardized microbiologic, and laboratory testing. Negative agreement is the proportion of true negative cases of the FebriDx test compared to expert clinical reviewers' evaluation and the results of clinical standardized microbiologic and laboratory testing.</description>
