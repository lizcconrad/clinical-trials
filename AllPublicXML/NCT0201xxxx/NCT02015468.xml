  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, randomized study investigating the possible benefits of immediate mobilization
      and frequent physiotherapy following a wrist fracture treated by volar plating.

      The current study will test the following null hypothesis:

      There is no significant difference between patients who receive a cast for the first 2 weeks
      postoperatively and then instructions in home exercises and patients who receive a cast for
      2-3 days postoperatively and then have frequent sessions with a physiotherapist following
      volar locked plating for a extraarticular distal radius fracture, as evaluated by
      self-reported satisfaction after 3 months.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will focus on patients treated with volar locked plating following an
      extraarticular distal radius fracture.

      In a prospective manner the investigators intend to analyze hand function, x-ray and other
      parameters in order to investigate whether early mobilization and a targeted program of
      physiotherapy postoperatively leads to a better functional result and earlier return to a
      normal activity level. The investigators analysis will also focus on the safety of early
      mobilization with regards to possible detrimental effects on the osteosynthesis, bony union,
      associated soft-tissue injuries and functional outcome. The investigators also intend to
      assess the cost of more intensive follow-up and physiotherapy and do a cost-benefit
      evaluation.
