    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well combination chemotherapy works in treating younger
      patients with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic desmoplastic medulloblastoma. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etoposide, and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate of the progression free survival (PFS) distribution for patients 0-&lt;4 years of
      age with M0 desmoplastic medulloblastoma (nodular desmoplastic or medulloblastoma with
      extensive nodularity) treated with the modified HIT SKK regimen (excluding the use of
      intraventricular methotrexate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the feasibility of a rapid central pathology screening review for treatment
      allocation according to histology and assess agreement between institutional and central
      pathology review diagnoses as well as among central pathology review diagnoses.

      II. Prospectively evaluate the molecular profile of nodular desmoplastic (ND)/medulloblastoma
      with extensive nodularity (MBEN) medulloblastoma in young children.

      III. Monitor and describe the neurocognitive and adaptive functioning of young children with
      ND/MBEN medulloblastoma treated on this protocol using the ALTE07C1 protocol.

      OUTLINE:

      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute or
      infused via minibag on days 1, 15, and 29; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3;
      methotrexate IV over 24 hours on days 15 and 29; etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days
      43-45; and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 43-45. Treatment repeats every 63 days for 3
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute or infused via
      minibag on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, etoposide IV over 60-120
      minutes on days 21-23, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 21-23. Treatment repeats every
      42 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36,
      48, 60, and 72 months.
