  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unicompartmental knee replacements are performed to treat osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis of
      the knee especially when it affects only the medial femoro-tibial compartment. To place the
      prosthesis, bone removal is necessary. The orientations of the bony cuts directly influence
      the position of the different elements of the prosthesis and the limb alignment. It is known
      that good positioning of the prosthesis is the key of a good survival of the implants. To
      guide the blade of the saw, cutting guides are used. The position of these guides gives the
      final position of the cuts. At present, two main techniques are used to position the guides:
      the conventional one, not very costly but not very accurate, and the navigated procedure,
      which is more accurate but also more expensive and more invasive. Since few years, patient
      specific cutting guides are used in total knee replacement with encouraging results and more
      recently in uni compartmental knee replacement with no scientific proof of efficiency.

      This study aims to validate the procedure of patient specific cutting guides.

      30 patients will be included in a mono centric, single-arm study with evaluation of the
      primary outcome by an independent expert comity. Each participant will have an MRI which will
      be sent to the society in charge of creating the patient specific cutting guides. The
      intervention will be performed using the patient specific cutting guides and in parallel, a
      station of navigation will be used to provide a safety control of the orientation of the
      cutting guide and to collect per operative data.

      Evaluation visit is performed 6 months after surgery.

    <description>Success is defined as a correct orientation of the tibial cut which has to be within patient's target value (± 2°) at 6 months in both the frontal and the sagittal plans.
Failure of prosthesis implantation (defined by outranging patient's target value of more than 4º in the frontal or the sagittal plan or more than 3 mm on the cutting depth, controled by per operative navigated procedure) is considered as treatment failure.</description>
