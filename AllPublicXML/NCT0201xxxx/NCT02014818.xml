  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To treat patients with stable coronary artery disease, elective percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) will be performed with the use of an everolimus-eluting cobalt- chromium
      stent (everolimus-eluting stent: EES, Xience Prime, Xpedition), which is the current standard
      drug-eluting stent (DES). Vascular responses at the site of stent placement will be evaluated
      by optical coherence tomography (OCT) at 1 or 3 months and at 12 months after stent
      placement, along with observation of changes over time in the target vessel. The
      relationships between OCT findings and the time course of platelet aggregation and between
      OCT findings and the occurrence of major cardio- cerebrovascular events will also be
      elucidated.
