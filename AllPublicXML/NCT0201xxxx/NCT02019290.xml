  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-center, open-label, inpatient/outpatient, fixed-sequence study
      examining the effect of multiple doses of bitopertin on single doses of Midazolam in healthy
      volunteers.

      A single oral dose on Midazolam (7.5 mg) will be administered on Day 1 after an overnight
      fast. Daily oral doses of bitopertin will be given under fed conditions from Days 2-13 and
      after fasting on Day 14. Oral doses of bitopertin and Midazolam (7.5 mg) will be
      co-administered on Day 15, after an overnight fast.

      Pharmacokinetics will be assessed throughout. Total time on treatment is expected to be 15
      days.
