      To evaluate the effect of daily ingestion of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri on the
      levels of secretory IgA and the cytokines Il1-beta, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in saliva of healthy
      young adults.

      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over design separated by three weeks run-in
      and wash-out periods. Each intervention period is three weeks and the participants are
      allocated to the test and placebo regimes in a randomized order.

      Material: 41 healthy adults are enrolled after informed consent from the School of Dentistry,
      University of Copenhagen.

      Methods: Samples of resting, unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva
      (SWS) are collected five times during the study period. The samples are immediately frozen in
      0.5 ml aliquots.

      Intervention: The subjects are instructed to ingest two tablets containing Lactobacillus
      reuteri or placebo, twice daily for 3 weeks. No probiotic food or health products are allowed
      during the intervention period. All normal oral hygiene routines should be maintained during
      the entire study. The compliance is checked through interviews. Any perceived side effects
      are reported without delay to the research staff.

      Endpoints: The concentration of total protein and secretory IgA in saliva are determined with
      the enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of the cytokines IL1-beta, IL-6,
      IL-8 and IL-10 is determined by Luminex-technology.

      Scientific importance: The study may provide evidence that probiotic supplements can
      influence the innate defense system in the whole saliva which may open up for novel
      strategies to combat oral diseases.
