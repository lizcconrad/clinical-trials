    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how safe LY2969822 (study drug) is and whether it
      causes any side effects. The study will also measure how much of the study drug gets into the
      blood stream and how long it takes the body to get rid of the study drug. This is the first
      time that this study drug is being given to participants. This study is for research purposes
      only and is not intended to treat any medical condition.

      Participants in Part A will complete three study periods, which together will last about 40
      days. Participants in Parts B and C will complete one study period which will last about 17
      days, but the total study time is about 40 days. Each participant may only enroll in one
      part. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the start of the study for all
      participants.
