  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule
      (SPN). This is an important group of patients because if it is lung cancer, presentation as a
      SPN represents early disease, which following surgery has a high 5 year survival rate.
      However as not all SPNs are lung cancer it would be unethical to biopsy every case. Clinical
      guidelines recommend that SPNs should undergo an initial (FDG)-PET/CT scan, which may give
      more information about the SPN and may indicate if it is likely to be lung cancer. However in
      many cases it does not and current practice is to monitor the SPN with a series of CT scans
      over 2 years to look for changes or growth which may/ but not always indicate lung cancer. If
      no changes are observed over 2 years the SPN is considered not lung cancer. This is both
      expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) and worrying for the patient in terms of
      monitoring CT costs and delayed treatment due to length of time to diagnosis.

      This study examines the diagnostic capacity of using a different CT scan. Dynamic Contrast
      Enhanced -CT(DCE-CT). DCE-CT and FDG-PET/CT scans give different information about the SPN
      and the investigators will look to see if information from either scan or combined
      information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early stage lung cancer. The
      investigators will also undertake a review of previous studies that have used these scans and
      use data from both the review and the trial to look at the cost effectiveness of using DCE-CT
      in the diagnosis of SPN.

      The trial will recruit 375 people who have a SPN detected by a normal CT scan which requires
      a FDG-PET/CT scan. In addition they will receive a DCE-CT scan either on the same day or
      within three weeks of the FDG-PET/CT scan. This is the only extra procedure that will take
      place to normal NHS care, however we will collect clinical and outcome data over the next two
      years.

      The study is coordinated by Southampton University clinical trials unit. Recruitment between
      January 2013 - April 2016, from up to 14 UK sites. Data analysis and conclusions are expected
      by the end of 2018.

      The study is funded by the NIHR-HTA

      Indication: Lung Cancer

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine with high precision, the diagnostic performances of DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET/CT
           in the NHS for the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs).

        -  To use decision analytic modelling to assess the likely costs and health outcomes
           resulting from incorporation of DCE-CT into management strategies for patients with
           SPNs.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess, within an NHS setting, the incremental value of incorporating the CT
           appearances of a SPN into the interpretation of integrated PET/CT examinations.

        -  To assess whether combining DCE-CT with 18FDG-PET/CT is more accurate and/or
           cost-effective, in the characterisation of SPNs, than either test used alone or in
           series.

        -  To document the nature and incidence of incidental extra-thoracic findings on
           18FDG-PET/CT undertaken for the characterisation of SPNs and model their impact on
           cost-effectiveness.

      Rationale:

      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule
      (SPN) on diagnostic imaging tests. This is an important group of patients because
      presentation as a SPN represents early disease with high 5 year survival rates following
      surgical resection. However, not all SPNs are due to lung cancer and the accurate
      characterisation of SPNs for diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is a diagnostic challenge
      with significant associated health costs.

      Widely adopted clinical guidelines for the subsequent investigation of SPNs recommend serial
      CT scans to look for subsequent growth with biopsy to confirm diagnosis. UK, National
      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend 18FDG-PET for the
      assessment of SPN in cases where a biopsy is not possible or has failed.

      DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET scans give different information about the SPN. Information from either
      scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early stage
      lung cancer.

      Trial Design: Prospective Observational

      Sample size: 375

      Non-CTIMP:Non interventional trial

      Concomitant Therapy: As per local practice

      Primary Trial Endpoints:

      Primary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity,
      specificity, accuracy) for 18FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CT in relation to a subsequent clinical
      diagnosis of lung cancer. The outcome measures used in the economic model will include
      accuracy, estimated life expectancy, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs will be
      estimated from an NHS perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will compare
      management strategies with DCE-CT to strategies without DCE-CT.

      Secondary Trial Endpoints:

      Secondary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics for 18FDG-PET/CT with
      incorporation of CT appearances and combined DCE-CT/18FDG-PET. The incidence of incidental
      extra-thoracic findings on 18FDG-PET/CT, subsequent investigations and costs will also be
      determined.

      Total Number of Sites: up to 14

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  A soft tissue solitary dominant pulmonary nodule of ≥ 8mm and ≤30mm on axial plane

          -  If clinicians and reporting radiologists believe the patient is being treated as
             having a single pulmonary nodule and there are other small lesions &lt;4mm that would
             normally be disregarded, the patient should be included in the trial.

          -  Nodules already under surveillance can be included provided they have a recent or
             scheduled FDG-PET/CT18 years of age or over at time of providing consent

          -  History of malignancy within the past 2 years

          -  Confirmed aetiology of the nodule at the time of qualifying CT scan - As this is a
             diagnostic study, should the aetiology of the nodule be confirmed by investigation
             such as FDG-PET/CT or bronchoscopy prior to consent the patient remains eligible as
             the intention to include is made on the analysis of the qualifying CT scan.
