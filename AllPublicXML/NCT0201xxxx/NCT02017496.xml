      The study explores the safety of breast conserving treatment (BCT)(defined as complete
      removal of tumor deposits) after neoadjuvant treatment for locally advanced breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard breast surgical procedure of locally advanced breast cancer in Norway is
      mastectomy. There is increasing interest in performing breast conserving treatment (BCT) in
      locally advanced cases after chemotherapy or hormonal treatment - if there is a partial or
      complete clinical remission. To increase the evidence for the safety (no residual tumor) of
      such a procedure directly compared to mastectomy without compromising the safety of the
      treatment, a breast preserving procedure followed by an immediate mastectomy can be performed
      within a study. It would then be possible to study the margins after the breast preserving
      procedure as well as the tumor status in the rest of the breast.

      Patients included in the study will receive neoadjuvant treatment followed by evaluation of
      the tumor reduction by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and selection of BCT candidates.
      Candidates will be prepared for BCT, and during the surgical procedure, BCT will be performed
      (as one surgical specimen) followed by immediate removal of the rest of the breast tissue
      (mastectomy). The BCT specimen and mastectomy specimen will be analysed for residual tumor
      cells. The tumor removal completeness of the BCT procedure can be evaluated, with comparison
      to the clinical and primary tumor characteristics, including analysis of the tumor biopsies
      and imaging before and during the neoadjuvant treatment, for selection of candidates for BCT
      in the future.

      Sampling of primary tumor DNA and RNA is not included as a study specific procedure, but if
      the patient is included in a different ongoing protocol with tumor sampling, there is
      approval/allowance for using tumor tissue for the purpose of the current study
      (characteristics of the primary tumor that may predict residual tumor pattern and BCT
      success)

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Patients with locally advanced breast cancer (cT3-4c, N0-3) with tumors &gt; 5 cm, as
             determined by MRI, where the present guidelines include them for neoadjuvant systemic
             therapy

          -  Written informed consent (informed consent document to be approved by the Independent
             Ethics Committee) prior to study-related procedures and examinations.

          -  Female age &gt; 18 years

          -  Able to comply with the protocol

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologist's physical status category 1 or 2 before surgery.
             Category 1 and 2 includes healthy patients and patients with only mild systemic
             disease, whereas category 3 includes patients with more serious systemic diseases (but
             still operable).

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Inflammatory breast cancer or diffuse locoregional involvement of the skin

          -  Stage IV - metastatic disease

          -  Locoregional relapse of earlier breast cancer

          -  Inability (irrespective of reason) to receive the recommended neoadjuvant treatment, -
             as decided by the treating physician.

          -  American Society of Anesthesiologist's physical status category 4-5
