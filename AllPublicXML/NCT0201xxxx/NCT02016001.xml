      to identify the Effective Fluoride Concentration In Toothpaste For Dental Caries Prevention
      after 18 months of randomized controlled trial.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries, well-controlled clinical trials have investigated the effective
      fluoride level in toothpaste and provided irresistible data in relation to the caries
      controlling efficacy of tooth pastes. But there has been no such data reported in our part of
      the world. This indicates the need to determine the effective concentration of fluoride in
      locally manufactured tooth pastes for accomplishment of the goal of prevention against dental
      caries.

      This will be a Parallel Group, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial, over a period of 18
      months. The study will be conducted in a randomly selected school of Karachi city.
      Participants will be the cohort of regular school children aged 12-14 years. Sample size for
      the present study attained was 330 (165 in both groups), expected attrition rate will be kept
      as 15%, so the total sample size is 330 + 50 = 380 (190 in each group).
