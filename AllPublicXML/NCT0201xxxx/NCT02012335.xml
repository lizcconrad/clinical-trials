  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether combination of ketamine plus
      electroconvulsive therapy improves depressive symptoms decreasing cognitive side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the clinical response to brief pulse ECT with infusion of ketamine
      0.5 mg/kg versus brief pulse electroconvulsive therapy with infusion of placebo (saline) in
      major depression. We also will compare levels of cognitive impairment among these groups,
      compare levels of quality of life among these groups, compare levels of BDNF among these
      groups. We also will study if levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are associated with cognitive
      impairment in subjects undergoing ECT.
