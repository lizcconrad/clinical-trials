      This is a monocenter, open-label, uncontrolled study in accordance with §23b MPG to evaluate
      the efficacy of the HIFU-treatment of fibroadenoma using the TH-One device

      Objectives Primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of HIFU in the treatment of the breast
      fibroadenoma using the TH-One device Secondary objective: To evaluate the tolerability of the
      HIFU using the TH-One device

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female patients 18 years or older with at least one diagnosed breast fibroadenoma.

          -  Diagnosis of fibroadenoma must be based on:

               -  clinical examination,

               -  women ≤ 40 years of age: ultrasound image alone; women &gt; 40 years of age:
                  ultrasound image and mammogram,

               -  histological confirmation of fibroadenoma of the breast.

          -  Patient's fibroadenoma size as determined by ultrasound imaging: the longest diameter
             is limited to 25 mm.

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test within 72
             hours prior to HIFU treatment.

          -  Patient must be able to understand the nature and the extent of the study and the
             procédures required and be willing and able to complete the screening and study
             procedures.

          -  Patient must give written informed consent (personally signed and dated) before
             completing any study-related procedure.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who is pregnant or breast-feeding.

          -  Patient with history of ipsilateral breast cancer within 5 years prior to study
             inclusion or radio therapy to the target breast within 5 years prior to study
             inclusion.

          -  Patient with implant on the treated breast.

          -  Patient with target fibroadenoma pre-treated by cryoablation or interstitial laser
