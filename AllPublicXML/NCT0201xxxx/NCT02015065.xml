  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      -Some people with wild-type gastrointestinal stromal tumors (WT-GIST) have a deficiency in
      one of their proteins called SDH. Vandetanib is a cancer drug that has been approved to treat
      thyroid cancer and has been used with some success in other tumors that have a similar loss
      of SDH. Researchers want to see if this drug can also decrease tumor growth in people with
      WT-GIST.

      Objectives:

      -To test whether the study drug will benefit people with WT-GIST.

      Eligibility:

      -Adults and children 3 years old and older with WT-GIST.

      Design:

        -  Researchers will test participants tumor tissue to confirm it is the wild type of GIST.

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.
           They will also have electrical recording of the heart (ECOG) and scans of the tumor.

        -  Participants will take the study drug in 28-day cycles. Their doctor will decide how
           many cycles they can complete.

             -  They will take the study drug once every day and record it in a diary.

             -  On Day 14, they will also visit their doctor to look for side effects.

        -  Before cycles 2, 3 and 4, participants will have a physical exam, urine tests, blood
           pressure check, and blood tests. These tests will then be done periodically for as long
           as they are in the study.

        -  Before cycle 4, scans will be done to check the size of the cancer. Most of these will
           be repeated every 3-6 cycles.

        -  When they stop taking the study drug, participants will return to the clinic for a
           physicial exam and blood tests.

      Background:

        -  Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the
           gastrointestinal tract, resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation therapy. KIT
           and PDGFRA mutations have been identified as tumor initiating events in 85% of adult
           patients with GIST, but 85% of GISTs in pediatric patients lack KIT and PDGFRA mutations
           (wild-type) and imatinib is not as effective in eliciting objective responses.

        -  Recent work in the Pediatric and Wild-Type (wt) GIST Clinic at the NCI led to the
           identification of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) germline mutations in 12% patients with
           wt-GIST (6/34). SDH protein expression evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) was
           markedly decreased or absent in 18/18 patients with pediatric wt-GIST. Thus the majority
           of wt-GIST are SDH-deficient. Vandetanib (ZACTIMA; ZD6474; AstraZeneca) is an oral small
           molecule antineoplastic drug that inhibits VEGFR2, EGFR, and RET-dependent signaling.
           Preliminary preclinical data demonstrate marked growth inhibition of
           SDH-mutant/deficient renal cell carcinoma cell lines when treated with vandetanib.

      Objective(s):

      -Primary: To assess the clinical activity (radiographic response RECIST v1.1) of vandetanib
      in children and adults with wt-GIST using RECIST (v1.1).

      Eligibility:

      -Adults and children with measurable localized or metastatic wt-GIST confirmed in a CLIA
      laboratory will be eligible for trial participation. Patients must have measurable disease by
      RECISTv1.1 and adequate organ function.

      Design:

        -  This phase II trial will determine whether daily oral vandetanib is active in patients
           with wt-GIST. Vandetanib activity will be assessed primarily by radiographic response of
           measurable disease using RECISTv1.1.

        -  Vandetanib will be administered orally once daily continuously in the absence of
           toxicity or disease progression, using a 28-day cycle.

        -  Patients will be carefully monitored for toxicity and response. A small, optimal
           two-stage phase II design with a target response rate of 25% will be used. Nine
           evaluable patients will be enrolled initially. If 1 or more of the first 9 have a
           response, then accrual would continue until a total of 24 patients have enrolled. If
           there are 3 or more responses in 24 (12.5% or more) patients, then this would be
           sufficiently interesting activity to warrant further study.

             consent form [ICF]) and for 3 months after the last dose of vandetanib to prevent
             pregnancy. In addition, oral contraceptives, approved contraceptive implant, long-term
             injectable contraception, intrauterine device, or tubal ligation are allowed. Oral
             contraception alone is not acceptable; additional barrier methods in conjunction with
             spermicide must be used.

          -  Male patients must be surgically sterile or using an acceptable method of
             contraception (defined as barrier methods in conjunction with spermicides) for the
             duration of the study (from the time they sign the ICF) and for 4 months after the
             last dose of vandetanib to prevent pregnancy in a partner.]

          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.

        Informed Consent:

        Procurement for the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pediatric Oncology Branch (POB)
        Clinical Research Protocols) prior to participating in studies required to determine
        eligibility for this trial. After confirmation of eligibility, participants who are greater
        than or equal to 18 years of age or LAR of minor participants must sign an informed consent
        document for this trial, indicating that they are aware of the investigational nature of
        the proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of participating and the alternatives to
        participating, prior to the conduct of any study procedures.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Presence of any of the following will prevent a subject from participation:

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding females because vandetanib may be harmful to the developing
             fetus or nursing infant and has been found to be embryotoxic, fetotoxic and
             teratogenic in rats.

          -  Subjects who are receiving any other investigational agents or who have received an
             investigational agent within 28 days prior to enrollment (does not apply to
             participation in survival follow up), or who have previous exposure to vandetanib.

          -  Abnormal Electrolyte Levels: Participants with a serum potassium less than 3.5 mmol/L
             or a serum ionized calcium or magnesium below the lower limits of normal (or above
             CTCAE Grade 1 upper limit). Correction of these electrolyte abnormalities with
             supplements is allowed. (Serum calcium above the CTCAE Grade 1 upper limit. In cases
             where the serum calcium is below the normal range, the calcium adjusted for albumin is
             to be obtained and substituted for the measured serum value. Exclusion is to then be
             based on the calcium adjusted for albumin values falling below the normal limit:
             Corrected Calcium = Ca + 0.8 x (4-serum albumin).)

          -  Presence of hypertension: Diastolic blood pressure above the 95% for age in children
             (Appendix 2) and &gt; 160 mmHg systolic or &gt;100 mmHg diastolic in adults on at least 2 of
             3 measurements with an appropriate-size cuff who are unable to achieve blood pressure
             control with optimal anti-hypertensive therapy. Patients who are treated with
             antihypertensive medications with good response are eligible.

        History of Cardiac Disorder:

          -  Participants with a history of arrhythmia (multifocal premature ventricular
             contractions, bigeminy, trigeminy, ventricular tachycardia, uncontrolled atrial
             fibrillation, left bundle branch block) that is symptomatic or requires treatment
             (except for controlled atrial fibrillation).

          -  History of any significant cardiac event (e.g. myocardial infarction), superior vena
             cava syndrome, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification of heart disease
             greater than or equal 2 within 12 weeks before starting treatment, or presence of
             cardiac disease that in the opinion of the Investigator increases the risk of
             ventricular arrhythmia.

          -  Participants with a history of congenitally prolonged QTc, a first degree relative
             with unexplained sudden death under 40 years of age, or a measured QTcB (Bazett s
             correction) longer than 480 msec on ECG. ECGs should be performed after correction of
             electrolyte abnormalities. Participants with a prolonged QTcB should have a repeat ECG
             twice, at least 24 hour apart, and the average of the 3 QTcBs should not exceed 480
             msec. History of QT prolongation associated with other medications that required
             discontinuation of that medication.

          -  Participants receiving a medication that has a known risk of QTc prolongation or is
             associated with Torsades de Pointes or any prohibited medications, concomitantly or
             within 14 days (28 days for levomethadyl) of enrollment.

          -  Impairment of gastrointestinal function or gastrointestinal disease that may
             significantly alter the absorption of vandetanib as evidenced by uncontrolled nausea,
             vomiting or diarrhea and/or current need for parenteral support with iron or Vitamin
             B.

          -  Other clinically severe or uncontrolled systemic illness or any concurrent condition
             that in the view of the principal investigator could compromise the participant s
             ability to tolerate vandetanib or could compromise study procedures or endpoints,
             including interstitial lung disease, drug-induced interstitial disease, radiation
             pneumonitis which required steroid treatment or any evidence of clinically active
             interstitial lung disease.

          -  Unstable brain metastases or spinal cord compression that requires treatment, unless
             the treatment ended at least 4 weeks before starting treatment and the condition has
             been stable without steroid treatment for at least 10 days.

          -  Major surgery (includes surgery that carries significant risk of blood loss, extended
             periods of general anesthesia, or requires at least an overnight hospital admission)
