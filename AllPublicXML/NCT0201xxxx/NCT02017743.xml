  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter post authorization observational study. Cancer patients diagnosed
      with non high risk VTE and are followed up in an outpatient setting will be treated with LMWH
      and the data will be recorded. Since this is an observational study there are no specific
      treatment protocols, i.e., patients will be treated according to the best investigator's
      criteria. Treatment protocol will be based on the routine treatment practice of the involved
      investigator. Patients to enroll will be cancer patients diagnosed for VTE and who are able
      to receive outpatient LMWH treatment. There will be no specific hypothesis to be tested.
