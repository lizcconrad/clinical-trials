    <textblock>
      This multi-center, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized placebo-controlled add-on clinical
      trial investigates the efficacy of aerobic exercise on cognitive performance and brain
      plasticity in remitted early phase schizophrenia. The aim is the enhancement of recovery with
      the use of 26 weeks of continuos endurance training (aerobic exercise) with stationary
      bicycles or a balance and tone program consisting of exercises for flexibility, core
      strength, balance and relaxation. Followed by a follow-up period of 26 weeks.

The findings are compared with data from healthy controls and non-diseased first-degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia who have been evaluated in other BMBF-funded studies (&quot;MooDS&quot;, &quot;IntegraMent&quot;). In addition, cross-sectional comparisons (TAU + Exercise vs. TAU + BKGT) and progress measurements to characterize treatment effects are planned.

    <description>By means of fMRI, the tasks resting activity, working memory, episodic memory, reward processing, social perspective takeover, emotion processing as well as ability to inhibit are to be investigated with already well pre-examined tasks.
A function measurement is performed at rest without stimulation (rsMRT), which provides information on the functional networking of different brain regions at rest (duration: approx. 5 minutes). There are also three fMRI surveys that record brain activity during simple psychological tasks. - The ability to inhibit (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus) is examined by means of a so-called flanker task. This is to respond to a specific target stimulus, which is surrounded by either the same (congruent) or by distracting (incongruent) stimuli. - Duration: 11 minutes</description>

    <measure>improvement of endurance capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months (at baseline, day 98, day 182 and day 365)</time_frame>
    <description>As part of the sports medical stress test, the determination of endurance performance in patients and control subjects takes place. For this examination, like in training, finder bike use and measurements of heart rate, lactate concentration and exertion sensation are performed. The ergometry is carried out as a Vita maxima examination, so it ends when the subjects can not or do not want to keep pedaling or when the termination criteria according to Steinacker &amp; Liu (2002) occur. From the examination, various submaximal and maximal parameters can be determined, have the validity for endurance performance and the training intensity can be determined. The examination is carried out under standardized and safe conditions and after a detailed medical history and physical examination to exclude contraindications.
Activity meters are used to control the physical activity of study participants outside the study intervention.</description>
