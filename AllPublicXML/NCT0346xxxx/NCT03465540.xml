        criteria

          -  NHL subjects only: Radiographically measurable disease with a clearly demarcated nodal
             lesion at least 1.5 cm in its largest dimension or a target extranodal lesion at least
             1.0 cm in its largest dimension

          -  AML subjects only: Pathologically confirmed diagnosis of AML as defined by the WHO
             Classification, More than 5% blasts in bone marrow

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤ 2

             clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption

          -  Hepatic function, as follows: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine
             aminotransferase (ALT) &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN), Total bilirubin (TBIL) &lt; 1.5
             X ULN (except subjects with Gilbert's syndrome)

          -  Cardiac function, as follows: Cardiac ejection fraction ≥ 50% and no evidence of
             pericardial effusion as determined by an ECHO or MUGA, No clinically significant ECG
             findings.

          -  Renal function as follows: Calculated or measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) of ≥ 30
             mL/minute calculated using the formula of Cockcroft and Gault [(140 - Age) × Mass (kg)
             / (72 × serum creatinine mg/dL)]. Multiply result by 0.85 if female.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             suggests occult hepatitis B. Positive Hepatitis C virus antibody (HCVAb): hepatitis C
             virus RNA by PCR is necessary. Detectable hepatitis C virus RNA suggests chronic
             hepatitis C

             include sexual abstinence (males, females); vasectomy; bilateral tubal
             ligation/occlusion; or a condom with spermicide (men) in combination with barrier
             methods (diaphragm, cervical cap, or cervical sponge), hormonal birth control or IUD
             (females)

          -  Females who are lactating/breastfeeding or who plan to breastfeed while on study
