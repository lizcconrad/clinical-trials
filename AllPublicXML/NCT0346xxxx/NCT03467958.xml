    <description>CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease with endoscopic localization to ileum and colon. CDEIS score considers 4 parameters (deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, surface involved by disease, and surface involved by ulcerations), each one evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score can be calculated even in case of incomplete investigations, as the results of the individual segments are divided by the number of segments investigated. The presence of stenosis, as a result of ulcer or not, increases the score at the end of the computation.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study:

        1. Subjects who are not in clinical response or clinical remission after completing 12
        weeks in the Induction Studies RPC01-3201 or RPC01-3202, subjects who experience relapse or
        who complete the Maintenance Study RPC01-3203, and subjects who complete a study of
        ozanimod for Crohn's Disease and meet the criteria for participation in the RPC01-3204
        Study will have the opportunity to participate in this study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:

        Exclusions Related to General Health:

          1. Subject has any clinically relevant hepatic, neurological, pulmonary,
             ophthalmological, endocrine, psychiatric, or other major systemic disease making
             implementation of the protocol or interpretation of the study difficult or that would
             put the subject at risk by participating in the study

          2. Subject is pregnant, lactating, or has a positive urine beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (β-hCG)

             diagnosis of macular edema

             Exclusions Related to Medications:

          5. Subject has received any of the following therapies since the first dose of IP in the

               -  treatment with lymphocyte-depleting therapies (eg, Campath®, anti-CD4,
                  cladribine, rituximab, ocrelizumab, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, total body
                  irradiation, bone marrow transplantation, alemtuzumab, daclizumab)

               -  treatment with a live vaccine within 4 weeks prior to Day 1 of this study

          6. Subject is currently receiving or requires initiation of any of the following
             therapies:

               -  treatment with corticosteroids at a dose that exceeds the prednisone equivalent
                  of &gt;40 mg

               -  treatment with immunomodulatory agents (eg, azathioprine, 6-MP, or methotrexate)

               -  chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (note: occasional use of
                  NSAIDs and acetaminophen [eg, headache, arthritis, myalgias, or menstrual cramps]
                  and aspirin up to 325 mg/day is permitted)

               -  treatment with Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs or treatment with 2 or
                  more agents in combination known to prolong PR interval

          7. Subject has ECG results showing any clinically significant abnormality on the last ECG
             of the previous study

          8. Liver function impairment or persisting elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 5 x upper limit of normal (ULN)

          9. Subject has a forced expiratory volume (FEV1) at 1 second or forced vital capacity
             (FVC) &lt; 50% of predicted values.

         10. Subject has confirmed absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) &lt; 200 cells/μL.
