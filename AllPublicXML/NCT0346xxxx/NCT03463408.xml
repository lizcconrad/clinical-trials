      Immunotherapy + Radiation in Resectable Soft Tissue Sarcoma
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single institution two cohort, open label, non-randomized study of neoadjuvant nivolumab
      and ipilimumab with concurrent radiation followed by surgical resection.

      Cohort A will comprise adult soft tissue sarcoma patents who consent to and receive
      ipilimumab + nivolumab concurrently with standard of care radiation. Ipilimumab will be given
      at a dose of 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks (total two doses) and nivolumab given as a flat dose of
      240 mg every 2 weeks (total four doses).

      Cohort B will comprise patients eligible for the trial who do not wish to receive
      immunotherapy but consent to the same blood draws, surveys, and specimen analysis as Cohort
      A. Cohort B will serve as a non-randomized but pragmatic and clinically relevant control
      group.

      Peripheral blood will be collected on day 1 pre-treatment, day 14, day 42, immediately prior
      to surgery, and at 3 month follow up. Peripheral blood will be sent for multidimensional flow
      analysis of changes in immune cell composition and markers of proliferation. Serum samples
      will be obtained before starting treatment and after surgery. Samples from select subjects
      whose resected tumors show significant response and whose tumors showed minimal response will
      be sent to Serametrix for serum profiling to detect antibody response to a panel of
      tumor-specific antigens.

      Standard surgical resection will be done 2 to 4 weeks after completion of radiotherapy.
      Accrual is expected to occur over 2 years. Follow up data will be collected for up to 3 years
      post-treatment.
