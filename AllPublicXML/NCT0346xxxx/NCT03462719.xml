  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess progression‑free survival (PFS) from treatment with
      ibrutinib plus venetoclax (I+VEN) compared with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (G-Clb) as
      assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is treatment with combination of I+VEN will result in longer PFS compared with
      G-Clb in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who meet International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) treatment criteria.
      The study includes screening (30 days), treatment (from randomization until treatment
      discontinuation) and follow-up phase (from treatment discontinuation until death, lost to
      follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first). Participants without
      progression will continue disease evaluations until disease progression or death. Study
      duration is approximately 6 years. Safety includes review of adverse events and laboratory
      tests performed over time.
