  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tumors are characterized by a great heterogeneity. Characterizing this intra-tumor
      heterogeneity is a major challenge in oncology to improve the therapeutic management and move
      towards personalized medicine adapted to each patient. However, intra-tumor heterogeneity
      remains rarely used for diagnostic purposes The discovery of an adrenal mass can occur in
      different circumstances. Detection of an adrenal mass can be done in a context of secreting
      syndrome, in the assessment of an extra-adrenal neoplasia or fortuitously when performing an
      imaging for another reason. The etiologies are numerous (cortical tumors, medullary tumors,
      metastatic lesion of a extra-adrenal neoplasia, others). The adrenal masses can be divided
      into two categories, depending on whether they are hyperfunctional or not. In patients
      without an oncological history, an adrenal mass discovered is most often a benign adenoma,
      but requires an endocrine assessment. In patients with known primary cancer, approximately
      30% of the adrenal masses are malignant.

      In all cases, the diagnostic procedure includes an imaging assessment to characterize the
      lesion and an endocrine assessment. CT scan performed without and after intravenous iodinated
      contrast agent injection is the first-line examination to assess an adrenal mass.

      18F-FDG-PET may be indicated as second-line for characterizing an adrenal mass. Adrenal tumor
      SUVmax (Standard Uptake Value) and adrenal tumor SUVmax / liver SUVmax ratio are routinely
      used to determine the malignancy of a lesion. Although very useful for assessing the glucose
      metabolism of a given lesion, these parameters do not allow assessing the heterogeneity of
      tumor uptake. The texture analysis corresponds to an analysis of the spatial distribution of
      FDG uptake, and allows, by the calculation of many indices, an evaluation of the
      heterogeneity of the tumors.

      The hypothesis of our study is that the texture parameters could have an additional
      diagnostic value to improve the performance of conventional quantitative parameters to
      determine the malignancy of a lesion.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of texture indices in a
      large cohort of patients presenting an adrenal lesion
