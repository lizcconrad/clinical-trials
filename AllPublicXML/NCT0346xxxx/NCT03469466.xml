  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of remotely guided US use by individuals without
      ultrasound training to assess for normal lung parenchyma in healthy volunteers. The untrained
      operators (operators) will perform US examinations of lung under the guidance of a medical
      professional (professional) with experience in ultrasound technique. The professional will
      guide the operator step by step on how to conduct an US exam of the 'patient's' lung. Images
      will then be saved and reviewed at a later time by an ultrasound expert to determine quality
      and clinical functionality in recognizing normal lung parenchyma. This simulation will be
      analogous to an untrained US operator assessing a potentially ill patient with the assistance
      of a remotely located physician. An example of this would be an astronaut with respiratory
      distress after experiencing a rapid decompression event being evaluated by another healthy
      astronaut by US under the guidance of the flight surgeon at Mission Control.

      Volunteers will meet with study personnel in the Clinical Skills Center at Stonybrook
      University. Informed consent will be obtained from all groups ('operators', 'patients',
      'clinicians'). A survey will be conducted to evaluate the subjects' prior experience in
      ultrasound. Subjects who qualify will continue to participate in the study.

      The 'patient' will initially be evaluated by US by an expert and 'ideal' images will be
      captured and stored for later comparison against those obtained by 'operators'.

      The 'operator' will be given an smart phone/table with video communication function and will
      be connected with the US 'expert', who will be located in a different room, physically and
      audibly out of range. For the first portion of the study, the 'expert' will instruct the
      'operator' on how to conduct an US exam limited to the lung. Using the two-way video and
      audio communication through the video communication application, the expert will guide to the
      operator on how to utilize the US machine, where to place the probe, and how to capture and
      save images. The 'patient' will be instructed not to assist the 'operator' in any way. For
      the second portion of the study, the 'operator' will utilize the US machine to conduct a
      similarly limited lung exam on themselves, again with the assistance of the 'expert' but no
      other study personnel.

      Finally, the 'clinicians' will carry out similarly limited lung exams on the 'patient', first
      without instruction from the 'expert' and then again under similar guidance as the previous
      portions of the study.

      During all portions of the study, time to image capture will be measured by observing
      personnel. All captured images will be sent to expert reviewers at which time a quality score
      will be generated. The score will be generated based off of the clinical utility of the
      image, general image quality, and several technical components of the image. Please see the
      accompanying Score Sheet for further details. Reviewers will be blinded as to the origin of
      the images ('operator' vs. 'clinician'). Scores obtained from 'operators' will be compared
      against those of 'clinicians'. Reviewers will be comprised of three experts in the field of
      US, all MDs who have received formal training in US and have at least 5 years of clinical US
      practice experience. Each captured image will be reviewed and scored by all three reviewers.

    <description>Ultrasound experts will blindly evaluate images obtained from both untrained and trained groups. Using the 'Ultrasound Quality Scorecard', evaluators will assess the quality of the image obtained and the technique carried out to obtain the image. These quality and technique criteria include 'Discernable Lung Parenchyma', 'Presence of A-lines', 'Lack of Obstruction from Rib Shadowing', 'Correct Probe Selection', Correct Depth Setting', 'Correct Gain Selection'. For each criterion (both quality and technique), a binary 'Yes/No' score will be given. Total 'Yes' scores will be summed for each ultrasound exam (minimum 0, maximum 6), with the higher number of 'Yes' responses signifying a higher quality ultrasound exam. Each ultrasound exam will be scored by three separate experts, with the average of the three scores being reported as the 'final score'.</description>
