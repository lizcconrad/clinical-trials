  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part 1 of the study will be conducted to provide additional information on the safety and
      tolerability of single doses of BOS172767 in healthy participants, to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles (including relative bioavailability) of BOS172767 following
      oral administration of 3 prototype formulations in healthy participants compared to an
      immediate release capsule formulation (reference), and also to determine the relative
      bioavailability of a selected BOS172767 prototype formulation in the fed and fasted states.

      Part 2 of the study will be conducted to provide additional information on the safety and
      tolerability of escalating single doses of the selected formulation of BOS172767 in healthy
      participants, to evaluate the PK profile following increased single doses of the selected
      formulation of BOS172767 following administration in healthy participants, and also to
      evaluate the dose linearity of the selected prototype.

      Part 3 of the study will be conducted to provide additional information on the safety,
      tolerability, and PK of the selected formulation of BOS172767 following multiple ascending
      doses (MADs) over 14 days of dosing in healthy participants.

  <detailed_description>

      Part 1 is comprised of a single-dose, part-randomized, open-label, 6-way crossover in 12
      healthy participants. Participants will be dosed on 6 separate occasions (in 6 treatment
      periods), and will receive a single prototype of BOS172767 in each treatment period.

      Part 2 is comprised of a single ascending dose, fixed-sequence, open-label, 3-way crossover
      with an optional fourth dosing period in 10 healthy participants. Participants will be dosed
      on 4 separate occasions (in 4 treatment periods), and will receive a single prototype of
      BOS172767 in each treatment period.

      Part 3 is a double-blind (sponsor-open), placebo-controlled, randomized MAD part in 36
      healthy participants (12 per study cohort). Participants will be dosed on 3 separate
      occasions (in 3 treatment periods), and will receive a single prototype of BOS172767 in each
      treatment period.

      Parts 2 and 3 are contingent upon successful completion of Part 1.
