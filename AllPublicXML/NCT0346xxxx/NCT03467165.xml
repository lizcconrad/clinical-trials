  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims at performing a pilot study to provide data on safety and potential
      efficacy of Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound Surgery (MRgFUS) in the treatment of
      pain caused by trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis (OA) and/or scaphotrapezial OA, and by hip
      OA, while exploring the potential application of MRgFUS to two different and central joints
      burdened by OA.

    <textblock>
      Pain caused by osteoarthritis is a matter of huge impact, in terms of quality of life, social
      and economic burden. Global aging of the population is going to worsen the problem. The hand
      is the most affected site in the upper limb, and involvement of the trapeziometacarpal joint
      is highly prevalent, with significant limitation of functionality when it happens. In the
      lower limb, the hip and the knee share the leading position in the clinical scenario, with
      the former being historically the most frequently submitted to joint replacement.

      At any site, the vast majority of joint replacement surgery procedures are performed because
      of pain. MRgFUS has recently demonstrated a great potential in treating pain caused by
      different medical conditions, including osteoarthritis. The aim of the work is to study the
      feasibility, the safety and the potential efficacy of MRgFUS in treating pain from
      osteoarthritis in two &quot;hot&quot; spots: the hip and the trapeziometacarpal/scaphotrapezial joint.
