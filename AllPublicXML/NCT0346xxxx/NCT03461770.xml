  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia-induced atelectasis is a well-known entity observed in approximately 68-100% of
      pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia. Infants and young children are more
      susceptible to this lung collapse due to their small functional residual capacity. Thus,
      intrapulmonary shunting caused by those atelectasis are more likely to occur during general
      anesthesia in infants and younger children than in adults. This problem predisposes children
      to hypoxemic episodes that can persist in the early postoperative period. Beyond the negative
      impact of atelectasis on gas exchange, mechanical ventilation induces a local inflammatory
      response in atelectatic lungs, even in healthy patients undergoing general anesthesia.

      Therefore, the diagnosis, prevention and active treatment of anesthesia-induced atelectasis
      are mandatory, not only to avoid hypoxemic episodes and atelectasis-related post-operative
      pulmonary complications, but also to protect the lungs during mechanical ventilation.
      Nowadays, the diagnosis of anesthesia-induced atelectasis is easily and accurately
      accomplished by lung ultrasound (LUS). LUS is a simple and non-invasive tool useful to detect
      atelectasis in children, to assess lung aeration and for monitoring ventilator settings or
      strategies. Regarding to the prevention of atelectasis, it was demonstrated that the
      application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during the induction of general
      anesthesia decreases atelectasis formation in adult morbidly obese patients.

      The investogators hypothesized that the use of CPAP during general anesthesia induction in
      pediatric patients can prevent or decrease atelectasis formation.

      Compare lung aeration between two different strategies of induction to general anesthesia:
      breathing throughout a facial mask without CPAP and breathing with 5 cmH20 of CPAP in
      pediatric patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia, using ultrasound imaging
      and a four-point-aeration score to assess the lung aeration.

    <description>Patients will receive anesthesia induction with Sevoflurane using a circular circuit without CPAP. Protective ventilation with 5 cmH20 of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) will be initiated after induction. At the end of surgery, mechanical ventilation will stop allowing spontaneous ventilation. Patients will be extubated without CPAP. Lung ultrasound examinations will be performed at different times-points: before anesthesia induction, during surgery, at the end of surgery and before extubation, and after extubation.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive anesthesia induction using 5 cmH20 of CPAP until the moment of intubation. After induction patients will receive the same protective ventilation than the control group. A lung recruitment maneuver will be applied if these patients present atelectasis during surgery. At the end of surgery, patients will be extubated under the modality of CPAP with 5 cmH20. Lung ultrasound examinations will be performed at different times-points: before anesthesia induction, during surgery, at the end of surgery and before extubation, and after extubation.</description>
