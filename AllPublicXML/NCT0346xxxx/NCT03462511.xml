  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many youth with chronic disease have difficulty taking medication every day and therefore do
      not receive full benefit from treatment. Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood
      disease that affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is
      the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves quality of
      life. The proposed study, a 5-site four-year randomized control trial (RCT), builds upon the
      investigators' recent feasibility study of the same title. Overall goals are reducing
      barriers to HU use and improving adherence for youth 10-18 years through creation of a daily
      medication habit. The goal of the proposed multi-site study is to test the efficacy of the
      HABIT intervention at 6 months and sustainability of the effect at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to medication adherence are common in youth with chronic illness and are a source of
      racial/ethnic disparities in underserved communities. An inherited blood disease, Sickle Cell
      Disease (SCD) is characterized by chronic and acute illness and reduced quality of life
      (QOL). It affects African Americans and other underserved communities. Hydroxyurea (HU) is
      the sole FDA-approved drug therapy for SCD and is highly effective and improves QOL. Poor
      adherence is common among youth and young adults with SCD.

      The importance of poor medication adherence, use of community-based health workers (CHWs) to
      bridge the gap between health services and underserved parent-youth dyads affected by SCD,
      the strength of the science, the success of the investigators' multi-ethnic feasibility
      study, and the potential application of study findings to youth with other serious chronic
      illnesses speak to the importance of this trial.
