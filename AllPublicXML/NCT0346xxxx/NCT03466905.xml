    <textblock>
      There is a need to reduce the number of ambulance transports to the Emergency Room to the
      patients who are not in need of urgent medical care. There are currently no studies and the
      aim of the study is to investigate if the ambulance transports to the Emergency Room can be
      reduced by a dialogue between a Registered Nurse in ambulance and a Medical Doctor in the
      Primary Care (called &quot;Ambulant assessment&quot;). In this connection there is also a need to
      follow up patients that not have been transported to the Emergency Room, secondary ambulance
      transport, relapse within 48 hours, type of examination and treatment and mortality.
