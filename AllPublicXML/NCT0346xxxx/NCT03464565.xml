      The purpose of this study is to collect real-world performance and safety data on the
      Penumbra System including the 3D Revascularization Device in patients with acute ischemic
      stroke (AIS) due to blockages of the large blood vessels in the brain.

      Registry Objective: The primary objective of this registry is to collect data on Penumbra
      System including the 3D Revascularization Device in a patient population with acute ischemic
      stroke (AIS) secondary to intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO).

      Registry Design: This will be a prospective, single-arm, multi-center observational registry
      and will include patients that present with either anterior or posterior LVO who are eligible
      for mechanical thrombectomy using the Penumbra System.

      Registry Duration: Subjects will be in the registry for approximately 90 days from enrollment
      to last follow-up.

      Data Management: Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) will be used at all investigational
      sites. All registry data will be entered into commercially available web-based electronic
      data capture system (EDC). Data entry will be performed by the study site personnel.
      Automated data quality checks will display warnings for invalid data. Additionally, manual
      review of data listings may be used to identify data discrepancies or inconsistencies.
