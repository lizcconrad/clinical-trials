  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cystic fibrosis require increased caloric intake to maintain appropriate
      growth, an important determinant of long-term outcomes. This study seeks to determine the
      feasibility of using a novel therapeutic food to promote weight gain and growth in children
      with cystic fibrosis.
