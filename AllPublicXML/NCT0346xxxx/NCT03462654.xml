  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the Lifestyle-Integrated Functional Exercise (LiFE) program, exercises to increase
      strength and improve balance are embedded into daily life activities. Recurring daily
      activities and tasks are used as prompts for these exercises so that they are performed
      multiple times per day. However, implementing the original LiFE program includes high
      financial requirements and human resources as it comprises one-to-one supervision of
      participants. Therefore, it is investigated whether implementing LiFE in groups (gLiFE) is
      not inferior to the individually delivered LiFE (iLiFE) in terms of reducing falls per
      physical activity. In addition, gLiFE is expected to be more cost-effective as compared to
      iLiFE. In a multicenter non-inferiority trial, 300 participants aged 70 years or older with
      confirmed fall risk will be randomized into either the iLiFE or gLiFE arm of the study. Both
      arms will undergo the same strength and balance exercises and habitualization strategies as
      described in the LiFE program, however, based on different approaches of delivery (i.e.,
      group vs. individual).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Lifestyle-integrated Functional Exercise&quot; (LiFE) program aims to promote safe indoor and
      outdoor mobility. It differs from classical exercise programs in that it trains and
      encourages participants to embed up to 15 balance and strength exercises into daily recurring
      tasks performed as part of the daily life routine. The LiFE program simultaneously aims at
      preventing falls and promoting an active lifestyle in older adults. As LiFE requires 1:1
      supervision by trainers who administer LiFE exercises during seven visits in the
      participants' homes, it is both time consuming and resource intensive and therefore not
      suitable for widespread implementation. Hence, the aim of this study is to compare a
      group-delivered LiFE intervention (gLiFE) with the original LiFE intervention (iLiFE). More
      specifically, gLiFE is tested for its non-inferiority compared to iLiFE in terms of:

        -  Effectiveness: The gLiFE program is not less efficacious than the established iLiFE
           program in terms of reducing fall incidence expressed as number of falls per amount of
           physical activity (e.g., steps).

        -  Retention rate: The gLiFE program does not result in a lower intervention retention rate
           (i.e., percentage of the sample completing the 6-month and 12-month follow-up
           assessment) as compared to the iLiFE program.

        -  Implementation: Delivering the gLiFE program is less costly and more cost-effective than
           delivering the iLiFE program.

      In a multicenter non-inferiority trial, participants (n = 300; &gt; 70 years; confirmed fall or
      high risk of falling) will be randomized into either the individual iLiFE (seven home visits)
      or gLiFE (groups up to twelve persons; seven group sessions).

    <description>In the individual LiFE (iLiFE), the program is taught in seven visits in the individuals' homes within eleven weeks. Participants are supervised in a face to face situation by one qualified trainer (physiotherapist or sports scientist). Each home visit takes between 1 and 1.5 hours. A total of five balance exercises, seven strength exercises for the lower extremities, and two exercises to increase physical activity are taught. In addition to the home visits, all participants receive two 'booster telephone calls' within the remaining weeks until the 6-month follow-up assessments.</description>

    <description>The group-based LiFE (gLiFE) program consists of seven group sessions (n = 8-12 participants) which are held over the course of eleven weeks, with a maximum duration of 2 hours per session. Each session is led by two qualified trainers (physio therapists or sports scientists), i.e., one main and one co-trainer. In all group sessions, trainers will teach the participants how to perform and integrate the LiFE program, i.e., LiFE balance and strength activities into their daily routines. After the group sessions have ended, participants will receive two 'booster telephone calls' within the remaining weeks until the 6-month follow-up assessments.</description>
