  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators examined the ability of orthopaedic surgeons to predict the
      outcome of surgery and non-operative treatment in patients (age 45 to 70) with a
      non-obstructive meniscal tear.

    <textblock>
      The additional benefits of Arthroscopic Partial Meniscectomy (APM) in middle aged patients
      with a non-obstructive meniscal tear are under scrutiny for years. Despite the most recent
      publications recommending to apply non-operative treatment (exercise therapy, injections,
      drugs) instead of APM in this patient group, the expected decrease in number of operations is
      slower then expected. Orthopaedic surgeons therefore seem unconvinced by the evidence to
      change practice.

      For this reason the investigators conducted an international survey amongst orthopaedic
      surgeons in which the investigators aimed to (1) determine the ability of orthopaedic
      surgeons to predict the outcomes of APM and physical therapy (PT) in middle aged patients
      with a non-obstructive meniscal tear, and (2) to determine which patient factors direct
      surgeons towards APM and towards PT.

    <description>In this survey, participants are provided with 20 cases and asked for their treatment of choice (APM or physical therapy). Subsequently, participants are asked for the expected outcome, which is change in knee function on the International Knee Documentation Committee 'Subjective Knee Form' (IKDC).
These data are used to assess to what extend orthopaedic surgeons are capable of predicting the outcome of surgical and non-operative treatment of meniscal tears in a random sample of patients from the Escape trial.</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>In this survey, participants are asked to choose from a list of patient specific factors, which of these direct their treatment choice toward APM, and which towards non-operative treatment.
These data are used to examine which patient specific factors are directing orthopaedic surgeons towards APM and towards PT. These factors will help future research focusing in creating patient specific profiles.</description>

        In this survey the investigators invited orthopaedic surgeons and residents from both the
        Netherlands and Australia to complete a meniscus survey, including a random sample of
        patients from the Escape trial. The in-/exclusion criteria are listed below.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients between 45 and 70 years of age at presentation.

          -  A meniscal tear visualized on MRI. The meniscal tear can either be isolated or
             combined with a partial asymptomatic Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury or an
             asymptomatic degenerative ACL shown on MRI with no abnormal clinical findings (a
             negative Lachman test and Pivot Shift).

          -  Mental Competence.

          -  Willingness to comply with follow up schedule.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Knee locking or trauma leading to acute surgery.

          -  One of the following associated injuries on the index knee:

          -  A symptomatic partial ACL rupture or any total ACL rupture determined by clinical
             examination (positive Lachman test and/or positive Pivot Shift) and shown on MRI;

          -  A complete Posterior Cruciate Ligament (PCL) injury;

          -  Cartilage change down to bone; grade 4 of the Kellgren Lawrence Grading Scale for
             Osteoarthritis visualized on X-ray;

          -  An injury to the lateral/posterolateral ligament complex with significantly increased
             laxity.

          -  A history of knee surgery other than diagnostic arthroscopy on the index knee.

          -  Tumors on MRI suspected for a malignancy.

          -  Obese patients with Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 35.

          -  ASA 4-5 patients which can severely interfere with rehabilitation.

          -  General disease that effects physical function or systemic medication/abuse of
             steroids (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic lupus
             erythematosus, gout, pseudogout)

          -  Any other medical condition or treatment interfering with the completion or assessment
             of the trial, e.g. contraindications to MRI or surgery.

          -  Drugs or alcohol abuse.
