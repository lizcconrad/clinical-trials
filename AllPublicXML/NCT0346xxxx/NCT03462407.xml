      This R21 application will provide a multidisciplinary One Health approach to DAID physical
      activity intervention for adolescents with developmental disabilities and their family dog.
      The novel intervention approach includes the use of the family dog in an established dog
      training protocol, focused on physical activity and aimed at improving physical activity,
      quality of life and social wellbeing for children with developmental disabilities. Recent
      pilot work has revealed physical and social-emotional improvements in children with
      developmental disabilities following an animal assisted intervention. There has been
      relatively limited research focused on the physical activity of adolescents with
      developmental disabilities and there remains a critical need to develop strategies that will
      encourage an active lifestyle for adolescents with developmental disabilities. Animal
      assisted therapy has known positive impacts on morale and is also known to reduce depressive
      psychological symptoms for children and adults. Yet, traditional 'service dogs' are
      prohibitively expensive for many families. Dog ownership alone is known to improve
      health-related physical activity. Thus, a critical need exists to create physical activity
      interventions that are easily accessible and provide manageable home-based physical activity
      adherence, but that are less expensive than traditional service dogs. To achieve these goals
      the investigators of this project have developed the following specific aims: 1) To develop
      and evaluate a novel DAID dog training program to promote physical activity in children with
      developmental disabilities; 2) To determine what impact participation in a DAID dog-training
      program has on the child's quality of life, feelings of social wellbeing and the child-dog
      relationship. The long term goal of this research is to improve the lives of adolescents with
      developmental disabilities. This research supports the One Health initiative and brings
      together aspects of improving health related to human and animal development.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several publications have demonstrated the extent of physical activity deficits in adolescent
      children with DD, however very few interventions have targeted this health disparity. Not
      only do significant disparities exist when children with DD are compared to their peers
      without disabilities, but without intervention, physical activity behaviors in children with
      DD further decline with age. The investigators, have successfully worked together on animal
      assisted interventions, ultimately focused on promoting physical activity in children with
      disabilities. Preliminary data strongly support the conclusion that physical activity,
      quality of life and social wellbeing improves with a family-dog-assisted intervention. While
      dog-assisted interventions have become increasingly popular across applied settings, the need
      for further empirical evaluation is clear. Given the rapid growth of scientific knowledge in
      the areas of developmental disabilities, human-animal interactions and canine behavior in
      recent years, the development and empirical evaluation of new animal assisted intervention
      programs built on a solid theoretical foundation and targeted to the needs of children with
      DD is especially critical. In addition to the development of this intervention, we will
      employ an experimental design to conduct within- and between-group evaluations that will be
      used to assess the efficacy of the proposed DAID intervention, as well as its relative value
      when compared with a traditional dog walking intervention and waitlist control (true
      control). To further strengthen our approach, the investigators will use a combination of
      objective validated physical (physical activity accelerometers), self-report (Quality of
      Life, Dog Care Responsibility Inventory, and Pet Relationship &amp; Friendship Scales) and
      behavioral measures (Child-dog/Dog-child proximity seeking, sociability and attachment) to
      evaluate program outcomes.

    <ipd_description>The proposed research will involve a small sample (30 subjects) of adolescents recruited from disability programs within Corvallis and the surrounding counties/ communities with developmental disabilities. Participants must also have a family dog to participate in this study. Even with the removal of all identifiers, the investigators believe that it would be difficult to protect the identities of subjects given the small region of recruitment and disability/ age characteristics of subjects and their family dogs. Therefore, the investigators are not planning to share the data.</ipd_description>
