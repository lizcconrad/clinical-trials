  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical trial comparing the immunosuppressive treatment determined according to
      two biomarkers, donor-specific IFN-γ ELISPOT and Mismatch of HLA between donor and recipient,
      in patients undergoing low immunological risk live donor kidney transplantation
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a national multicenter clinical trial, controlled, randomized, stratified, parallel
      groups, and without masking.

      This is a prospective intervention study in which two strategies for determining
      immunosuppressive treatment in kidney transplant patients from a live donor with low
      immunological risk are compared according to solid phase antibody detection techniques (cPRA
      0% and isolated negative antigen) and crossmatch by negative cytotoxicity. Patients are
      randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to receive one of two immunosuppressive treatment strategies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult men and women (≥18 years).

          2. Receptors of a first kidney transplant from an incompatible HLA living donor (at least
             1 mismatch HLA at any antigenic level).

          3. AB0 compatible transplant.

          4. Patients with a calculated PRA of 0% by solid phase technique and absence of anti-HLA
             class I and class II antibodies by single antigen test (Luminex®).

          5. Patients who agree to participate in the Trial by signing the Specific Informed
             Consent of this study.

          6. Potentially fertile women should use high reliability contraceptive methods
             (Pearl-Index &lt;1) in order to avoid pregnancy during the entire duration of the study
             and up to 6 weeks after the end of their treatment with Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF).
             Potentially Fertile Women include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has
             not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not post-menopausal (defined as
             amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months, or women who are receiving hormone replacement
             therapy with a documented level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)&gt; 35 mlU / ml).

             days thereafter. Potentially fertile partners of these patients should use a reliable
             contraceptive method during the same period, in order to minimize the risk of
             pregnancy.

             with Hepatitis C virus (positive PCR result) at the time of transplant.

          8. Patients with infection with the known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

          9. Patients with active systemic infection that requires the continued administration of
             antibiotics.

         10. Patients with any neoplasm except localized skin cancer and who is receiving adequate

             or thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;80,000 / mm3).

         12. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable even if they have hemoglobin levels&gt; 6g /
             dL.

         13. Patients with intestinal pathology or severe diarrhea that may decrease absorption

         16. Potentially fertile women who do not agree to use reliable contraceptive measures
             during the trial, who are pregnant, breastfeeding or who present a positive pregnancy
