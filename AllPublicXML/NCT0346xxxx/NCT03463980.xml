      The purpose of this study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with
      low-income, suicidal African American women and men that compares the relative effectiveness
      of compassion meditation (CM) versus a support group (SG) for (1) reducing psychological
      distress (suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, and shame); (2) bolstering interpersonal
      connectedness; and (3) enhancing self-compassion and mindfulness. It is hypothesized that at
      post-intervention and follow-up, compared to individuals in the SG, those in the CM
      intervention will endorse less psychological distress (suicidal ideation, depressive
      symptoms, and shame), more interpersonal connectedness, and greater levels of self-compassion
      and mindfulness.

    <measure>Change in Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention - baseline (T1), post-intervention - at completion of 6 weekly sessions (T2), and at 6 week follow-up (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The BSS is a self-report 19-item scale preceded by five screening items. The BSS and its screening items are intended to assess a patient's thoughts, plans and intent to commit suicide. All 24 items are rated on a three-point scale (0 to 2) total scores could range from 0 to 48. No specific cut-off scores exist to classify severity or guide patient management. Increasing scores reflect greater suicide risk, and any positive response merits investigation.</description>

    <measure>Change in Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-intervention - baseline (T1), post-intervention - at completion of 6 weekly sessions (T2), and at 6 week follow-up (T3)</time_frame>

Each item is rated on a four-point scale (0 to 3) with possible total scores ranging from 0 to 63. Scores provide a measure of the severity of self-reported depression: 0 -9 minimal, 10 -16 mild, 17-29 moderate, and 30 - 63 severe.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-intervention - baseline (T1), post-intervention - at completion of 6 weekly sessions (T2), and at 6 week follow-up (T3)</time_frame>
    <description>The Levels of Self-Criticism Scale (LOSC), which has 22 items assessing comparative self-criticism and internalized self-criticism, will be used to measure the level of self-criticism. The LOSC measures both comparative self-criticism (e.g. &quot;I fear that if people get to know me too well, they will not respect me.&quot;) and internalized self-criticism (e.g. &quot;Failure is a very painful experience for me.&quot;). Participants are asked to rate each item on a 7 point Likert scale from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;very well.&quot;</description>
