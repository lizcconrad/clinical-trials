    <textblock>
      IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide, leading to end stage
      renal disease (ESRD) in up to 30 to 40% of patients with in a few decades after diagnosis.
      Several therapeutic options have been used in clinical practice. However, no treatments can
      completely stop the progression of IgAN. Given the pathogenic mechanism of IgAN, many
      researchers have tried to treat patients with IgAN using immunosuppression such as
      corticosteroids. To date, there have been conflicting results on the effects of
      immunosuppression in IgAN. Earlier studies from Italian groups showed that corticosteroid
      treatment significantly attenuated kidney function decline and decreased the development of
      ESRD. Since then, the beneficial effects of corticosteroids have generally been accepted for
      treatment of IgAN particularly in patients with high degree of proteinuria &gt; 1.0 g/day
      despite maximal conservative care during 3 to 6 months. However, a recent interventional
      study by German group, known as the Supportive Versus Immunosuppressive Therapy for the
      Treatment of Progressive IgA Nephropathy (STOP-IgAN) trial, showed that immunosuppressive
      treatment in addition to intensive supportive care did not significantly improve renal
      outcome and resulted in more treatment-related side effects. Moreover, the Therapeutic
      Evaluation of Steroids in IgA Nephropathy Global (TESTING) study, another randomized
      controlled study from China, was early terminated because of safety concern related to
      corticosteroids. Interestingly, the primary composite outcome occurred significantly less in
      the methylprednisolone group as compared to the placebo group despite more serious adverse
      events in the former group. With this background in mind, we designed a multicenter
      prospective randomized controlled open-label trial; a step-wise therapeutic approach with
      corticosteroids or add-on cyclophosphamide therapy in IgAN patients with persistent
      proteinuria who have preserved eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m2. A total of 19 hospitals will
      participate in this study. During 12 weeks before the enrollment, all patients will receive
      maximal supportive care including the use of RAS blockers, blood pressure control with a
      target of &lt;130/80 mmHg, and protein restriction diet. If proteinuria does not decrease &lt; 1.0
      g/g creatinine, patients will be randomly assigned to continue supportive care, or to receive
      corticosteroids. At 3 months after randomization, patients in the corticosteroid arm who have
      persistent proteinuria of ≥ 1.0 g/g creatinine, or fast decline in eGFR ≥ 15% from the
      baseline value, will additionally receive cyclosphosphamide during the following 3 months.
      Patients who have substantial decreased amount of proteinuria &lt; 1.0 g/g creatinine at 3
      months will continue protocol-based corticosteroids during the same period. At 6 months after
      randomization, patients who receive add-on cyclophosphamide will switch to azathioprine as a
      maintenance therapy and those who receive corticosteroids alone will discontinue the
      treatment and will be followed up during 24 months thereafter. At least 87 subjects (a total
      of 174) would be required for each group to detect 13.5% difference in response rates between
      the two groups based on previous studies if type I error rate is 5% and type II error is 20%
      given 20% of drop-out rate during the study period. The primary endpoint is the development
      of a ≥ 30% decline in eGFR from the baseline or the onset of ESRD. This study will unveil
      conflicting results on the effects of immunosuppressive treatment in IgAN patients at high
      risk of progression.

      The investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled open-label
      trial; a step-wise therapeutic approach in IgAN patients with persistent proteinuria who have

      will receive maximal supportive care including the use of RAS blockers, blood pressure
      control with a target of &lt;130/80 mmHg, and protein restriction diet. If proteinuria does not
      decrease &lt; 1.0 g/g creatinine, patients will be randomly assigned to continue supportive
      care, or to receive corticosteroids. At 3 months after randomization, patients in the
      corticosteroid arm who have persistent proteinuria of ≥ 1.0 g/g creatinine, or fast decline
      in eGFR ≥ 15% from the baseline value, will additionally receive cyclosphosphamide during the
      following 3 months. Patients who have substantial decreased amount of proteinuria &lt; 1.0 g/g
      creatinine at 3 months will continue protocol-based corticosteroids during the same period.
