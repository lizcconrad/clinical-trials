  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the dismal prognosis of pancreatic cancer, detecting liver metastases early can avoid
      inappropriate therapy with the associated substantial risks, long-term hospital admissions
      and high costs, but without survival benefit. The current standard of diagnostic workup with
      contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) has a poor sensitivity (38-76%) for the detection of liver
      metastases. As more sophisticated and expensive treatment options emerge, better staging of
      pancreatic cancer is needed to avoid unnecessary procedures and select the most appropriate
      treatment strategy. New imaging modalities are available, but their value in staging of
      pancreatic cancer has not been evaluated yet. Therefore prospective imaging studies are
      necessary.

      The main aim of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of contrast-enhanced
      diffusion-weighted MRI (CE-DW-MRI) in the detection of liver metastases in patients with
      pancreatic cancer compared to a reference standard of histopathology and follow up imaging.

      The study is an international, multicenter prospective cohort study (inclusion of patients
      until 138 patients with liver metastases are included, with a total maximum of 465 patients).
      Patients with pancreatic cancer will undergo additional CE-DW-MRI within two weeks from the
      CECT. CECT and CE-DW-MRI will be read independently by two radiologists. Suspected liver
      lesions on CECT and/or CE-DW-MRI will be biopsied to obtain histopathology as reference
      standard. For liver lesions without histopathologic proof of metastases a paired follow-up
      CECT and CE-DW-MRI serve as a composite reference standard. Pancreatic resection will be
      pursued in patients without proven liver or distant metastases. Patients with locally
      advanced or metastatic disease will be offered palliative treatment. Follow up CECT and
      CE-DW-MRI will be performed in all patients at 3, 6, and 12 months.
