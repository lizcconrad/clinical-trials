  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective randomized clinical study of all morbidly obese patients undergoing SG, RYGB
      and OAGB, as primary bariatric procedures, was performed. Patients were randomly assigned
      into 3 groups: those patients undergoing SG, those ones undergoing RYGB and those ones
      undergoing OAGB. BMI, excess BMI loss (EBMIL) and remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM),
      hypertension (HT) and dyslipidemia (DL) were assessed.
