  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open clinical study to evaluate the soothing and re-epithelizing activity of a single
      application of two cometic formulations (&quot;P926 - LICHTENA DermAD CREMA VISO&quot; and &quot;P927 -
      LICHTENA DermAD CREMA CORPO&quot;) on experimentally induced erythema by repeated tape stripping
      on the forearm (volar surface) of 20 healthy volunteers.

      Study products activity was assessed in comparison to placebo (&quot;P926P - LICHTENA DermAD CREMA
      VISO - PLACEBO&quot;) and versus untreated control area.
