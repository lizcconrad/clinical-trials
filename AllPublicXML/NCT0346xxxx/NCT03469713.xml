    <textblock>
      NIVES study is an ongoing phase II, single arm, multicenter study. In this trial pts received
      SBRT to one non-brain measurable lesion and concomitant NIVOLUMAB, an anti-programmed cell
      death (PD-1). Combining SBRT with NIVO may enhance the antitumor immune responses and improve
      clinical outcomes, how it was demonstrated for other solid tumors with a phenomenon known as
      the abscopal effect . It was planned to enrolled a total of 68 pts within 12 months. The
      objective of the current analysis is to describe the first report of safety profile of NIVO
      in combination with SBRT.

    <time_frame>36 months from the first administration of nivolumab</time_frame>
    <description>Immune checkpoint inhibitors act by shortcutting the communication between immune cells and tumor cells mediated by the PD1-PDL1 interaction. Discordant results about the correlation of PDL1 expression and response to immunotherapy exist. Thus, we will investigate the expression of PDL1 in the tumor using four available IHC test (Dako 28.8, Dako 22C3, Ventana SP142, Ventana SP 263) and we will correlate levels of expression with response to treatment.</description>

    <description>To evaluate whether and how the initial genetic background of the renal carcinoma may impact on response to treatment in the present setting a deep sequencing analysis will be performed to assess mutational status of 578 cancer genes using the Comprehensive Cancer Design panel (Roche) and MySeq Illumina Next Generation Sequencer. The overall mutations load and the type of mutations detected will be correlated with the response to treatment.</description>

    <description>To investigate the effect of stereotactic radiotherapy on the modulation of the immune system we propose to analyze variation in the plasma levels of soluble immune-modulators during treatment. Will be use the Bio-Plex Pro™ Human Inflammation Assay (Bioplex, Biorad) that enables to detect and quantify a panel of 24 key biomarkers of inflammation including TNF superfamily proteins, IFN family proteins, and Treg cytokines</description>

    <description>we will investigate JAK1, JAK2 and B2M mutations by in the circulating free tumor DNA (ctDNA) obtained from the plasma samples. The ctDNA will be analyzed with a multiplexed sequencing assay that generates reads containing targeted regions along with a molecular tag that allows the accompanying optimized variant analysis software to assemble the reads into families of molecules originating from the same initial ctDNA molecules and model errors accumulated during library amplification, templating, and sequencing to accurately reconstruct the sequence of the original ctDNA molecule. The resulting sequence is then used to make variant calls down to 0.05% allele ratio with high sensitivity and specificity.</description>
