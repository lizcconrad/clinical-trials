  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to find out if an investigational drug, Nivolumab, can be safely
      administered after a &quot;half-matched&quot; (haplo) bone marrow transplant (BMT), and if the
      investigational drug will help to prevent or delay relapse or progression of sarcomas. In
      this study investigators will also be trying to learn more about how the investigational drug
      changes blood and/or tumors. Participants are eligible for this trial if they have recently
      undergone a &quot;half-matched&quot; (haplo) bone marrow transplant and have either relapsed or are at
      high risk to relapse.

    <textblock>
      High risk, recurrent, or refractory solid tumors in pediatric, adolescent and young adult
      (AYA) patients have an extremely poor prognosis despite current intensive treatment regimens.
      Johns Hopkins piloted an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) platform using a reduced
      intensity conditioning (RIC) and partially HLA-mismatched (haploidentical) related donors for
      this population of pediatric and AYA solid tumor patients.With this strategy, investigators
      demonstrated that RIC haploBMT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) is feasible and
      has acceptable toxicities in patients with incurable pediatric and AYA solid tumors; thus,
      this approach serves as a platform for post-transplant strategies to prevent relapse and
      optimize progression free survival. In this trial, the central hypothesis is that the
      efficacy of alloBMT for high risk solid tumors can be improved by developing methods to
      augment donor T cell responses against antigens selectively or uniquely expressed by tumor
      tissue.

      Investigators aim to demonstrated that PD-1 blockade with nivolumab will be safe and well
      tolerated after RIC haplo BMT, initially in a relapsed population (Part A) and ultimately
      when given pre-emptively (Part B).

    <intervention_model_description>Nivolumab will be infused intravenously (IV, in a vein) over 60 minutes every 14 days for a maximum of 24 doses (12 cycles). A cycle is considered 28 days. Participants may continue to receive Nivolumab unless they develop serious side effects or the tumor worsens.
There are two parts to this study. The first part, Part A, is for patients who have relapsed or have progressive disease after their BMT. Part A will enroll approximately 3-9 patients. The second part, Part B, is for patients who have not yet relapsed or progressed after BMT. Part A will be completed to prove that administering the experimental drug after BMT is safe and part B will begin once part A is completed</intervention_model_description>
