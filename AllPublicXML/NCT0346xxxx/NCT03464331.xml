      Background Physical activity (PA), is an effective means of protecting against cardiovascular
      disease (CVD) development. PA refers to any skeletal muscle bodily movement that requires
      energy expenditure. Research shows that low- to moderate-intensity muscle endurance exercise,
      such as walking or brisk walking for about 15-20 minutes per day, is associated with a
      significantly lower CVD risk regardless of body mass index. Mobile technologies such as
      smartphone physical exercise apps offer a potentially cost-effective platform for
      facilitating regular exercise, allowing individuals to set goals, receiving feedback on
      achievements and health information for facilitating regular exercise. &quot;Zero-time Exercise&quot;
      (ZTE) is a new concept for physical activities (PA) and exercise promotion and can easily
      attract attention especially when most people believe that extra time is needed to do
      exercise. ZTE can be done easily during most time of day, while sitting, standing, walking or
      waiting. These include simple movements, such as stretching and resistance (endurance)
      movements of the head, neck and shoulders, chest and abdominal muscles and the upper and
      lower limbs. When ZTE is integrated into daily life and sustained with increasing intensity,
      the effects could be substantial, especially for those who are sedentary and have
      difficulties to meet the minimal requirements of 150 minutes of at least moderate PA per
      week. The term is also intended to motivate people to start with simple exercises (the
      'Foot-in-the-door' approach), change the mindset (that exercises need much time, money and
      sweats) and overcome the inertia from a sedentary lifestyle to become more active. It could
      also be a way to promote mental health (such as increasing happiness) through PA or exercises
      and enjoying the fun and satisfaction from the rapid improvements in fitness performances.
      Having brought some easily observable benefits quickly to those who are willing to try for a
      few days, ZTE might lead to more intensive or vigorous exercises requiring extra time for
      greater benefits.

      Objective:

      To test the feasibility [recruitment, dropout, and adherence to PA] of using whatsapp as an
      inertia reminder to promote the adherence of Zero-time Exercises (ZTE) in patients with CHD.

      Methods:

      A 12-week single-blind randomised control design pilot study. 100 participants aged 18-69
      years or above with proven stabilized acute coronary heart disease, physical inactive and
      having own smartphone with adequate internet technology literacy to operate the smartphone
      app and able to read and understand Chinese were recruited from the outpatient Cardiac Clinic
      in 3 hospitals.

      The intervention group will be asked to practise ZTE either using the smartphone app or a
      zerotime exercise booklet with a focus on exercise adherence to at least 20-30 minutes per
      day, and on most and preferably all days of the week. The control group (CON) were asked to
      do deep breathing exercise at least 20 minutes daily. The exercise adherence of 25
      participants in each EXP and CON groups are measured by activity trackers.

      A mobile electronic whatsapp message was used as an anti- inertia reminder (AIR) to promote
      ZTE adherence. We used pictures with simple exercises to remind the participants in
      intervention group (EXP) to do ZTE regularly. Whatsapp reminders on deep breathing exercises
      are sent to CON. The frequency, format, whatsapp feedback and response to enquiry are the
      same as for EXP.

    <intervention_model_description>Simple individual randomization method by sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) will be used to ensure the research staff / interventionists and participants will be concealed from the allocation sequence. The statistician will prepare about 150 identical, opaque, sealed, A5-sized envelops, with a unique 3-digit serial number on the cover of each envelope as an identifier. Half of them will each contain a card indicating EXP and the other half, CON. For EXP, the card will further indicate activity tracker or no tracker, in 1:1 ratio. After consent, the RS will open an envelope according to the sequence of the serial number and assign participant to either EXP or CON group. The envelop must be opened according to the serial number. All others will not know the group allocation before the envelope is opened. Frequent checks (at least weekly) of these numbers will be done to ensure no deviation.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Adherence to zero time exercise intervention is calculated as the total time (duration) of ZTE done per week (as reported by participants) divided by total time (150 minutes per week as prescribed by the research team) of ZTE to be done per week. Seventy percent is considered as a good adherence rate.</description>

    <description>The Investigators/research staff (RS) will help EXP download, operate the Zero-time exercises (ZTE) app and ZTE e-diary. The EXP can enter their goal for the chosen exercise by setting the target duration or number of completed repetitions, review their previous record, and compare their exercise frequency and time ranking with those of the other EXP. After the EXP uploads the goal and results to the ZTE e-diary, the data will be automatically sent to the ZTE app database for data analysis. The EXP will be given a paper diary to record their Zero-time exercises (ZTE). Twenty-five EXP will be given activity trackers (e.g. Fitbit) to record their steps/motion throughout the 3 months.</description>
