    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of abdominal breathing exercises on
      pain, sleep quality and quality of life with adhesive capsulitis patients. The 41 adhesive
      capsulitis patients, 29 women and 12 men aged between 40-65 years, had divided into two
      groups by simple random sampling. In the study group, abdominal breathing exercise training
      was applied to routine physiotherapy program, in the control group routine physiotherapy
      program was applied for 8 weeks. Individuals were assessed for lung function test, range of
      motion, pain, sleep quality and quality of life. First assesment were performed at the
      beginning of treatment, 2nd assesment were performed at the end of 8 th week.

      Pain in the early stages of adhesive capsulitis leads to many symptoms such as sleeping
      problems. Breathing exercises also began to take place among the applications towards pain.
      Abdominal respiration is considered the easiest method to reveal relaxation response. Slow
      breathing increases parasympathetic activity in the body and reduces sympathetic activity.
      This is the first and fundamental step of real healing. The reduction of pro-inflammatory
      markers with respiratory exercises suggests that respiratory exercises are effective in
      inflammation.

      On study group; Hotpack was applied for 15 minutes and TENS was applied for 15 minutes and
      ultrasonics for 5 minutes. Then, scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were
      applied in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation) to increase
      joint range of motion by physiotherapist. Then abdominal respiratory exercise training was
      given 3 times a week as 30 sets of 3 times a week and patients were treated for 8 weeks.

      For the control group; Hotpack was applied for 15 min and TENS was applied for 15 min and
      ultrasonics for 5 min. Then scapular mobilization and passive stretching exercises were
      applied for 8 weeks in 10 sets of 3 sets (flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation)
      to increase joint range of motion by physiotherapist.
