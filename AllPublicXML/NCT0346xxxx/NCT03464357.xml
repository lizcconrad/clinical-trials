  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photophobia is a common and disabling symptom in patient with dry eye syndrome. The aim of
      this study is tried to better understand this complain analyzing brain activation during a
      luminous stimulation to highlight modification of cortical activation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye syndrome is a frequent and underestimated disease whose incidence tends to increase
      because of the population ageing and behaviors modification (time spent using screens
      increased, wearing of contact lenses…). Photophobia deteriorates the quality of life in
      patients with dry eye syndrome decreasing outdoor activities. This symptom is not understood
      and does not seem to be linked with dry eye syndrome severity. The study will compare
      cortical activation after luminous stimulation of 16 patients eyes (8 patients with dry eye
      syndrome and photophobia vs 8 asymptomatic patients) using functional MRI (fMRI).

      The primary study endpoint was the extent of magnetic signals in visual cortex after luminous
      stimulation. Secondary endpoints were the spatial activation extent in the 3 areas of the
      visual cortex (Brodmann areas 17,18,19).

    <description>Measurement of voxel activation is validated and standardized (SPM8 software (Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK) . In order to be able to determine the anatomical location of the voxels, a registration of the images on the standard image MNI152 (Montreal National Institute) provided by the Montreal Neurological Institute for which the spatial location of all the areas is known will be realized. It will thus be obtained, the number of activated voxels per visual area (Brodmann 17, 18, 19) for each hemisphere (contralateral and ipsilateral) of a subject with or without complaint.</description>

    <description>The BOLD (Blood-Oxygen-Level Dependent) signal obtained by fMRI reflects the rate of oxygenation of the blood in the brain. However, the hemodynamic response that corresponds to an inflow of oxygenated blood increases in regions that consume energy. Thus, it is possible, by the study of the BOLD signal, to know with a great precision the regions of the brain specially active during a given task.
The recorded signals reflect a neuronal activation. For each eye, recordings with and without flash visual stimulation are performed alternately.</description>
