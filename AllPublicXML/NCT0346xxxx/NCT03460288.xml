  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study examines the efficacy and acceptance of a computer-based training program for
      individuals with problematic or pathological gambling behavior. The study intends to
      investigate the extent to which the computer-based training program leads to a significant
      reduction in pathological gambling (primary outcome) when compared to a control group. The
      study design is a randomized-controlled trial with one intervention group and one wait-list
      control group.

      The study examines the efficacy of a computer-based training program for individuals with
      problematic and pathological gambling behavior. The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which the online program leads to a significant reduction in
      pathological gambling. The primary outcome is the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsory Scale (PG-YBOCS total score) as a measure of the severity of
      pathological gambling symptoms. Secondary outcomes are further measures of gambling-related
      symptoms, such as the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), as well as rates of depression,
      measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items depression module (PHQ-9), and rates
      of impulsivity, measured with the impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck's Impulsivity Inventory
      (I-7). The training is expected to lead to a significant reduction in
      problematic/pathological gambling behavior (PG-YBOCS) and all secondary outcomes when
      compared to a control group. The study design is a randomized-controlled trial with one
      intervention group and one wait-list control group and two assessment times (pre and post).
      The intervention group receives the download link for the training program directly following
      the baseline survey and can use the training over a period of 8 weeks, whereas the wait-list
      control group receives access to the training after completion of the post-survey.

    <intervention_model_description>The study is a randomly controlled study with 2 conditions: Condition 1: Computer-based training program (retraining), condition 2: Wait-list control group (access to the training after the post-assessment).
Two assessments-points, the intervention period (pre-post) is eight weeks. Sociodemographic and pathological data are obtained with an internet survey on Unipark®.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Pathological Gambling Adaptation of Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (PG-YBOCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in PG-YBOCS from pre- to post-intervention (i.e. 8 week interval)</time_frame>
    <description>The total score consists of ten items that measure the severity of gambling symptoms within the past week. The first five questions assess urges and thoughts associated with gambling, whereas the last five questions assess the behavioral component of the disorder. The sum score of each subscale ranges from 0-20. Each subscale can be analyzed separately as well as together as a total score (primary outcome). The total score can be interpreted as follows: 0-7: sub-clinical, 8-15: mild, 16-23: moderate, 24-31: severe and 32-40: extreme gambling symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Change in SOGS from pre- to post-intervention (i.e. 8 week interval)</time_frame>
    <description>20-items self-report measure to screen for engagement in gambling activities and gambling-related problems. A score between 0-2 corresponds to non-problematic gambling, a score of 3-4 to at-risk gambling, and a score of 5-20 to probable pathological gambling.</description>

    <measure>Eysenck Impulsiveness Questionnaire - Subscale Impulsivity (I-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in I-7 from pre- to post-intervention (i.e. 8 week interval)</time_frame>
    <description>Impulsivity will be assessed with the 17-item impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck Impulsiveness Questionnaire, which consists of the three subscales impulsiveness, venturesomeness, and empathy (Eysenck, Pearson, Easting, &amp; Allsopp, 1985). The reliability of the subscale is good (α = .82 - .85).</description>

    <measure>Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items depression module (PHQ-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in PHQ-9 from pre- to post-intervention (i.e. 8 week interval)</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 is used to assess depressive symptoms over the past week. The nine items of the questionnaire are based upon the diagnostic criteria of major depression. Internal consistency of the scale is very good (Cronbach´s α = .86 - .89).</description>

    <description>The training-program includes ten pictures related to slot-machine gambling and 10 neutral pictures that need to be either pushed (i.e., avoidance) or pulled (i.e., approach) with the computer mouse or finger (when a tablet is used) according to a non-affective dimension (color of the frame). Pictures are presented in random order.</description>

    <description>The participants of the wait-list control condition do not receive the retraining intervention during the intervention period of 8 weeks, but may continue any treatment that has already been started before, including pharmacological treatment. Participants in the wait-list control condition receive full access to the training program after completion of the post-assessment.</description>

    <description>The training program is based upon the approach-avoidance task (AAT) and can be easily performed on a computer, laptop or tablet. There is a total of 20 pictures, 10 slot-machine gambling related pictures and 10 neutral pictures that were already used in a prior study (Wittekind et al., submitted). The pictures appear on the computer screen and have to be either pushed or pulled. Pushing and pulling depends on a masked instruction (not related to the content of the pictures, but to the color of the frame). All gambling-related pictures are framed with the color that is instructed to be pushed, all neutral pictures are framed with the color that is instructed to be pulled.</description>
