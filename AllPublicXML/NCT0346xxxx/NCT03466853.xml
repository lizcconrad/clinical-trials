      Assessment of malnutrition within 48 hours of birth through anthropometric indices as Weight,
      Length and Head circumference, Proportionality indices as MAC/HC ratio, Ponderal index and
      Body mass index, Clinical assessment of nutritional status (CANS) score. Detection of early
      neonatal morbidities within the first week of life including Hypoglycemia ,Polycythemia,
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Neonatal sepsis, Hyperbilirubinemia and Feeding intolerance

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the 1st 48 hours of birth, all live born, singleton neonates with gestational ages
      between 28-40 weeks will be included in the study after obtaining an informed consent from
      their legal guardians.

      Assessment of malnutrition within 48 hours of birth:

        1. Anthropometric indices:

           Weight (using the infant weighing scale). Length (using the infant measuring board).
           Head circumference (using non-metallic non-stretchable tape).

        2. Proportionality indices:

           MAC/HC ratio (Calculation for each infant and value will be plotted on and compared with
           a standard curve). Ponderal index Body mass index

        3. Clinical assessment of nutritional status (CANS) score:

      A total score &lt;25 is considered as fetal malnutrition. 3. Detection of early neonatal
      morbidities within the first week of life (for those who will require NICU admission):

        1. Hypoglycemia (Random blood sugar)

        2. Polycythemia (Hematocrit level)

        3. Respiratory Distress Syndrome

        4. Neonatal sepsis (Clinically, Laboratory: CBC with diff., CRP, C/S)

        5. Hyperbilirubinemia (Serum bilirubin level, Need of phototherapy or exchange transfusion)

        6. Feeding intolerance (Abdominal distension with prominent intestinal loops, Gastric
           residue more than 3ml/kg before feeding at least 2 times/ day)

    <description>Systematized inspection and estimation of loss of SC tissues and muscles of nine superficial physical parameters including hair and buccal fat in the cheeks, chin and neck, arms, back, inter or subscapular skin, buttocks, legs, chest, and abdominal wall skin. These signs will be rated from 1 (worst, severe FM) to 4 (best, well nourished), and the highest and lowest total scores are 36 and 9, 3respectively. A total score of &lt;25 is considered as fetal malnutrition.</description>
