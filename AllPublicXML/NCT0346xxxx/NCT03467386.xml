    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies the side effects of total bone marrow and lymphoid
      irradiation and how well it works with cyclophosphamide in treating patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia. Total marrow and lymphoid irradiation targets cancer in bone marrow and
      blood, instead of applying radiation to the whole body. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid
      irradiation before a donor transplant helps stop the growth of cells in the bone marrow,
      including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving total bone marrow and lymphoid irradiation before donor transplant and
      cyclophosphamide after transplant may work better at treating acute myeloid leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety/feasibility of combining a total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
      (TMLI) transplant conditioning regimen with a post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide
      (PTCy)-based graft versus host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis strategy, through the assessment
      of: adverse events: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course, duration and
      complications: including acute GvHD, infection and delayed neutrophil/platelet engraftment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) of acute GvHD at 100 days post allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT).

      II. To estimate the CI of chronic GvHD at 6 months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

      III. To estimate GVHD-free relapse-free survival (GRFS) at 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

      IV. To describe the kinetics of immune reconstitution and T cell repertoire in the first year
      post alloHCT.

      V. To estimate overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS) and CI of relapse, and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

      VI. To characterize quality of life using 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36),
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT), and M. D. Anderson
      Symptom Inventory (MDASI) or Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) at 100 days, 6
      months, 1- and 2-years post alloHCT.

      VII. To assess bone marrow cellularity from bone marrow samples. VIII. To assess the
      clonogenic potential of cells from bone marrow samples. IX. To assess stromal damage from
      bone marrow samples. X. To evaluate cytokines and oxidative stress markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of TMLI.

      Patients undergo TMLI twice daily (BID) on days -4 to 0, then undergo bone marrow or
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant on day 0. Patients receive cyclophosphamide
      intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 3 and 4, tacrolimus given by continuous intravenous
      infusion (CIV) on days 5-90, and filgrastim beginning on day 5 until absolute neutrophil
      count (ANC) 1,500/mm^3 for 3 consecutive days.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 24 months.

    <time_frame>Up to 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.
The eight sections are:
15a1. vitality
15a2. physical functioning
15a3. bodily pain
15a4. general health perceptions
15a5. physical role functioning
15a6. emotional role functioning
