  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A single center, prospective, open-label, non-inferiority randomized controlled clinical
      trials (1:1 treatment ratio) regarding pregnancy outcomes between IVM and standard IVF among
      infertility couples with PCOS in China.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single center, randomized controlled clinical trial will enroll 820 couples with PCOS
      undergoing their first cycle of IVF. The participation in this study will be approximately 2
      years with a total of 7 visits from the cycle beginning, pregnancy to delivery. On day 2 or
      day 3 following the onset of menstrual bleeding, eligible patients will be allocated to two
      groups at a ratio of 1:1- IVM protocol, and standard IVF protocol. All participants will be
      randomized through stratified block randomization according to the study sites.

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients that have provided informed consent will be randomized to either IVM or standard IVF. Randomization and allocation of patients to study groups will be performed on the day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle. Randomization will be centrally controlled by administrative staff in the trial center, who are not involved in the treatment procedure. When there is an eligible participant to be enrolled into the study, nurses from the specific site will log in the trial center to get allocation of patients according to a computer-generated randomization list in a 1:1 ratio, with a variable block size of 2, 4 or 8 and stratified by center.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Controlled ovarian stimulation protocol will not performed in this group patients. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning was examined on natural cycle to monitor the follicle size in group B participants. Oocyte retrieval was scheduled once the endometrium had reached at least 6 mm in thickness and there was no follicle larger than 10 mm. After oocyte retrieval, the COCs will be cultured for 28-32h in special IVM media in order to get the matured oocytes. All the metaphase II (MII) oocytes were inseminated by means of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). All embryos will be cultured to blastocyst stage and be vitrified.</description>
