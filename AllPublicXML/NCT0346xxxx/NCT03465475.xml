  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhalation agents constitute the major part of anesthetic drug costs (20% - 25%) and a
      significant portion of the applied inhalation agents are thrown into the atmosphere through
      the waste gas system without being absorbed by the patient. The amount of waste gas is
      directly correlated to the fresh gas flow (FGF). Reducing the TGA during general anesthesia
      reduces the consumption of inhalant agents and contributes to the reduction of greenhouse gas
      pollution. Risks such as hypoxia, hypercapnia, inadequate depth of anesthesia and potential
      toxic gas accumulation were associated with low flow anesthesia, but the patient was provided
      with adequate safety by following pulse oximetry, capnography, FiO2 and anesthetic gas
      analysis. We aimed to perform anesthetic cost analysis in fresh gas flow (5 and 10 mL/kg)
      determined according to ideal body weight.

      After the ethical approvel 40 adult patients scheduled for hepatectomy will be taken to
      study. Patients will be monitored after they are taken to the operating room (ECG, NIBP,
      SpO2, Body Temp, BIS, NIRS, PVI, PI, ORI). After the anesthesia induction and tarakeal
      entubation, first twenty patient will take 5 mL/kg fresh gas flow (group 1), hemodynamic and
      gas consumption data will be recorded. Second twenty patient will take 10 mL/kg fresh gas
      flow (group 2), hemodynamic and gas consumption data will be recorded. An operating room will
      be reserved for this study.
