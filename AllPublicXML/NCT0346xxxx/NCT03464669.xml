      This project aims to evaluate the impacts of group prenatal education and online prenatal
      education on health determinants and users' health status.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal education is a core component of perinatal care and services provided by health
      institutions. Whereas group prenatal education is the most common educational model, some
      health institutions have opted to implement online prenatal education to address
      accessibility issues as well as the evolving needs of future parents. This prospective cohort
      study aims to evaluate the impacts of group prenatal education and online prenatal education
      on health determinants and the perinatal health status of parents. It is part of a larger
      multipronged study using mixed methods.
