  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to compare the effectiveness of a behavioral treatment, the Acceptance and
      Commitment Therapy, provided as an add-on to the prophylactic treatment (treatment as
      usual-TaU) against TaU only on the reduction of monthly headaches frequency over 12 months in
      a sample of patients with high-frequency migraine without aura (i.e. reporting 9-14 days with
      headache per month in the previous three months).

      ACT will be provided in small groups (5-7 patients each) by specifically trained therapists.
      The ACT consists in 6 weekly sessions, 90 minutes each, and 2 supplementary &quot;booster&quot;
      sessions, at two and four weeks after the conclusion of the weekly session. The main focus of
      the six ACT session will be the following: 1) Creative helplessness: the problem of control;
      2) Identifying values: introduction to Mindfulness; 3) Actions guided by values: working with
      thought; 4) Working with Acceptance and Willingness; 5) Committed Actions: self-as-context;
      6) Integration: working with obstacles - wrap-up. The booster session starts with a
      mindfulness exercise, followed by a review of the contents covered across the ACT program.

      TaU will consist of education of patients, followed by pharmacological prophylaxis.
      Prophylaxis is prescribed based on patients' profile, such as previous failures,
      contraindications and so on by a neurologist with expertise in headache treatments and
      limited to Topiramate, Propanolol, Amytriptiline or Calcium channel blockers.

      The study will be a Phase II Trial; randomized, Open-Label; Multicenter study. Patients will
      be randomized 1:1 to the two groups: 64 patients (32 per group) will be enrolled to detect an
      absolute difference of at least 2 migraine days/month in the experimental group (assuming
      alfa 5%, power 95%, up to 15% loss to follow-up).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and significance. Patients with Migraine without Aura at high frequency of attacks
      (9/14 episode per month) are particularly exposed to the risk of medication overuse and
      chronification of their headache. The treatment of this category of patients can be difficult
      and they need a multidisciplinary treatment to learn techniques to manage their pain before
      than a chronic migraine condition has been induced. In recent years, non-pharmacological
      treatments have been proposed for treating patient with different forms of migraines and,
      among them, Mindfulness showed to be comparable to pharmacological prophylaxis.

      ACT (Acceptance Commitment Therapy) belongs to the third wave of behavioral approaches used
      for different pathological conditions; the attention is focused on mental processes and the
      objective of this intervention is the psychological flexibility by cultivating six different
      positive psychological capacities; acceptance, defusion, sense of self, mindfulness, values,
      committed actions.

      Reports in literature documented the effectiveness of ACT intervention to improve disability
      and impact in pain conditions and to develop the resilience of patients suffering from
      different physical or mental clinical problems. People with low resilience are exposed to
      have more emotional difficulties in terms of depression and anxiety and stress, in particular
      when they are suffering from chronic pain conditions such as migraine at high frequency,
      which has high impact on patients life. It has been demonstrated that specific interventions
      addressed to promote resilience can be helpful to reduce the impact of the disease and of
      pain. Studies on the use of mindfulness and ACT in particular in chronic pain conditions and
      migraine have demonstrated how these practices are helpful to tolerate pain, to contain the
      use of symptomatic medications and to modulate some specific characteristics of migraine
      patients personality, e.g. rigidity, low acceptance, low resilience.

    <measure>Change in mindfulness, assessed with the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale.</measure>
    <time_frame>6, 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The scale measures people's tendency to be mindful of moment to moment experience, i.e. it focuses on the presence of attention and awareness of what occurs in the present. It is composed of 15 items, rated on a 1-6 scale: thus overall score ranges between 15 and 90, with higher scores reflecting higher mindfulness (i.e. higher attention and awareness of what occurs in the present).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in overall work productivity reduction.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Work productivity reduction is a composite measure given by two sub-dimension, namely absenteeism and presenteeism. Absenteeism is calculated as the number of days in which the person did not get to work because of headache. Presenteeism is calculated as the number of days in which the person was at work, but worked with reduced efficiency due to the presence of migraine headache. To calculate presenteeism, patients have to refer the number of days in which they worked with lower ability due to headache, and have to provide an estimate of their average performance level on a 1-99% scale. The portion needed to reach 100% performance is the productivity reduction coefficient, which is multiplied by the number of days with presenteeism to get the overall presenteeism measure.
The overall work productivity reduction is given by the sum of absenteeism and presenteeism.</description>

    <description>During withdrawal treatment, patients are given recommendations on the approach to the use of drugs for acute treatment of migraine headache and on lifestyle issues. With regard to drugs, patients will be encouraged to restrict use of acute medications to headaches with &quot;severe pain&quot;; i.e., those rated as 8 or greater on a 0-10 (no pain - pain as bad as it could be). In these instances, patients will be instructed to take Eletriptan (40 mg) and/or Almotriptan (12.5 mg) as the first-line treatment, indomethacin (50 mg) as the second line, and will be specifically urged to avoid opioids. With regard to healthy lifestyle issues, patients will be encouraged to engage in moderate physical activity (i.e., 45 minutes twice per week of aerobic exercise), remain well hydrated, consume 3 meals per day, and maintain a regular sleep/wake pattern with at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.</description>
