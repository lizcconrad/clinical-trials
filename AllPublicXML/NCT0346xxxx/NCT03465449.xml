  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are studying the feasibility, acceptability, and outcomes of an intervention called
      chronic kidney disease -palliative care (CKD-PC). CKD-PC is a palliative care-based dialysis
      decision-making intervention that involves educating patients and caregivers about dialysis
      and engaging them in shared decision-making. Half of the enrolled patients will receive
      CKD-PC and the other half will receive Usual Care.
