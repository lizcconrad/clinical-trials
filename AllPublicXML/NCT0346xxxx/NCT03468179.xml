  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides
      (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in
      response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese
      individuals, and increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese
      individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. We have
      found that oatmeal has large amounts of NAPEs, and based on previous mouse studies, we
      hypothesize that a single dose of dietary oatmeal is sufficient to double plasma NAE from
      baseline, possibly inducing satiety and increasing basal metabolic rate. To test this
      hypothesis, we will feed volunteers a single weight-based serving of oatmeal while monitoring
      its effects on serum glucose, NAPE and NAE levels as well as on subjective satiety.

      N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPEs) and their active metabolites, N-acyl-ethanolamides
      (NAEs) are lipid satiety factors that are normally biosynthesized in the intestinal tract in
      response to food intake. Reduced levels of NAPEs and NAEs have been found in obese
      individuals, so that increasing plasma NAPE and NAEs levels may be beneficial to obese
      individuals trying to lose weight or to keep off weight gain after losing weight. While NAPEs
      are endogenously synthesized by mammals in their intestinal tract, many other organisms,
      including plants, also biosynthesize NAPEs. Recent screening of a wide range of foods by our
      lab demonstrated that oatmeal (Regular Instant Oatmeal) had very large amounts of NAPEs (0.17
      mg NAPE / g dry oatmeal), suggesting that consumption of oatmeal may be a straightforward
      mechanism for elevating plasma NAPE and NAE levels in obese individuals. Based on our
      previous mouse studies with synthetic NAPE and with bacteria biosynthesizing NAPE, we
      hypothesize that a dose of oatmeal sufficient to deliver 0.135 mg NAPE per kg body should be
      sufficient to double plasma NAE levels from baseline, thereby inducing satiety and increasing
      basal metabolic rate. For a 100 kg person, 80 grams of dry regular instant oatmeal (2
      servings) provides this 0.135 mg / kg dose. (The dose of dry oatmeal per person = (body
      weight in kg / 100 kg)* 80 g dry oatmeal. Thus for 50 kg person, 40 g dry oatmeal (1 serving)
      provides the required dose.) This amount of dry oatmeal is converted to the test meal by
      adding sufficient water to overtop oatmeal by about 1 cm (or to consistency desired by
      volunteer) and then microwaving for ~3-4 minutes on high. In the initial testing, no
      additives such as butter, cream, or brown sugar should be used in preparation or serving
      oatmeal. Water can be consumed ad lib.
