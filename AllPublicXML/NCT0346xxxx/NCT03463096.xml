    <textblock>
      This is a study of advanced lung physiology in altered gravitational conditions, consisting
      of respiratory measurements in healthy volunteers during high G acceleration on a long-arm
      human centrifuge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lung is highly gravity-dependent - it has little actual tissue mass and deforms under its
      own weight. This is relevant to astronauts in space, but is actually much more broadly
      important to life on Earth. Every time we change our posture - for example from lying to
      standing - the direction in which gravity acts across the lung changes. These postural
      effects can become clinically important in critically ill patients. Currently there is debate
      in the scientific world about how gravity actually influences lung function, and how it
      interacts with other factors such as the anatomical structure of the airways and blood
      vessels of the lung. New technology developed by researchers at the University of Oxford now
      has the potential to help answer some of these questions. This device uses a technique called
      laser absorption spectroscopy to make measurements of breathing gases that are much more
      accurate than previous techniques - it is able to count the number of oxygen, carbon dioxide
      and water vapour molecules in and out while a person breathes. A non-invasive 15-minute
      breathing test with this technology provides information on the distributions of airflow and
      blood flow in the lungs, and it has been deployed successfully in the operating theatre and
      in intensive care units. This study aims to make comprehensive measurements of lung
      physiology under altered gravitational conditions and develop the technology and measurement
      techniques for possible future use in microgravity. This will include measurements of oxygen
      and carbon dioxide from the laser gas analyser (and measures of lung inhomogeneity obtained
      from these), lung mechanics and breathing drive.

    <description>The lung inhomogeneity index is the standard deviation for the natural logarithm of the standardised lung compliance, equivalent to the standard deviation for the natural logarithm of the ratio between fractional lung compliance and fractional alveolar volume of the lung units.
It is determined using the respiratory data obtained by molecular flow sensing using the laser gas analyser.</description>
