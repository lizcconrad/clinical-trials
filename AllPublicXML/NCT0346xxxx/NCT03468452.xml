  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MYASTHENIA GRAVIS (MG) is an autoimmune disease characterized by varying degrees of muscle
      weakness and fatigability worsened with exertion and relieved with restã€‚Thymectomy plays an
      important role in the management of these patients because a consistent association between
      myasthenic and thymic pathology has been recognized.The need for prolonged mechanical
      ventilation in these patients after thymectomy is determined by their preoperative condition
      and various perioperative risk factors. Leventhal et al proposed a preoperative scoring
      system to predict the need for postoperative mechanical ventilation in myasthenic patients
      undergoing thymectomy based on the following 4 criteria: duration of MG, chronic respiratory
      disease, dose of pyridostigmine, and vital capacity. However, some investigators discovered
      that the Leventhal criteria may not be the sole benchmark and that other criteria such as
      severity of myasthenia,history of myasthenic crisis, and presence of thymoma may be more
      important in predicting the necessity for prolonged mechanical ventilation after thymectomy.
      Naguib et al described multivariate determinants of the need for postoperative ventilation
      after thymectomy in MG patients predominantly on the basis of pulmonary function tests. In
      addition, the prevalence and presentation of MG may be variable among different ethnic
      groups. However, there are very few large studies investigating the determinants of prolonged
      mechanical ventilation after thymectomy. The authors describe the parameters associated with
      prolonged mechanical ventilation after trans-sternal thymectomy at their institution.

      Perioperative variables collected from the patient records were demographic data, duration of
      the disease,severity of the disease based on Osserman's classification, antiacetylcholine
      receptor (AChR) antibody positivity, preoperative drug therapy, history of preoperative
      myasthenic crisis, technique of anesthesia, drugs used for anesthesia, perioperative
      complications, and duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation. Even though the MG
      classification by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America is widely accepted,disease
      severity was graded according to the Osserman and Genkins classification preoperatively as
      per the authors' institutional protocol.
