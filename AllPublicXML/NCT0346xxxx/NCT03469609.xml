  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that mucous fistula refeeding between
      enterostomy creation and enterostomy closure reduces the time to full enteral feeds after
      enterostomy closure compared to standard of care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enterostomies in children may be created for different reasons. During the presence of an
      enterostomy the regular stool transfer is interrupted as the distal part of the bowel (the
      part following the enterostomy) does not participate in the circulation of stool. Therefore
      it does not contribute to the resorption of enteral contents. As a consequence these children
      need additional parenteral nutrition. Due to the negative side-effects of parenteral
      nutrition all patients should return to enteral nutrition as soon as possible. Consequently,
      many pediatric surgical centers worldwide routinely perform mucous fistula refeeding (MFR)
      into the former unused bowel after enterostomy creation because case reports and
      retrospective analyses show low complication rates and faster postoperative weight gain.
      Several providers, however, shy away from this approach because to date there is still no
      high quality evidence for the benefit of this treatment. Case reports and retrospective
      analyses show low complication rates and faster postoperative weight gain.

      The aim of this study is to assess the effects of mucous fistula refeeding in a randomized,
      prospective trial. We hypothesize that MFR between enterostomy creation and enterostomy
      closure reduces the time to full enteral feeds after enterostomy closure compared to standard
      of care. Moreover, the side effects of parenteral nutrition may be reduced and the
      postoperative hospital care of infants undergoing ostomy closure shortened.
