  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study will collect the treatment information
      and outcomes of the patients with previously untreated cavernous malformations (U-CMs) in
      China (at least 2000 patients from 20 centers). The investigators aim to determine the effect
      of different treatments on long-term outcomes in patients with untreated cerebral cavernous
      malformations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the availability of microsurgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery for
      cavernoma treatment and known genetic causes of most familial forms of cavernoma,
      uncertainties remain about cause, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and care. According to the
      recently published CM treatment guideline, surgical and conservative treatments are both
      first-line therapeutic options in previously untreated CMs (U-CMs). However, given current
      data, neurosurgeons are still unable to counsel patients on which would be the best option.
      To address the absence of high level evidence to support cerebral CM treatment decisions,
      there is a need for a large sample size study of cerebral CM treatment with a prospective
      concurrent group. China has the largest population in the world and may have the most
      extensive and valuable clinical resources of U-CMs. But, till now, the current treatment and
      outcome situation of the disease in China is not well known. Thus, the investigators are
      conducting a nationwide multicenter prospective registry study in China to determine the
      effect of different treatments on long-term outcomes in patients with untreated cerebral
      cavernous malformations.At least 2000 patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformation
      will be enrolled from 20 Grade Ⅲ A level hospitals distributed all over China. Clinical data
      and laboratory data are prospectively collected by electric case report form (CRF) and
      uploaded online by each neurosurgery center to form the prospective clinical database in
      First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. This is a cohort follow-up study
      across a 5-year period with a 2 years interval of enrollment and 3 years follow up for each
      patient.

        Consecutive patients with untreated cerebral cavernous malformation are enrolled from 20
        Grade Ⅲ A level hospitals distributed all over China. At the time of the participants
        entered the study, lesions should not have been treated by surgery or radiosurgery
        previously. This is a cohort follow-up study across a 5-year period. All patients in this
        study should meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Informed written consent should be
        obtained from eligible adult patients or from the guardians of eligible pediatric patients.
        All patients in the prospective part of this study can withdraw at any time.
