  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a potential solution to address high rates of depression and anxiety seen in epilepsy
      patients and poor mental health care access, this randomized trial aims to study treatment
      for anxiety and depression in epilepsy taking place directly within the epilepsy clinic vs.
      psychiatry referral (typical care). Patients that meet eligibility criteria, including
      significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety, will be randomized to the either the
      intervention group or the control group. The intervention will consist of an initial
      prescription for an FDA-approved medication to treat depression/anxiety and telephone-based
      chronic care management plan for repeated symptom measurement and side effect surveillance.
      The control group will receive usual care, which is a referral order to psychiatry placed by
      their treating neurologist.

      This trial is an innovative learning healthcare system approach to translate the concept of
      measurement-based depression care into a specialty clinic setting and extend the concept to
      treat depression and/or anxiety. The investigators' neurologist/APP-administered medication
      intervention utilizes FDA-approved drugs with advantageous features for use in epilepsy
      (escitalopram and venlafaxine) and a telephone-based chronic care management plan for
      repeated symptom measurement and side effect surveillance. The proposed intervention may
      overcome barriers to implementing mental health treatment interventions in generalized
      clinical settings by using healthcare providers commonly present in specialty clinics
      (physicians and APPs) along with a billable, best practices chronic care management
      intervention package. To test this idea, the investigators seek to pilot a randomized trial
      of neurologist/APP medication management of depression and anxiety versus usual care with
      psychiatry referral in the epilepsy clinic, using epilepsy as a paradigm for chronic medical
      illness with high prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity.

    <description>The intervention will consist of initiating a chronic care management plan in the epilepsy clinic and an initial prescription from the epileptologist for escitalopram 10mg daily. Escitalopram dose adjustment will be made based on biweekly repeated screening of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as side effects identified on biweekly telephone calls or the 6-week advanced practice provider (APP) follow up visit. Escitalopram dose may be titrated up to a maximum of 20mg daily in 5-10mg increments every 2 weeks for treatment effect, or titrated down to 5mg if needed for adverse effects. If a participant is unable to tolerate escitalopram, then venlafaxine XR 37.5mg will be substituted, to be titrated in a similar manner biweekly based on side effects and anxiety and depression symptoms (with 37.5-75mg increment dose changes and maximum dose of 225mg daily).</description>
