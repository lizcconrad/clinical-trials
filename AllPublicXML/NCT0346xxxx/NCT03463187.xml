    <time_frame>From baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with treatment-emergent positive anti-ixekizumab antibodies was summarized by treatment group. Percentage was calculated based on the number of evaluable participants and was calculated by number of participants with treatment-emergent positive anti-ixekizumab antibodies / number of evaluable participants * 100%.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>PASI combines the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions(head,trunk,arms,and legs).For each region the percent area of skin involved was estimated from 0(0%) to 6(90%-100%) and severity was estimated by clinical signs of erythema,induration and scaling with a scores range from 0(none) to 4(very severe).Each area is scored by itself and the scores were then combined for the final PASI. Final PASI calculated as:sum of severity parameters for each region*area score*weighing factor (head[0.1],upper limbs[0.2],trunk[0.3],lower limbs [0.4]).Overall scores range from 0(no psoriasis) to 72(most severe disease). Percent change from baseline in PASI score over time will be evaluated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of 0 or 1 achievement</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline through 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA of psoriasis is scored on a 6-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema, induration, and scaling across all psoriatic lesions. Average erythema, induration, and scaling are scored separately over the whole body according to a 6-point severity scale (0 [clear] to 5 [severe]). The total score was calculated as average of the 3 severity scores and rounded to the nearest whole number score to determine the PGA score and category (0=clear; 1=almost clear; 2=mild; 3=moderate; 4=moderate to severe; 5 = severe). Proportion of subjects achieving PGA response of 0 or 1 over time will be evaluated. PGA response of 0 or 1 is defined as a PGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and an improvement of at least 2 points on the PGA scale from baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change of dermatology life quality index (DLQI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in DLQI over time. This DLQI is a 10-question patient administered questionnaire that covers six quality of life domains including symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment, with total scores ranging from 0-30 (less to more impairment)</description>

               -  PGA score of 3 or greater and

               -  BSA affected by plaque-type psoriasis of 10% or greater.

          7. History of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior which in the opinion of the
             Investigator, makes the subject unsuitable for clinical study participation.

             judgement of the Investigator prevents the subject from participating in the study.

          9. Have a known allergy or hypersensitivity to any biologic therapy at screening that
             would pose an unacceptable risk to the subject if participating in this study.

         11. Are currently enrolled in, or discontinued from a clinical trial involving an
             Investigational product (IP) within the last 4 weeks or at least 5 half-lives of the
             last dosing prior to randomization, whichever is longer; or concurrently enrolled (at
             randomization) in any other trials.

         12. Have had a live attenuated vaccination within 12 weeks before randomization, or intend
             to have a live attenuated vaccination during the course of the study, or have

             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibodies.

             A positive test for hepatitis B is defined as 1) positive for hepatitis B surface
             antigen [HBsAg], or 2) positive for anti-hepatitis B core antibody [HBcAb+] but
             negative for hepatitis B surface antibody [HBsAb-].

         15. Have laboratory test values that are considered clinically significant at screening
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, pose an unacceptable risk to the subject if
             participating in the study or of interfering with the interpretation of data.
