        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject ≥ 18 years of age.

          2. Life expectancy ≥ 12 weeks by the Investigator.

          3. In Phase Ia, histologically confirmed NSCLC (including sarcomatoid carcinoma) with
             c-Met alterations defined as c-Met gene amplification ≥ 5 copies or c-Met protein
             overexpression (IHC 3+) or c-Met exon 14 skipping mutation. No EGFR T790M mutation for
             subjects with c-Met gene amplification or c-Met protein overexpression; KRAS/ALK/ROS1
             WT or unknown mutation/rearrangement status for subjects with c-Met exon 14 skipping
             mutation.

          4. In Phase Ib, histologically confirmed NSCLC as in Phase Ia, AGC, or HCC with c-Met
             gene amplification ≥ 5 copies, or c-Met protein overexpression (IHC 3+). HCC subjects
             must have Child Pugh Class A.

          5. Available fresh samples of NSCLC (except for c-Met exon 14 skipping mutation that can
             be from archival tumor sample), and available fresh or archival tumor sample of AGC
             and HCC for c-Met gene alteration characterization or determination of c-Met protein
             overexpression (IHC 3+). Fine needle aspiration and cytology samples are not
             sufficient.

          6. In Phase Ia/Ib, all NSCLC subjects with EGFR mutation must have progressive disease
             after 1 or 2 lines of prior therapy including at least an EGFR-TKI targeting other
             than c-Met alterations. Subjects with c-Met exon 14 skipping mutation must have
             received at least 1 line of standard therapy in Phase Ia and can be first or second
             line subjects in Phase Ib. In Phase Ib, subjects with AGC must have progressive
             disease after at least 1 line of prior standard therapy and subjects with HCC must
             have received 1 line of targeted agent therapy.

          7. At least 1 measurable target lesion.

          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score 0-2.

          9. Adequate organ function as documented

         10. Toxicities from any prior therapy, surgery, or radiotherapy must have resolved to
             Grade 0 or 1 as per the National Cancer Institute- Common Terminology Criteria for
             Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE), excluding alopecia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant (serum human chorionic gonadotropin positive) or breastfeeding female
             subject.

          2. Prior anti-tumor systemic chemotherapy or loco-regional therapy for HCC (such as
             percutaneous ethanol injection, chemoembolization or radiofrequency ablation),
             biologics therapy, Chinese herbal anti-cancer or anti-infective medication within 28
             days or 5 × half life time, whichever occurs last, before the first dose.

          3. Prior therapy with another c-Met inhibitor.

          4. Presence of EGFR T790M mutation in NSCLC subjects pretreated with an EGFR-TKI; Known
             KRAS/ALK/ROS1 mutation/rearrangement in NSCLC subjects with c-Met exon 14 skipping
             mutation.

          5. Known or suspected hypersensitivity to SCC244 and/or its excipients.

          6. Palliative radiotherapy to bone metastasis within 4 weeks prior to the first dosing.

          7. Prior or concomitant other malignant tumor (except effectively controlled non-melanoma
             skin cancer, breast carcinoma in situ or cervix cancer in situ and superficial bladder
             cancer within past 5 years).

          8. Cardiac function impairment or clinically significant heart disease including
             congestive heart-failure ≥ Grade 2 according to grading of New York Heart Association,
             arrhythmia, conduction abnormality requiring treatment, myocardium diseases or
             uncontrollable hypertension within 6 months prior to screening. QTc-prolongation &gt; 470
             msec, risk factors for Torsades De Pointe, hypokalemia or family history of
             long-QT-Syndrome.

          9. History of stroke within 6 months prior to screening.

         10. Known central nervous system or brain metastasis that is either symptomatic or
             untreated. Metastases that have been treated by complete resection and/or radiotherapy
             demonstrating stability or improvement are not an exclusion criterion provided they
             are stable as shown by CT scan for at least 1 month without evidence of cerebral edema
             and no requirements for corticosteroids or anticonvulsants.

         11. Inability to swallow oral medication, or active digestive system disease, or major
             digestive surgery, which in the Investigator's opinion can affect administration and
             absorption of SCC244 (such as active ulcerative disease, uncontrollable diarrhea, and
             small bowel resection).

         12. Any disease or condition with clinical significance (such as pancreatitis,
             uncontrollable diabetes, active or uncontrollable infection, drug or alcohol abuse, or
             psychiatric conditions), which can affect protocol compliance.

         13. Positive result for active infection by hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV); known
             positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

         14. Men and women of reproductive potential not willing or not able to employ a highly
             effective method of birth control/contraception to prevent pregnancy until the end of
             trial.
