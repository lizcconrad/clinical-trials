  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomised, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre trial in which MC2-01
      cream and calcipotriene [CAL]/betamethasone [BDP] ointment (comparator) is investigated in
      subjects with clinically diagnosed extensive psoriasis vulgaris.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MC2-01 cream is designed for optimal patient satisfaction - it quickly absorbs into the
      skin leaving it nicely moisturized allowing patients to move on with daily routines. In this
      trial, the MC2-01 cream will be compared to a marketed calcipotriene [CAL]/betamethasone
      dipropionate [BDP] ointment. The purpose of the trial, is to determine the pharmacokinetic
      parameters of MC2-01 cream and the comparator under maximum use conditions.
