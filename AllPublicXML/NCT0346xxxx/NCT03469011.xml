  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancers that have spread beyond the neck are not curable. About 30,000 people
      worldwide die from thyroid cancer every year. Usually, thyroid cancers get worse because the
      cancer cells become more and more abnormal through a process that is called
      dedifferentiation.

      Radioactive iodine is a standard treatment for this type of thyroid cancer. Patients will
      usually receive multiple dose of radioactive iodine over the course of their cancer journey.
      Thyroid cancers lose sensitivity to radioactive iodine as the cancer progresses/worsens with
      the process of dedifferentiation. When this occurs, the radioactive iodine treatments no
      longer work against the cancer and the cancer grows.

      Radioactive iodine enters cancer cells through transporter proteins on the outside of the
      cancer cell. The transporter proteins that are the most important are the sodium iodide
      symporters. As thyroid cancers dedifferentiate, these symporters stop working as well as they
      once did. The radioactive iodine can therefore not get into the cancer cells to cause cancer
      cell death.

      Laboratory research has shown that in thyroid cancer, a protein on the cell called platelet
      derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) is an important for tumour growth and thyroid
      cancer dedifferentiation. PDGFRα helps cancer progression and lowers the ability of sodium
      iodine symporters to move radioiodine into cells where it would normal act to kill the cancer
      cells. PDGFRα therefore makes thyroid cells resistant to radioactive iodine.

      Imatinib is an anti-cancer drug that blocks PDGFRα function. It has been used for many years
      to treat other cancers such as leukemia. The investigators who wrote this study believe that,
      base on laboratory testing, if thyroid cancer patients are given imatinib whenafter their
      cancers have become resistant to radioactive iodine, the imatinib will block PDGFRα. This
      will let the sodium iodine symporters work again and move the radioactive iodine into the
      cancer cells. This should shrink the tumours. Imatinib would then make the thyroid cancer
      cell sensitive to radioactive iodine again. This should shrink the tumours and would mean
      longer control of the cancer, helping people with this disease live longer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed new method of therapy for patients with progressive, metastatic papillary or
      follicular thyroid cancers will combine a focused blockade of PDGFRα with radioactive iodine.
      This is based on a new model for dedifferentiation in thyroid cancer as recently published by
      Lopez-Campistrous et al., 2016 (Appendix 1). Using this model and extensive preclinical data,
      the investigators hypothesize that the relatively short course of the well-known drug
      imatinib will allow for re-differentiation of thyroid cancers permitting radioactive iodine
      transport thus restoring sensitivity to radioactive iodine. The efficacy of these agents will
      be determined in a trial of 18 patients through a short treatment phase of approximately 3
      months through which the investigators should be able to determine a clinically relevant
      response. The investigators believe this trial is highly clinically relevant and has the
      benefits of using previously well described treatments in a novel pattern that should
      maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. If successful, this trial will translate into a
      new treatment paradigm for metastatic thyroid cancer.
