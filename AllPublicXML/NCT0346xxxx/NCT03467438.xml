  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), according to the Montreal classification, is defined
      as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms
      and/or complications. GERD, as clinically defined by the presence of heartburn, acid
      regurgitation, or both, at least once a week, is a global disease, being one of the most
      common gastroenterological disorders worldwide that affects roughly 10-30% of the general
      population in the Western world and less than 10% of the Asian populations. GERD
      complications may be life threatening and range from reflux esophagitis to Barrett's
      oesophagus and, eventually, adenocarcinoma.

      Zinc L-carnosine (brand name in Italy: Hepilor®) is a chelate compound of zinc and
      L-carnosine, with a long history of more than 20 years of clinical use in Japan that has
      recently become available in Italy for the treatment of any condition that requires a mucosal
      protection and mucosal repair within the gastrointestinal tract, thus including GERD.
      However, clinical data in western countries are limited. The aim of this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled study is to demonstrate the efficacy of Zinc-l-carnosine in maintaining
      GERD clinical remission during a 12-week treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesise that Zinc-l-carnosine is able to maintain GERD remission, thus
      improving the quality of life of these patients. A comparison with a placebo is necessary, as
      GERD symptoms may be heavily influenced by the nocebo/placebo effect.

      This is a post-marketing, single center, double-blind, and randomized, placebo-controlled,
      parallel study. Patients with GERD treated with an 8-week cours of proton pump inhibitors
      will be randomize and receive either Zinc-l-carnosine or placebo for 12-week. GERD symptoms
      will be assessed with a questionnaire (modified GERD questionnaire by Locke) monthly for 12
      weeks and after a 4-week wash-out. Also, quality of life will be assessed at baseline and at
      12 weeks with the 36-item short form survey (SF-36).
