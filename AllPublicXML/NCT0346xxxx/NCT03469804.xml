  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classic and endemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) are lymphangio-proliferations associated with human
      herpes virus 8 (HHV8), which treatment is poorly codified. Chemotherapies give at best 30-60%
      of transient responses. While interferon responses are frequent, this drug is often poorly
      tolerated in elderly patients. Therefore new therapies are needed. Classic KS represents an
      ideal model for evaluating new drugs since patients do not receive concomitant
      immunosuppressive regimens nor antiviral therapies.

      Pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody has recently been shown to improve survival in
      several solid tumors. In KS few data are available on the role of PD1-PD-L1 axis. A
      significant PD-L1 expression on HHV8-associated pleural effusion lymphomas and on KS samples
      have been recently reported. Our experience in classical and endemic KS supports the role of
      this pathway with expression of PD-L1 by subpopulations of T cells but also NK cells in
      peripheral blood cells from these patients and expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells in KS
      lesions.

      In this study we will evaluate the benefit and safety profile of pembrolizumab in classic and
      endemic KS.
