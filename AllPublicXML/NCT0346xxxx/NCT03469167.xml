  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single-blinded, randomized study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of CEGP003 in patients with acute peptic ulcers bleeding, compared to endoscopic epinephrine
      injection therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CEGP003 is wound dressing solution containing Hydroxyethyl-cellulose and EGF. Epidermal
      growth factor (EGF) stimulates cell growth and differentiation by binding to its receptor,
      which can enhance wound healing and regeneration of new tissue, finally may provide a new
      option in treating a peptic ulcers bleeding.
