  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's Disease (CD) patients, belonging to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), frequently
      suffer from uncontrolled intestinal inflammation. This can lead to severe disease
      complications requiring hospitalization. Up to 50% of all CD patients develope intestinal
      strictures. Intestinal strictures can be subdivided into predominantly inflammatory and
      predominantly fibrotic types. This subclassification in different types of strictures is
      important for clinical decision making: patients with predominantly fibrotic strictures would
      undergo surgery or interventional endoscopic treatment and patients with predominantly
      inflammatory strictures would be treated anti-inflammatory. To determining the degree of
      fibrosis and inflammation in CD strictures remains difficult.

      Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is a new imaging approach belonging to the group of
      quantitative phase imaging. DHM enables stain-free quantitative phase contrast imaging and
      provides the determination of an refractive index which directly correlated to tissue
      density.

      This study aims to evaluate DHM for assessing the degree of fibrosis and inflammation in
      surgical specimen from patients with stricturing CD. The investigators collect full thickness
      surgical resection specimen from 29 patients with symptomatic CD strictures. More detailed,
      the investigators collect full thickness surgical resection specimen out of stenotic and
      non-stenotic bowel segments from each patient. For primary purposes, the investigators
      analyze the obtained tissue using DHM and compare differences of the refractive index,
      determined by DHM, between stenotic and non-stenotic parts of the intestinal wall. For
      secondary purposes, the investigators will correlate the findings made by DHM with a detailed
      analysis by a histopathologist using a scoring system (Goldstandard) to determine the degree
      of fibrosis and inflammation in the samples.
