  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious endocarditis (IE) is a pathology where the mortality rate of between 20 and 25%,
      but a higher morbidity since 50% of the patients are treated by a valvular surgical
      procedure. The diagnosis of IE is often difficult and therefore too late. In 2015, the
      European Society of Cardiology recommendations published by the integrate Positron Emission
      Tomography with Computed Tomography (PET/CT) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in the
      diagnostic management of IE.

      However, during conventional examinations, with 12 hours fasting and low carb dieting,
      myocardial uptake of 18F-FDG may be intense and interfere with results.

      The purpose of this study is to assess a strict low carbohydrate diet as Atkins (&lt;3gram/day
      of carbohydrate) diet to facilitate the infective endocarditis diagnosis by 18F-FDG PET/CT
      Primary objective is to assess a strict low carbohydrate diet during 12h and 12h fasting for
      enhancing the contrast between infect area and surrounding structures and improve the
      detectability of infective endocarditis by PET/CT

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Comparison of the detection sensitivity of IE outbreaks between 18F-FDG PET/CT performed
           with the low carbohydrate diet and conventional diet performed

        2. To assess the strict low carbohydrate diet effects on the uptake 18F-FDG distribution ,
           particularly in the myocardium, circulating blood, skeletal muscles, brain and liver.

        3. Characterization of metabolic changes generated by the low carbohydrate diet using
           plasma bioassays (blood glucose, insulinemia, free fatty acid concentration,
           ß-hydroxybutyrate).
