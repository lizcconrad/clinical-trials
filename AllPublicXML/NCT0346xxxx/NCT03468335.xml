      Second-line therapy with Nal-IRI after failure gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in advanced
      pancreatic cancer - predictive role of 1st-line therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research hypothesis:

      Patients profit from 2nd-line therapy with Nal-IRI if they also had a benefit from 1st-line
      treatment. Benefit from treatment (either 1st or 2nd-line) will be defined as a patient
      specific Time-To-Treatment Failure (TTF) which is in the upper third of the distribution of
      TTF values of the studied population.
