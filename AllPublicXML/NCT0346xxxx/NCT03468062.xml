  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is a selective a2-agonist and a sedative with anti-inflammatory,analgesic,
      and antiemetic effects, and its use for procedural sedation during endoscopy or ablation for
      atrial fibrillation has been increasing. It is also used for sedation in the intensive care
      unit. Recently, it was reported that dexmedetomidine is often used as an adjuvant for general
      anesthesia. Sympatholysis of dexmedetomidine can attenuate the increased sympathetic tone
      after surgery and result in antistress effects. In addition, opioid-sparing and analgesic
      effects are promoted by the perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine. Although it has
      been reported that the perioperative administration of dexmedetomidine improves quality of
      recovery after spinal and ENT surgeries, the outcomes for patients who undergo laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy remain poorly investigated.

      The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of preoperative dexmedetomidine
      administration on quality of recovery by using the QoR-40 questionnaire in patients who
      undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
