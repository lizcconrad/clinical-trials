  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of optical coherence tomography (OCT) and its application for in vivo imaging
      has opened entirely new opportunities in ophthalmology (Wojtkowski, Kaluzny et al. 2012;
      Drexler, Liu et al. 2014). The technology allows for both noninvasive visualization of the
      morphology and measurement of functional parameters within ocular tissues to a depth of a few
      millimetres even in nontransparent media. Until now the resolution of commercially available
      OCT systems is, however, much lower than that provided by light microscopy.

      Recently, an ultrahigh-resolution OCT system was developed by our group providing resolutions
      of 1.7 and 17 µm in axial and lateral direction, respectively. This axial resolution is about
      four times better than that provided by standard OCT systems. It allows to perform in vivo
      imaging with a resolution close to biopsy of tissue and to visualize structures of the
      anterior eye segment with a remarkable richness of detail. The prototype was applied for in
      vivo imaging of the cornea including the precorneal tear film (Werkmeister, Alex et al.
      2013).

      The goal of the planned pilot study is to apply this innovative imaging modality for
      visualization of the ultrastructure of the different parts of the anterior eye segment
      structures in diseased subjects, as well as in patients who underwent minimally invasive
      glaucoma surgery (MIGS). The obtained in vivo cross sectional images and three-dimensional
      data sets are hoped for contributing to the knowledge about the anatomy and physiology of the
      corresponding tissues. This could allow for a better interpretation of clinical features and
      findings obtained in slit lamp examination.

    <description>A spectrometer based ultrahigh resolution Spectral Domain OCT (SDOCT) system operating at 800 nm for the anterior chamber will be employed in the present study. The spectrum of the Ti:Sapphire laser light source is centered at 800 nm. With a full width at half maximum bandwidth of 170 nm, the axial resolution is 1.3 μm in the cornea. The transverse resolution of the employed OCT system is 21 μm at the front surface of the cornea. For measurement, patients will place their head in a modified slit lamp head rest. During the measurement period, patients will be asked to look straight forward onto an internal fixation target and to avoid blinking. Different scattering patterns, e.g. raster, circular and spiral scans will be employed.</description>
