      Hypothesis:

        1. Tissue and salivary pepsin will resolve after 12 weeks use of Reza band, but not
           following standard of care alone.

        2. RFS, RSI and inflammatory cytokines (IL -1β, -6, and -8) will decrease to normative
           levels following 12 week use of Reza band, but not with standard of care alone.

      Laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR), the back flow of gastric contents into the laryngopharynx,
      contributes to several otolaryngologic symptoms, inflammatory disorders, and even neoplastic
      diseases of the laryngopharynx. It is estimated that this disease effects 20 - 40% of the
      United States population and appears to be as common in children and infants as adults.

      It is widely accepted that chronic reflux into the esophagus causes inflammation (reflux
      esophagitis; gastro- esophageal reflux disease - GERD) which can, over time, result in a
      metaplastic change in the cells that line the lower esophagus - Barrett's esophagus - which
      confers an increased risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma. It is strongly thought that chronic
      uncontrolled LPR not only causes inflammatory, but perhaps also neoplastic pathologies in the
      laryngopharynx, as it does in the esophagus.

      Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is the mainstay of treatment for GERD. However, their
      efficacy for the treatment of airway reflux, including LPR, remains doubtful. In fact,
      placebo-controlled trials have failed to demonstrate any therapeutic benefit of PPIs for the
      treatment of LPR. Combined multi-channel intraluminal impedance - pH monitoring (MII-pH)
      represented a major advance in diagnosing airway reflux by its ability to detect reflux
      events independent of the pH of the refluxate. By demonstrating the inefficacy of
      acid-targeting therapeutics for LPR, association of symptoms with nonacid reflux, and symptom
      alleviation upon surgical intervention that abrogates reflux of all gastric contents, the
      data garnered through MII-pH technology brought about a shift in perception of LPR and airway
      reflux as primarily acid-mediated disease, to one that can be significantly mediated by
      nonacid components of reflux for which typical GERD treatment would not suffice.
      Approximately $26 billion/year is currently spent on PPIs for the treatment of LPR, despite
      their poor efficacy for this patient population. Reza band, a non-medication, non-surgical
      medical device designed to reduce symptoms of LPR has recently been approved by the FDA. It
      works by stopping the flow of gastric contents through the upper esophageal sphincter (UES)
      by increasing the internal pressure of the UES. The investigators propose a prospective
      cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of Reza band for LPR using pepsin as the primary
      outcome measure. Pepsin, a gastric proteolytic enzyme initially synthesized and secreted as
      the zymogen pepsinogen by chief cells in the gastric fundus and subsequently cleaved in an
      autocatalytic fashion to produce the mature form of pepsin upon introduction to the acidic
      environment of the stomach lumen, has been shown by this group and others to be a specific
      and sensitive biomarker for gastric reflux and aspiration. While many episodes of LPR are
      weakly acidic or nonacid, pepsin is present in all refluxate. The investigators have
      previously reported pepsin in laryngeal epithelia from 26/27 pH-confirmed LPR patents, not
      detected in 19 control subjects (p &lt; 0.001). In an ongoing study, salivary pepsin correlates
      with both number and duration of reflux events measured by MII-pH (p &lt; 0.05) and Reflux
      Symptom Index (RSI) (p &lt; 0.01) in LPR patients (n = 39). Pepsin was not detected in MII-pH
      confirmed reflux-free control subjects (n = 15).

      The objective of this study is to perform a pilot clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
      the Reza band is effective for the treatment of LPR, measured by resolution of pepsin and
      decrease to normative values for RSI, Reflux Finding Score (RFS), and inflammatory cytokines.
      The long-term goal is to determine the efficacy of the Reza band in the sequential
      progression of reflux-attributed laryngeal inflammatory and neoplastic disease. Specific Aim:
      Evaluate the efficacy of the Reza band for the treatment of LPR. A prospective cohort of
      patients with clinically diagnosed LPR (RSI ≥ 13 and RFS ≥ 7) will receive standard of care ±
      Reza band for 12 weeks (30 patients per group). In addition to the routine clinical outcome
      measures for LPR: RSI and RFS, salivary pepsin, tissue (post-cricoid) pepsin and inflammatory
      cytokine profile will be documented pre- and post-treatment and compared between the two
      patient cohorts. Pepsin and inflammatory cytokine profile will be measured using an
      established in-house and commercially available ELISA respectively.

      This pilot study will pave the way for clinical trials of a much-needed therapy for airway
      reflux. If the hypothesis proves true and the Reza band resolves pepsin and inflammatory
      cytokines, and significantly improves endoscopic signs (RFS) and symptoms (RSI) of LPR, these
      data will also support a clinical trial to assess the utility of the Reza band in preventing
      reflux attributed laryngeal inflammatory and neoplastic disease sequelae.
