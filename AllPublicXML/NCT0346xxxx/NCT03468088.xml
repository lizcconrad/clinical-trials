      This study aims to investigate the relative effect of handgrip strengthening exercise in
      improving function, pain, strength, and active range of motion (AROM) of the shoulder among
      patients with primary sub-acromial impingement syndrome (SAIS).

      The current study is a Single-Blind Randomized Clinical Trial to investigate the
      effectiveness of handgrip strengthening exercise in the treatment of patients with primary
      subacromial impingement syndrome. The randomization process will be based on concealed
      envelop picked up by participants.The patient will be conveniently recruited from the
      ministry of health hospitals in Jeddah.The patient who will meet the inclusion criteria; they
      will sign the consent form. The baseline data will be collected. The assessment will be
      carried out at the baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks; end of the treatment program; by the same
      blinded examiner for each patient and consist of the following instrument: Disabilities of
      Arm, Shoulder &amp; Hand (DASH questionnaire), Visual analog scale (VAS), Hand-held dynamometer
      (HHD), and smartphone clinometer.

    <description>It will be assessed using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire, which is a 30-item questionnaire that assess the ability of a patient to perform various upper extremity activities. it uses a 5-point Likert scale. A higher scores signify a greater level of disability, whereas, lower scores signify a lower level of disability.</description>

    <description>Handgrip strengthening exercises will be added to the experimental group. This exercise is chosen based on literature review of EMG and biomechanical studies. Adjustable heavy grip hand gripper will be used as handgrip resistance at 10 repetitions maximum (RM). The exercise will be performed in standing position the patient's back will be rested in a wall, arm at 30º abduction, 60º abduction 90º abduction &amp; with 90º ER. In this positions, the patient will be performed 3 sets of 10 squeezes each at a 1-minute interval.</description>

    <description>Ultrasound therapy will be used to treat both groups. Ultrasound will be applied; while the patient will be seated in an adjustable chair with back support, feet on the floor. The chair will be positioned beside a table. The patient's shoulder will be rested on the table beside the body and elbow will be flexed at 90°. A round-headed probe will be used that is put in direct contact with the patient's skin over the shoulder joint. Ultrasound gel will be used on all surfaces of the head in order to reduce friction and assist in the transmission of the ultrasonic waves.</description>
