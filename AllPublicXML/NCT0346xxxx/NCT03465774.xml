  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are commonly used to treat pleural effusions (build-up of
      fluid in the lungs). Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is also used to treat pleural
      effusions. The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if adding doxycycline to the
      use of an IPC can lead to shorter treatment times with IPCs.

      This is an investigational study. Doxycycline and IPCs are FDA approved and commercially
      available for the treatment of different types of infections and pleural effusions. Either or
      both can be done even if you do not take part in this study as part of your regular care. It
      is consider investigational to compare the results of IPC alone and IPC plus doxycycline.

      The study doctor can describe how the IPC and doxycycline are designed to work.

      Up to 208 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the IPC is inserted, you will complete 2 questionnaires about your quality of life and
      any symptoms you may have. These should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

      You will be required to sign a separate consent form in order to have the IPC placed. Your
      doctor will give you detailed instructions about the IPC placement procedure, including its
      risks.

      You will have the choice to receive either an IPC alone or an IPC with doxycycline.
      Regardless of what you decide, you will be followed for up to 1 year.

      If you choose IPC with doxycycline, after the IPC is placed, the doctor will give you a
      prescription for a fentanyl patch to help control pain. The study staff will tell you how and
      when to wear the fentanyl patch and about any side effects that are related to fentanyl.

      About 5 days (+/- 2 days) after the IPC has been placed, you will have a clinic visit in
      which you will be checked up on as part of your standard of care. It is important that you
      wear your fentanyl patch in the morning before this visit. At this clinic visit, you will
      have a chest x-ray, you will be asked to rate your pain on a scale of 1-10, and you will be
      asked how much fluid has drained from your catheter at home. This is part of the standard of
      care, and you will be provided a container and method for measuring the amount of fluid.

      Based on the results of the above Day 5 check-up, if you are found to be ineligible to
      receive doxycycline, the fentanyl patch will be taken off and you will be followed as part of
      your usual care. However, you will still considered to be on study and you will be followed
      the same as a participant who receives the doxycycline.

      If you are found to be eligible to receive doxycycline, you will receive fentanyl by vein
      over a few minutes, if needed to help control your pain. Your doctor will then begin to drain
      your catheter and doxycycline will be placed in the catheter. The catheter will be capped for
      1 hour and then drained again.

      Length of Study Participation:

      If you receive it, you will receive doxycycline 1 time. You will be followed for 1 year after
      the catheter is removed, regardless of whether or not you receive doxycycline. Your
      participation on this study will be over if you withdraw consent or the study closes,
      whichever takes place first.

      Follow-Up:

      Between 10 and 14 days after you have the catheter placed, you will come to the clinic as
      part of your usual standard of care so the doctor can check your IPC for possible leaking,
      infection, to see how much fluid has drained, and to remove any sutures. The catheter may be
      removed if it is leaking or shows signs of infection. You will continue to have this visit 1
      time each month as part of your standard of care until the catheter is removed. During each
      of these visits:

        -  You will have a chest x-ray to check your lungs.

        -  You will complete the same 2 questionnaires that you completed before your IPC was
           placed.

      One (1) time each month for up to 1 year after the IPC is removed, you will be called and
      asked how you are doing, if you are having any side effects, if the disease has come back,
      and about your overall quality of life. Some of this information may be collected from your
      medical record. You will complete the same 2 questionnaires that you completed before your
      IPC was placed. Each phone call should last about 10-15 minutes.
