  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is known as an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in older cardiac
      patients, including patients with congestive heart failure. It is an important factor taken
      into the cardiologists decision making in the clinic, and influences the intensity of follow
      up treatment, invasive intervention and the need to ensure a stronger social support system
      for the patient. Frailty assessment is usually made subjectively by the cardiologist, known
      in the literature as eyeball testing.

      In this study the investigators will compare the cardiologists subjective eyeball testing to
      objective frailty assessment tests based on Fried score and Edmonton frail scale

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients visiting the congestive heart failure clinic at Meir Medical Center will be
      assessed for frailty twice. Once in an &quot;eyeball&quot; test by their cardiologist at the clinic,
      and a second time in an objective test based on fried and Edmonton frailty scores.

      The second subjective assessment will be made by geriatric and internal medicine physicians,
      and the cardiologist won't be aware of the results of the objective assessment.

      The results of both tests will be compared.
