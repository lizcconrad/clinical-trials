    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare between crystalloid versus crystalloid and colloid
      combination preloads for prevention of hypotension following intrathecal anaesthesia in
      patients undergoing elective Caesarean section.

      To examine weather baseline perfusion index could predict the incidence of
      intrathecal-induced hypotension during Caesarean section.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intrathecal anesthesia is the most commonly used technique for elective Caesarean section all
      over the world.

      One of the most common complications of this technique is hypotension. It's incidence is more
      than 80% without any prophylactic measures, this hypotension has adverse effects on both
      mother ( causing nausea and vomiting ) and foetus ( causing acidosis and neurological defects
      ).

      This complication can be managed by several ways like fluid therapy, usage of vasopressors or
      combination between both of them.

      Among the type of fluids ( crystalloid or colloid ) it's still not known which one of them is
      better. Crystalloid has a short intravascular half-life because of its rapid distribution
      into the interstitial space. On the other hand colloid remains longer within the
      intravascular space.

      Change in baseline peripheral vascular tone due to pregnancy may affect the degree of such
      hypotension. The perfusion index ( PI ) derived from a pulse oximeter has been used for
      assessing peripheral perfusion dynamics due to changes in peripheral vascular tone.
