  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate fundamental cell processes. Dysregulation of miRNA expression and
      function is reported in various diseases including cancer, metabolic disorders as well as
      neurological disorders. Circulating miRNAs have been proposed to mirror physiological and
      pathological conditions suggesting their use as biomarkers for various diseases. The study
      will focus on a case-control study cohort (N=1000) of subjects recruited at the IRCCS
      Neuromed for which a deep clinical characterization and genome-wide sequencing data are
      available. This study will enable to identify novel circulating biomarkers for Parkinson's
      disease (PD). Further, the project will give new insights on the involvement of miRNAs in the
      etiology of PD and in the understanding of the genetics of the disease thus opening avenues
      for novel therapeutic strategies.

      Hypothesis and Significance:

      The project intends to identify novel biomarkers for PD and clinical parameters related to
      the PD etiology. To do that circulating miRNA profiling through a next-generation sequencing
      will be performed using a single sample approach in the case-control study cohort and
      identified miRNAs will be validated by qRT-PCR and functional analyses. In addition, the
      project will contribute expanding the knowledge of the genetic architecture of PD taking
      advantage of genetic characterization of the study sample. miRNA genes and target genes will
      be used to prioritize genetic variants to be tested for association with PD to detect novel
      genes and functional variants that confer disease risk.

      Specific Aim 1:

      Profile of circulating miRNAs in the serum of PD patients and controls by next-generation
      sequencing in individual samples. Correlation between identified miRNAs and PD-related
      parameters and validation in independent cohorts

      Specific Aim 2:

      Bioinformatics prediction of target genes and miRNA functional validation

      Specific Aim 3:

      Identification of genes/genetic variants in miRNA pathways predisposing to PD

      Expected outcomes:

      The study will allow to discover novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for Parkinson's
      disease. As the deep phenotype characterization of the study sample, the project expects to
      find new associations of identified miRNAs with disease-related parameters and define the
      role of miRNAs in the physiological pathways in which those parameters are involved and in
      the etiology of PD. Also, the understanding of the genetics of the disease will open avenues
      for novel therapeutic strategies.

        Collection of 1000 case-control study samples with a large phenotype and genotype
        characterization. The study includes 500 PD patients and 500 age/gender-matched controls.
        All PD patients have been diagnosed at the IRCCS Neuromed and followed-up (at least for 5
        years) for disease progression. Data collected from patients and unrelated controls
        include: socio-demographic status, life style, anamnesis and family history, exposure to
        toxic chemical and/or environmental agents. Patients have been studied with a protocol
        comprising neurological examination (Stadio di Hoehn and Yahr, MDS-UPDRS part III, MOCA
        test) and evaluation of no motor symptoms. Information about drugs therapy have been also
        collected.
