  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objetive of this study is to analyze the effectiveness of a home rehabilitaton
      program vs a e-Health program. Therapeutic approach will be by electroanalgesia and exercise
      of patients with chronic low back pain.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double blind clinical trial will be developed in a sample of 80 subjects with chronic low
      back pain. Patients will receive 3 weekly sessions of electroanalgesia and an exercise
      program for 8 weeks, for a total of 24 sessions. The aim is to analyze the effectiveness of a
      home rehabilitation program vs a web platform program on disability, pain, fear of movement,
      quality of life, resistance of the trunk flexors, lumbar mobility in flexion and muscular
      electrical activity.

    <description>It consists in a home rehabilitation program. Patients will recieve electroanalgesia with TENS and an exercise program following the McKenzie method. At first and second sessions, patients will be instructed on how to use electroanalgesia and how to perform the exercises. Then, patients will perform the therapy at home. Patients will perform the treatment 3 times per week, for 4 weeks, with a total of 24 sessions</description>

    <description>It consists in a support system for the treatment of chronic low back pain based on web technologies. The system can register a subject and provide a treatment of electroanalgesia and exercise through the Mckenzie method. Video applications of electroanalgesia and exercises will be shown to patients who use their computer or mobile device to access the platform through the Internet. The treatments will be recommended by the system based on the database that is configured to accommodate the application of electroanalgesia and McKenzie exercises based on the diagnosis according to the McKenzie method.patients will perform the treatment 3 times per week, for 4 weeks, with a total of 24 sessions</description>

    <description>It consists in a home rehabilitation program performing electroanalgesia and an exercise program following the Mckenzie method. Patients will be instructed in the use of the TENS device using 5x9cm electrodes at the bilateral paravertebral level, the patients that present radicular pain, the electrodes will be placed in the path of the affected nerve. The realization of exercises will be through the application of an Mckezie protocol. The duration will be the same as that used to carry out the Mckenzie protocol. Mckenzie exercises are designed to make changes in the internal components periarticular of the spine.</description>
