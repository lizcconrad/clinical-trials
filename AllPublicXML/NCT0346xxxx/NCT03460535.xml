  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a purely observational project and the objectives are to record and analyze the local
      potentials at the site of Premature Ventricular Contraction (VPC) focus through the Rhythmia
      system, ti determine the short and long-term success of the procedure and compare it to the
      existing literature about standard procedures, to highlight the advantages of the system
      compared to conventional mapping and to characterize optimal pace map or activation map as
      achieved by the Rhythmia system.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a purely observational study. No special methodology choice, no comparison.

      The study want to find the determination of precise location of the focus and mechanisms
      involved constitutes a challenge for conventional electrophysiology, even with tridimensional
      systems, because of the time needed for accurate delineation of the location (due to the
      sometimes unfrequent Ventricular Premature Beats (VPB)) and to the insufficient mapping
      density or inadequate signal characteristics. The Rhythmia system could allow better
      determination of the focus location in relation to the anatomical structures, especially with
      unfrequent VPB, because of the available high density mapping due to the number of closed
      high-resolution electrodes located on the Orion catheter. Better delineation of the true
      focus origin and of the mechanisms involved (automaticity vs re-entry) may be of useful help
      for better understanding and efficient therapy.

        Patients will be recruited by consultations, hospitalisations or referral by external
        doctors, in the department of Cardiology.

        This is a purely observational study. No power calculation will be needed due to the lack
