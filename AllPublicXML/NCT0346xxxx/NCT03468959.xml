      This study is to examine the association between maternal omega3 and other polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFAs) during pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as other
      non-typical development (Non-TD) in the prospective Markers of Autism Risk in Babies-Learning
      Early Signs (MARBLES) cohort.
