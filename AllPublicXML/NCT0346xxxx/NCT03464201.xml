  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The good tolerability profile of enzalutamide, the fact that the administration of steroids
      is not necessary and the impressive results achieved in prostate cancer, make this drug an
      ideal candidate to be tested in ovarian granulosa cancer, a tumor that could somehow be
      considered as &quot;female prostate cancer&quot;.
