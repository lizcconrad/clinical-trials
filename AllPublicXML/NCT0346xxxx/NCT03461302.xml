  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale/hypothesis: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease, occurring most
      frequently in children. Currently, topically applied corticosteroids are used as a standard
      anti-inflammatory treatment. When a corticosteroid with a high potency is used for a long
      period of time, adverse effects like skin atrophy and systemic effects may occur, especially
      in children. In addition, corticophobia among patients is an issue that warrants alternatives
      for the treatment of AD in children. An alternative treatment is the topical application of
      coal tar, which is known to be an effective and safe treatment for AD for ages, and is used
      in our department for decennia. Although there is convincing evidence in the literature on
      the safety of coal tar, evidence in the literature on the efficacy of coal tar in the
      treatment of AD is lacking, especially in children.

      Objective: To evaluate efficacy of topical treatment with coal tar compared to topical
      treatment with corticosteroids in children aged 1 to &lt;16 years with moderate to severe AD

      Study design: investigator-initiated, parallel-group randomized controlled pilot study

      Study population: Children aged 1 to &lt;16 years with moderate-severe AD

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized in two groups: (1) topical treatment with coal tar
      or (2) topical treatment with moderate potency corticosteroids for a treatment duration of 4
      weeks.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is the percentage change in EASI score
      at week 2.
