  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to provide preliminary data to determine if concentrations of
      piperacillin/tazobactam change in patients with severe respiratory failure receiving
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The investigators hypothesize that patients will
      have significant changes in concentration measurements, specifically an increased clearance
      rate and increased volume of distribution, during ECMO as compared to critically ill
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a healthy patient, the lungs provide oxygen to the blood and remove carbon dioxide.
      However, in patients with severe lung failure, blood may not adequately be delivered to the
      lungs, or the lungs may not adequately supply blood with oxygen. In this case, patients may
      require assistance from a machine to help provide this oxygen. Extracorporeal membrane
      oxygenation (ECMO) is a device that acts as an artificial lung, allowing the patient to
      recover from their illness. Patients receiving support from ECMO are often put in a medically
      induced coma while their lungs heal. Certain drugs may stick to the internal surfaces of the
      machine; therefore leading to decreased concentrations. Patients receiving ECMO often require
      antimicrobials to treat severe infections. However, little data exist concerning the likely
      changes in drug concentrations from drug circuit interactions in adult patients receiving
      ECMO.
