  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is reported in the literature that children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
      (ADHD) may have executive function deficits, impaired social functions, emotional
      dysregulation, behavioral disorders and motor impairments. Furthermore, studies have shown
      that exercise, such as acute and chronic aerobic exercises and acute whole body vibration
      training, improves executive functions and motor abilities and so it is hypothesized that
      exercise may have a potential or additional treatment option for children with ADHD.
      Neurobiological researches have already proven the effects on brain changes during exercise
      and in the case of ADHD, increasing levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine within
      the front striatal lobes of the brain were highlighted when discussing the effects on this
      neurodevelopmental disorder. The literature emphasizes the importance of physical activity in
      children with ADHD, but there is no clarity regarding the frequency, intensity or duration of
      the exercise. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate and compare the effects of
      treadmill training as an aerobic exercise and whole body vibration training on executive
      functions and balance in children with ADHD.

    <measure>Change from baseline postural stability test score in Biodex Balance System at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Postural Stability Training mode is designed to emphasize specific movement patterns or strategies by placing markers anywhere on the screen grid. The patient's score is a tally of how many times the patient can touch targets with the on-screen cursor during any session. Time counts up or down as set.The Postural Stability Test emphasizes a patient's ability to maintain center of balance. The patient's score on this test assesses deviations from center, thus a lower score is more desirable than a higher score.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline limits of stability test score in Biodex Balance System at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Limits of Stability Training screen is designed to challenge the user to move through a movement pattern consistent with the sway envelope.This test challenges patients to move and control their center of gravity within their base of support.
During each test trial, patients must shift their weight to move the cursor from the center target to a blinking target and back as quickly and with as little deviation as possible. The same process is repeated for each of nine targets</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline Stroop test score at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test assesses the response inhibition and measures the ability to shift perceptual set in accordance with changing demands. It also measures the inhibition of a habitual behavior pattern and behaving in an unusual manner. Defects in these abilities result in lack of perseveration, stereotypic behaviors, and difficulty in controlling behavior. These functions are mainly controlled by the frontal lobes. Higher interference scores indicate poorer performance. This test has been adapted and standardized for the Turkish population</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline BRIEF (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function) score at 8 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>İt assesses executive function and self-regulation in children and teens. High scores indicate a higher level of dysfunction in a specific domain of executive functions.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline Conners score at 8 weeks</measure>
