  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sitting for long uninterrupted periods of time can increase risk of heart disease, diabetes
      and early death, even if you take part in the United Kingdom government guidelines for
      physical activity of 21/2 hours per week of exercise. Effective interventions to reduce the
      risk of these diseases are therefore needed. The aim of this study is to examine the effects
      of regularly breaking up sitting time with light intensity treadmill desk walking among
      office workers on health markers, sitting time and physical activity. If using a treadmill
      desk leads to benefits in these disease risk markers then this could be an effective strategy
      to improve employee health in the workplace.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group. After
      baseline activity and health measures, they will take part in the study for 4 weeks.

      Intervention group: Participants will have a treadmill desk placed in their office or a
      nearby location and will be asked to walk while working on the treadmill desk continuously
      for 20 minutes at a self-selected slow pace each hour for a minimum of 6 hours per shift.
      There will be one treadmill desk between 2-3 people.

      Control group: Participants will be asked to work as usual at their regular workstation with
      no changes in their physical activity and dietary habits.

      Sitting time and physical activity will be measured at baseline and during the last week f
      the intervention. A range of health and psychological measures will be taken at baseline and
      post-intervention.

    <description>Measured using the Cohen Perceived Stress likert scale.
10 items are answered on the following scale that refer to the person's thoughts and feelings over the past month: never=1; almost never=2; sometimes=3; fairly often=4; very often=5
The items are in the past month how often have you:
been upset because of something that happened unexpectedly
felt unable to control the important things in your life
felt nervous or stressed
felt confident about your ability to handle personal problems
felt that things were going your way
found that you could not cope with all the things you had to do
been able to control irritations in your life
that you were on top of things
been angry because of things that happened that were outside of your control
felt that difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them
Positively worded items are reverse scored and the ratings are summed, with higher scores indicating more perceived stress.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived vigor</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention (within 1 week after intervention ends)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using a 12 item likert scale. The scale is: never of almost never=1; very infrequently=2; quite infrequently=3; sometimes=4; quite frequently=5; very frequently=6; always or almost always=7.
The items are based on how often have you felt this way at work? There are three subscales of the Shirom-Melamed Vigor Measure. The three subscales are: Physical Strength; Emotional Energy; and Cognitive Liveliness.
Higher scores indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <description>A shared treadmill workstation will be installed in participating offices, or in a nearby location in case there is no space to fit the workstation in the office, enrolled to this group. Within the intervention group there will be a maximum allocation of two participants per treadmill desk. The participants in the intervention group will be asked to interrupt their sitting with 20 minutes of self-selected light-intensity walking at a speed of 1-4 km/h each hour for a minimum of 6 hours per shift to accumulate a total of 2 hours of light-intensity activity per work day.</description>
