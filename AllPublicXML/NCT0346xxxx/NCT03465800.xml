  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research seeks to examine psychological factors that may impact relationship between
      incentives and health behavior engagement, specifically physical activity. Additionally, it
      will compare the impact of two different incentive schedules on behavior engagement, one
      providing immediate rewards (i.e. rewards received on a daily basis) and another providing
      delayed rewards (i.e. rewards received at the end of the study period), with an active
      self-monitoring intervention condition in which no rewards are offered. Study participants
      will provide reports of their physical activity each day for three weeks, and in the two
      incentive conditions, they will receive small monetary rewards for their physical activity.
      Following the three week reporting and reward period, participants will complete two
      additional assessments, measuring psychological constructs and behavior engagement following
      the cessation of rewards. The study will also examine how cognitive and anthropomorphic
      factors may contribute to intervention response and the effects on psychological constructs.
