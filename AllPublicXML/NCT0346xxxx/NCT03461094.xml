  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fluid therapy is often used as first line treatment of acute circulatory failure, aiming an
      increase in cardiac output (by improving preload) and in tissue perfusion. Depending on left
      ventricular systolic function, fluid challenge could lead to an increase in cardiac ouput and
      tissue perfusion, or only detrimental consequences (by fluid overload and aggravation of lung
      and tissues oedema, increase of morbi-mortality). Patients are defined as responders to fluid
      therapy if one can observe an increase of cardiac output up to 15% after fluid therapy (500ml
      of crystalloids): gold standard test used in most of the studies on the subject. Literature
      reports on heterogenous populations a reproductible and constant response rate to this fluid
      challenge of 50%. It seems reasonable to dispose of indices allowing to predict fluid
      responsiveness without resulting in fluid intake. Statics markers have been abandonned for
      several years and dynamics methods have been developped.

      In front of arrythmia, validated methods are scarce. Passive leg rising method appears to be
      the only one and it's validity seems to be less well documented than in sinusal patients. The
      purpose of this study is to determine a new method to assess fluid responsiveness in
      arrythmic patients.

      In atrial fibrillation, RR interval varies widely between cardiac cylces. Systolic interval
      remain constant. Variations will occure at expense of diastolic interval, or ventricular
      filling interval. One can reliably assume that when RR is longer, preload is rising. If the
      patient is on the ascendant part of the Franck-Starling curve, a longer RR should cause au
      greater VTI (Vitess Time Integral, surrogate of cardiac output).

      The evaluation by transthoracic echocardiography of the indice delta ITV / delta RR should
      determine the degree of fluid responsiveness in arrhythmic patients.

      After decision of fluid expansion, patients will have haemodynamic and echocardiographic data
      measured, delta ITV / delta RR indice assessed, then passive leg rising and fluid expansion
      with 500 ml of cristalloids administered, with evaluation of VTI (as surrogate of cardiac
      output) at each time. Fluid responders will be compared to non-responders to evaluate the
      diagnostic performances of the indice delta ITV / delta RR.
