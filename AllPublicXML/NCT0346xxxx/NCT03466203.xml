  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of
      LLF580 administered subcutaneously over 3 months in obese subjects. In addition, the study
      will also determine early efficacy signals in various metabolic diseases associated with
      elevated triglycerides and/or obesity.
