      This study compares the efficacy of four different types (Cognitive Behavior Therapy for
      Insomnia (CBT-I), Focus of Attention (FOA), Combined CBT-I and FOA and Sleep Hygiene) of
      therapies approaches for the treatment of insomnia. This study is a randomized, open label
      study, the participants are asked to review the benefits they get from the intervention. This
      study involve 6 weekly sessions after screening and completion of the end of treatment,
      3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-up assessment. The trained study staff will administer
      study scales during therapy session. The subjective review of insomnia improvement will be
      assessed at end of treatment, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months follow-up assessment. Subjects
      are adult who meet, DSM-5 the diagnostic criteria for primary Insomnia.

      Inclusion/Exclusion criteria to be assessed at Screening (Visit 1) and Visit 2. For those
      found eligible who complete the study, participation will include Screening (Visit 1), 6
      weekly sessions after screening, and completion of the post-treatment and 6-month followup
      assessment.

      Once subject sign the consent form, subject will be asked inclusion and exclusion criteria
      and will be given details about the study as per protocol.

      Those eligible will be randomly assigned to one of four behavioral treatment approaches. The
      participant will have six weekly one hour in person sessions in which the assigned treatment
      will be administered. The participant will be assessed at the end of treatment and again at 6
      month followup.
