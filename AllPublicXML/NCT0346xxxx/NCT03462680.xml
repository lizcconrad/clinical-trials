  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease. The use of anti-inflammatory drugs
      was found to reduce the risk of PD . Niacin may play an important role in reducing
      inflammation in PD. The investigators also found that individuals with PD have a chronic
      niacin deficiency .

      The purposes of this study are to (1) examine the blood, urine and spinal fluid of persons
      with Parkinson's to look for evidence of inflammation and; (2) whether 6 months of vitamin B3
      supplements may reduce the inflammation and/or improve symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays a central role in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology [1] as evidenced by
      the presence of microglia in the substantia nigra in post-mortem samples [2] as well as
      activated microglia and cytokines in clinical and animal studies [3]. The use of non-aspirin
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was found to reduce the risk of PD [4]. The
      investigators recently identified an anti-inflammatory receptor GPR109A that is upregulated
      in PD [5]. Niacin has a high affinity for this receptor, suggesting that it (niacin) may play
      an important role in reducing inflammation in PD. The investigators also found that
      individuals with PD have a chronic niacin deficiency [5]. Using seed funding from the local
      PD chapter, the investigators obtained pilot data which suggested that restoring the
      deficiency via over-the-counter (OTC) supplementation reduced inflammation and decreased the
      severity of the disease symptoms [6]. In this VA-funded study, the investigators will
      determine the effect of 6 months' OTC niacin supplementation on inflammation (as assessed in
      the blood and spinal fluid) and severity of the PD symptoms.

               -  PD features include the presence of at least two of the four cardinal clinical
                  manifestations of the disease, which are tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and
                  disturbances of posture or gait, without any other known or suspected cause of
                  Parkinsonism.

          -  Subjects should be stabilized on PD medication for at least 3 months before enrollment
             into the study.
