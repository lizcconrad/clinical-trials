  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pilot study is designed to investigate the acute and chronic effects of the diet
      supplement tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) on endothelial function in participants with
      type 2 diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to investigate the effect of two doses of TUDCA on endothelial
      function.All subjects will receive 500 mg/day in a one week run-in period and then 1750
      mg/day in one week treatment period. The study will consist of four visits (screening visit
      and three study visits), and last up to 2 weeks for individual subjects, depending on the
      time between visits. It is estimated that the study will last two years from IRB approval
      through data analysis.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Type 2 diabetes mellitus defined as fasting glucose greater than or equal to 120
             mg/dL, HgA1C â‰¥6.5% or ongoing treatment with hypoglycemic medication.

          -  Willing to give written informed consent and able to understand, to participate in and
             to comply with the study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women lactating or pregnant. All women with childbearing potential will undergo a
             urine pregnancy test at each visit to exclude pregnancy.

          -  Treatment with an investigational product within the last 30 days.

          -  Clinically evident major illness of other organ systems, including end-stage cancer,
             renal failure, or other conditions that in the opinion of the principal investigator
             make a clinical study inappropriate.

          -  Inability to provide informed consent.

          -  Clinical instability that would preclude withholding medications as determined by the
             study physician.
