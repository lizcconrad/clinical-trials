    <textblock>
      This study will enroll male and female patients 18 years old or older who have a diagnosis of
      locally advanced, unresectable or metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma (except GIST and
      Kaposi's) from any site. A minimum of 1 prior chemotherapy regimen, including adjuvant and
      neo-adjuvant therapy for the treatment of sarcoma, must have been given. Patients eligible
      for an anthracycline should have received a prior anthracycline containing regimen. Patients
      who decline or are not eligible for anthracycline treatment may be considered for this
      protocol as a first line treatment. Patients with a diagnosis of liposarcoma should also have
      received eribulin.

      During screening, subjects will receive a test dose (15g) of ascorbate. If the test dose
      results in any toxicity &gt;/= CTCAE grade 3 or a significant medical event in the opinion of
      the principal investigator, the patient will be considered a screen failure.

      Subjects who pass screening will then receive ascorbate, 75g, on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16
      of a 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15, after the infusion
      of ascorbate. Concomitant treatment will continue for at least 6 cycles. Patients whose
      disease has not progressed while receiving gemcitabine and ascorbate and who are tolerating
      therapy may continue either single agent gemcitabine or concomitant treatment beyond 6 cycles
      at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment will be terminated with progression of
      disease. Disease will be assessed by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or MRI of the lesion
      every 2 cycles for progression.

         10. Patients must have had disease progression on or following their most recent treatment
             regimen or on presentation for the first time with locally advanced unresectable or

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency

          2. New York Heart Association (NYHA) Grade II or greater congestive heart failure (see

          4. History of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months prior to Day 1

          5. Known CNS disease, except for treated brain metastasis: Treated brain metastases are
             defined as having no evidence of progression or hemorrhage after treatment and no
             ongoing requirement for dexamethasone, as ascertained by clinical examination and
             brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period. Anticonvulsants (stable dose)
             are allowed. Treatment for brain metastases may include whole brain radiotherapy
             (WBRT), radiosurgery (RS; Gamma Knife, LINAC, or equivalent) or a combination as
             deemed appropriate by the treating physician. Patients with CNS metastases treated by
             neurosurgical resection or brain biopsy performed within 3 months prior to Day 1 will
             be excluded

             monitor, and the PI).

          7. Significant vascular disease (e.g., aortic aneurysm, requiring surgical repair or
             recent peripheral arterial thrombosis) within 6 months prior to Day 1

          8. Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of
             therapeutic anticoagulation)

          9. Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation. Use of effective means of
             contraception (men and women) in subjects of child-bearing potential

         10. Patients who are on the following drugs and cannot have a drug substitution:
             flecainide, methadone, amphetamines, quinidine, and chlorpropamide. High dose ascorbic
             acid may affect urine acidification and, as a result, may affect clearance rates of
             these drugs.

         11. Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical conditions

         12. Patients who have received chemotherapy or any investigational drug &lt; 2 weeks prior to
             starting study drug or who have not recovered from side effects of such therapy.

         13. Major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 28 days
             prior to Day 1 or anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course
             of the study.

         14. Concomitant use of any anti-cancer therapy or radiation therapy.

         15. Male patients whose sexual partners are WOCBP not using a double method of
             contraception during the study and 3 months after the end of treatment. One of these
             methods must be a condom.

         16. Patients with a history of another primary malignancy within 2 years other than
             curatively treated CIS of the cervix, or basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin

         17. Patients with known positivity for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); baseline
             testing for HIV is not required. High-dose ascorbate acid is a known CYP450 3A4
             inducer, which results in lower serum levels of antiretroviral drugs.37

         18. Patients with any significant history of non-compliance to medical regimens or with
             inability to grant a reliable informed consent

         19. Patients with GIST tumors are excluded
