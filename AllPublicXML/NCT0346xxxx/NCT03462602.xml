      Introduction: The value of routine nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression after pancreatic
      surgeries is not yet established. Previous studies in the setting of abdominal surgery
      suggested that the use of NGT does not accomplish any of its intended goals.

      Methods/design: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter trial with two
      treatment arms. One group underwent pancreatic surgeries with routine NGT and was left in
      place after surgery until the patient passed flatus or stool. The other group underwent
      pancreatic surgeries without receiving NGT decompression, in which the NGT was removed at the
      end of surgery.

      Discussion: Routine NGT decompression after pancreatic surgeries does or does not appear to
      have its anticipated advantages would be discovered in this RCT.
