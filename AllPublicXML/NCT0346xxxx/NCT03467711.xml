  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopy is increasingly used for major abdominal and pelvic surgery. As this approach is
      also recommended in elderly patients with serious comorbidities, optimal fluid therapy
      guidance during this procedure is important.

      Many studies have reported that less invasive dynamic indices such as pulse pressure
      variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), which are derived from the arterial
      pressure waveform, are superior to static indices to predict fluid responsiveness. PPV and
      SVV are based on the heart-lung interaction and reflect cyclic changes in stroke volume
      induced by mechanical ventilation in the closed-chest condition. Therefore, their ability to
      predict fluid responsiveness can be affected by factors that influence the arterial tone or
      the compliance of the respiratory system.

      Laparoscopic surgery for the abdominal visceral organs requires pneumoperitoneum and the
      Trendelenburg position to optimize surgical conditions, and can reduce cardiac output and
      respiratory compliance. Accordingly, the usefulness of PPV and SVV in predicting fluid
      responsiveness during laparoscopic surgery under these conditions may be questioned. A recent
      study investigated the effect of pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopy. Using an uncalibrated
      pressure waveform device, PPV and SVV had a relatively poor capacity to predict fluid
      responsiveness during laparoscopy. Interestingly, Sheila and colleagues recently reported
      that the changes in pulse pressure variation or stroke volume variation (ΔPPV6-8 and ΔSVV6-8)
      obtained by transiently increasing tidal volume from 6 to 8 mL/kg predicted body weight
      (tidal volume challenge) are superior to PPV and SVV in predicting fluid responsiveness
      during low tidal volume ventilation. The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate
      that the changes in PPV and SVV (ΔPPV6-8 and ΔSVV6-8) and the after a &quot;tidal volume
      challenge&quot; predict fluid responsiveness during pneumoperitoneum and Trendelenburg position.
