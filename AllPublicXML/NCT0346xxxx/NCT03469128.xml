    <textblock>
      The present research was aimed at comparing the effects of the Cognitive Processing Therapy
      (CPT) with the effects of medicine in treating the patients who have dual diagnosis PTSD &amp;
      SUD. The present study examines the extent to which CPT is effective in treating PTSD
      symptoms for patients with PTSD and SUD.

      Participants were grouped into 3 groups: first: Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) in which
      participants completed 12 sessions of CPT. Second: Medication group in which patients with
      co-occurrence PTSD &amp; SUD disorders were treated by medicine (Disulfiram, Naltrexone and
      Buprenorphine). Third: control group that consists of patients with co-occurrence PTSD &amp; SUD
      disorders who were not treated yet (waiting lists in the hospital).
