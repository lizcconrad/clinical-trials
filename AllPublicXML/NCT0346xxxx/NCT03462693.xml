    <textblock>
      A single-center, observational, prospective, two dynamic cohorts study with before-after
      design. Group 1: Treatment with 6 sessions using dry needling with DNHS® (Dry Needling for
      Hypertonicity and Spasticity) on the spastic muscles of the affected arm in patients with
      stroke plus standard physiotherapy treatment. Group 2: Standard physiotherapy treatment.
      Spasticity will be assessed by Modifying Modified Ashworth Scale (MMAS), functionality with
      the Fugl-Meyer scale for the upper limb, motor recovery with Brunnstrom Stages Scale (BSS)
      and upper limb spasticity pattern (ULP), pain by 10-points Numerical Rating Scale (NRS10) and
      the quality of life with the Euro QoL 5D 5L survey.

      In both groups the valuations will be made following the same schedule.

      Once each patient has signed the informed consent document and it has been verified that the
      inclusion criteria are met, it will be assigned the same identification number (ID) that is
      related to its Clinical History (CH) by simple coding; custody of the file with the
      relationship of each ID with its CH will be the responsibility of the principal investigator.
      Patients admitted to the Guadarrama Hospital with the diagnosis of stroke and who meet the
      eligibility criteria will be treated by their usual physiotherapist, who will administer the
      standard dry needling intervention plus standard physiotherapy treatment or only standard
      physiotherapy treatment as a function of being trained and qualified to administer dry
      needling.

      Patients will receive 6 sessions of DNHS® (Dry Needling for Hypertonicity and Spasticity)
      technique with an interval of 1 week between each session (1st to 4th sessions) and every 15
      days (5th and 6th sessions). The procedure will be applied according to the corresponding
      protocols established in the NWPs (Normalized Work Plans) used in the usual clinical practice
      in the Guadarrama Hospital. All patients (both groups) will receive standard daily
      physiotherapy treatment for the affected arm according to the NWPs used in the Guadarrama
      Hospital.

      The DNHS® technique is specifically indicated for the treatment of spasticity. This technique
      differs from that usually used to relieve pain and deactivate myofascial trigger points
      (MTPs). The muscles to be treated are placed in a submaximum stretching position; the
      evaluation criteria when defining the needle insertion zone are based on finding an increase
      in modularity and muscle activity in the area when the muscle undergoes rapid stretching.
      Once the area to be treated is located, the needle is inserted and moves between 0.5 and 1 cm
      in / deep and fan out / surface to cause a local or global spasm reaction. Treatment ceases
      when the frequency of these responses decreases markedly or disappears. If the patient feels
      &quot;not tolerable&quot; pain (some discomfort from the dry needling is usual), you can stop the
      treatment at any time. Before and after each dry needling session or standard physiotherapy
      treatment patients will be evaluated by their usual physiotherapist, using the upper limb
      block of the Fugl-Meyer scale that assesses motor skills and sensitivity of the affected arm,
      evaluation of pain through NRS10 and assessment of spasticity of muscles to be treated by
      MMAS. Also, at the beginning, in the 4th session and at the end of the study, the Euro-QoL 5D
      5L quality of life survey will be administered, with a license for use. In addition BSS and
      ULP will be evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study. In each dry needling
      session, the caliber of the needle used, the number of fast-in and fast-out of the needle and
      the number of the spasm reactions caused for the purpose of establishing the dose pattern
      shall be recorded for each treated muscle.

    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Upper Limb Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke evaluates and measures recovery in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. It consists of 4 domains formed by ordinal items of 3 points: 1 (not performed), 2 (partial execution) and 3 (complete execution). The maximum total sum score of the scale is 226. The domains are: Motor block consisting of 33 items with a maximum total sum score of 66 and consisting of the following sections: A: Upper Extremity, B: Wrist, C: Hand and D: Coordination and speed; an increase of 10 points in this block is described as a clinically important change. Three other domains are added to the motor block: H: Sensation, with 6 items with a maximum total sum score of 12, J: Passive joint movement, with 12 items with a maximum total sum score of 24 and J: Joint pain with 12 items with a total maximum sum score of 24.</description>

    <description>The Modification of Modified Ashworth Scale evaluates the increase in muscle tone in patients with central nervous system lesions. It consists of 4 ordinal categories: 0 (no increase of the tone), 1 (increase of tone that appears at the end of the range of movement), 2 (marked increase of tone that appears in the whole movement path although the passive movement is easy), 3 (increase of tone that appears in the whole range of movement and that makes passive mobilization difficult) and 4 (the part affects this rigid extension or flexion).</description>

    <measure>Euro QoL 5D quality of life scale</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Euro QoL 5D quality of life scale is a survey of perceived quality of life that consists of 5 domains: Mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain / discomfort and anxiety / depression; each domain is evaluated with an inverse Likert scale of 5 points where 1 indicates the absence of a problem and 5 the most extreme problem. It also consists of a subscale that evaluates the level of global health through a visual analog scale of 100 points. A unique health state is defined by combining 1 level from each of the 5 dimensions, this combination can be converted into a single index value by facilitating the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).</description>
