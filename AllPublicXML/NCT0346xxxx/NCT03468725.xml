  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The XEN1101 Phase 1 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      that will eventuate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and effects on
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of oral doses of XEN1101 in healthy male subjects.The
      TMS procedure is designed to demonstrate delivery of XEN1101 into the central nervous system
      and to observe a change in cortical excitability as measured by EEG and/or EMG activity. It
      is estimated there will be approximately 15 subjects in the planned study.
