      The overall objective of this study is to explore whether transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) can accelerate associative learning and boost associative memory in
      healthy subjects.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of transcranial Direct Current
      Stimulation (tDCS) stimulation during a verbal paired-associate learning task to determine if
      tDCS may be used as a way to enhance brain plasticity during an associative memory task, and
      to accelerate learning and to optimize associative memory performance. We hypothesize that
      participants who receive tDCS stimulation will improve their associative memory performance.
