      Investigational agent, AZD6738 will be given in combination with Olaparib to women with
      recurrent ovarian cancer (platinum-sensitive or platinum-resistant).

      This study will determine if using Olaparib in combination with AZD6738 is safe and tolerable
      and also determine the objective response rate and progression free survival of combination
      of AZD 6738 and Olaparib in women with recurrent ovarian cancer in distinct Pt-sensitive and
      Pt-resistant cohorts.

      Women 18 years or older, who have recurrent ovarian cancer will be enrolled in this study.
      After consenting to participate in this trial, they will undergo screening process which will
      involve medical exam and blood work. If found eligible to participate in the trial, they will
      be given olaparib to be taken on all 28 days of the cycle and investigational AZD 6738 from
      days 1-7. For the first cycle, the subject will need to come in every week for lab tests and
      physical exam - this will help the treating physician determine an adverse event as soon as
      it happens. After that, patients are expected to come in every month at the end of each cycle
      (each cycle is 28 days).

      Patients will undergo scans for tumor assessments every 2 cycles and if stable disease or
      response to therapy is documented after cycle 4, imaging will continue every 3 cycles
      thereafter.

             transfusion within 28 days prior to dosing).

         12. Patients must be at least 2 weeks from previous therapy (chemotherapy, hormonal
             therapy, and radiation therapy, or investigational agents; 6 weeks for mitomycin C) to

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known brain metastases diagnosed within 1 year will be excluded from
             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop
             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic
             and other adverse events.

          2. Patients who have had prior AZD6738 or other cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors such as
             other ATM or ATR inhibitor, WEE-1 inhibitor or CHK1 (or 1/2) inhibitors.

          3. Patients with a serious cardiac condition, such as congestive heart failure; New York
             Heart Association Class III/IV heart disease; unstable angina pectoris; myocardial
             infarction within the last 3 months; valvulopathy that is severe, moderate, or deemed
             clinically significant; or arrhythmias that are symptomatic or require treatment.
             Resting ECG with QTc &gt; 470 msec on 2 or more time points within a 24 hour period or
             family history of long QT syndrome.

             orthostatic hypotension.

          5. Lack of recovery of prior adverse events due to prior cancer therapy to Grade ≤1 (NCI
             CTCAE v4.03; except alopecia). Stable persistent grade 2 peripheral neuropathy may be
             allowed as determined on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the PI. Patients
             with platinum-related hypomagnesemia (on replacement) will be eligible.

          6. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, clinically
             significant GI bleeding or hemoptysis within 28 days prior to the start of the study,
             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          7. Another previous, active or current invasive malignancy within the last 5 years, with
             the exception of curatively treated stage Ia cervical carcinoma, or resected stage IA,
