  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish and identify the level of sedation that is performed in
      the endoscopy rooms of Galdakao Hospital. To do this, the investigators used the BIS
      monitoring system, which obtains objective values in real time from the anesthesia performed.
      The monitoring is completed with basic parameters validated by European guidelines (heart
      rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate), capnography and Ramsay
      sedation scale, widely validated for use outside the operating room. The main work hypothesis
      was that in at least 10% of the patients BIS values compatible with moderate or deep sedation
      would be obtained (BIS &lt;65).

      Observational study in patients undergoing scheduled colonoscopy in endoscopy rooms of the
      Galdakao-Usansolo Hospital. The investigators objectified the level of sedation that was
      performed in these procedures using Bispectral Index Monitoring, as well as the total dose of
      medication required and the level of satisfaction obtained after completing the sedation. The
      incidence of hemodynamic and respiratory complications observed was included, as well as the
      treatment needed to solve them.

      A total of 196 patients were needed to obtain statistically significant results. Qualitative
      variables are expressed in the form of freguencies and percentages and continuous variables
      in the form of means and stnadard deviations. Comparisions of percentages were made by the
      Chi square test and the difference of means in the continuous variables by the t
      test.Stadistical significance will be assumed when p&lt;0.05. All estadistical analyzes were
      carried out using SAS V9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Carey, NC).
