    <textblock>
      Current diagnostic criteria for Immune ThrombocytoPenia (ITP) are mainly based on the
      presence of low numbers of platelets, excluding other multiple causes of thrombocytopenia,
      including immunodeficiencies, constitutional or acquired thrombocytopenia, hypersplenism and
      clonal hematological disorders such as MDS, disorders lymphoproliferative and acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML), among others. The analysis complementary tests for the diagnosis of ITP
      include studies basic systematic hematology, together with autoimmune assays and
      microbiological tests, while the evaluation of bone marrow is limited to elderly patients
      and/or patients resistant to treatment. Previous research has described the development of
      Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) in patients with a previous diagnosis of ITP, and even the
      presence of MDS associated with genetic background. Therefore, it is conceivable fact that a
      percentage of cases with clinical signs of ITP in the moment of appearance may actually
      correspond to the first stages of MDS development in which bone marrow cells are not
      systematically evaluated in the initial presentation.

      The anomalous immunophenotypic patterns between multiple compartments of bone marrow cells
      and peripherally blood (PB) platelets have been characterized through flow cytometry. The
      flow cytometry currently represents an important complementary tool for diagnosis of MDS that
      has shown great effectiveness and applicability in the differential diagnosis of non-clonal
      cytopenias against early MDS and for the detection of stages prior to MDS. Besides, the flow
      cytometry has made it possible to detect the presence of coexisting features related to MDS
      in patients with other malignancies hematologic conditions such as multiple myeloma, AML, and
      lymphocytic leukemia chronic. Therefore, the immunophenotypic analysis of the cells of the
      bone marrow of patients with ITP at the time of appearance would help to identify the cases
      that underlie clonal hematopoiesis MDS type. In the present study it is planned a broad
      characterization immunophenotyping of multiple compartments of bone marrow cells and PB
      platelets from patients with recently diagnosed ITP and investigate their morphological
      antecedents, in order to identify those patients who show compatible clonal hematopoietic
      patterns with MDS evident (or at risk of development), as candidates to receive most
      appropriate therapeutic methods.
