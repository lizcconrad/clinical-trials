  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will focus on pretreatment expectations of patients with early Lyme disease
      manifested as erythema migrans with the aim of assessing the association between pretreatment
      expectations quantified with a questionnaire and treatment outcome quantified with the
      presence of post-Lyme symptoms. Furthermore, the investigators will compare the prevalence of
      nonspecific symptoms among patients and among age-matched controls without a history of Lyme
      borreliosis.

    <time_frame>Study point: at 14 days post-enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>At follow-up at 14 days patients will be examined physically and will be asked an open question about health-related symptoms. Symptoms that will newly develop or worsen since the onset of erythema migrans and which will have no other known medical explanation will be regarded as post-Lyme symptoms.
Complete response to treatment will be defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status. Partial response will be defined as the presence of post-Lyme symptoms, while occurrence of new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis will be interpreted as failure.</description>

    <description>At follow-up at 2 months patients will be examined physically and will be asked an open question about health-related symptoms. Symptoms that will newly develop or worsen since the onset of erythema migrans and which will have no other known medical explanation will be regarded as post-Lyme symptoms.
Complete response to treatment will be defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status. Partial response will be defined as the presence of post-Lyme symptoms, while occurrence of new objective signs of Lyme borreliosis, and/ or persistence of borreliae as detected by culture of skin re-biopsy sample, and/or persistence of erythema migrans at more than 2 months post-treatment will be interpreted as failure.</description>

    <description>At follow-up at 6 months patients will be examined physically and will be asked an open question about health-related symptoms.

    <description>At 12 months patients will be examined physically and will be asked an open question about health-related symptoms.
Symptoms that will newly develop or worsen since the onset of erythema migrans and which will have no other known medical explanation will be regarded as post-Lyme symptoms. Complete response to treatment will be defined as a return to pre-Lyme health status.

    <measure>Change in occurrence of nonspecific symptoms from baseline to 6 months and to 12 months post-enrollment in patients with erythema migrans and control subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Study points will be: at enrollment, at 6, and at 12 months post-enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will complete a written questionnaire asking whether they had had any of 8 nonspecific symptoms (fatigue, arthralgias, headache, myalgias, paresthesias, memory difficulties, concentration difficulties, irritability) within the preceding week. Control subjects will complete the same 8-symptom questionnaire as the patients within 14 days of the examination date of the corresponding patient at enrollment, and again at 6 and 12 months. Patients and controls will grade the severity of each individual symptom on a 10-cm visual analogue scale (10 = most severe).</description>
