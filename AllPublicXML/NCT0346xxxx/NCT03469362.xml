  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracorporal urinary diversion (ICD) provides superior postoperative outcomes compared to
      extracorporal urinary diversion (ECD). The investigators' hypothesis that ICD may provide
      clinical benefit is based on principles of less bowel and ureteral handling, superior
      operating room workflow, less exposure to the external environment, and optimal visualization
      with ICD while utilizing a smaller incision compared to ECD. ICD should have less
      bowel-related complications, lower pain scores allowing patients to be discharged from the
      hospital sooner and regain functional independence more quickly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial comparing ICD to ECD following robotic-assisted radical
      cystectomy (RARC). All patients will undergo the standard of care for RARC followed by either
      extracorporal urinary diversion (ECD) or intracorporal urinary diversion (ICD). RARC will be
      performed as per center-specific techniques, which on the whole are comparable. The surgical
      approach for ileal conduit formation will be standardized with the requirement for ureteral
      stents in all patients. The post-operative care of all patients will involve use of an
      enhanced-recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol. Certain components of this protocol will be
      standardized.

      Patients will be followed-up as per the usual standard of care for RARC followed by urinary
      diversion. History and physical examination are recommended at 30 days, 3, 6, 12, 24 months
      postoperatively, and as per the clinician's discretion afterwards. During each follow up
      functional assessment for urinary and sexual quality of life will be performed as per the
      study calendar.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent

          -  At the discretion of the treating surgeon, any pre-existing condition such as severe
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that precludes a safe initiation or maintenance
             of pneumoperitoneum over a prolonged period of time and during surgery.
