    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to development of more effective treatment tactics of the
      stereotactic radiotherapy and radiosurgery alone and together with classic radiation therapy
      in primary inoperabel solid tumors and oligometastastatic cancer.

      Despite the fact that of many investigations in the world clinical researches, the SRT of
      primary-inoperabel and metastatic solid tumors combined with conventional and conformal
      radiation therapy methods the possibility of the sequences, the optimal fractions of the
      regimes and doses which determines normal tissues toxic manifestations, implementation of
      prevention, have not been solved yet.

      The conducted research works to study quality of life for improving the social status of
      patients with primary-inoperable and metastatic solid tumors, is not fully resolved.

      Thus, preparing of highly effective treatment tactics in primary-inoperable and metastatic
      solid tumors, is one of the most important problems of modern clinical oncology and this fact
      gives grounds to carry out the planned research work.
