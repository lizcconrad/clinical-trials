  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that affects a ratio of up to
      20-30% of infants prematurely born before 30rd week. Delay of starting to speak, cerebral
      palsy and cognitive disorders may be seen in infants suffering from this disease. Although
      all the evidence found on the specific mediators and pathways that regulate the mechanism by
      studies made to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism, there hasn't been any remarkable
      progress on preventing the development of BPD in new-born infants born below 1500gr body
      weight. BPD is still one of the most important morbidity and mortality reasons in premature
      infants. There is a need of further studies to understand the genetic background of BPD
      specific to different populations, to identify polymorphisms related with the disease and for
      developing genetic methods for early the diagnose of the disease.

      With this purpose, first of all polymorphisms related with BPD and those which are related
      with similar other lung diseases will be investigated. DNA samples derived from blood samples
      of 200 patients (100 BPD infant and 100 control) will be examined for polymorphisms in
      specific genes that are chosen in the light of the prior literature scanning. To the
      investigators' knowledge, this will be the first study of a broad scanning of polymorphisms
      related with BPD in Turkish population.
