  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-habilitation programs that combine physical training, nutritional support and emotional
      reinforcement have demonstrated efficacy as presurgical optimization strategies in the
      context of digestive surgery. The experience in patients at risk for cardiac surgery, one of
      those associated with higher morbidity and mortality, is anecdotal. Main objective: to
      evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a pre-habilitation program for
      the improvement of preoperative functional capacity in high-risk and intermediate risk groups
      for cardiac surgery and its impact on the reduction of postoperative complications (primary
      endpoint). Secondary objectives: (i) in-hospital stay; (ii) symptoms, quality of life, (iii)
      evaluation of information and communication technologies (ICT) as a support for the
      pre-habilitation, and (iv) design and validation of indicators for a future large-scale
      implementation of this type of intervention.

      Design: Subproject: #1: Prospective study of the efficacy of prehabilitation in heart
      transplant candidates during the study period. The results will be compared with historical
      records; #2: Randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 ratio to assess the efficacy of
      prehabilitation in patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization or valve
      replacement surgery. Subjects: Subproject #1: 40 patients candidates for heart
      transplantation. Subproject #2: 80 patients in the prehabilitation group and 80 controls in
      which a conventional treatment will be performed. Intervention: (i) personalized supervised
      resistance training, and (ii) program to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles.
      The overall duration of the intervention is estimated to be at least 4-6 weeks (variable in
      each subproject). The support with ICTs will be a significant aspect of the program in which
      the adaptation of the personal health folder of Catalonia (Cat@SalutLaMevaSalut) will be
      fundamental.
