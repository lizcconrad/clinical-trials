  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The AFERBIO study will evaluates safety and potential benefit of AferBio® in patients with
      non-small cell lung cancer undergoing at least a second-line palliative monochemotherapy.
      AferBio® is a fermented supplement in powder form obtained through biotechnological processes
      developed in Brazil. In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial,
      participants starting a new palliative regimen will be allocated to AferBio® or placebo. The
      primary aim will be to compare health-related QOL scores among the arms of the study over
      time.

          -  Diagnosis of any chronic disease that, in the researcher's opinion, will interfere
             with the participation in the study;

          -  Known diagnosis of HIV -infection;

          -  Diagnosis of any chronic disease that changes the immune system and significantly
             increases the risk of infection;

          -  The need to use G-CSF already in the first chemotherapy cycle;
