    <textblock>
      The trial proposed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an inotuzumab ozogamicin followed
      by an age-adapted intermediate intensive consolidation therapy and maintenance treatment in
      patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia older than 56 years
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances especially in younger patients, the prognosis of elderly patients
      with ALL remains dismal with a 5-year survival rate of around 20%, even after intensive
      chemotherapy.

      Inotuzumab ozogamicin (PF-05208773; CMC-544) is an antibody-targeted intravenous (IV)
      chemotherapy agent composed of an anti-CD22 antibody linked to calicheamicin, a potent
      cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic.

      After a prephase treatment, induction therapy will be based on inotuzumab ozogamicin and
      intrathecal therapy only. After a maximum of three cycles, patients will receive an age
      adapted intermediate dose consolidation chemotherapy based on the backbone of the German
      Multicenter Study Group for adult ALL (GMALL). This will be followed by a conventional
      maintenance therapy. All patients will be followed for cytological response, minimal residual
      disease and safety parameters.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patients, ≥56 years of age and fit for therapy

          2. Newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (&gt;25% marrow blasts, assessed by
             morphology; i.e. M3 marrow)

          3. Leukemic blasts must have CD22 surface expression of a least 20%, assessed by
             local/institutional flow cytometry of a bone marrow aspirate sample (assessment of
             CD22 via the reference lab for immungenetics is strongly recommended). In the case of
             an inadequate aspirate sample (dry tap), flow cytometry of peripheral blood specimen
             may be substituted if the patient has circulating blasts; alternatively, CD22
             expression may be documented by immunohistochemistry of a bone marrow biopsy specimen

          4. No previous ALL-specific treatment with the exception of corticosteroids and/or single
             dose vincristine and/or a maximum of three doses of cyclophosphamide (cumulative dose
             of 600mg/m2) and the standard prephase treatment

             infiltration of the liver, total serum bilirubin must be &lt; 2.5 x ULN and AST/ALT &lt;5 x
             ULN

          7. Serum creatinine &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or any serum creatinine level

          6. Major surgery within &lt;4 weeks before entry on study

          7. Unstable or severe uncontrolled medical condition (e.g., unstable cardiac function or
             unstable pulmonary condition)

          8. Concurrent active malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of
             the cervix, or localized prostate cancer that has been definitely treated with
             radiation or surgery; patients with previous malignancies are eligible provided that
             they have been disease free for &gt;2 years

             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
