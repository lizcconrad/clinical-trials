    <textblock>
      To conduct a superiority trial of COPES versus standard Veterans Health Administration (VHA)
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Chronic Pain (CBT-CP)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our prior efficacy trial found that COPES was not inferior to in-person CBT-CP and that
      participants attended, on average, a little over two more treatment weeks in COPES than
      in-person treatment, presumably due to the ease of in-home treatment attendance relative to
      in-person treatment.
