    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to determine the effect of a clinical decision support tool on
      image ordering for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. Patients who present with acute
      unilateral flank or abdominal pain in whom emergency department providers suspect
      nephrolithiasis will receive either a clinical decision support module or no module.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CT scan is overused for patients who present to the ED with suspected nephrolithiasis (acute
      flank or abdominal pain). We have developed a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to
      identify those patients in whom ultrasound is appropriate. The CDS tool is based on the Study
      of Ultrasonography vs. Computed Tomography for Suspected Nephrolithiasis in the Emergency
      Department.

      Our goal is to assess the effectiveness of a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to improve
      advanced imaging for suspected nephrolithiasis in the ED. We hypothesize those randomized to
      receiving CDS will order CT less often compared to those receiving control. Also, we
      hypothesize those randomized to receiving CDS will have a similar ED length of stay and rate
      of unexpected ED return as those receiving control.

      Study design: Randomized trial of a CDS tool embedded in the electronic health record for
      patients with suspected nephrolithiasis. The study will be conducted at UCSF Department of
      Emergency Medicine.

      Study subjects: We will enroll adult patients who present to the ED who present with
      &quot;suspected nephrolithiasis&quot;, which we define as those with 1) symptoms of nephrolithiasis,
      and 2) require cross-sectional imaging. Symptoms of nephrolithiasis include acute unilateral
      flank and/or abdominal pain, typically described as severe and colicky. The pain is
      accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and urinary symptoms, such as hematuria. The imaging studies
      emergency physicians typically order for suspected nephrolithiasis include: CT scan (CT scan
      without contrast, CT scan with contrast, CT scan with and without contrast), radiology
      ultrasound, or point of care (POCUS) ultrasound. We will enroll patients whose providers
      order an imaging test for kidney stone - CT scan, ultrasound, or POCUS.

      Sampling, recruiting and retaining subjects: We will enroll consecutive patients who present
      to the ED with the selection criteria. Those with suspected nephrolithiasis but have an
      exclusion criteria will be recorded and compared to those who were enrolled. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to either receiving CDS recommendations or no CDS
      recommendations. Subjects will not receive informed consent, and will not be contacted by
      staff.

      Intervention: The intervention is the CDS tool, which consists of 2 components: 1) assess the
      presence of appropriateness criteria for ultrasound; 2) provide recommendations to encourage
      clinicians to order ultrasound, and a place to change the order. The CDS tool will be placed
      or integrated into EPIC, at the point of order entry. The tool will be triggered by an order
      for cross-sectional imaging to identify or rule out kidney stone. At UCSF, this will include
      CT for suspected nephrolithiasis.

      The main outcome variable will be proportion of study arm who receive CT, and median
      radiation dose. Proportion of study arm who receive CT is defined as #CT scans
      ordered/#patients in study arm. The secondary outcomes will include proportion of patients
      with an unscheduled return due to missed diagnosis, cost, ED length of stay.
