  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal canal cell carcinoma is a very rare cancer but well treated. If the morphological test
      are well established in the initial evaluation, it's not the case of the follow up evaluation
      particularly by MRI.About 1/3 of patient decline with metastatic relapse during the follow up
      of these patients.It appears that clinical regression seen precociously is a predictive
      factor of survival without relapse. But there 's no study confirming that point.

      This context takes us to evaluate if there is a predictive factor in MRI to final clinical
      result.
