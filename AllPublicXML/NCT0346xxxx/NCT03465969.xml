  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess relationship between tacrolimus concentrations
      determined via whole blood MITRA assay method with those determined using the established and
      validated whole blood venepuncture method using samples taken from liver and kidney
      transplant participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a bioanalytical assay method cross-validation study using blood samples donated
      by liver or kidney transplant participants. Participants will have been on a stable dose of
      Advagraf and deemed clinically stable for a period of 3-6 months and attend a routine
      out-patient follow-up visit to receive their usual oral dose of commercial Advagraf.
      Participants will be asked to provide 1 whole blood venepuncture sample and 1 whole blood
      finger prick MITRA sample at pre-dose and at approximately 1 and 3 hours post-dose.
      Participants will be kept at the study site for an extra 1 hour to ensure post-sampling
      safety and will be discharged thereafter.
