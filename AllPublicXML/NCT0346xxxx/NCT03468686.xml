    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of rTMS on the reduction of anhedonia and
      rumination and their associated neural networks. In a randomized double-blind trial, 45
      patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) in Atieh Clinical Neuroscience Center are
      assigned to two groups. The first group receives bilateral rTMS for 10 sessions on DLPFC; the
      second group receives sham rTMS for 10 sessions. In this group, the stimulation parameters
      are similar to that in the actual rTMS group, except that the coil angel is 90° and
      perpendicular to the head. Anhedonia symptoms will be measured by the Snaith-Hamilton
      Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), and rumination symptoms will be measured by the Ruminative Responses
      Scale (RRS) in the baseline and in the end of 10th session. In order to investigate neural
      networks associated with Anhedonia and rumination, EEG of patients will be recorded at the
      first session and at the end of the treatment.

    <description>Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) is a 14-item checklist covering four domains of hedonic experience, namely interest/pastimes, social interaction, sensory experience, and food/drink. Items are comprising of statements that participants rate as &quot;strongly disagree&quot; (0), &quot;disagree&quot; (0), &quot;agree&quot; (1), or &quot;strongly agree&quot; (1). The lowest possible score is 0, the highest possible score is 14. total score of interest/pastimes subscale is 3, social interaction is 5, sensory experience is 4 and food/drink is 2.</description>

    <description>The Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) is a measure of depressive rumination which has two subscales: Both subscales are composed of five items. Brooding and Reflection. Higher score indicate a higher level of ruminative responses (range: 22-88).</description>

    <description>The coil will locate on F3 and F4 in accordance with the 10-20 international system. bilateral rTMS include stimulate the right DLPFC at 1 Hz for a 10 seconds train of stimulation, 2 seconds inter-train interval, and a total of 150 pulse trains. Immediately after that, the stimulation was carried out on the left DLPFC at 10 Hz, 5 seconds of stimulation, with 10 second inter-train interval and 75 pulse trains.</description>
