    <textblock>
      Exercise in all Chemotherapy (EnACT) is a study to assess safety, feasibility, and
      acceptability of an exercise program within chemotherapy. This will be a single group study
      to capture the effects of an exercise intervention on the average chemotherapy patient and
      the patients compliance to the study.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Feasibility</measure>
    <time_frame>Feasibility will be assessed at the completion of the study for each patient (average of 5 months of chemotherapy).</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be obtained if one third of chemotherapy patients actually do the exercise prescribed (one exercise session per week for four weeks).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare changes in pain, physical function, nausea, vomiting, arthralgias, chemotherapy alterations (dose delays and alterations).</measure>
    <time_frame>Surveys will be given once the patient is consented and again at the completion of the study for each patient (average of 5 months per patient).</time_frame>
    <description>This will be compared using surveys at the beginning and end of chemotherapy (or intervention). Data will also be collected on the initial chemotherapy prescription and whether there are dose alterations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Qualitative assessments of clinician perspectives regarding the study. At the end of the study clinicians will be asked a series of qualitative questions to gain their insight into the study.</measure>
    <time_frame>Surveys will be provided to clinicians at the completion of the study (up to 38 months)</time_frame>
    <description>At the conclusion of the study, clinicians within the institution will be asked qualitative questions regarding the study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assessing safety through number of patients with injuries related to the intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>A standardized survey for assessing injuries will be used and administered at the end of the patients chemotherapy (average of 5 months)..</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator will be using a standardized Adverse Events/Injury History survey as the primary instrument in assessing safety. This survey focuses on asking questions to gauge the participants experience with muscle strain, joint pain, among other things, in order to assess if there were any complications associated with the intervention. The investigator will consider the intervention safe if less than 25% of included patients report mild musculoskeletal impairments and less than 5% experienced musculoskeletal injuries (defined as symptoms lasting a week or longer and or requiring the attention of a medical professional).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Acceptability will be assessed at the completion of the study for each patient (average of 5 months of chemotherapy).</time_frame>
    <description>We will consider the intervention to be acceptable if more than 50% of the patients approached agree to receive at least the first session of exercise counseling.</description>
