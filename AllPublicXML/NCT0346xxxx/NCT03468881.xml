  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study (FORECAST 2) builds upon the work of the successful pilot study (FORECAST) that
      found some evidence that breast cancer patients' fears of cancer recurrence (FCR) were
      sensitive to the communication exchange with therapeutic radiographers during weekly review
      appointments. The aim of FORECAST 2 is to co-design and pilot a communication training
      package for therapeutic radiographers to help them manage emotional talk with breast cancer
      patients who are undergoing treatment, with the intention to minimise patients' development
      of FCR during this trajectory.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first aim of this study is to develop a training package (called KEW: Know, Encourage and
      Warm-up) to enhance communication skills of therapeutic radiographers in responding to
      emotions and concerns that are expressed by breast cancer patients at weekly review
      appointments. The first two phases of the project address this aim. Phase 1 will use a
      co-design methodology in which patients and therapeutic radiographers come together to
      develop a storyboard for the video and manual that will comprise the training package. Both
      local and national patient representatives and radiographers will be asked to comment and
      provide feedback on the output of the co-design process, leading to the production of the
      training video and manual (phase 2). Data collection will include verbatim transcripts from
      the co-design process, which will be content analysed to identify recommended techniques to
      be used within the review radiotherapy setting.

      Phase 3 of the project addresses the second study aim, which is to pilot the package in a
      single service to test the acceptability into routine practice, to collect details for the
      preparation of a RCT study that includes more service units, to produce an electronic diary
      assessment of recurrence fears and to observe practice benefits within service. A pilot
      workshop will be conducted, after which 74 (female) breast cancer patients will be recruited
      to participate. All measures required for the RCT will be included.

      Patients will complete questions including: 1) demographic information, 2) a 7-item FCR scale
      (FCR7) and 3) a 20-item Affect Schedule (PANAS) before first radiation treatment (T1).
      Throughout the period of treatment, patients will be asked to fill in a daily 3-item FCR
      questionnaire (FCR3) either in the form of a paper dairy or through a mobile phone
      application to monitor their FCR level. Then, at the end of the radiotherapy treatment (T2),
      PANAS and FCR7 will be measured again. Patients will also be asked to complete an adaptation
      of the Medical Interview Satisfaction Sale (MISS) and the Consultation and Relational Empathy
      measure (CARE). Finally, six-eight weeks after the end of the treatment (T3), all
      participants will be asked to complete the FCR7 once again as well as a 5-item EuroQoL
      EQ-5D-3L scale by telephone.

      The same system of latent variable growth curve analysis as in the pilot FORECAST study will
      be used to calculate patients' FCR trajectory and link these to FCR7 outcomes. With a sample
      size of 74 patients, a medium to low-sized effect of 0.375 at 80% power and alpha (2-sided)
      set to 0.05 can be detected to demonstrate if the KEW intervention can decrease levels of FCR
      compared to the FCR levels obtained in the FORECAST pilot study.

    <measure>Fear of Recurrence level - FCR7</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Fear of Recurrence level scale (FCR7) is a 7-item self-report measure of patients' fear of cancer recurrence. It has been used previously in a national study and the FORECAST pilot. It shows high internal consistency (Cronbach's α of 0.92) and its construct validity has been demonstrated through association with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) (Humphris et al., 2018).</description>

    <description>The Fear of Recurrence level scale (FCR3) is a 3-item self-report measure of patients' fear of cancer recurrence. It has been used previously in the FORECAST pilot study and is based on the 4-item scale FCR4, which psychometric qualities are supportive of its internal consistency (Cronbach's α of 0.92) and validity (association with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)) (Humphris et al., 2018).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Positive And Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks following baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) is a 20-item self-report measure of positive and negative affect. The PANAS has been shown to possess adequate psychometric properties in a large sample drawn from the general adult population, and the construct validity of the PANAS scales and the reliabilities of both scales were adequate, Cronbach's α were 0.89 for Positive Affectivity and 0.85 for Negative Affectivity (Crawford &amp; Henry, 2004).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Consultation and Relational Empathy measure (CARE)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks following baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Consultation and Relational Empathy measure (CARE) is a 10-item self-report measure of patients' experience of clinical encounters. It shows high internal reliability (Cronbach's α of 0.92) and sufficient evidence of face validity (feedback from 10 patients) and convergent validity (r = 0.85 versus Reynolds Empathy Measure (RES)) (Mercer et al., 2004).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>An adaptation of the Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS-21)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks following baseline visit</time_frame>
    <description>The Medical Interview Satisfaction Scale (MISS-21) is a 21-item self-report measure of patients' satisfaction with doctor consultations, validated in British general practice populations. Internal consistency scores ranges between Cronbach's α of 0.67 and 0.92 for the four subscales. There is sufficient evidence construct validity of the MISS-21 with highly significant positive correlations (0.21-0.63) between MISS-21 scores and aspects of satisfaction with previous consultations (Meakin &amp; Weinman, 2002). The FORECAST 2 study will make use of selected questions from MISS-21 that are relevant to the clinical encounters with therapeutic radiographers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>5 EQ-5D-3L</measure>
    <time_frame>6-8 weeks after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-3L is a standardised instrument for use as a measure of health outcome and was developed by the EuroQol Research foundation. It consists of five questions relating to five dimensions of health; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain and discomfort and anxiety and depression. The EQ-5D has well-established validity and reliability and has been used in many studies of patients with a variety of chronic conditions in many different countries (Schrag et al., 2000; Walters &amp; Brazier, 2005).</description>
