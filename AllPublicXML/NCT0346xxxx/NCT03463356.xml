  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project will develop and test a brief 2-session shame intervention in individuals
      diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Using a non-concurrent multiple baseline
      design, the investigators will determine whether the brief shame intervention leads to
      reductions in trait self-reported shame and state shame in response to an in vivo stressor
      task. The investigators will also evaluate the effect of changes in shame on trait SAD
      symptoms.
