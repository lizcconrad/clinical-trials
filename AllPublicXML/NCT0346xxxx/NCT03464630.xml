  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A mobile remote coaching program study to improve maternal mood and increase parenting
      practices that lead to better infant social-emotional and communication outcomes
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To address the life course needs of depressed mothers and their infants, brief, accessible,
      and integrated interventions that target both maternal depression and specific nurturing
      parent behaviors demonstrated to improve infant social-emotional communication outcomes are
      needed. In prior programmatic research, two separate web-based, remote coaching interventions
      for: (a) parent nurturing behaviors that improve infant outcomes (Baby-Net R34; R01) [13],
      and (b) maternal depression (Mom-Net R34; R01) [14] were developed. Compared to controls, the
      Baby-Net program demonstrated medium to large effects on observed nurturing parent behavior
      and on infant social-emotional competencies in the context of play [13] and in the context of
      book activities [15]. Mom-Net demonstrated low attrition and high levels of feasibility,
      program use, and satisfaction [14]. Compared to controls, Mom-Net participants demonstrated
      significant reductions in depression and improved preschool parenting behavior [14]. A
      substantial advantage of the mobile, remote coaching approach is that it overcomes multiple
      logistical barriers that often prevent low-income mothers from participating in
      community/home visiting treatment programs [2]. Thus, this prior research on web-based
      maternal depression and specific nurturing parenting behavior in infancy, provides a strong
      empirical basis for the Mom &amp; Baby Net program. Investigators will rigorously test the merged
      Mom &amp; Baby Net intervention effects with 180 low-income mothers with depression and their
      infants via a 2-arm, intent-to-treat, randomized controlled trial.
