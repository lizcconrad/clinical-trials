      PART 1:

      Primary objective:

      - To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of BI 836880 in combination with BI 754091
      in check point inhibitor naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous
      NSCLC who progressed during or after first line platinum based treatment.

      Secondary objective:

        -  To provide safety data

        -  To evaluate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 836880 and BI 754091 during combination
           therapy after the first and fourth infusion cycle.

      PART 2:

      Primary objective:

      - To assess anti-tumour activity of BI 836880 in combination with BI 754091 in check point
      inhibitor naïve patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC who
      progressed during or after first line platinum-based treatment .

        -  Cohort A: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with low PD-L1
           expression (PD-L1 expression in 1-49% of tumor cells)

        -  Cohort B: Patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC with high
           PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 expression in ≥ 50% of tumor cells)

      Secondary objective:

        -  To provide preliminary safety data and the secondary measures of clinical efficacy
           including disease control (DC), duration of objective response (DoR), progression free
           survival (PFS), and tumour shrinkage

        -  To evaluate the basic pharmacokinetics of BI 836880 and BI 754091 during combination
           therapy after the first and fourth infusion cycle.

          -  Patient with brain metastases that are symptomatic and/or require therapy.

          -  Patients who require full-dose anticoagulation (according to local guidelines). No
             Vitamin K antagonist and other anticoagulation allowed; Low-Molecular-Weight Heparin
