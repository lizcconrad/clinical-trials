  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital body charts are used to assess the pain experience in people with pain. People are
      asked to report their pain by shading a human body template on a digital tablet. The aim of
      this study is to investigate whether people with chronic low back pain, compared to healthy
      volunteers, consistently locate on a digital body chart all nociceptive stimuli induced in
      the lumbar region.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers and people presenting chronic low back pain, will be recruited. A
      standardized grid will be drawn over the participants' lumbar region. Circular electrodes,
      connected to a constant current stimulator, will be applied at points on the grid. All
      participants will be blinded to the electrode locations. Painful electrocutaneous stimuli
      will be randomly delivered for each electrode. Participants will be instructed to draw with a
      stylus pen on a digital body chart displayed on a tablet where they will perceive each
      painful stimulation.

      The body chart will be centred on a canvas 768x1024 pixels (pxl), and pain location will be
      defined by X and Y coordinates. The consistency in reporting the location of each painful
      stimulation will be described through coordinates.

      In addition, only people presenting chronic low back pain will be asked to provide
      information about their lifestyle, level of disability, actual pain and general pain,
      assessment of kinesiophobia and health status.

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Before electrocutaneous stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index is a tool for the assessment of a patient's functional disability. It is a self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and ability to travel.
Each topic category is followed by six statements describing different scenarios in the patient's life relating to the topic. The patient then checks the statement which most closely resembles their situation. Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5, where 0 indicates less amount of disability and 5 indicates most severe disability.
The scores for all questions answered are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range 0 to 100). Zero is equated with no disability and 100 is the maximum disability possible.
Italian validated version of the scale will be used.</description>

    <measure>Current pain level on Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0-10 cm)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before electrocutaneous stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The patient will be asked to draw a vertical line on a horizontal 10 cm line, where he/she felt the current pain intensity would be better represented, in a range from the left end of the line indicating &quot;no pain&quot; corresponding to 0 cm to the right one indicating &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot; corresponding to 10 cm.
The total score of the scale ranges from 0 = &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 = &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-13)</measure>
    <time_frame>Before electrocutaneous stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK) is a 13 item scale developed to measure the fear of movement (kinesiophobia) related to chronic lower back pain. Respondents are asked to rate each item on a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). The subscale ranges scores are 13-22 suggesting &quot;subclinical level of kinesiophobia&quot;, 23-32 suggesting &quot;mild level of kinesiophobia&quot;, 33-42 suggesting &quot;moderate level of kinesiophobia&quot; and 43-52 suggesting &quot;severe level of kinesiophobia&quot;.

    <description>The Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36 item questionnaire which measures the quality of life across eight domains, which are both physically and emotionally based. High scores define a more favorable health state.
