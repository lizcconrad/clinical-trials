  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomised controlled trial investigating a combination of mirror therapy and
      treadmill training for the rehabilitation of lower limb impairment following a stroke. This
      study has been conducted as part of a PhD qualification at the Institute of Technology Sligo
      in Ireland with all therapy sessions taking place at the institute. The study was conducted
      in conjunction with Sligo University Hospital and it attained ethical approval through the
      relevant University Hospital Ethics Committee.

      The study necessitated patients with chronic stroke to walk on a treadmill while viewing a
      reflection of their non-affected limb in a mirror. There was also a placebo group and these
      patients walked on the treadmill and viewed a mirror in an altered position. Patients were
      referred through Hospital Health Professionals. Prior to trial commencement all participants
      were given comprehensive trial information and provided signed written informed consent. A
      total of 30 participants were recruited. Patients attended the study for 30 minutes per day,
      three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome assessment prior to the
      beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three month followup assessment. All
      assessments were carried out by a Chartered Physiotherapist specialising in stroke
      rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome measures for lower limb
      motor function, muscle tone, walking speed and endurance.

    <masking_description>Experimental Group saw mirror image of non-affected limb in mirror while walking on treadmill.
Placebo Group saw no refection of the non-affected limb due to positioning of mirror while walking on treadmill.
Outcome assessor was blinded to treatment allocation. They evaluated participants in separate lab and was asked not to discuss the treatment given to patients. Even if the patient mentioned the trials they would discuss the fact that they were using Mirrors and Treadmill.</masking_description>
