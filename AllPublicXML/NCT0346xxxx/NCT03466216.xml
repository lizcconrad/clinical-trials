  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AlphaMedix™ (²¹²Pb-DOTAMTATE) is a radiotherapeutic drug indicated in subjects with
      unresectable, metastatic somatostatin receptor (SSTR) positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).
      Because 212Pb is an in vivo generator of alpha particles, it is particularly suitable for
      SSTR therapy applications.

      This drug addresses an unmet need in the field of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy
      (PRRT) for NETs. Substitution of an alpha emitter (²¹²Pb) for the beta emitters currently
      being used (i.e., 177Lu or 90Y) will provide significantly higher Linear Energy Transfer
      (LET) and a shorter path length. Higher LET particles should cause more tumor cell death.
      Shorter path length should result in less collateral damage of the normal tissue and
      therefore less side effects for subjects receiving the drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This dose escalation study will include a maximum of 50 subjects with histologically
      confirmed NET, a positive somatostatin analogue scan, and no prior history of PRRT therapy.

      The study will begin with a single ascending dose (SAD) of AlphaMedix™ administered by IV.
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor
      response or DLT. Once tumor response is observed, the study will convert to a Multiple
      Ascending Dose (MAD) regimen. The MAD treatment regimen will start with the previous safe
      cohort's dose and will consist of 3 IV administrations of AlphaMedix™ at 8-week intervals.
      Subsequent cohorts will receive an incremental 30% increase that will continue until tumor
      response or DLT.

      The primary objective is to assess the safety and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) using
      ascending doses of AlphaMedix™. The secondary objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetic
      properties and preliminary effectiveness of AlphaMedix™.
