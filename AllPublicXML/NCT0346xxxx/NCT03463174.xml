  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial designed to assess the 1-year effectiveness of two
      treatment modalities for the mandibular edentulists: conventional complete dentures and
      single-implant mandibular overdenture.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial alongside a cost-effectiveness analysis will include
      edentulous individuals who meet eligibility criteria. New maxillary and mandibular dentures
      will be fabricated for all participants following a standardized protocol. Then, participants
      will be randomized into one of the treatment groups: conventional complete denture group or
      single-implant mandibular overdenture group. Each participant allocated to the overdenture
      group will then receive an implant (Titamax TI cortical - Neodent, Brazil) in the mandibular
      midline followed by the immediate connection of an O-Ring/ball attachment with intra-oral
      incorporation of the retention system in the mandibular denture. Direct costs related to
      therapies in both groups will be identified, measured and valuated for one year after
      treatment and patient-reported outcomes will be assessed. Incremental cost-effectiveness
      ratios will be estimated and graphically presented on cost-effectiveness planes. A Markov
      decision tree will be constructed to set out the consequences of the competing alternatives.
      Sensitivity analysis on the most important assumptions will be performed in order to assess
      the robustness of the model.

    <description>The cross-culturally adapted Brazilian version of the Oral Health Impact Profile for edentulous subjects (OHIP-EDENT) will be used. It contains 19 items divided in four different subscale domains: (I) masticatory discomfort and disability (four items), (II) psychological discomfort and disability (five items), (III) social disability (five items), and (IV) oral pain and discomfort (five items). The items are answerable by a 3-point Likert scale and responses will be summed to result an overall score. Higher scores represent worse OHRQoL.</description>

    <description>Participants will report how satisfied they are on a 0-100 scale by choosing a multiple of 10. Zero will be considered the least satisfied possible and &quot;100&quot; the most satisfied possible.</description>

Participants will receive regular maintenance for their dentures, including adjustments for the elimination of sore areas, denture relining and repair of fractures, when needed, until the end of the follow-up period.</description>
