  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to determine if treatment with azacitidine and venetoclax is
      effective treatment for elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have not
      received previous treatment. Azacitidine and venetoclax will be given as induction treatment
      followed by venetoclax maintenance treatment for patients who respond to the induction
      treatment.

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study for elderly patients who have not received previous treatment for
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Up to 42 patients will be enrolled. All patients will be
      treated with azacitidine and venetoclax until a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative
      response is achieved. Once patients achieve a MRD negative composite response, azacitidine
      will be discontinued and venetoclax dose will be decreased to &quot;maintenance&quot; dose.
