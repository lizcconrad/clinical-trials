    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate a yoga intervention for individuals who
      experience persistent pain following oncology surgery. The integrated yoga program will
      involve postures, breathing exercises, and concentration practices. Data will be collected at
      several time points (pre-, mid-, and post-intervention) for both the intervention and
      wait-list control conditions. The data will be analysed using linear mixed effects growth
      models. Results will be written up in manuscript format, published in a peer review journal,
      and disseminated at scientific research conferences.
