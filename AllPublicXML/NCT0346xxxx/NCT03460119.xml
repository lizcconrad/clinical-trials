  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to describe the changes in respiratory rate, heart rate and
      dyspnea, before and after using HFNC in patients presenting to our emergency department with
      ARF.

    <textblock>
      A retrospective cohort study was performed. To all adults presenting to the emergency
      department who used high flow nasal cannula to treat clinical signs of acute respiratory
      failure based on the presence of a breathing frequency ≥ 25 breath/min and increase work of
      breathing evidence by dyspnea, in-drawing, accessory-muscle use and/or diaphoresis despite
      conventional oxygen therapy ≥ 6 l/min. Demographic variables and clinical and gasometric
      parameters before and after two hours using HFNC were recorded.

    <description>The high flow device that we used was an air oxygen blender (Whisper FlowⓇ), which allows FiO2 adjustment between 0.30 and 1.0 and can deliver a gas flow from 10 to 150 l/min. The gas mixture was routed from a heated humidifier (MR850 with MR 290 chamber) through a one line heated inspiratory circuit (RT241) to the subject at a temperature of 37°C via a nasal cannula (OptiflowⓇ).</description>
