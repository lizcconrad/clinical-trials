      The purpose of this study is to learn if the stoma boot camp is a good and effective way to
      help people adapt to life with a stoma after surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the USA. The primary treatment for invasive
      bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy (RC) with a urinary diversion. Patients that have this
      procedure must deal with a stoma that requires daily care and manual skills. A stoma is an
      artificial opening that allows urine to pass from the ureters outside the body. Having a
      surgery that results in a stoma can dramatically change a person's life.

      This study is being done to test a new education session called the stoma boot camp. The
      session was created to help people deal with changes in their post-surgery life and living
      with a stoma.

      The session requires a one time visit to the study site and lasts about two hours.
      Participants can bring a support person to the boot camp if they choose. During the two hour
      session, nurses will provide teaching, counseling, and hands on practice with an artificial
      stoma.

    <description>The Ostomy Adjustment Scale evaluates a person with an ostomy following surgery. The instrument consists of 34 statements. Scores range from a minimum of 34 to a maximum of 204. The higher the score, the better the person's perceived adjustment.</description>
