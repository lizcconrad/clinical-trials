  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transition from the Pediatric clinic to the adult care is a challenging period for young
      adults with type 1 diabetes, due to the high risk of poor glycemic control. Achieving the
      glycemic target without hypoglycemia and/or large glucose excursions is of paramount
      importance for type 1 diabetic patients, who have high variability of daily glucose levels .
      Both insulin pump therapy and multiple daily injections of insulin are recommended strategy
      to achieve glycemic control in type 1 diabetes; however, no studies investigated the effects
      of insulin pump vs insulin injections on glycol-metabolic outcomes in the transition phase.
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
      (CSII) therapy, as compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI), on glycemic and
      metabolic control, in young type 1 diabetic patients transitioned to the adult diabetes care.

    <description>In order to measure satisfaction with diabetes treatment regimens, we used the self-reported Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire. This instrument aims to assess levels of satisfaction in subjects using different treatment strategies. The questionnaire consists of eight questions: six questions addresses general satisfaction with a score from 0 to 6 for each question (0 = worst), that has to be computed in a total score ranging from 0 (=worst) to 36 (=best); among the remaining two questions, which has to be computed separately as two subscales, one concerns the perception of hyperglycemic events and another the perception of hypoglycemic events, both with a score from 0 (none of the time) to 6 (most of the time).</description>
