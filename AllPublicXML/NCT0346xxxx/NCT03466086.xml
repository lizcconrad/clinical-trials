    <measure>Assessment of dry eye symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Approximately 1.5 hours at 1 week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective assessment of dry eye symptoms will be done at 1-week follow-up using Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI©) instrument. The OSDI© is assessed on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher scores representing greater disability. The index demonstrates sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between normal subjects and patients with dry eye disease measuring dry eye disease as normal, mild, moderate, or severe.</description>
