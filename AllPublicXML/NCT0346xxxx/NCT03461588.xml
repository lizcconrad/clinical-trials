  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to prospectively investigate the cardiac dose-sparing effect and clinical
      benefit of deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. Patients with left-sided breast
      cancer treated with breast conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is enrolled.
      Radiotherapy is delivered with either free-breathing or deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH)
      technique. The cardiac dose parameters and cardiac toxicity are prospective evaluated, and
      the dose-effect relationship is analyzed.

    <textblock>
      Patients with left-sided breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery are
      prospectively enrolled. Two types of radiation treatment are delivered based on attending
      physician's preferences: radiation to whole breast +- regional nodal areas with
      free-breathing technique, or with deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique. The cardiac
      dose parameters including heart dose and the dose to left anterior coronary artery are
      assessed, and the cardiac toxicities regularly assessed with cardiac
      enzymes,electrocardiogram(ECG) and normal gated single-photon emission computed
      tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging before, during and after radiation.The dose-effect
      relationship of heart injuries is analyzed.
