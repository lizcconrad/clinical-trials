  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized clinical trial is to compare two currently
      accepted standard-of-care treatment strategies: Medical thoracoscopy as compared to
      instillation of intrapleural tissue Plasminogen Activator (TPA) and human recombinant
      Deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for the management of empyema or complicated parapneumonic effusion
      (CPPE) in adults.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Pleural infection (empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion (CPPE)) represents
      one of the most common clinical diagnoses encountered in clinical practice in the United
      States (US) It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality despite advances in
      medical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

      Objective: Compare two standard of care treatments: TPA/DNase vs early medical Thoracoscopy

      Methods: Investigators will conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial. Plan is to
      enroll total of 80 patients and randomize those patients to either Medical Thoracoscopy group
      or Fibrinolytic Therapy group.

      Follow-up will be daily until hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 weeks in the outpatient
      setting

      Potential Outcome and Benefit: Determine best strategy for treating patients with pleural
      infection
