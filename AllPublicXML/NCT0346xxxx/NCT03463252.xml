      Primary end points:

      This clinical trial is aimed to analyze the effectiveness of Levonorgestrel-Releasing
      Intrauterine System (LNG-IUS, Mirena®) in the fertility-sparing treatment of atypical
      endometrial hyperplasia and early endometrial carcinoma, including pathology response and
      pregnancy outcome.

      Second end points:

      To analyze the appearances of side-effects.

    <description>Pathologic response to medicine treatment is categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), no change (NC), and progressive disease (PD). CR is defined as the absence of any hyperplastic or cancerous lesion. PR is defined as the residual lesion with degeneration and atrophy of endometrial glands. NC is defined as residual lesion without degeneration or atrophy of endometrial glands. PD is defined as the appearance of endometrial cancer for EAH and grade 2 (G2) or 3 for EC.</description>

Patients with partial response or in stable condition, after 2 cycles, will receive continuous treatment for one more cycle again. Patients with complete response after 2 or 3 cycles are encouraged to pregnancy.
