  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perception of cutaneous sensory stimulation shows a large range of variability across
      multiple populations. Understanding this variability is critical to medical practice as
      interpretation of discomfort and pain is critical to diagnosis and treatment. Further,
      procedural medicine involves inflicting pain on patients in the form of injection of local
      anesthetic. Our protocol aims to determine how patients differentially interpret the
      non-noxious stimulation of vibration and the differences in perceiving anesthestic injection
      after the vibratory stimulus. We will explore how this ranges across all patients treated in
      a dermatological surgery out-patient setting. The goal is to identify which variables, such
      as age, gender, medical history, influence how sensation is interpreted.

    <intervention_model>Single Group Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Subjects will be randomly assigned into one of two groups:
Group 1: Vibratory anesthetic device (VAD) is in the OFF mode Group 2: VAD is in the ON mode
We will use a random number generator to place patients into one of the two groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Subjects will be asked to close their eyes prior to the vibration anesthetic device (VAD) being applied to their skin. Only the user will know whether the VAD will be on or off based on the result of a random number generator. This will prevent anticipatory changes on the subjects side. The subject will be aware of the intervention after the device is turned on or left in the off position.</masking_description>
