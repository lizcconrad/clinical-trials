  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to characterize the bacterial composition (microbiota)
      colonizing to the human body in different physio - pathological conditions (lifestyle, motor
      activity, surgical operations, probiotic and prebiotic consumption, antibiotic therapies,
      chemotherapeutic therapies), nervous and musculoskeletal diseases, gastrointestinal and
      metabolic disorders , oral and vaginal diseases, etc.). In particular, they will be
      investigate:

        -  the changes in the bacterial abundance

        -  the potential microbial interactions with the human host

        -  the microbial networks describing on the bacterial interactions within a specific
           composition of the human microbiota

      The main objective of this study is to deepen the knowledge about the bacterial communities
      associated to the human organism. In particular, the present study aims to evaluate how the
      microbiota (intestinal, cutaneous, vaginal, nasal, bronchial, breast milk, salivary, oral,
      etc.) is subject to quantitative and qualitative changes consequently to different events
      involving the human host. The project trys to highlight which microorganisms may be involved
      in the onset or progression of certain pathological condition, as well as to identify which
      bacterial genera can be more subject to variations due to specific non-pathological events.

      Secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To define a &quot;healthy microbiome&quot;, that is to understand which are the main bacteria that
           commonly compose the human microbiome in physiological conditions, differentiating it
           from that present in certain pathological conditions.

        -  To characterize the physiological effects that bacterial changes of the human microbiota
           have on the host.

        -  To evaluate whether the use of probiotics, prebiotics, dietary and nutritional factors,
           cosmetics, and oral, nasal, vaginal, or pharmacological therapies of any kind can
           influence the microbial network of the human microbiota associated to different body
           districts.
