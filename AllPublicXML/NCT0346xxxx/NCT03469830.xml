  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores the smart scar care pad's potential therapeutic effect in treatment
      hypertrophic scar while elucidating the adverse effects if there is any. Half of the
      participant receives traditional treatment of pressure garment and the other half receives
      the smart scar care pad together with pressure garment.

    <description>The smart scar care pad (SCCP):
The SCCP is a newly invented insert material that can maximise treatment outcomes via enhanced compression and occlusion. The wearing regime for SCCP is 4 hours a day for the first day, with 2-hour increments added every other day until the total wearing time reached 23 hours. SSCP was cleaned twice a day for hygienic reasons.
The smart pressure monitored suit(SPMS):
The SPMS is a type of custom-made pressure garment. SPMS was used 23 hours a day and only removed when showering.</description>
