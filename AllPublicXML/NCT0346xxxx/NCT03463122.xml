      Head-mounted display based virtual reality rehabilitation for hemispatial neglect.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators examine about the efficacy of field-of-regard-focused visual exploration
      therapy implemented using a head-mounted display virtual reality system for hemispatial
      neglect rehabilitation following stroke.
