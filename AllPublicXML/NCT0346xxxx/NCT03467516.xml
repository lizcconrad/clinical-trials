  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study in which the efficacy of a non-myeloablative lymphodepleting
      preparative regimen followed by infusion of autologous TIL and high-dose aldesleukin in
      patients with metastatic uveal melanoma will be evaluated.

      Metastatic uveal melanoma (UM) carries a poor prognosis with estimated survival of 4-6
      months. There are no known effective systemic therapies. Metastatic UM is classified as an
      &quot;orphan&quot; disease and there are currently few clinical trial options for these patients. Thus,
      novel systemic approaches are desperately needed.

      A recent pilot study has found that administration of autologous tumor infiltrating
      lymphocytes (TIL) generated from resected metastases can induce objective tumor response and
      durable complete response in metastatic uveal melanoma patients. These encouraging results
      require confirmation to determine if this immunotherapy is of future benefit in treating this
      disease.

      STUDY DESIGN

      The Phase 2 study will be conducted in conjunction with companion protocol (Cell Harvest and
      Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies) as
      described below:

      Cell Preparation:

      Patients with evaluable metastatic uveal melanoma who have lesions that can be resected with
      minimum morbidity will undergo resection of tumor. TIL will be obtained while enrolled on the
      companion protocol (Cell Harvest and Preparation to Support Adoptive Cell Therapy Clinical
      Protocols and Pre-Clinical Studies). Separate tumor procurements may be performed under a
      protocol to obtain TIL if initial tumor procurements could not successfully generate TIL. The
      TIL will be grown and expanded for this trial according to standard operating procedures
      submitted in the IND. The TIL will be assessed for potency by interferon-gamma release.

      Treatment Phase:

      Once cells exceed the potency requirement and are projected to exceed the minimum number
      specified in the COA, the patient will be registered on this study and receive the lymphocyte
      depleting preparative regimen consisting of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by
      infusion of up to 2x10^11 lymphocytes (minimum of 1x10^9 cells) and administration of
      high-dose intravenous aldesleukin. It is anticipated that TIL that meet the COA will not be
      achievable in approximately 20% of patients who undergo resection. These patients may undergo
      a second resection to grow TIL, if another suitable lesion exists. Approximately 6 weeks (+/-
      2 weeks) after TIL administration, patients will undergo a complete tumor evaluation and
      evaluation of toxicity and immunologic parameters. Patients will receive one course of
      treatment. The start date of the course will be the start date of the chemotherapy; the end
      date will be the day of the first post-treatment evaluation. Patients may undergo a second
      treatment. Patients will receive no other experimental agents while on this protocol.

    <intervention_model_description>The Phase 2 study will follow the Simon's optimal two-stage design. Fifteen patients will be included in the first stage; if there are 1 or fewer patients responding to therapy the trial will be terminated. If at least 2 responses are observed, expansion into Stage 2 to a total of 47 patients will occur. If at least 6 patients respond to therapy, the study therapy would be considered to have met its primary study goal.</intervention_model_description>

             asymptomatic are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic
             radiosurgery must be clinically stable for 1 month after treatment for the patient to
             be eligible. Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.

          -  Greater than or equal to 18 years of age and less than or equal to age 75

          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent Document

          -  Willing to sign a durable power of attorney

          -  Clinical performance status of ECOG 0 or 1

          -  Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

               -  Seronegative for hepatitis B antigen, and seronegative for hepatitis C antibody.
                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

          -  Hematology

               -  Absolute neutrophil count greater than 1000/mm3 without the support of filgrastim

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ to 1.6 mg/dl

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ to 2.0 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert's Syndrome who
                  must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

          -  More than four weeks must have elapsed since any prior systemic therapy at the time
             the patient receives the preparative regimen, and patients' toxicities must have
             recovered to a grade 1 or less (except for toxicities such as alopecia or vitiligo).
             (Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

             Disease).

          -  Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          -  Active systemic infections (e.g.: requiring anti-infective treatment), coagulation
             disorders or any other active major medical illnesses.
