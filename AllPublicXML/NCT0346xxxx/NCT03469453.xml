      This pilot study aims to test Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for
      adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)

      The study has a single case research design (multiple baseline) and will include 12
      participants with GAD according to a semi structured diagnostic interview.

      Participants will be randomized to either two, six or ten weeks baseline measurements prior
      to starting treatment, and will thus work as their own controls.

      Primary outcome measures will be collected at 10 weeks after treatment start. Follow-up
      assessments will be made three month after treatment.

    <description>Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (ICBT) for GAD, 10 weeks. Patients and their parents work with separate programs via the Internet. Both have contact with a therapist. Participants practice awareness of worry through daily worry monitoring. They identify their own behaviors that reinforce worry, i.e. control and avoidance behaviors. The program gives a rationale for behavior change, which is then implemented. Participants practice problem solving and exposure to uncertainty inducing situations and thoughts. Parents receive support and psycho education about worry. They practice alternative parental behaviors, which decrease focus on worry while validating the child's feelings. Treatment contains planning for maintenance of treatment gains for both patients and parents.</description>
