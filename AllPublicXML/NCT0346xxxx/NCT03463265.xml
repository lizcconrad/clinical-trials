        Inclusion Criteria Specific for Arms A

          1. All subjects must have histologic evidence of high grade glioma (World Health
             Organization [WHO] grade 3 or grade 4) and radiographic evidence of recurrence or
             disease progression (defined as either a greater than 25% increase in the largest
             bi-dimensional product of enhancement, a new enhancing lesion, or a significant
             increase in T2 FLAIR). Subjects must have at least 1 measurable lesion by RANO
             criteria (≥ 10 mm in 2 perpendicular diameters).

          2. Subjects must have previously completed standard radiation therapy and been exposed to
             temozolomide.

          3. No prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors, or BEV or any other anti-angiogenic agents,
             including sorafenib, sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, or cilengitide (for the ABI-009 +
             BEV arm), or MRZ or any other proteasome inhibitors, including BTZ, CFZ, or IXZ (for
             the ABI-009 + MRZ arm).

          4. At least 4 weeks from surgical resection and at least 12 weeks from the end of
             radiotherapy prior to enrollment in this study, unless relapse is confirmed by tumor
             biopsy or new lesion outside of radiation field, or if there are two MRIs confirming
             progressive disease that are approximately 8 weeks apart.

        Inclusion Criteria Specific for Arms B

          1. Histologically confirmed newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

          2. Subjects must have had surgery and have a measurable post-contrast lesion after
             surgery detected by MRI.

        No prior treatment with mTOR inhibitors, and no prior local or systemic therapy for GBM.

        Exclusion Criteria Common for Both Arms A and B

        A patient will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following criteria
        apply:

          1. Co-medication or concomitant therapy that may interfere with study results.

          2. History of thrombotic or hemorrhagic stroke or myocardial infarction within 6 months.

          3. Pregnant or breast feeding.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection requiring IV antibiotics &amp; psychiatric illness/social situations that would
             limit compliance with study requirements, or disorders associated with significant
             immunocompromised state.

          5. Active gastrointestinal bleeding.

          6. Pre-existing thyroid abnormality is allowed provided thyroid function can be
             controlled with medication.

          7. Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus as defined by HbA1c &gt;8% despite adequate therapy.

          8. Patients with history of interstitial lung disease and/or pneumonitis, or pulmonary
             hypertension.

          9. Use of strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 within the 14 days prior to receiving
             the first dose of ABI-009. Additionally, use of any known CYP3A4 substrates with
             narrow therapeutic window (such as fentanyl, alfentanil, astemizole, cisapride,
             dihydroergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, terfanide) within the 14 days prior to
             receiving the first dose of ABI-009.

         10. Known other previous/current malignancy requiring treatment within ≤ 3 years except
             for limited disease treated with curative intent, such as in situ prostate cancer,
             intracapsular renal cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, squamous or basal cell skin
             carcinoma, and superficial bladder carcinoma.

         11. Any comorbid condition that restricts the use of study drug and confounds the ability
             to interpret data from the study as judged by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.

         12. Known Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), or active Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C.
