  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ELVIS Kids is a parallel, open label, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Hypertonic Saline
      (HS) nose drops (~2.6% NaCl) vs. standard care in children &lt;7 years of age with symptoms of
      an Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will run over ~30 months. Children are recruited prior to, or within 48 hours of
      developing URTI symptoms by advertising in areas such as local schools, nurseries, health
      centres and workplaces as well as social media. For the purposes of this study an URTI is
      defined as: at least two respiratory symptoms (nasal stuffiness, runny nose, cough, sore
      throat, or sneezing) OR one respiratory symptoms and at least one systemic symptom (lethargy,
      muscle pain, headache, pyrexia ≥38°C).

      Willing parents/guardians, of children &lt;7 years of age, will be directed by the study
      advertising to contact the research team at the Children's Clinical Research Facility (CCRF)
      if they are interested in participating. Children will be randomised to either a Control arm
      of standard symptomatic care, or an Intervention arm of 3 drops each nostril of HS at least 4
      times a day until 24 hours after asymptomatic or maximum of 28 days. All participants will be
      requested to obtain a mid-turbinate nasal swab prior to first nasal HS drops (repeated daily
      for 5 days), a daily symptom diary (CARIFS, a valid illness measure in the UK), and an end of
      illness questionnaire (healthcare use, adverse events, acceptability, infection in household
      contacts, parental time taken off usual activities). Parent/guardian of the children
      allocated to the intervention arm will be taught how to prepare the HS. Parent/guardian of
      children who are asymptomatic at recruitment are requested to inform CCRF when the child
      develops an URTI (within 48 hours) and follow the instructions already provided to them when
      given the go-ahead to start the trial. On day 28, parents/guardians will be contacted to
      determine if their child suffered from wheeze either during the illness or at any point until
      day 28. Participation in the study will end on day 28.
