    <textblock>
      Symptomatic hypotension during (or immediately following) hemodialysis complicates 5 to 30
      percent of all dialysis treatments and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
      Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and European Best Practice Guidelines
      define intradialytic hypotension as the presence of a decrease in systolic blood pressure ≥20
      mmHg or a decrease in mean arterial pressure by 10 mmHg, providing the decrease in blood
      pressure is associated with clinical events and need for nursing interventions. Common causes
      of intradialytic hypotension include excessive or rapid ultrafiltration, high blood flow
      during dialysis, CHF, taking the antihypertensive medications prior to HD, and others. One of
      the possible reasons that is surprisingly has not been approached worldwide for
      intra-dialytic hypotension could be more prevalent adrenal insufficiency in ESRD patients or
      a delay in the appropriate rise of endogenous serum cortisol given hemodialysis is considered
      by all means a stressful condition to the body. Investigators will assess first the
      prevalence of intradialytic hypotension at JUH dialysis unit. Investigators will screen
      patients who developed intradialytic hypotension for adrenal insufficiency by ordering random
      am cortisol. Then Investigators will give IV Hydrocortisone 100 mg prior to HD to patients
      who developed intra-dialytic hypotension and monitor their BP response during the HD
      treatments for 3 HD sessions (1 week, 3 HD sessions). After that, the same patients will
      receive 100 mg normal saline for 3 HD sessions. Both the administrator and the patient will
      be blinded for the interventions.
