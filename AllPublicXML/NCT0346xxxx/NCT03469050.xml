  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonic microbiota changes may play a key role in the pathogenesis of acute diverticulitis. A
      previous proof-of-concept study suggests that rifaximin, a low-absorbable oral antibiotic,
      may be beneficial for prevention of acute diverticulitis recurrence by modulating the gut
      microflora.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different
      doses of a delayed release formulation of rifaximin, versus placebo, for the prevention of
      recurrence of acute diverticulitis and diverticular complications in patients with a recent
      episode of acute diverticulitis.
