  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pilot study to investigate the safety and feasibility of stem cells treatment of complex
      anal fistula in patients with Crohn`s disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stem cells therapy in the management of soft tissue healing has been shown to be safe and
      feasible with encouraging short-term results both for crypto glandular and Crohns anal
      fistula. The long-term results are still insufficient but based on only a few studies
      conducted with small patient series and various techniques and type of stem cells. In the
      present study the patient's own adipose tissue derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) will be
      used. Traditionally the stem cells are injected into the fistula tract; however survival and
      retaining the stem cells in the fistula tract is problematic. Alternatively, one may apply
      stem cells enriched fatty tissue around and into the fistula tract. The aim of this project
      is to develop a method for treatment of patients with Crohns fistula. The results of
      conventional surgery are disappointing and followed by a high degree of recurrence and
      complications.

    <description>Patients enrolled in the study will be treated for their anal fistula by surgical closure of the internal opening, debridement of the fistula and injection of patients own stem cells enriched fatty tissue around the fistula. Stem cells preparation will be performed prior to fistula treatment by liposuction and then isolation.</description>
