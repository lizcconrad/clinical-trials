  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in February 2018.

      The purpose of this study is to make a monitoring of adverse reactions in 100 thousand
      children aged 14 years and below to see whether Reduning injection is safe and the
      characteristic and mechanism of anaphylactic reaction used Reduning injection in hospitals in
      China.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to observe the clinical characteristics and adverse reactions of patients aged 14
      and below using Reduning injection in hospital,registry study is suitable method in this
      area. Otherwise, nested case control study is used to find out the mechanism of anaphylaxis.
      Calculating the incidence of adverse drug reactions is one of the main aims for this study.
      100000 cases need to be registered at least. The aim population is who using Reduning
      injection from February 2018 to December 2018.
