  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The quality of care associated with medical procedures, such as procedural sedation, has
      historically been assessed from the perspective of the healthcare professional, wherein the
      appropriateness of the services provided and the skill with which this care was performed
      were considered. However, more recently, the perspectives of consumers of healthcare services
      (i.e. the patients) have also been sought in the form of patient satisfaction. A review of
      the literature shows that patient satisfaction is routinely assessed when determining the
      effectiveness of sedation; however, it is less frequently assessed as the primary outcome. In
      child-specific, validated studies, limitations are noted with respect to being validated in a
      language other than English and failing to encompass a variety of procedures. As a result,
      these validated tools are not appropriate for use with pediatric populations undergoing
      procedural sedation in North America, nor are these validated tools amenable to comparison
      with our proposed tool.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the central unit procedural sedation team servicing several areas of specialty, a
      varied patient satisfaction tool is required to ensure all concerns pertaining to sedation in
      each specialty are addressed, as well as allowing consistency between specialties to be
      examined. Therefore, the objective is to develop and validate a procedural sedation
      satisfaction tool for use with a variety of specialties requiring pediatric procedural
      sedation.
