      Dr. Bin Wang developed the investigational vaccine used in this clinical trial and designed
      the trial protocol.For patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric
      adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma tumor who have
      disease progression with first line chemotherapy. Single or multiple doses of personalized
      mRNA tumor vaccine encoding neoantigen will be given to observe the safety and efficacy the
      mRNA tumor vaccine.

      Primary objectives:

      Determine the safety, tolerability and cytokinetics of the personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in
      patients with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma.

      Secondary objectives:

      Make a preliminary evaluation on the efficacy of personalized mRNA tumor vaccine in patients
      with advanced esophageal squamous carcinoma, gastric adenocarcinoma, pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma and colorectal adenocarcinoma with the following parameters:

      Time of tumor progression (TTP);

      Disease Control Rate (DCR);

      Objective Remission Rate (ORR);

      Overall Survival (OS).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients aged 18 - 75 with pathologically confirmed advanced Esophageal Squamous
             Carcinoma, Gastric Adenocarcinoma, Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Colorectal
             Adenocarcinoma.

          2. Patients with advanced Esophageal Squamous Carcinoma, Gastric Adenocarcinoma,
             Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma and Colorectal Adenocarcinoma who have disease progression
             with first line chemotherapy. (1) Failure of treatment is defined as disease
             progression, recurrence or metastatic disease, or intolerable toxicities occurred
             after treatment. (2) Each line of treatment during the period of disease progression
             includes one or more chemotherapy drugs which are administered for not less than one
