  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, double-blind，placebo parallel-controlled phase III study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CMAB007 (recombinant humanized anti-immunoglobulin
      E(IgE) monoclonal antibody for injection) to treat asthma patients who remain not adequately
      controlled despite Med/high ICS plus LABA in China. Following a screening period of up to 2
      weeks and run-in period of 4 weeks, randomized patients will enter a 24-week treatment period
      with CMAB007 or placebo. Efficacy and safety will be assessed at 4-week intervals during the
      treatment period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400 asthma patients with an increased serum total IgE level(60-1500
      international unit(IU)/ml) and uncontrolled receiving medium to high dose inhaled
      corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting β2-agonist(LABA) will be randomised in about 43 sites
      in China. They will be administered CMAB007 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1 for 24 weeks. During
      the whole study, all subjects will be on regularly fixed combination of med/high ICS and LABA
      (budesonide and formoterol fumarate powder for inhalation or salmeterol xinafoate and
      fluticasone propionate powder for inhalation). They should complete PEF measurement and
      patient diary daily and be assessed every 4 weeks. Spirometry, questionnaires, laboratory
      tests and so on will be performed. At selected sites, about 45 patients will be enrolled in a
      sub-study to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characterises of CMAB007.
      Anti-drug antibody (ADA) will be sampled at V1, V2 and V7 too.

    <description>CMAB007(recombinant humanized anti-IgE monoclonal antibody for injection ) will be at a fixed dose determined by the subjects' total IgE and weight at V0. All the subjects will be treated subcutaneously for 24 weeks. The 4-week total dose is 0.016mg/kg/IgE(IU/ml), administered every 2 or 4 weeks, for the subjects with total IgE level 60-700IU/ml. If the total IgE level is 700-1500IU/ml, they will be administered 375mg every 2 weeks. Symbicort(Budesonide and formoterol fumarate powder for inhalation) or Seretide (salmeterol xinafoate and fluticasone propionate powder for inhalation) will be used 1/2 inhalations bid as asthma-controlled drug during the whole study. Ventolin (Salbutamol sulphate aerosol) will be used as asthma rescue drug.</description>
