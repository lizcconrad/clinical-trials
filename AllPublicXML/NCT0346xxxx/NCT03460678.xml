  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter randomized study is to compare the effectiveness and safety
      of erlotinib and pemetrexed in the maintenance treatment of patients with advanced
      non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized multi-center prospective study to compare the 12-month effectiveness (survival)
      and safety of erlotinib and pemetrexed as maintenance treatment in two groups of patients
      with locally advanced or metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) other
      than predominantly squamous cell histology, whose disease has not progressed immediately
      following platinum-based chemotherapy for 4 cycles administered per routine daily practice in
      each study center

    <intervention_model_description>Eligible patients will be randomized into either the arm of Erlotinib 150 mg once daily, or the arm of Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21‐day cycle, until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in eligible patients randomized to erlotinib or pemetrexed treatment arms</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression Free Survival is defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of tumor progression or death from any cause, assessed until at least 12 months after randomization.
Progression is defined using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST version 1.1)</description>

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response defined using RECIST version 1.1 and the duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or progressive disease (PD) is objectively documented (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started) or until at least 12 months after randomization as assessed every 6 weeks</description>

    <description>Incidence rates, severity, relationship of adverse events (AEs) and serious AE (SAE) to treatment drugs, number of AEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation and clinically relevant changes in laboratory tests will be recorded, estimated and presented</description>
