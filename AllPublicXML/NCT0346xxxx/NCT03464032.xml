                  carcinoma/adenocarcinoma), progressive after the first-line therapy with
                  platinum-based CT or EGFR/ALK wt NSCLC progressive after the first-line therapy
                  with EGFR/ALK inhibitors (the drug will be used as a second therapy line);

               -  Metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma, progressive after at least the first-line
                  therapy (the drug will be used as a second or third therapy lines);

               -  Locally advanced or metastatic bladder cancer progressive on/after therapy with
                  platinum-based CT (the drug will be used as a second therapy line);

          4. ECOG score of 0 to 1;

          5. Presence of blocks for histological examination and/or patient's agreement to conduct
             a biopsy of an accessible lesions to obtain a histological material for examination of
             PD-L1 status

          6. Measurable disease (at least one lesion) according to RECISTv.1.1;

          7. Resolved toxicity events from the previous therapy or adverse consequences of surgical
             interventions to ≤ grade 1 CTCAE v. 4.03, except for chronic/irreversible adverse
             events not affecting the safety of the study therapy (e.g. alopecia);

          8. No severe pathology of organs or systems;

          9. Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks from the screening;

         10. Patients of childbearing potential enrolled in the study must agree to use reliable
             contraception methods throughout the study period, beginning 2 weeks before the
             inclusion in the study and up to 8 weeks after the last dose of BCD-100.

        Exclusion Criteria:
