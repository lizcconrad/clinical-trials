  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment with ustekinumab or
      adalimumab in biologic naive participants with moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease
      (CD) who have previously failed or were intolerant to conventional therapy (corticosteroids
      and/or immunomodulators, such as azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate), as
      measured by clinical remission at one year.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the safety and efficacy of ustekinumab versus adalimumab. It will consist
      of screening (within 1- 5 weeks prior to Week 0), treatment phase (Weeks 0 to 52), and
      follow-up phase (up to Week 76). The primary hypothesis is that ustekinumab is superior to
      adalimumab as measured by clinical remission after one year of treatment. Study assessments
      will include Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), video ileocolonoscopy; CD-related
      healthcare utilization; patient-reported outcomes (PROs); laboratory evaluations; biomarkers;
      review of concomitant medications and adverse events (AEs); and evaluation of serum
      concentrations of study agent as well as development of antibodies to study agent. All
      participants will randomly be assigned to receive either ustekinumab or adalimumab. No
      participants will be treated with placebo only.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants with Clinical Remission at Week 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 52</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of participants with clinical remission at Week 52 will be assessed. Clinical remission is defined as a Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of less than (&lt;) 150 points (in general, CDAI score ranges from 0 to approximately 600; higher score indicates higher disease activities). CDAI was assessed by collecting information on 8 different Crohn's disease-related variables (extra-intestinal manifestations, abdominal mass, weight, hematocrit, total number of liquid stools, abdominal pain/cramping, use of antidiarrheal drug(s) and/or opiates, and general well-being). A decrease in CDAI over time indicates improvement in disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 16 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS-29 includes seven health related quality of life domains (Physical Functioning, Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, Social Functioning, and Pain), and the pain domain has two subdomains (interference and intensity). Each of the 7 domains has four 5-level items. In addition to these items, pain intensity is assessed using a single 11-point numeric rating scale anchored between no pain (0) and worse imaginable pain. Raw scores are transformed using the T-score metric based on the item response theory calibrations in which scores have a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the general population in the US. T-scores can be estimated using the scoring tables listed in the PROMIS manuals. A higher PROMIS T-score implies more of the concept being measured; for instance, a higher PROMIS score on physical function indicates better functioning, whereas a higher score on depression indicates more severe depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI) Questionnaire at Week 8, 16 and 52</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8, 16 and 52</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the WPAI questionnaire score will be assessed at Week 8, 16 and 52. Work productivity was measured by the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI). The WPAI questionnaire is used to measure productivity loss associated with Crohn's disease during the past 7 days. It consists of six questions about absence from work because of Crohn's disease, hours actually worked, reduction in productivity at work attributed to Crohn's disease and reduction in productivity while performing daily activities. This instrument generates four scores between 0 and 100: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impairment at work / reduced productivity while working), work productivity loss (overall work impairment /absenteeism plus presenteeism) and activity impairment, which were expressed in percentage of impairment.</description>

          -  Has moderately-to-severely active CD with a baseline Crohn's disease activity index
             (CDAI) score of greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 220 and less than or equal to (&lt;=) 450

          -  Has one or more ulceration on screening ileocolonoscopy which will result in an Simple

             corticosteroid dependent

          -  Has not previously received an approved biologic for Crohn's Disease (i.e.,
             infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, ustekinumab, natalizumab, vedolizumab or
             approved biosimilars of these agents)

          -  Participants on oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, budesonide) at a
             prednisone-equivalent dose of &lt;=40 or milligram/day (mg/day) or &lt;=9 mg/day of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has complications of CD that are likely to require surgery or would confound the
