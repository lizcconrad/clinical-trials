    <textblock>
      The objectives of this phase II clinical study are: evaluate the efficacy, safety, patient
      adeherence and clinical applicability of a new robotic device for patients with stroke at a
      physical rehabilitation institution (Instituto de Medicina Física e Reabilitação do Hospital
      das Clínicas da Universidade de São Paulo - IMREA HCFMUSP - Rede de Reabilitação Lucy
      Montoro, unidade Vila Mariana). Methods: 10 patients with stroke diagnosis and Fugl-Meyer
      score ranging from 34 to 55 will be selected to be included in the study. After signing the
      informed consent form and being assessed by the baseline evaluations, they will undertake 18
      sessions of robotic therapy, which in its turn will be prescribed three times a week. After
      this period, the patients will be evaluated for future comparison of both the pre-treatment
      and final assessments.
