  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim was to determine whether Whole Body Cryotherapy (WBC) can result in improved pain
      status, perceived health, and quality of life in patients with fibromyalgia. It is
      hypothesized that this positive effect can be achieved through increased functional mobility
      and decreased pain intensity resulting from cold-induced modulation of the
      inflammation-immune axis.

    <textblock>
      24 patients with fibromyalgia were randomized into 2 groups (n=11 in the WBC group, n=13 in
      the control group). In the WBC group, 10 sessions of WBC were performed (in addition to usual
      care) in a standard cryotherapy room over a duration of 8 days. Patients in the control group
      did not change anything in their everyday activities. Several self-reported variables
      relating to perceived health were measured repeatedly (pain intensity, functional mobility,
      and quality of life).

    <measure>functional status : the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), subjective low back pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>chnage from baseline at two weeks follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-completed questionnaire which gives a subjective percentage score of level of function (disability) in activities of daily living in those rehabilitating from low back pain There are 10 questions (items). The questions are designed in a way that to realize how the back or leg pain is affecting the patient's ability to manage in everyday life.
Each of the 10 items is scored from 0 - 5. The maximum score is therefore 50. The obtained score can be multiplied by 2 to produce a percentage score.
If the first statement is marked, the section score = 0, If the last statement is marked, it = 5
If all ten sections are completed the score is calculated as followed:
Example: 10 (total score of the patient), 50 (total possible raw score), 10/50 x 100 = 20%
If one section is missed or not applicable, the score is calculated as followed:
Example: 15 (total score of the patient), 45 (total possible score), 15/45 x 100 = 30%</description>

    <measure>functional status : the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at one month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. This questionnaire is a self-report questionnaire that patients can rate difficulty and interference with daily life on a 5 point Likert scale. DASH Scoring Formula = ([(sum of n responses)/n] -1)(25) where n represents the number of completed items. The score on both test ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) is between 12.75% - 17.23%</description>

    <measure>functional status : Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at one month follow-ups</time_frame>
    <description>The test can be used to evaluate the impairment of a patient with lower extremity musculoskeletal condition or disorders. Can be used clinically to measure the patients' initial function, ongoing progress, and outcome as well as to set functional goals.In 1999, Binkley et al. developed the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), a patient-reported lower limb function questionnaire applicable to a wide spectrum of outpatients with a lower limb musculoskeletal condition. The LEFS consists of 20 items, each scored on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). The total score varies from 0 to 80, with higher scores representing better a functional status.</description>
