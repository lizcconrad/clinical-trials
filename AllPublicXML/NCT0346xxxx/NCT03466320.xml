      This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing primarily the safety of the NKR-2 treatment
      administered after a non-myeloablative preconditioning regimen in r/r AML/MDS patients.

      This Phase I study will contain two different sequential segments. The first segment will
      determine the recommended investigational treatment option (schedule of preconditioning and
      NKR-2 dose) and the second segment will expand to a larger number of r/r AML/MDS patients.

      This open-label Phase I study aims at assessing primarily the safety of the NKR-2 treatment
      administered after a non-myeloablative preconditioning regimen in r/r AML/MDS patients.

      This Phase I study will contain two different sequential segments.

      The first segment will determine the recommended investigational treatment option (schedule
      of preconditioning and NKR-2 dose) and the second segment will expand to a larger number of
      r/r AML/MDS patients. The first segment will evaluate the preconditioning regimen consisting
      in cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m² and fludarabine 30 mg/m² daily (CYFLU) administrated 3
      consecutive days daily at a specific interval prior to the NKR-2 administration. This segment
      is divided into three sequential cohorts to evaluate respectively:

        -  Two different intervals between the preconditioning regimen and the NKR-2 administration
           i.e. NKR-2 administered 3 days (T3) or 7 days (T7) after the end of the preconditioning
           regimen,

        -  Two different NKR-2 dose-levels i.e. dose-level 1 (1x108 NKR-2/injection) and dose-level
           2 (3x108 NKR-2/injection).

      The second segment (extension segment) will enroll more r/r AML/MDS patients (to reach 9
      evaluable patients in total) to further evaluate the recommended NKR-2 dose (1x108 or 3x108
      NKR-2/injection) administered at the recommended interval (T3 or T7) after the CYFLU
      preconditioning.

      Each patient will receive a single administration of NKR-2 following the preconditioning
      regimen. Depending on the clinical response as evaluated at the first tumor assessment,
      scheduled five weeks after NKR-2 administration, three situations may arise:

        -  If the patient is presenting a complete remission, then three new injections of NKR-2 at
           the recommended dose defined in the ongoing THINK study (THINK RecD), without prior
           preconditioning, will be administered with a two weeks interval,

        -  If the patient is presenting a stable disease or a partial remission, a new injection of
           NKR-2, with a prior preconditioning (with the same interval and regimen than for the
           first injection) will be administered to the patient,

        -  If the patient is in PD, he/she will not receive any other NKR-2 injection but will
           follow other visits as scheduled.

      At the second tumor assessment scheduled 12 weeks after first injection, and for patients who
      received a second injection of NKR-2 with a prior preconditioning, two situations may arise:

        -  If the patient is in CR, SD or PR, then three new injections of NKR-2 at the THINK RecD,
           without prior preconditioning, will be administered with a two weeks interval,

        -  If the patient is in PD, he/she will not receive any other NKR-2 injection but will
           follow other visits as scheduled.

      For each patient who received at least one NKR-2 administration, the overall study duration
      will be 15 years after first NKR-2 administration.

      The duration of the administration phase and treatment follow-up will be 24 months.

      Patients will be asked to complete a total of maximum 23 visits during the treatment
      administration phase, and maximum 6 visits during the treatment follow-up phase. During the
      long-term safety follow-up, yearly visits will be scheduled (up to Y15).

      Rationale for the study:

      NKR-2 has the potential to treat many distinct tumor-types because of a broad expression and
      important prevalence of the NKG2D ligands expression in various tumor types including in r/r
      AML/MDS. This Phase I study will explore the hypothesis that the administration of modified
      T-cells targeting NKG2D-ligands expressed by AML/MDS cells, after a prior nonmyeloablative
      preconditioning treatment, in patients refractory to and/or relapsing after prior therapies,
      is safe and, considering the poor outcomes and lack of therapeutic strategies for this
      patient population, may have a strategic advantage over current approaches and provide
      potential clinical benefit.

      Objectives of the study:

      Primary

      To document and characterize:

      • The safety of the NKR-2 treatment administration in r/r AML/MDS patients after a
      non-myeloablative preconditioning.

      Secondary

      To document and characterize:

        -  The NKR-2 peripheral blood kinetics post-administration,

        -  Indicators of clinical activity,

        -  Additional indicators of safety.
