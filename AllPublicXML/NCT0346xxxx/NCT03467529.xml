  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New tools are needed to 1) diagnose and 2) stage early esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      (SCC) in order to improve outcomes of this frequent and lethal cancer.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical technique, which can image human tissue ex
      vivo and in vivo with a resolution around 30µm and with a depth of 1mm. Full-field optical
      coherence tomography (FFOCT) is a new modality, which allows to image an ex vivo specimen
      with a cellular resolution and to perform 3D reconstruction. This device has never been
      tested on esophageal specimens.

      Therefore, the aim of this non-interventional research is 1) to determine FFOCT diagnostic
      criteria for SCC and 2) to figure if FFOCT allows the staging of the depth of invasion in
      SCC.

      To achieve these goals, we will image ex vivo 10 specimens of endoscopic resection of SCC
      (endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and submucosal dissection (ESD)) using an FFOCT device
      and we will compare the results with histological analysis of these specimens.

      General study methodology

      The study presents the following characteristics:

        -  Observational

        -  Non interventional imaging study

        -  Single-centre

        -  Not controlled

        -  Prospective Tests and analysis CRF

        -  Filled by the investigator

        -  Data from the medical file of the patient Imaging

        -  As standard of care

        -  Before endoscopic resection the lesion will be characterized and pictures will be made
           using white light endoscopy, magnification techniques and electronic chromoendoscopy

        -  Immediately after endoscopic resection, the specimen will be prepared, oriented and
           scanned using the FFOCT device (CE marking)

        -  Imaging movies will be then reviewed by trained readers and compared to movies of
           healthy patients, findings will be described

        -  Imaging movies will be compared to pathology slides

      Pathology

        -  After scanning the specimen will be sent to pathology for analysis

        -  The pathology slides will be scanned to be kept in the study record together with their
           interpretation

      Study schedule

        -  Total length of study: 24 months

        -  Methodology and regulatory: 6 months

        -  Recruitment period: 1 year

        -  Recruitment among the patients scheduled for the endoscopic procedure in the operative
           room

        -  One single visit = inclusion the day of the procedure

        -  No follow-up required

        -  Analyses: 3 months

        -  Paper writing: 3 months

    <description>The principal objective of this study will be reached if:
the tumoral lesion is correctly identified in the specimen in FFOCT images
and/or the normal esophageal mucosa and submucosal and/or normal vessels are correctly identified in the specimen in FFOCT images
in at least 8 specimens.</description>

        10 patients will be recruited by the Clinical investigation center by reviewing the
        scheduled SCC resections each week. All patients scheduled for an endoscopic resection of
        SCC will be considered for inclusion in the study. The study itself will take place in the
        department of gastroenterology. Recruitment within one year of inclusion will be possible
        because our unit is a regional reference center for interventional endoscopy.
