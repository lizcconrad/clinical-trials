    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, single-arm early feasibility study to assess the
      safety and feasibility of lowering intraocular pressure with the Brown Glaucoma Implant. A
      total of 10 subjects will be enrolled at a single center. Subjects will be followed for 24
      months, with the primary assessments completed 6 months after implant.

    <description>The Brown Glaucoma Implant (BGI) is an implantable device designed to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients by shunting aqueous humor from the anterior chamber of the eye to the surface of the eye. Because there are no physiologic sources of outflow resistance, the device can be engineered to target an IOP that is low enough to halt the progression to blindness in a patient suffering from glaucoma.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 22 years and older

          -  No light perception in the study eye.

          -  Intraocular pressure in the study eye greater than or equal to 15mmHg and less than or
             equal to 40mmHg

          -  At least two contiguous clock hours of intact conjunctiva near the limbus between
             clock hours of 9:00 and 3:00 in the study eye

          -  Adequate space in the anterior chamber of the study eye sufficient to support implant
             with the BGI

          -  Able and willing to comply with the protocol requirements

          -  Able to understand and sign the Informed Consent form

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active Neovascular Glaucoma in the study eye.

          -  Corneal conditions in the study eye that may inhibit normal incisional healing (e.g.
             Fuch's dystrophy) or impair visualization of the implant inside the anterior chamber

          -  Anticipated need for ocular surgery within one year in the study eye.

          -  Contact lens use in the study eye

          -  Clinically significant inflammation or infection in the study eye within 60 days prior
             to the preoperative visit or any systemic infection

          -  Other clinical conditions including poorly controlled diabetes, cancer requiring
             treatment, any drugs or comorbidities that may inhibit wound healing

          -  Participation in any other clinical trial during participation in this trial

          -  Life expectancy less than 1 year
