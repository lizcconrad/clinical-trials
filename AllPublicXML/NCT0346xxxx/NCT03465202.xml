  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre prospective non-interventional study designed to evaluate the effects
      of patient age on the pharmacokinetics of capecitabine and its metabolites 5'DFCR, 5'DFUR,
      and 5-FU. In addition, the study will assess the correlation between the pharmacokinetic
      parameters calculated and cytidine deaminase, biomarkers of aging, clinical frailty,
      treatment outcome, and toxicity. To be enrolled, patients must have breast or colorectal
      cancer and be eligible to receive capecitabine monotherapy in accordance with its approved
      clinical usage in the UK. Treatment will be administered according to NICE guidelines as well
      as the clinical judgement of the prescribing physician. One hundred patients (50 breast
      cancer patients, 50 colorectal cancer patients) who are about to start treatment with
      capecitabine monotherapy will be recruited to the study and undergo study procedures within
      the first week of treatment.

    <time_frame>Six months</time_frame>
    <description>Toxicity grade(s) as measured by CTCAE version 4.03 (published by the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services 2009). General grading scheme is as follows: Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL. Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5: Death related to AE.</description>

    <description>Progression free survival as measured by the RECIST criteria version 1.1 (Eisenhauer et al., 2009). The RECIST criteria define progression as 'at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression)'</description>

Partial response = 'At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.'</description>

    <description>Quality of life as measured by the EORTC-QLQ-C30 version 3 questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses the quality of life of cancer patients in a series of 30 questions, with 28 of the questions on a scale of 1 to 4 where 1 is 'not at all' and 4 is 'very much'. Final two questions relate to overall quality of life and health on a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is 'very poor' and 7 is 'excellent'.</description>
