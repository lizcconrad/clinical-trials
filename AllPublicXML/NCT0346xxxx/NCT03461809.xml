      This retrospective observational study is designed to assess the response to treatment with
      ocular acupuncture and its relative factors, in terms of diplopia status, ocular motility
      differences, and clinical features, in ocular motor nerve palsy patients. During this study,
      a retrospective data collection will be carried out using the information contained in the
      medical record of aimed patients, provided that the treatment with ocular acupuncture.

    <description>Patient's skin located in the extraocular muscles projection area is routinely disinfected. A diameter of 0.20 mm and length of 25 mm needle is inserted slowly. Piercing depth is about 20mm. The electropuncture apparatus is used, each group of electrodes are distinguished with different colors of wires to generate current stimulations of current 1.0~1.5 milliampere (mA), voltage 9 volt(V), frequency 1.5 hertz (Hz), and duration of 40 minutes.</description>
