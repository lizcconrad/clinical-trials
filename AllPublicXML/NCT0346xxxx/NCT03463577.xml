  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of Boostrix administered on or after the
      first day of the 27th week of pregnancy by conducting a post-marketing study that will
      provide safety information to the public and healthcare providers. This will be one of the
      largest cohorts of pregnant women vaccinated with Boostrix in the U.S. Through partnership
      between Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) and the sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK),
      information about the safety of maternal vaccination with Boostrix and maternal and infant
      adverse events in a community setting will be gained.
