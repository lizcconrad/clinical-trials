  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women in developed countries. The
      diagnosis is often made at a localized stage (67% of cases), making it a relatively good
      cancer prognosis with a 5-year all-stage survival of 81.7%.

      Its management at the localized stage is based on surgery and radiotherapy. Adjuvant
      chemotherapy may be offered in addition to radiotherapy, but its place is still debated. It
      is classically delivered sequentially before or after radiotherapy, concomitant
      radiochemotherapy not being a standard. It is generally recommended in case of stage III, and
      for the earlier stages, its use is based on various prognostic factors (histological type,
      grade, emboli) and the feasibility of treatment (age, general condition, comorbidities). In
      fact, patients treated for endometrial cancer are elderly (median age 63 years) and in the
      majority of cases present comorbidities (diabetes, obesity and hypertension). Chemotherapy
      can induce side effects that can persist and potentially alter the quality of life of these
      often fragile patients. Although the impact of surgery and radiotherapy on the quality of
      life has been well studied, there is insufficient literature data for adjuvant chemotherapy.
      The investigator propose a case-control study that will evaluate the quality of life and late
      sequelae of patients treated for locally advanced endometrial cancer with sequential adjuvant
      chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy at a distance from their management. comparing
      their results to a group of patients who had been treated with postoperative radiotherapy
      alone.
