  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The burden placed on advanced cancer family caregivers (FCGs) and the toll on their mental
      and physical health have never been greater and is particularly pernicious for underserved
      groups in the Southeastern U.S., including rural-dwellers and African-Americans, for whom
      interventions have not been specifically developed and tested. The purpose of this K99/R00 is
      provide the awardee with the knowledge and training necessary to become a leading independent
      clinical investigator in developing and testing telehealth palliative care interventions for
      family caregivers (FCGs) of underserved persons with advanced cancer. The research specific
      aim during the K99 phase was to develop and tailor the content, format and delivery of a
      telehealth intervention for FCGs of persons with advanced cancer in the rural South. To meet
      this aim, qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 lay healthcare
      navigators, 20 FCGs, and 18 patients with advanced cancer to elicit feedback on a FCG
      intervention outline based on published evidence-based interventions. After thematic
      analysis, major findings included that the intervention should: have topical content that is
      flexible and based on continuous assessment; include at least some face-to-face contact;
      cautiously consider internet-based technologies because internet access in rural areas is
      poor; and potentially have navigators lead the intervention with appropriate oversight and
      additional training. K99 study findings have been used to adapt and develop a potentially
      scalable FCG intervention in the Southern U.S. population (Project Cornerstone). The K99
      study phase in combination with accomplishing the training objectives has successfully
      catalyzed the awardee's transition from a Postdoctoral Fellow to a Tenure-Track Assistant
      Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Nursing. The overall goal
      during the R00 phase will be to conduct a small-scale pilot RCT of Cornerstone with 60 FCGs
      of rural-dwelling and/or African-American patients with advanced cancer to assess
      acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy. The research specific aims during the R00
      phase are to: evaluate the acceptability of Cornerstone and the feasibility of enrolling and
      retaining 60 participants into a RCT of the FCG intervention for 24 weeks (Aim 1) and
      evaluate the potential efficacy of Cornerstone in improving caregiver (Aim 2) and care
      recipient (Aim 3) outcomes compared to usual care (quality of life and distress
      [anxiety/depressive symptoms]). The results will directly support an R-01 application to
      conduct an efficacy RCT of an early, telehealth PC intervention for Southern FCGs of
      underserved persons with advanced cancer.

    <description>Project Cornerstone basic elements are:
The intervention is lay navigator-led with regular supervision by a specialist palliative care clinician;
6 base telephone/in-person sessions: Sessions cover specific topics (every 1-2 weeks, 20-60 minutes/session; by phone or in-person), followed by monthly follow-up and additional coaching sessions as needed;
Regular caregiver distress thermometer screening and problem support and self-care coaching.
Caregivers receive a Project Cornerstone Family Supporting Family (FSF) Binder that organizes intervention materials and contains educational information pertaining to the 6 base coaching sessions. Project Cornerstone begins within 60 days of a care recipient being diagnosed with advanced cancer and ends 1 year after care recipient death.</description>
