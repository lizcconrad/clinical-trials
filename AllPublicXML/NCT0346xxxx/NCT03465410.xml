    <textblock>
      The pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus (TAC) are characterized by high inter- and
      intra-individual variability with narrow therapeutic range. Currently, the limiting point of
      Tac drug monitoring is the inability to individualize doses during the first few days after
      transplantation. Our group developed a population pharmacokinetic model (PPK) identifying
      CYP3A4 * 22 and CYP3A5 * 3 polymorphisms and hematocrit as explanatory variables of the
      observed variability in pre-dose (Co) concentrations. According to this model, the proportion
      of patients that do not reach the therapeutic target is 40

      The results of the study of genetic polymorphisms performed in renal transplant patients at
      our hospital demonstrated the influence of CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3A4 * 22 single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNPs) on exposure to Tac. From these results, the first population
      pharmacokinetic model was developed, which included CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3A4 * 22 polymorphisms
      as well as hematocrit as explanatory variables of interindividual variability. Based on our
      population model and using the simulation tool, the percentage of patients reaching the
      therapeutic target based on Co values within the range of 6-10 ng / mL was determined after
      being dosed according to the strategy of Conventional dosage empirically according to Co
      achieved. The simulation of 50 Co values according to the conventional dosage allowed to
      determine the proportion of patients reaching the therapeutic target in each case and their
      confidence interval. 40% of the patients did not reach the therapeutic objective. Based on
      the clusters of the two polymorphisms, the percentages of patients on or below exposed varied
      according to whether they were slow or fast metabolizers respectively. Due to this high
      variability in Tac PK, the individualization of the Tac posology was calculated by
      calculating the initial dose according to the population model previously developed and
      adjusting the subsequent doses, as a function of the Tac Co through Bayesian approximations
      with the inclusion of genotyping and Hematocrit, can contribute greatly to achieve optimal
      exposure to the drug from the start of treatment in the immediate post-transplant and reduce
      the variability observed in the Co-achieved; This may be particularly important for patients
      with a slow and rapid metabolizer profile. All of this may contribute to minimizing adverse
      effects, ensuring greater efficacy in the target population, reducing the risk of acute
      rejection, and reducing associated costs.

      In the present study we intend to incorporate pharmacogenomics for its application in de novo
      patients, which will allow us to perform a more individualized therapy for each patient based
      on the values of target Co and the CYP3A5 * 3 and CYP3 A4 * 22 polymorphisms of the patient
      since The initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and thus improve efficiency and decrease
      adverse effects.
