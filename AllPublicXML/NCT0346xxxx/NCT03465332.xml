  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the diagnostic measures (including blood eosinophil counts) commonly
      used by lung specialist's in routine clinical care of subjects with COPD in Germany and how
      these diagnostic tests influence the physician's treatment decisions. The study will be
      conducted in three parts. In the first part, lung specialist's, who will not participate in
      the survey, will develop doctor's questionnaire. The second part is an interventional
      cross-sectional study, wherein approximately 30 lung specialists will be enrolled and data on
      their perspective on diagnosis and treatment of COPD subjects will be collected via the
      revised doctor's questionnaire. The third part is a retrospective non-interventional study
      where each doctor will collect retrospective data from selected subjects with COPD from the
      time of informed consent up to 12 months before. The retrospective data will be collected
      from subject files of approximately 250 subjects with COPD.
