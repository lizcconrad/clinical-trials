  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to compare the effect of two weight loss interventions
      inducing the same energy deficit but one based on exercise and one using dietary restriction,
      on appetite control in obese adolescents. Investigator hypothesis that daily energy intake
      and hunger will be increased in the dietary restriction group but not in response to the
      exercise program.

    <textblock>
      The present study will compare the nutritional responses to two 4-month weight loss programs
      inducing the same energy deficit in obese adolescents, one based on exercise and the other
      one using dietary restriction. After a first 4-month phase stabilizing the adolescents' daily
      energy intake and expenditure, half of the sample with increase their physical activity to
      induce a 10% increase of their daily energy expenditure (maintaining the same energy intake)
      while the other half will stick with the same physical activity program but reduce their
      daily intake to match for the same 10% energy deficit. Before, at the end and 4 months after
      the intervention, Investigator will assess the adolescents' energy intake and appetite
      control by measuring: ad libitum energy intake, appetite feelings throughout the day, food
      preferences, food reward. But also all the potential underneath mechanisms based on
      gastro-peptides and adipokines. Finally, sleep metabolism will be assessed using
      polysomnography as a potential link between weight loss and appetite control. Body
      composition, quality of life, aerobic capacities and resting metabolic rate will also be
      measured at each time point.
