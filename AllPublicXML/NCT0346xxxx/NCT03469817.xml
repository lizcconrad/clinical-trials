    <textblock>
      The study aims to describe bone apposition and fixation of the Trident and Trident II
      Tritatnium acetabular system in patients 1 year status post total hip replacement. We will be
      studying this by comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s taken 1 year s/p total hip
      replacement with a Trident II cup with MRI's taken of patients with the Trident Cup who had
      MRIs done at 1 year post-op.
