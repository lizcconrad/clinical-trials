      This clinical research focus on evaluating the effectiveness of Huanglian-Jiedu Decoction in
      patients with intense-exuberant stomach fire syndrome (one of the common TCM syndrome)of
      acute pericoronitis,minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis and recurrent herpes simplex
      labialis,meanwhile, exploring the pharmacological mechanism and potential biomarkers of this
      traditional formula.

      Huanglian-Jiedu Decoction, as a traditional Chinese medicine formula，includes 4 kinds of
      Chinese herbs as following: Huanglian (Rhizoma Coptidis), Huangbo (Cortex Phellodendri),
      Huangqin (Scutellaria baicalensis) and Zhizi (Scutellaria baicalensis). Huanglian-Jiedu
      Decoction has been recorded to be effective in many diseases that belong to the syndrome of
      intense-exuberant stomach fire from thousands years of clinical practice, just like acute
      pericoronitis, minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis and recurrent herpes simplex labialis,etc.
      While its clinical pharmacological mechanism has not been clearly illustrated. In this study,
      the investigators focus on evaluating the effectiveness of Huanglian-Jiedu Decoction in
      patients with intense-exuberant stomach fire syndrome (including three disease: acute
      pericoronitis, minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis and recurrent herpes simplex labialis),
      and exploring the pharmacological mechanism and potential biomarkers of this traditional
      formula.

    <description>Intense-Exuberant Stomach Fire Syndrome scores were questionnaires that consists of basic symptoms and disease-specific symptoms that described in traditional Chinese medicine. The basic symptoms included feverish sensation, thirst that preferring cold drink, bad breath, flushed face, bound stool, scanty yellowish urine, red tongue with dry and yellowish fur, and the forceful or rapid pulse. The disease-specific symptoms included tooth or/and gums for acute pericoronitis, ulcer for recurrent aphthous stomatitis and herpes for recurrent herpes simplex labialis. Each symptom was assessed by the Visual Analogue Scale（VAS），where a higher score meant higher severity.</description>

    <description>Using the OHIP measures, the patients were asked to rate the impact of their oral health on 14 key areas of OHRQoL: &quot;What effects do your teeth, gums, and/or mouth have on each of the 14 key areas of life quality (i.e., your comfort, your speech)?&quot; These 14 items were subdivided into seven domains (subscales): functional limitation, physical discomfort, psychological discomfort, physical disability, psychological disability, social disability, and handicap. For the OHIP-14, the response categories were recorded on a five-point Likert scale: 0, never; 1, hardly ever; 2, occasionally; 3, fairly often; 4, very often.
