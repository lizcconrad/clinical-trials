  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As surgery enters the era of value-based care, it is advocated that postoperative recovery be
      measured using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) as they provide a mean to incorporate the
      patient's perspectives and experiences into research and clinical decision-making. In
      abdominal surgery, this is currently precluded by the lack of PRO measures specifically
      developed and validated in the context of postoperative recovery.

      The core goal of this research project is to develop a PRO measure aimed to assess
      postoperative recovery from the perspective of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. This
      project complies with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Society for
      Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) guidelines for PRO development and will be
      conducted in three phases:

      Phase 1: Qualitative interviews with patients to develop a conceptual framework and generate
      relevant items.

      Phase 2: Use of Rasch Analysis for item-reduction and scale formation.

      Phase 3: Further assessment of measurement properties based on traditional psychometric
      methods.

      OBJECTIVE:

      To develop a comprehensive, conceptually relevant and psychometrically sound PRO measure to
      assess recovery after abdominal surgery.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Phase 1(Conceptual framework and item generation): Semi-structured interviews focusing
           on patient lived experiences after abdominal surgery are currently being conducted to
           derive the &quot;final conceptual framework of recovery after abdominal surgery&quot;. The
           interviews are guided by the &quot;hypothesized conceptual framework&quot; which is based on
           previous literature and expert input. This phase has a minimal targeted sample of 30
           patients. To account for potential cross-cultural differences in recovery experiences,
           the study is enrolling patients from 5 international sites: McGill University Health
           Centre (Montreal, Canada), Hospital Sao Paulo (Sao Paulo, Brazil), Vita-Salute San
           Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy, Hokkaido University Hospital (Sapporo, Japan) and
           Hospital (TBE, USA). Interview audio recordings are transcribed, translated if required,
           and coded according to ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and
           Health) domains. Codes for which saturation is reached will comprise the final
           conceptual framework of recovery. Items reflecting the essence of each domain will be
           generated and patient understanding of the items will be assessed through cognitive
           interviews. Items for which no problems have been identified and those successfully
           revised will be compiled into an item pool to be 'calibrated' in subsequent stages of
           PRO development.

        -  Phase 2: (Rasch Analysis): Estimate the extent to which the pool of items generated in
           Phase 1 fit the Rasch model and, based on this analysis, modify or eliminate items to
           ensure that the novel PRO measure fits a linear continuum and produces meaningful
           scores. Phase 2 targets a sample of 300 patients and the preliminary item pool will be
           administered at one time point either in pen-and-paper format or using an online survey,
           depending on the patient's preference. Based on the analysis, a computer adaptive
           testing (CAT) system will be developed to allow accurate measurement of PRO scores using
           a minimal number of items.

        -  Phase 3: (Validation using traditional psychometric methods ): Use traditional
           psychometric methods to contribute further evidence regarding the measurement properties
           of the novel PRO measure of recovery after abdominal surgery. To do so, the final PRO
           measure in CAT format will be administered to a consecutive cohort of patients
           undergoing abdominal surgery (target sample size of 200) in two institutions (MUHC and
           Florida Hospital) preoperatively and at postoperative days 3, 7, 15, 30 and 90.
