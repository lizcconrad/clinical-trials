  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, open-lable, multicentre study to compare the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin,
      acetylcysteine plus danazol with danazol monotherapy in patients with
      corticosteroidresistant/relapsed ITP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a severe bleeding disorder. Approximately 2/3 of patients
      achieve remission from first-line therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of
      corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a
      great challenge. Atorvastatin was shown to enhance bone marrow endothelial cell function and
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was shown to inhibit PLT binding to endothelial cell.

      A multicentre prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were
      either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed. Patients were
      randomized to atorvastatin, acetylcysteine plus danazol with danazol monotherapy group.
      Platelet count, bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment.
      Adverse events are also recorded throughout the study, in order to compare the efficacy and
      safety of atorvastatin, acetylcysteine plus danazol with danazol monotherapy in patients with
      corticosteroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
