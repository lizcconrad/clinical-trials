    <textblock>
      This study intended to assess the expiratory flow limitation (EFL) during tidal breath in
      patients intubated in intensive care unit (ICU) for moderate or severe acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS). EFL is defined as the lack of increase in expiratory flow in
      response to an increase in alveolar-to-atmospheric pressure gradient. It reflects airway
      closure. Early studies have been done using the Negative expiratory pressure (NEP) technique,
      which is no longer available. We proposed in present study a new method, which consists of
      diverting manually the expiratory flow to the atmosphere by-passing the expiratory valve. We
      aimed at assessing EFL at positive expiratory pressure (PEP) 5 cmH2O in semi-recumbent then
      in supine position together with measurement of trans-pulmonary pressure and regional lung
      ventilation. Higher PEP levels will be tested, namely 10, 15 and a trans-pulmonary PEP of 3
      cmH2O, in semi-recumbent position.

    <description>A Fleish 2 pneumotachograph and a port to measure airway pressure are attached at the Y piece of the ventilator circuit and connected to a Biopac 150. At the end of inspiration the air is expelled to the atmosphere upstream the expiratory valve. The flow volume loop at baseline and that during the manoeuver are plotted and patients classified as EFL or not EFL (NFL). Measurements are taken in semi-recumbent then after 5 minutes in supine position.</description>
