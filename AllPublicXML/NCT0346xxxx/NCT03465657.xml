  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous evidence shows that sodium intake in Spanish adult population is over the
      recommended limits and this high sodium intake is related with difficulties in body weight
      control and blood pressure control.

      The aim of this study is to stablish a direct relationship between salt intake and the health
      parameters previously mentioned in a representative sample of Spanish schoolchildren between
      7-11 years old. The investigators are applying a 3-day dietary records to collect dietary
      data, and collecting 24-h urine samples in order to analyse biochemical indicators of sodium
      intake and other nutrients. Anthropometric data are also being recorded and body composition
      is also analysed using bioimpedance technique.

      Specific Aims

        1. To stablish the average sodium intake in Spanish children, using a 24-h urine sample and
           validated dietary questionnaires.

        2. To compare 24-hour urinary sodium measurement to the dietary survey method

        3. To study the relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure levels in Spanish
           scholars.

        4. To analyze the relationship between sodium intake and overweight/obesity in Spanish
           children using anthropometric and bioimpedance analysis measures.

        5. To identify main food sources of sodium in the diet of Spanish schoolchildren and the
           use of discretionary salt.

        6. Provide new data for monitoring sodium intake in Spanish schoolchildren and design
           campaigns to reduce their intake.

        7. To provide reference data of sodium intake on a representative sample of the Spanish
           child population for European and international databases.
