    <intervention_model_description>A stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial. All clusters (i.e., specialized palliative care (SPC) units) will start as controls and will change to intervention at various times determined by randomization. In this way, all SPC units will contribute to control and intervention groups, thus accounting for variation between SPC units.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The CSNAT intervention is a caregiver-led approach where the caregiver first identifies his/her needs of support in the CSNAT, which consists of 14 support domains. Then the practitioner facilitates the intervention where the caregiver prioritizes which domains to discuss. In the conversation, the caregiver's domain priorities and subsequently identified support needs are discussed with the practitioner to agree on actions/solutions and a shared action plan. The intervention will be offered each caregiver twice: the first time between 0 and 13 days after enrollment, and the second time between 15 and 27 days after enrollment.</description>
