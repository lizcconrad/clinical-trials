  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the efficacy of a fixed combination of black cohosh (EP-40) and Rhodiola
      rosea (EPR-7) with low (6.5 mg) and high doses (500 mg) of a standardized black cohosh
      extract only in adult woman with menopausal complaints.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the problems caused by Hormone Replacement Therapy with chemical entities, some
      medicinal plants used in the traditional systems of medicine have shown immense potential in
      non-hormonal treatment of menopausal symptoms without major adverse events. We hypothesize
      that Menopause Relief EP-40 (a fixed combination of Cimicifuga EP-40 and Rhodiola EPR-7
      extracts) will significantly relieve menopausal complaints such as hot flushes, profuse
      sweating hot flushes, excessive perspiration, night sweats, sleep disorders, nervousness,
      mood swings, physical and mental fatigue as compared to EP-40® capsules or placebo in adult
      females in menopause.

    <measure>Kupperman Menopausal Index (KMI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A modified total Kupperman Index (KMI) score and its sub-items will be used. It is a 10-item questionnaire of single symptoms with scores ranging from 0 to 3 (none, mild, moderate and severe). Total KMI is defined as the sum of sub-item scores multiplied by any weighting factors. The maximum value of the total KMI is 48. The primary outcome will be the difference in the changes from baseline to the end of therapy (week 12), between verum groups and placebo, assessed by the total KMI and stratified by individual baseline scores in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (patients treated with study medication and with at least one efficacy assessment after baseline).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Menopause Rating Scale (MRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The MRS is a patient reported assessment of 11 symptoms of menopause on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). The MRS groups symptoms into three subscales: psychological, somatic, and urogenital. A composite score is calculated by adding the items in each dimension (subscale). The total score is the sum of the three dimensional scores. The primary outcome will be the difference in the changes from baseline to the end of therapy (week 12), between both verum groups and placebo, assessed by the MRS and stratified by individual baseline scores in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (patients treated with study medication and with at least one efficacy assessment after baseline).</description>
