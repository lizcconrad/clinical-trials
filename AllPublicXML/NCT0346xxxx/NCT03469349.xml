      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of actovegin in participants
      with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Fontaine Stage IIB.

      The study will enroll approximately 366 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned to
      one of the two treatment groups in 1:1 ratio:

        1. Actovegin

        2. Placebo (dummy inactive substance) - this is a tablet/IV infusion that looks like the
           study drug but has no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take IV infusion for 2 weeks followed by oral tablets for
      10 weeks.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted Russia, Belarussia, Georgia, Ukraine and
      Kazakhstan. The overall time to participate in this study is 25-26 weeks. Participants will
      make multiple visits to the clinic, and 12 weeks after last dose of study drug for a
      follow-up assessment.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) at Weeks 12 and 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12 and 24</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 patient-reported measure of health-related quality of life. It consists of 8 sections: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health, that are the weighted sums of the questions in each health domain. Each scale is directly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score, the more disability, and the higher the score, the less disability, ie, a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
