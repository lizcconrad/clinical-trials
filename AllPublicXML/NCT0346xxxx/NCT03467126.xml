      A prospective, single-arm, multi-center, non-randomized, pre-market study designed to provide
      clinical data regarding the use of the AcQMap High Resolution Imaging and Mapping System
      during an atrial fibrillation retreatment ablation procedure. The patient population inlcudes
      men and women, eighteen (10) years of age or older, who in the past twenty-four (24) months
      have had no more than two (2) previous left-atrial ablations for AF treatment. The treatment
      plan must include evaluation and ablation (as indicated) of pulmonary vein reconnections plus
      AcQMap guided non-PV substrate ablation. Subject assessments will occr at screening,
      procedure, hospital discharge, 3-, 6-, and 12-months.
