  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-section correlational study that will examine the relationships between
      wheelchair speed, maneuverability, and endurance with community integration. By identifying
      which of these has the biggest contribution to community participation, the information will
      be used to justify continues therapy, to alter the focus of therapy, and to justify purchase
      of power or power assist wheelchairs when needed. Currently, therapists make the
      recommendation for a power or power assist chair based on their clinical judgement and the
      patient's experience, but there has been limited justification from the literature for these
      decisions. Finally, because the CHART measure is the gold standard in rehabilitation research
      for community integration, but has psychometric problems, we will use this opportunity to
      validate a new more psychometrically solid measure, the PART-O, against the CHART.

    <measure>Life Space Assessment Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0</time_frame>
    <description>This nine question survey asks participants where they have gone in the last week, frequency of those visits, and how independently they went there. The locations vary from spaces within their home, immediately around their home, or outside of their neighborhood, city, county, state or nation. Their independent movement patterns will be classified as within the home, limited community mobility and full community mobility.</description>

    <description>This measure of wheelchair propulsion speed asks patients to propel themselves as fast as they can over 20 meters. This task is performed twice, and the average time is used for the score</description>

    <description>This group will participate in activity-based measures employed in routine occupational and physical therapy practice to assess participants' wheelchair speed, maneuverability, and endurance. These measures include: the Life Space Assessment Scale, 6-Minute Push Test, Forward Push Test, Wheelchair Slalom Test, Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique, and PART-O.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>GPS Tracking</arm_group_label>
    <description>A GPS tracker will be placed on the wheelchairs of 25 individuals who consent to participate in this arm of the project. Using a GPS tracker will provide a direct measure of the community locations these participants go. The GPS location is collected every minute, and mapped to Google Maps, which would allow calculation of speed of movement.</description>
