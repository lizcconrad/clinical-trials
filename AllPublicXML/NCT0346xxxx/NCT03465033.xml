  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies describe that the maximum mandibular opening decreases 60% -70% immediately
      after orthognathic surgery (OS) and other variables, including laterotrusion, movement speed
      and facial mimic also decrease drastically. In addition, patients frequently experience
      temporary or permanent sensory orofacial disturbances ranging from 9% to 76% of cases.

      It has been described that scheduled early physiotherapy reduces these complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Before the surgical intervention (T0) the maximum interincisal oral opening measurement,
      laterotrusion and maximum protrusion will be recorded by digital caliber. The overbite and
      the overjet, length of upper lip and lower facial third will be measured. The symmetry of the
      upper lip in a forced smile will be determined. The measurements made at T0 will be repeated
      at T1 (2 weeks after surgery), T2 (5 weeks after surgery), T3 (9 weeks after surgery), T4 (12
      weeks after surgery), T5 (24 weeks after surgery) and T6 (after orthodontic removal).The
      level of pain during the measurements of the mandibular movements will be recorded in the
      Visual Analogue Scale, and the self-reported area of the orofacial sensory alterations by
      means of a diagram and the objective area by means of the sensory discrimination test of two
      points will be determined. In T4, the impact of the status of the function and oral
      structures on daily activities will be recorded through a self-pass questionnaire based on
      the Oral Index Daily Performance questionnaire (OIDP-sp). In the T6 the measurement of
      laterotrusion, protrusion and retrusion movements measured by Gysi Gothic arch will be
      performed.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients undergoing OS will be studied. All patients will be told that two interventions are compared but they will not know which one is the usual care or the early physiotherapy. All of them will receive instructions of basic care after surgery: use of intermaxillary elastics, soft diet during the first month and semi-soft during the second month. Patients will be asked to remove the intermaxillary elastics 30min before the measurements.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The impact of the status of the oral function and structures on daily activities will be recorded through a self-pass questionnaire based on the Oral Index Daily Performance questionnaire (OIDP-sp)). In the OIDP index impacts are quantified by multiplying the frequency and severity scores to obtain the performance score for each of eight dimensions (eating, speaking, cleaning teeth, working, social relation, sleeping/relaxing, smiling and emotional status). The sum of these scores is considered the total impact score. This total score is divided by the maximum possible score and multiplied by 100 to give the percentage score. This scoring system yields an intuitive oral impact score.</description>

    <description>From T1 to T2 patients will perform 3 daily repetitions of active exercises:1 5 repetitions of oral opening exercises and bilateral manual progressive stretching, protrusion and maximum lateralization of the jaw on both sides, holding each movement for 5s and a session of cryotherapy applied to the masseter, temporal and suprahyoid muscles for 120s in two 60s sessions. They will also perform 30 repetitions of exercises aimed at improving the labial seal (inflate cheeks) and the symmetry of the upper lip (broad smile). From T2 to T3 30 repetitions of the same exercises will be performed and passive progressive opening will be implemented by &quot;clamping&quot; Patients will also perform isometric contraction exercises in opening, closing, laterotrusion, protrusion and retrusion. Each movement will be repeated 5 times and it will remain for 5s.</description>
