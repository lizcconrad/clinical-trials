  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inherited epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a genetic skin disorder characterized by skin
      fragility and recurrent blister formation. More and more evidence has suggested that the skin
      lesions initially caused by genetic mutations may be further aggravated by inflammatory
      responses. Several reports showed successful alleviation of EB symptoms upon treatment with
      immunomodulatory therapies. Modulation of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β has shown promising
      results in alleviating epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a major subtype of inherited EB,
      by downregulating IL-1β-mediated JNK/MAPK signaling pathway. This data further supports the
      potential of using cytokine modulators to treat EB.

      AC-203, a topical formulation, can inhibit the production and activity of IL-1β,
      down-regulate IL-1β receptors, and increase IL1β-receptor antagonist (IL1-Ra) expression. In
      addition, AC-203 has been reported to inhibit anti-BP180 autoantibody-induced IL-6/IL-8
      upregulation in cultured keratinocytes and LPS-induced IL-6 upregulation in cultured
      macrophages. Furthermore, AC-203 was also found to inhibit the formation of NLRP3
      inflammasome, which plays essential roles in induction of caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and
      release of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. These studies demonstrated the cytokine
      modulatory properties of AC-203 and pointed out the possible application of AC-203 in a
      variety of inflammatory diseases.

      This study is designed to test the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of
      AC-203 ointment (vs. placebo) in patients with inherited EB.
