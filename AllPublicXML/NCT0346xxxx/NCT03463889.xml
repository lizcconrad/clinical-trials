  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well Gallium-68 prostate specific membrane antigen
      positron emission tomography (PET) work in diagnosing patients with thyroid cancer.
      Diagnostic procedures, such as 68Ga-PSMA PET, may more accurately diagnose thyroid cancer and
      find out how far the disease has spread.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility and utility of Gallium Ga 68-labeled PSMA-11 (68Ga-PSMA) PET
      imaging in patients with thyroid cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between targeted molecular uptake of 68Ga-PSMA PET in thyroid
      cancer compared to areas identified as tumor by radioiodine uptake (in well-differentiated
      cancers) or fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) uptake (in poorly differentiated and/or
      radioiodine-negative cancers).

      II. To determine and compare the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA PET to (18F-FDG)
      PET and/or radioiodine scintigraphy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if 68Ga-PSMA PET uptake is related to tumor differentiation and PSMA staining
      in tissue pathology when available.

      II. To determine the correlation between standardized uptake value maximum (SUVmax) of target
      thyroid cancer lesions on 68Ga-PSMA PET and serum thyroglobulin levels.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive 68Ga-PSMA intravenously (IV) over 1-2 minutes and then undergo PET/MRI
      60 minutes after injection. Patients may undergo a second PET/MRI 2-6 months after completion
      of first scan.
