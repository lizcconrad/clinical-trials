        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a clinical diagnosis of DS or LGS, where convulsive seizures (generalized
             tonic clonic seizures, tonic seizures, atonic seizures, tonic/atonic seizures, focal
             seizures with clear observable motor signs) are not completely controlled by current
             AEDs.

          -  All medications or interventions for epilepsy (including ketogenic diet [KD] and vagal
             nerve stimulation [VNS]) must be stable for at least 4 weeks prior to first ZX008 dose
             and are expected to remain stable throughout the study.

          -  Subjects must be taking a stable dose of CBD for at least 4 weeks prior to first ZX008
             dose.

          -  Subject's source of CBD is expected to be consistent for at least 3 months during
             study participation.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

             myocardial infarction or stroke.

          -  Subject with current cardiac valvulopathy or pulmonary hypertension that the
             Investigator, parent/caregiver, IPCAB, IDSMC, or sponsor deems clinically significant.
