  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research has shown that people suffering from MDD tend to maintain dysfunctional expectations
      despite experiences that disconfirm expectations. Recently, it has been shown that this
      persistence of expectations is due to maladaptive information processing involving &quot;cognitive
      immunization&quot;. This experimental study aims at testing three different strategies to inhibit
      cognitive immunization, in order to enhance expectation change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It appears adaptive to change one's expectations when continuously gaining
      expectation-disconfirming experiences; however, research has shown that people suffering from
      MDD have difficulty in changing their expectations after experiences that disconfirm
      expectations. Recently, the investigators have shown that this persistence of expectations is
      due to maladaptive information processing involving &quot;cognitive immunization&quot;, defined as a
      cognitive reappraisal of expectation-disconfirming experiences in such a way that the
      individual's expectations are maintained. In view of psychotherapeutic interventions aiming
      to modify patients' dysfunctional expectations, effective strategies to inhibit cognitive
      immunization strategies need to be identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to
      compare different immunization-inhibiting strategies with regard to their effectivity in
      enhancing expectation change. For this purpose, the investigators use a standardized
      experimental paradigm, which was developed and validated in a previous study.

    <description>Participants in this condition receive a manipulation suggesting that the performance test &quot;TEMINT&quot;, they previously worked on, has been shown to be highly relevant for daily life and professional success. We anticipated that after receiving this fake information about the TEMINT, it would be difficult for participants to engage in cognitive immunization processes because the validity and utility of the expectation-disconfirming experience is explicitly highlighted.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>SALIENCE</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in this condition are asked to think about how well they performed on this really difficult performance test. We anticipated that this manipulation would enhance expectation change, as the salience of the expectation-disconfirming experience was explicitly increased.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Before working on the performance test, participants in this conditions receive the instruction to attentionally focus on their personal result in the performance test. Further, they are asked to specify what would be personally good result for them. We anticipated that after receiving this instruction, the expectation-disconfirming performance feedback should be salient for the participants, hence making it difficult for them to engage in cognitive immunization strategies.</description>

    <description>After receiving expectation-disconfirming positive performance feedback, partcipants in this condition are instructed to remember how well they performed on the performance test.

    <description>Before working on the performance test, participants are instructed to pay attention to the feedback they receive.
