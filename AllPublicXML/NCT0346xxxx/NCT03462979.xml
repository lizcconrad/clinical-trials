  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate how knowledge of gluten immunogenic peptide (GIP) levels in
      stool and urine affects subsequent adherence to a gluten-free diet. Half of the participants
      will receive results in real-time using a home device and the other half will store samples
      to be tested at the end of the 30 week study. Participants will also have a diet review with
      a dietitian at the beginning of the end of their study and be asked questions about their
      symptoms, gluten-free diet adherence and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following a gluten-free diet is difficult. Eating small amounts of gluten may be common.
      Gluten may cause a wide range of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. Thus, there is not always a
      'feedback loop' to alert to accidental gluten exposure. Nevertheless, these &quot;silent&quot; gluten
      exposures may interfere with recovery and healing of the intestine. New tools are available
      to test for fragments of gluten - Gluten Immunogenic Peptides (GIPs) in urine and stool.

      The goal of this research study is to evaluate how knowledge of gluten-immunogenic peptide
      (GIP) levels in urine and stool affects subsequent adherence to a gluten-free diet.
      Participants will be children with celiac disease recruited at Boston Children's Hospital.
      All participants will undergo a diet assessment by a dietitian at the beginning and end of
      the study. At random intervals, participants will be prompted to collect their next urine and
      stool and complete a survey related to symptoms and diet adherence. Half of the participants
      will store the sample to be tested later and the rest of the participants will be provided
      with devices to test their urine and stool at home to receive immediate results. GIP test
      results will be compared to other measures of celiac disease and gluten-free diet adherence,
      including antibody tests. These findings will help to determine how these new tools can be
      used to improve gluten-free diet adherence and symptoms and the effect on quality of life.

    <description>Participants in the open results arm will be provided with Gluten Detective home testing kits (immunochromatographic lateral flow tests) at week 5 of the study for immediate qualitative (yes/no) feedback about the presence of biomarkers of gluten in their stool and/or urine. During the period from week 5 to week 30, participants will be contacted a total of 6 times at random intervals to collect and test urine and stool samples and complete a questionnaire. During this time participants will also keep a diary of suspected gluten exposures. All samples collected will be returned during the week 30 study visit.</description>

During the period from week 5 to week 30 of the study, participants will be contacted a total of 6 times at random intervals, instructed to collect stool and urine samples, and complete a questionnaire. Participants will also keep a diary of suspected gluten exposures. All samples collected will be returned during the week 30 study visit.

    <description>The immunochromatographic lateral flow test (Gluten Detective) is an at-home test that detects gluten immunogenic peptides excreted in stool or urine. This test can detect gluten exposures which occurred either during the last 24 hours (urine) or within up to a 7 day window (stool). Minimum intake amounts of gluten for successful detection using these test are 50mg (stool) to 500mg (urine)</description>
