      Purpose: The purpose of the study is to explore the efficacy of H1 deep TMS for the treatment
      of FMS.

      Design: Prospective randomized sham controlled trial Study Population &amp; sample size:forty
      (40) FMS subjects between 18-80 years of age.

      No. of Centers: Four centers-

        1. Shalvata Mental Health Center, Tel -Aviv University, Israel.

        2. Soraski medical center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.

        3. Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel

        4. Beer-Yakov Mental Health Center, Tel-Aviv University, Israel. Duration and intensity of
           Treatment: All subjects will receive prefrontal deep rTMS of H1 Coil (75 trains of 2
           seconds, 20 Hz, with 20 seconds inter-train intervals, up to 120% of motor threshold, a
           total of 3000 pulses per session), for 4 weeks, 5 days a week, overall 20 sessions.

      Name of device: The Brainsway Ltd. H1-Coil

      Study Endpoints: Clinical outcome:

      primary outcome Change in self-reported average pain intensity over the last 24 hours will be
      measured at the end point with the numerical scale (0 = no pain, 10 = maximal pain
      imaginable) of the VAS-FIQ.

      secondary outcome

        1. Change of sensory and affective pain dimensions will be measured at the end point using
           the McGill Pain Questionnaire.

        2. Change of the impact of pain and FMS on quality of life, will be measured at the end
           point using the BPI items for pain interference.

        3. change of sensitivity to painful stimuli will be evaluated by physical measurements:

             -  WPI

             -  SSS

        4. Changes in cognitive functions in domains of attention, working memory, spatial memory,
           executive functions and social cognition will be measured at the beginning and end point
           of the study using the Penn Web-Based Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (WebCNP).
