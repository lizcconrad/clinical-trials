  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In healthy individuals, many postural musculoskeletal problems arise due to various reasons.
      The cervical region is the region where these problems are most common. The cervical region
      ranks second in the general population after the lumbal area of musculoskeletal system
      disorders and affects close to 70% of the general population.The most important causes of
      this posture disorder are; muscular performance and strength are inadequate, as well as
      decreased proprioception of the muscles, deterioration of the individual balance systems that
      result in individual visual or vestibular problems.

      Exercise therapy is at the forefront of these methods, while a variety of methods are applied
      in the prevention and treatment of neck problems. Recent studies have focused on multifaceted
      treatments including exercises to improve strength, endurance and coordination of cervical
      muscles, proprioceptive training, relaxation exercises to prevent muscle tension,
      stabilization exercises and behavior modification. Cervical stabilization exercises are a
      frequently used exercise approach. Cervical stabilization exercises, which are different from
      ordinary exercises, are based on biomechanics, neurophysiology and physiotherapy research.
      The main objective of this method is; improve body awareness, maintain posture uniformity,
      improve strength, endurance, coordination and proprioception. Stabilization exercises also
      increase the strength and endurance of the postural and stabilizer muscles, improving
      stability control in the stabilized and non-stabilized positions.

      Another method that contributes to the development of balance and proprioceptive sense is
      vibration application. Proprioception plays an important role in ensuring the coordination of
      movements. When the proprioception input is disturbed, both the position sense and the speed
      of movement may be affected. Muscle-tendon vibration is a noninvasive method that is often
      used in proprioception studies. It has been suggested that the vibration application are the
      enhancing effect of the proprioceptive. However, there is not enough research on this
      subject.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the cervical stabilization exercises to be
      applied to the cervical region and the local vibration applied to the neck muscles are
      related to muscle performance, proprioception and balance and their superiority with each
      other.

    <description>The sensory organization test. The sensory organization test (SOT) was developed to describe the contribution levels of the three basic systems of balance (visual, vestibular, somatosensory) to the general equilibrium. SOT was used to assess changes in visual, vestibular, and somatosensory balance of individuals at eighth week.</description>
