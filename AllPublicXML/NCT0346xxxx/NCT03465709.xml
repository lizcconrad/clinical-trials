        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age greater than or equal to 60 years.

          2. Normal Luminance best corrected visual acuity (NL-BCVA) of 24 letters or better using
             Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) charts (20/320 Snellen equivalent).

          3. Clinical diagnosis of neovascular AMD with the following criteria met:

               1. Eligible for an injection of an anti-VEGF injection with macular fluid present at
                  Day -28.

               2. Must have been treated with anti-VEGF in study eye for at least 6 months prior to
                  joining the study.

               3. At least 6 months of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy at intervals not greater than
                  8 weeks (± 7 days) for the past 2 injections in the eye that is selected to be
                  the study eye.

          4. A clinically meaningful (50%) reduction in excess macular fluid or macular thickness
             in the study eye at the discretion of the investigator between Screening Day -28 and
             Screening Day -14 as assessed by SD-OCT.

          5. Female subjects must be:

               1. Women of non-child-bearing potential (WONCBP), or

               2. Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) with a negative pregnancy test at
                  screening and must agree to use protocol defined methods of contraception for the
                  duration of the study and refrain from breastfeeding for the duration of the
                  study.

          6. Males with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use protocol
             defined methods of contraception and agree to refrain from donating sperm for the
             duration of the study.

          7. Willing and able to give informed consent and to comply with the study procedures and
             assessments

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of other causes of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) including pathologic
             myopia (spherical equivalent ≥ -6 diopters), central serous chorioretinopathy, ocular
             histoplasmosis syndrome, angioid streaks, choroidal rupture, and multifocal
             choroiditis.

          2. History of vitrectomy to the study eye

          3. Presence of any ophthalmologic condition that reduces the clarity of the media and
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, interferes with ophthalmologic examination
             (e.g. advanced cataract or corneal abnormalities).

          4. Intraocular surgery (including lens replacement surgery) within 3 months prior to
             randomization.

          5. Any history of endophthalmitis.

          6. Trabeculectomy or aqueous shunt or valve in the study eye.

          7. Aphakia or absence of the posterior capsule. Note: previous violation of the posterior
             capsule is also excluded unless it occurred as a result of yttrium aluminum garnet
             (YAG) laser posterior capsulotomy in association with prior posterior chamber
             intraocular lens implantation and at least 60 days prior to baseline.

          8. Any ophthalmic condition that may require surgery or medical intervention during the
             study period or, in the opinion of the Investigator, could compromise visual function
             during the study period (e.g. severe uncontrolled glaucoma, clinically significant
             diabetic macular edema, ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal vasculopathies).

          9. Any contraindication to IVT injection including current ocular or periocular
             infection.

         10. Current treatment for active systemic or localized infection.

         11. Participation in any systemic experimental treatment or any other systemic
             investigational new drug within 6 weeks or 5 half-lives of the active (whichever is
             longer) prior to the start of study treatment. Note: clinical trials solely involving
             observation, over-the-counter vitamins, supplements, or diets are not exclusionary

         12. Medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, make
             consistent follow-up over the 24- month treatment period unlikely, or would make the
             subject an unsafe study candidate.

         13. Any baseline laboratory value (hematology, serum chemistry or urinalysis) that in the
             opinion of the Investigator is clinically significant and not suitable for study
             participation.

         14. Known hypersensitivity to fluorescein sodium for injection or hypersensitivity to
             APL-2 or any of the excipients in APL-2 solution
