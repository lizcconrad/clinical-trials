      This study evaluates the safety and tolerability of 3 dose levels of ABL-101 and supplemental
      oxygen in acute stroke patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Only a small proportion of patients are currently suitable for treatment with &quot;clot busting&quot;
      drugs after a stroke. Being able to visualise potentially rescuable brain tissue on scanning
      may allow more people to be treated. Currently available methods require extra time to
      acquire and are not therefore widely used. By carrying significant extra oxygen to the brain,
      the ABL-101 molecule may not only allow the visualisation of salvageable tissue, but also
      prevent progression of stroke damage in and have an additional direct benefit on tissue
      survival. Studies in animal models of stroke show smaller areas of stroke damage after
      ABL-101. There is therefore a rationale for testing this molecule in stroke patients, both as
      a diagnostic method, and also as a potential therapeutic agent.

    <description>Patients will receive either ABL-101 or placebo (equivalent volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride) within ascending dose groups of 6 patients each (4 to ABL-101, 2 to placebo).The starting cohort will be Cohort 1: 0.5mL/kg.
In the event that the start dose of Cohort 1 is considered intolerable in the opinion of the iDMC based on incidence of patients experiencing dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the iDMC will have the option of recommending a lower dose cohort (Cohort -1) of 0.25ml/kg (to a maximum of 25ml) be undertaken.
Cohort 1: 0.5 mL/kg to a maximum of 50ml; Cohort 2: 1.5mL/kg to a maximum of 150ml; Cohort 3: 3.0mL/kg to a maximum of 300ml.
All patients will receive Oxygen 60% by face mask (8l/min) for approximately 24h after ABL-101 or placebo administration.</description>
