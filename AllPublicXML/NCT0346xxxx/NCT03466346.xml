      Despite carrying the vast majority of the global mental disorder burden, 75% of adults with
      mental disorders in Low and Middle Income Countries have no access to services. This study
      will test strategies for integrating evidence-based depression treatments with primary care
      services at a large public sector hospital and conduct robust cost and cost-benefit analyses
      of each treatment to produce a &quot;menu&quot; of cost-benefit options for integrated depression care
      with corresponding effectiveness and implementation values. The project is relevant to the
      mission of the National Institutes of Mental Health because it addresses mental health care
      delivery and related health economics at the individual, clinical and systems levels.

    <textblock>
      Dominated by depression, mental disorders are a leading cause of global disability. Most of
      the disease burden is in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where 75% of adults with
      mental disorders have no service access. Despite nearly 15 years of efficacy studies showing
      that local non-specialists can provide evidence-based care for depression in LMICs, few
      studies have advanced to implementation research. As emphasized by a recent World Health
      Organization (WHO) initiative, integration of depression treatment into existing systems of
      care is critical to achieving public health impact.

      The research team has worked in western Kenya for 5 years with a UCSF-Kenya collaboration
      that supports integrated HIV services at over 70 primary healthcare facilities in Kisumu
      County (Family AIDS Care and Education Services [FACES]). With high prevalence of Major
      Depressive Disorder (MDD) in Kenyan primary care populations (26.3%, 3-5 times higher than in
      the U.S.), treatment for depression is a top concern for Kenyan mental health leaders. Kenyan
      leaders recently launched a government-funded initiative to scale-up treatment for mental
      disorders in primary healthcare, prioritizing depression. Yet, they lack an evidence base for
      the two essential treatments -psychotherapy and second generation antidepressantsâ€”without
      which Kenyan care scale-up will fall short of its potential. The proposed research responds
      to this need.

      The investigators will partner with local and national mental health stakeholders in Kenya to
      evaluate: (1) non-specialist delivery of evidence-based depression treatment integrated
      within existing healthcare centers in regards to clinical effectiveness and implementation
      parameters; including (2) costs and cost-benefit ratios for depression care. Given that
      evidence-based psychotherapy and second-generation antidepressants are the two leading
      first-line treatments for depression and are feasible to deliver in Kenya, the investigators'
      goal is to test an implementation strategy for improving equitable access to these treatments
      by integrating them with primary care. The study uses an effectiveness-implementation hybrid
      design type I to assess outcomes of non-specialist delivered Interpersonal Psychotherapy
      (IPT) compared to fluoxetine, including assessment of the service delivery mechanism.

      The study's approach differs from most prior work in the field because it uses an
      effectiveness-implementation design, compares outcomes for IPT versus second generation
      antidepressant, integrates depression treatment into primary care, and analyses depression
      care costs and cost-benefit ratios for each treatment arm. The results of the proposed
      research will be significant in two ways: (1) they will produce a scalable strategy for
      delivering depression treatments in sub-Saharan Africa using non-specialists integrated
      within existing primary care structures and (2) they will produce a policy maker &quot;menu&quot; of
      short and long-term cost-benefit options for integrated depression care with corresponding
      effectiveness and implementation values.

    <description>IPT was developed in the 1980s by Gerald Klerman and Myrna Weissman to address interpersonal issues in depression. IPT is now considered evidence-based, first-line treatment for depression. IPT improves symptoms by addressing problems in social relationships. IPT is traditionally delivered as weekly one-hour sessions over 12 weeks, focused on one interpersonal problem area.</description>

    <description>Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor that is FDA approved for the treatment of depression. Compared to placebo, fluoxetine is more likely to produce symptom response for MDD. Despite the interim development of many other antidepressants since the development of fluoxetine, it remains a first line treatment for depression.</description>

    <ipd_description>NIMH Data Archive The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NIMH have developed a federation of data repositories called the NIMH Data Archive (NDA) to store the collection of data from participants in research studies related to mental health, regardless of the source of funding. The extensive information collected by these studies, and subsequently stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR), the NIH Pediatric MRI Repository (PedsMRI), the National Database for Clinical Trials Related to Mental Illness (NDCT), and the Research Domain Criteria Database (RDoCdb) provides a rare and valuable scientific resource. The NIH and the NIMH seek to encourage the use of these resources to achieve rapid scientific progress. In order to take full advantage of such resources and maximize their research value, it is important that data be made available, on appropriate terms and conditions, to the largest possible number of qualified investigators in a timely manner.</ipd_description>
