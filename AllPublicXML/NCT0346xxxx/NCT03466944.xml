  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot cancer imaging study investigating change in the apparent diffusion
      coefficient (ADC) at a single time point post-transplantation in patients. The treatment is
      bone marrow transplant as per standard patient care, without change for trial purposes.

      Its main aim is to evaluate the engraftment of bone marrow after transplantation performing
      functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine and pelvis at baseline and
      after 2-3 weeks after the transplantation (according to the appearances of raised white blood
      cells).This will enhance the understanding of bone marrow features on imaging at engraftment
      and improve the management of children/young adults who suffer acute leukaemia.

      Following allogenic haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, changes in bone marrow apparent
      diffusion coefficient (ADC) are measurable at the point of engraftment and in conjunction
      with peripheral blood counts may provide a future biomarker of successful clinical outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center pilot study. The investigators intend to image 12 inpatients, aged
      5-24 years old who are scheduled for haemopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Patients will have two MRI scans requiring them to lie in the scanner for approximately 15
      minutes. Patients unable to tolerate lying flat for this length of time or to tolerate the
      scan for any reason will be withdrawn from the study. If required a play specialist can be
      organised to help the young patients feel more at ease in the MRI department. MRI does not
      involve radiation exposure and when performed within national safety guidelines do not pose a
      significant risk. Patients with contraindications to MRI such as pacemakers, certain metal
      implants and claustrophobia will not be recruited. Every effort will be made to book scan
      appointments to coincide with clinic visits.

      Scans will be reported as per clinical procedures and data will be made available to the
      referring consultants immediately via the radiology picture archiving and communications
      system (PACS).
