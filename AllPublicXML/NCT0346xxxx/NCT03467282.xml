  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive accumulation of
      lipids in hepatocytes, not associated with alcohol consumption and ranges from hepatic
      steatosis to steatohepatitis, a form that can progress to cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma, and
      is considered a liver manifestation of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). The disease occurs in
      16 - 30% of the general population, but can reach up to 90% of obese individuals. Changes in
      lifestyle, including weight loss and physical activity are indicated with first choices for
      improvement of the liver condition.

      Recently the relationship between obesity, diabetes, MetS and NAFLD with intestinal
      microbiota has also been suggested in the development and progression of liver disease, since
      it is related to hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In this sense, this work aims to
      evaluate the effects of probiotic supplementation on intestinal microbiota modulation, degree
      of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, inflammation and body composition.

      In this randomized clinical trial (RCT) will include adult outpatients linked to the
      Gastroenterology Service of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (Hospital of Clinics of
      Porto Alegre-HCPA) -Brazil with diagnosis of NAFLD confirmed by biopsy and transient
      elastography. Patients who are cirrhotic, pregnant, co-infected or who have Chronic Kidney
      Disease will not be included. All patients, after signing the Written Informed Consent Form,
      will undergo a complete anamnesis to investigate alcohol consumption (AUDIT, Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test), smoking, previous history, medications in use, food
      consumption assessment (through a 3-day food record), physical activity level and physical
      and functional capacity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, sit-to-stand test,
      unipodal, walk test and dynamometry), body composition (Electrical bioimpedance, dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), anthropometric measurements), cardiovascular risk (Framingham
      Score and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease - ASCVD), biochemical parameters for
      assessment of inflammatory status [C-reactive protein (CRP), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)],
      lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides), hepatic function [cytokeratin-18
      (CK18), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase], as well as blood glucose
      level , insulin, albumin, creatinine and complete blood count and even assessment of gut
      microbiota (patients will be provided with a kit for collecting feces and from the extraction
      of DNA from stool samples, after which a metagenomic analysis will be performed). These
      procedures will be performed at baseline and repeated after 24 weeks (at the end of the
      study). Through the of process of randomization (randomization.com), the patients will be
      allocated to receive treatment A or B. As for patients and researchers involved both are
      blinded (double-blind study). The intervention consists of treatment with probiotic mix
      (Lactobacillus acidophilus 1x109 colony-forming unit (CFU) + Bifidobacterium lactis 1x109 CFU
      + Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1x109 CFU + Lactobacillus paracasei 1x109 CFU) and the placebo
      identical in characteristics and packaging (polydextrose). Patients will be instructed to
      consume 2 sachets/day during 24 weeks. Patients will be instructed to report any symptoms or
      para effects related to the use of sachets and adherence control will be carried out through
      the patient's notes on a form provided and also by checking the number of sachets.
