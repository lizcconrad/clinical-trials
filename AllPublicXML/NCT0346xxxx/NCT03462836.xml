  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, pain control methods based on narcotic analgesics have been used to control
      severe pain after surgery, but this has resulted in side effects such as vomiting,
      constipation, dizziness, mental confusion due to drugs, and respiratory depression. This
      slowed the recovery of the patient after surgery and increased the duration of
      hospitalization, which had a negative impact on the patient 's prognosis. In addition,
      research has been conducted on the use of various painkillers in a variety of ways over the
      past decade to reduce the dose of narcotic analgesics and to increase the effectiveness of
      pain control, since studies of anesthetics and narcotic analgesics have shown
      immunosuppressive effects.

      This study investigate the effect of multimodal analgesics for postoperative pain control on
      immune function amd prognosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal cancer
      resection.
