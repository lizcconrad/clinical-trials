  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proximal humerus fractures are more common in older people. They can be caused by a minor
      trauma on an osteoporotic bone.

      Non- or little-displaced proximal humerus fractures are treated orthopedically. When the
      displacement is more important, the choice of the treatment is crucial and the algorithm of
      treatment is in permanent evolution. The technology and design of the implants and the
      operative techniques of osteosynthesis and arthroplasty have evolved. Patients live longer,
      they lead a more active life and their expectations have changed. The goals of the treatment
      should be an increase in shoulder function and a decrease in treatment failure.

      This study analyzes the results of the treatment by intramedullary osteosynthesis using a
      Multiloc nail from Synthes between 2012 and June 2017. The study will compare the functional
      results obtained after fixation by a Multiloc nail, a Philos plate or arthroplasty.The
      functionality of the shoulder and the quality of life will be evaluated according to the type
      of treatment.

    <description>The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire is a 30-item questionnaire that looks at the ability of a patient to perform certain upper extremity activities. The score is computed according to this formula: ([(sum of n responses)/n] -1)(25) where n represents the number of completed items. A higher scores indicate a greater level of disability and severity, whereas, lower scores indicate a lower level of disability.The score ranges from 0 (no disability) to 100 (most severe disability).</description>

    <measure>Constant score</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant-Murley score (CMS) is a 100-points scale composed of a number of individual parameters. These parameters define the level of pain and the ability to carry out the normal daily activities of the patient. The Constant-Murley score was introduced to determine the functionality after the treatment of a shoulder injury. The test is divided into four subscales: pain (15 points), activities of daily living (20 points), strength (25 points) and range of motion: forward elevation, external rotation, abduction and internal rotation of the shoulder (40 points). The higher the score, the higher the quality of the function.</description>

    <measure>QoL 36</measure>
    <time_frame>one year</time_frame>
    <description>The QoL 36 quality of life questionnaire consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.</description>
