  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preprocedural, preoperative, and prevascular access anxiety in pediatric patients has been
      previously shown to increase the likelihood of family stressors, agitation, sleep
      disturbances, and negative behavioral changes. The purpose of this study is to determine if a
      non-invasive distracting device (Virtual Reality (VR) headset, Augmented Reality (AR)
      headset, or bed mounted Video Projection unit (i.e. BERT, Bedside EnterRtainment Theater)) is
      more effective than the standard of care (i.e., no technology based distraction) for
      preventing anxiety before non-invasive surgical sub-specialty procedures among children
      during out-patient clinic visits. Examples of the most common procedures include, but are not
      limited to gastrostomy tube exchanges, suture removals, dressing changes, foley insertions,
      EEG set up, chest tube removals, cast removals, pin removals and other similar procedures.
      (The investigators refer to these procedures under an umbrella term of non-invasive surgical
      subspecialty procedures). The anticipated primary outcome will be reduction of child's
      anxiety during and after procedures.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anxiety among children undergoing non-invasive surgical subspecialty procedures is common.
      Not only is high anxiety traumatic, but research in a surgical setting indicates that high
      anxiety in children before surgery leads to adverse outcomes such as increased pain and
      analgesics requirements, delayed hospital discharge and maladaptive behavioral changes.
      Treating anxiety may decrease any of these undesirable behaviors that may arise when
      experiencing a non-invasive surgical subspecialty procedure in a clinical setting.

      In this study, investigators hope to determine if technology based distractions (VR headsets
      with headphones, AR headset, or BERT projector) are more effective than standard care for
      preventing high anxiety before non-invasive surgical subspecialty procedures. As a secondary
      objective of the study, the investigators seek to determine if the use of technology based
      distraction will result in higher parent and patient satisfaction as well as evaluate which
      techniques are most effective. As a tertiary aim, the investigators seek to understand if
      passive or active interventions are more effective in decreasing anxiety.

    <description>Peak Pain Score minus Baseline Pain Score. Pain scores range from 0 to 10. 0 represents no pain and 10 represents the worst pain possible. Change in pain score ranges from +10 to -10. Higher positive values represent a worse outcome, and higher negative values represent a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Brief Behavioral Distress Scale (BBDS). Measures patient cooperation. Behavior cooperation choices exist on a scale consisting of non-interfering behaviors, potentially-interfering behaviors and interfering behaviors. Non-Interfering Behaviors = minor, verbal/vocal distress, moan, comfort seeking, etc. Potentially Interfering Behaviors = intense verbal/vocal distress, scream, shout, tensing of muscles, clench, flinch, gritting of teeth, etc.Interfering Behaviors = escape, disrupt, avoid, aggress, etc. Interfering behaviors represent a worse outcome.</description>
