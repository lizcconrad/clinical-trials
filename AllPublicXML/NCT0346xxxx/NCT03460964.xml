  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial will explore the accuracy and acceptability of a non-invasive,
      wearable glucose sensor in patients living with DM. This study will compare needleless
      glucose sensor readings from sweat with glucometer measurements from patients with any type
      of diabetes at fasting, and after a meal.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an unmet need for a non-invasive glucose monitoring device. UCSD nanoengineers
      developed a flexible, ultra-thin sensor adherent to the skin, similar to a temporary tattoo.
      Sweat glucose correlates with blood glucose. This proposed study would be the first to
      examine this needle-free glucose sensor to measure glucose in endogenous sweat in individuals
      with DM, and would serve as the basis for future development of a continuous, non-invasive
      sensor. The investigators hypothesize that compared with a glucometer, a tattoo sensor can
      accurately measure sweat glucose in patients with DM.

Glucose will be measured with both an adhesive (needle-free) glucose sensor and a glucometer, at fasting, and time points ranging from 15 to 200 minutes after consuming a standardized meal. There are no other interventions.</description>
