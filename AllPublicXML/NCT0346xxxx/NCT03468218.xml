  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab and cabozantinib in treating patients with
      head and neck squamous cell cancer that has come back or spread to other places in the body
      and cannot be removed by surgery. Monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may interfere
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor
      cells by blocking some of the pathways needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and
      cabozantinib may improve the chances of tumor response in patients with head and neck
      squamous cell cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with recurrent/metastatic (RM)
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who receive the combination of
      pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with the combination
           of pembrolizumab and cabozantinib.

        -  To identify potential biomarkers related to response to the combination of pembrolizumab
           and cabozantinib in patients with RM SCCHN.

        -  To evaluate whether markers of angiogenesis, Met or pMet expression, or inflammatory
           activation can predict response to the combination or PFS.

        -  To gather exploratory clinical data on a potentially predictive set of biomarkers
           (potential biomarkers include MET expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization
           [FISH], next generation sequencing [NGS] and immunohistochemistry
           [IHC]/immunofluorescence [IHF] of MET proto-oncogene (cMET), phosphorylated cMET (pMET),
           hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), human
           epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) and heregulin messenger ribonucleic acid
           [mRNA] level).

        -  To further define the toxicities associated with these regimens in patients with SCCHN.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and cabozantinib
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 2 years.

             pregnant (ie, females who have had any evidence of menses in the past 12 months, with
             the exception of those who had prior hysterectomy); however, women who have been
             amenorrheic for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential
             if the amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, low body
