  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single-blind, parallel group clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FS Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during
      surgery in pediatric subjects.

      Pediatric subjects (&lt;18 years of age) requiring an elective (non-emergent), open
      (non-laparoscopic), pelvic, abdominal, or thoracic (non-cardiac) surgical procedure, wherein
      a target bleeding site (TBS) is identified, and a topical hemostatic agent is indicated, will
      be eligible to participate in the clinical trial.

      The study treatments will be applied on the cut parenchymous surface of a solid organ (ie,
      liver) and in soft tissue (ie, fat, muscle, or connective tissue).

      This is a prospective, randomized, active-controlled, single-blind, parallel group clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FS Grifols as an adjunct to hemostasis during
      surgery. Approximately 172 pediatric subjects will be enrolled and will be randomly allocated
      in a 1:1 ratio into 1 of 2 treatment groups: FS Grifols or EVICEL. Enrollment will be
      monitored by surgery type to ensure at least 50% of the surgical procedures are hepatic.

      A specific bleeding site will be defined as the TBS when it is determined by the investigator
      (the surgeon) that control of bleeding by conventional surgical techniques (including suture,
      ligature, and cautery) is ineffective or impractical and requires an adjunct treatment to
      achieve hemostasis.

      When the TBS is identified, the investigator will record the precise anatomical location of
      the TBS, rate the intensity of the bleeding at the TBS (Grade 1-4 according to a 5-point
      validated bleeding severity scale), and record the size of the approximate bleeding surface,
      (small, medium, and large). For soft tissue surgery only, the investigator will also record
      the type of soft tissue (ie, fat, muscle, or connective tissue). In this clinical trial, only
      subjects with a TBS with bleeding of Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) intensity will be
      enrolled.

      This study includes a Screening Visit to determine subject eligibility, a Baseline Visit, the
      Surgical Procedure (Day 1), and Post-operative assessments at Days 1, 4, and 30. The total
      duration of a subject's participation in this study is expected to be no longer than 2 months
      from the Screening Visit to the Post-operative Day 30 Visit.

             to participate in the clinical trial and provide written informed consent for the
             subject. In addition, assent must be obtained from pediatric subjects who possess the
             intellectual and emotional ability to comprehend the concepts involved in the clinical

             tissue TBS identified intra-operatively by the investigator (the surgeon).

          5. TBS has Grade 1 (mild) or Grade 2 (moderate) bleeding intensity according to the
             investigator's (the surgeon's) judgment. The intensity of the bleeding at the TBS will
             be rated by the investigator using the 5-point validated bleeding severity scale.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Pre-operative:

          1. Admitted for trauma surgery.

          2. Unwilling to receive blood products.

          4. Known history of intolerance to any of the components of the investigational product
             (IP).

          5. Female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding or, if of child-bearing potential (ie,
             adolescent), unwilling to practice a highly effective method of contraception.

          6. Previously enrolled in a clinical trial with FS Grifols.

          7. Currently participating, or during the study is planned to participate, in any other
             investigational device or medicinal product study without prior and explicit approval
             from the sponsor.

             Intra-operative:

          8. An appropriate parenchymous or soft tissue TBS (as defined in exclusion criteria 9 and
             10) cannot be identified intra-operatively by the investigator (the surgeon).

          9. TBS has Grade 3 (severe) bleeding according to the investigator's (the surgeon's)
             judgment that cannot be controlled with conventional surgical techniques to Grade 1 or
             Grade 2 bleeding. The intensity of the bleeding at the TBS will be rated by the
             investigator using the 5-point validated bleeding severity scale.

         10. TBS is in an actively infected surgical field.

         11. Occurrence of major intra-operative complications that require resuscitation or
             deviation from the planned surgical procedure.

         12. Application of any topical hemostatic agent on the resection surface of parenchyma or
             soft tissue prior to application of the IP.
