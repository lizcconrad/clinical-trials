  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial was to establish the clinical efficacy of Listerine and chlorhexidine
      (CHX) when used as a cooling agent with ultrasonic instrumentation, on periodontal parameters
      and halitosis.

      Ninety patients with periodontal disease participated for the study. Individuals were
      randomly selected to a control and test groups. At baseline, all subjects completed a
      questionnaire and carried out an examination. Standard periodontal outcome variables were
      assessed. For both groups, the plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), pocket depth (PD),
      bleeding on probing (BOP) and clinical attachment level (CAL) scores were enrolled at
      baseline and after 30 days. Volatile sulphur compound (VSC) levels were evaluated by a
      Halimeter (Interscan Corp., Chatsworth, CA, USA) at baseline (T0), immediately after
      treatment (T1), and at 7 (T2), 14 (T3) and 30 days (T4).
