  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing Mohs micrographic surgery frequently experience anxiety. It has been
      suggested that enhanced patient education prior to the procedure may decrease patient
      anxiety. The purpose of the study is to investigate if optimized patient education enhances
      patient understanding, decreases patient anxiety and increases patient satisfaction.

      1. To investigate if patient education with a 3 dimensional printed (3DP) Mohs micrographic
           surgery (MMS) model and standardized script protocol increases patient understanding of
           MMS more than current standard of care (control group) at the University Hospitals
           Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.

        2. To investigate if patient education with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script
           protocol decreases perioperative patient anxiety during MMS more than current standard
           of care (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS
           Clinics.

        3. To evaluate if patient satisfaction with a 3DP MMS model and standardized script
           protocol increases patient satisfaction during MMS more than current standard of care
           (control group) at the University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center MMS Clinics.

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be recruited from University Hospitals Department of Dermatology Mohs Micrographic Surgery Clinics at the Cleveland Medical Center, Chagrin Highlands and Westlake Locations. These patients will be randomly assigned to a control (50%) or experimental group (50%) prior to the onset of the study protocol.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mohs Quiz</measure>
    <time_frame>Post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>This is a short, questionnaire with 6 objective questions related to the patient's understanding of Mohs.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI is a well-known, frequently used measure of patient anxiety within the clinical setting. This form consists of two forms to assess state anxiety and a patient's baseline trait anxiety. Each form consists of 20 Likert-type questions, that can be easily answered by a patient with an average reading level. Estimated time for completion of these questions is approximately 2 minutes per form. This form has been used in 2 studies to date that assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Anxiety Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a frequently employed Likert-type scale that is used to measure anxiety. This 0-10 scale documents the patients current state of anxiety and can be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used in 2 studies to date and previously by experimental team to assess intraoperative anxiety in Mohs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) Understanding Score</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a frequently employed Likert-type scale that because of the ease of use this tool has been converted to assess other objective measures including understanding. This 0-10 scale documents the patients current state of understanding and can be answered by patients with an average reading level. Estimated time of completion is under 30 seconds. This form has been used by experimental team to assess intraoperative understanding in Mohs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satisfaction Survey Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Post surgery (1 day)</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be provided 3 subjective questions related to their satisfaction with the explanation of MMS that they received.</description>
