      The purpose of this study is evaluate goal-directed therapy with continuous central venous
      saturation compared to standard therapy in children undergoing cardiac surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk for adverse clinical outcomes due a
      inadequate tissue perfusion. Recent studies have been demonstraded which the monitorization
      of continuos central venous saturation could be benneficial. There is evidence that
      monitoring continues venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) can be beneficial in patient outcomes,
      guided by ScvO2 therapy has been associated with improved outcomes in resuscitation of
      critically ill patients with sepsis and after congenital heart surgery complexa. The early
      detection and treatment of tissue hypoxia can prevent morbidity and mortality. tissue hypoxia
      may be a result of the imbalance between supply (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2). If the
      fault supply, oxygen consumption is maintained by increased oxygen extraction resulting in
      decreased central venous oxygen saturation

    <description>Central venous oxygen saturation will be targeted higher than 65% in non-cyanogenic patients and 55% in cyanogenic.
First, isotonic crystalloid, 10 up to 20 mL/kg, will be administered in boluses to achieve continuous central venous oxygen saturation higher than 65% in non-cyanogenic and 55% in cyanogenic.
Second, if not achieved with fluid administration, will be targeted by initiating and titrating inotropics (dobutamine or milrinone). If the mean arterial pressure is lower than 50 mm Hg will be associated epinephrine.
If the ScvO2 is lower than 65% in non-cyanogenic and 55% in cyanogenic and the hemoglobin was lower than 8g/dl, red blood cells (20mL/Kg) will be transfused to achieve a hemoglobin level of at least 8g/dL.</description>
