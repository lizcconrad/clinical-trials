  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays obesity is emerging as a very common health problem. It has been shown in various
      studies that obesity may be an important risk factor for the onset and progression of knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). The aim of this study is to determine the effects of bariatric surgery
      on knee pain, loss of function, quality of life and central sensitization.

      Weight loss in patients with knee OA reduces pain and provides functional improvement. It has
      been shown that bariatric surgery combined with diet and exercise changes have positive
      effects on weight loss, knee pain and function.

      Neuropathic pain is a disease that affects the somatosensory system or pain that results in a
      lesion. It has been reported that neuropathic pain is more frequently seen in patients with
      high body mass index.

      The hyperreactivity of the central nervous system (CNS) plays an important role in the
      chronic pain of OA patients. It has been shown that CNS becomes hypersensitive in people with
      chronic OA pain and central sensitization phenomenon plays an important role in pain
      complaints reported by these patients.

      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on knee pain, loss of
      function, quality of life and central sensitization.

    <description>It is commonly used to measure the severity of the patients' pain. It consists of a line 10 cm. long and marked with numbers from 0 to 10. The patient is asked to mark the point corresponding to the severity of the pain on this line in the range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (most severe pain).</description>
