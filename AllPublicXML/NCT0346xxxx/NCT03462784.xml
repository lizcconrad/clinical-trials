  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, there are more than 60,000 births annually of serious forms of thalassemia .The
      World Health Organization considers thalassemia to be a major health burden.

      Beta- thalassemia is a group of recessively inherited disorders of hemoglobin synthesis
      characterized by reduced synthesis of the ß-globin chain caused by a mutation. The homozygous
      state results in severe anemia which needs regular blood transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thalassemia is the most common monogenic disorder in the world .Thalassemia major
      (beta-thalassemia) affects a significant segment of the population in certain areas of the
      world. Alterations in migration patterns have changed the geographic distribution of this
      disease and made it a worldwide health problem with a high frequency in Africa, India,
      Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean area.

      The combination of transfusion and chelation therapy has dramatically extended the life
      expectancy of these patients, thus transforming thalassemia from a rapidly fatal disease of
      childhood to a chronic illness compatible with a prolonged life. On the other hand, frequent
      blood transfusions leading to iron overload and the chronic nature of the disease have
      contributed to a whole new spectrum of complications in adolescents and young adults
      suffering from thalassemia major.

      Complications associated with beta thalassemia, aside from the aforementioned anemia, are as
      follows

        -  Extramedullary hematopoiesis

        -  Asplenia secondary to splenectomy

        -  Medical complications from long-term transfusional therapy - Iron overload and
           transfusion-associated infections (eg, hepatitis) Increased risk for infections
           resulting from asplenia (eg, encapsulated organisms such as pneumococcus) or from iron
           overload (eg, Yersinia species))

        -  Cholelithiasis (eg, bilirubin stones) Study of the prevelance and risk fators
           responsible for thalassemia complication can help in adopting appropriating strategies
           for management of these complication.

Historical data included information regarding immunizations, infection exposures, surgical procedures, organ dysfunction (Organ dysfunction was defined as a history of requiring medical treatment for heart disease, diabetes (Type 1 or 2), hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, or gonadal failure) age at transfusion initiation, chelation therapy, type of RBC product, transfusion reactions, and antigen matching. Data will be collected from chart review, patient interviews, blood banking records, and laboratory testing. All these data will be collected to know the type of complication and measure the prevelance of these complication</description>
