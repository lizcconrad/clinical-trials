  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) belongs to the group of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is
      characterized by a chronic relapsing disease course. As uncontrolled intestinal inflammation
      can lead to severe disease complications, treatment of UC has evolved from sole treatment of
      symptoms up to histological remission which is marked by the absence of histological
      inflammation. To correctly assess and quantify the degree of histological inflammation in IBD
      patients remains difficult.

      Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is a new imaging technique belonging to quantitative
      phase contrast imaging. It is based on the detection of optical path-length delays in a
      stain-free manner, thereby providing a refractive index which directly correlates to tissue
      density.

      This study aims to evaluate the role of DHM for quantifying the degree of histological
      inflammation in endoscopically acquired biopsies of UC patients in a prospective clinical
      trial. From 28 UC patients, the investigators will obtain endoscopically acquired colonic
      biopsies. The investigators will assess the degree of inflammation in these biopsies using
      DHM and in addition to this an experienced histopathologist will determine the degree of
      inflammation in these biopsies using a histological scoring system (Nancy-Score =
      goldstandard). Finally, the investigators will directly correlate the results from DHM
      analysis to the histological analysis using the Nancy-Score.
