  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Split-body/face evaluator-blind study of the safety and performance of fractional RF for the
      treatment of surgical scars following breast augmentation, abdominoplasty or face lift. The
      study will enroll up to 50 female subjects requesting treatment of surgical scars following
      breast augmentation or abdominoplasty and up to 25 male and female subjects requesting
      treatment of surgical scars following face lift surgery. Subjects will receive a total of
      three treatments of their surgical scars at one-month intervals on one side of the body or
      face only. Subjects will be followed up at one, two, three and ten months after their last
      treatment. Outcomes will be compared to the non-treated side.

      Blinded evaluators to determine the efficacy of the study treatment by comparing baseline
      photographs with photographs taken at follow up months 3, 4, 5 and 12 using the Global
      Aesthetic Improvement scale (GAIS), Manchester Scar Scale (MSS) and Patient and Observer Scar
      assessment scale (POSAS).

      Study subjects will also complete a Patient and Observer Scar assessment scale (POSAS) and
      5-Point Likert Satisfaction Scale at baseline and at follow-up month 5 and 12, indicating
      their satisfaction with the study treatment.
