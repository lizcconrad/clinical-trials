  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Backround: No data on the adjunctive effects of hyaluronic acid (HA) in a post-surgery,
      chlorhexidine (CHX) - based plaque control regimen are available. Also, contrasting evidence
      is available regarding the efficacy of CHX-based formulations containing anti-discoloration
      system (ADS). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the post-surgery gingival healing
      as well as plaque, gingival inflammation, and staining levels following the use of a 0.2%
      chlorhexidine (CHX) solution with or without anti-discoloration system (ADS) and 0.2%
      hyaluronic acid (HA).

      Methods: Patients undergoing flap surgery at sites with an intact or reduced but healthy
      periodontium participated in a parallel-arm RCT. After surgery, patients used the assigned
      mouthrinse (CHX+HA+ADS or CHX) for 21 days. At day 7 and 21, the Gingival Healing Index (GHI)
      was used to assess the quality of flap closure at the interdental papilla. Plaque index
      (PlI), Gingival Index (GI), Angulated bleeding score (AngBS), tooth and tongue staining were
      also assessed.

    <time_frame>GHI was evaluated at 7 days following surgery.</time_frame>
    <description>The healing process was evaluated at experimental teeth using a composite index, namely the Gingival Healing Index (GHI), which was created specifically to assess the post-surgery conditions of the interdental papilla. Briefly, the interdental papillae of experimental teeth were visually inspected, and a score was assigned for the severity of wound dehiscence (1-3) and the profile of the buccal and oral aspects of the papilla (1-3). For each patient, GHI score was obtained as the sum of the scores of each variable. Therefore, GHI ranged from 2 (worst quality of healing) to 6 (optimal quality of healing).</description>
