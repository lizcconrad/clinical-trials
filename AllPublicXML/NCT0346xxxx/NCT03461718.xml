  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will be investigating the use of ketamine in sedation for endoscopic procedures,
      specifically outpatient endoscopy including esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy.
      Participants will be randomized to one of two arms including conventional moderate sedation
      with midazolam and fentanyl or the ketamine arm. They will then undergo the planned
      procedure. Physicians preforming the procedure will be surveyed following the procedure and
      patients will be surveyed twice, once after meeting criteria for discharge on day of the
      procedure and a second time 48 hours following the procedure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators plan to conduct a single blinded randomized controlled trial
      in the Gastroenterology Service to demonstrate the efficacy of ketamine and its utility in
      moderate sedation. Patients presenting to the endoscopy lab for esophagogastroduodenoscopy
      (EGD) and/or colonoscopy who meet inclusion criteria will be approached, and if amenable,
      will be consented and enrolled. Patients will be randomized to receive either a ketamine
      loading dose and then subsequent doses IV ketamine and midazolam 1mg IV prior to
      administration of ketamine or standard fentanyl/midazolam moderate sedation during their
      procedure. Participants will then undergo the planned procedure. The primary outcome will be
      patient satisfaction, which will be measured using the validated &quot;Patient Satisfaction with
      Sedation&quot; instrument (PSSI). A number of secondary outcomes will include the following: (1)
      provider satisfaction (measured using and the &quot;Clinician Satisfaction with Sedation&quot;
      instrument (CSSI), (2) the time from sedation administration to procedure start (when the
      scope is inserted), (3) the time from sedation to recovery (defined as the time from the end
      of the procedure until the patient meets discharge criteria from the recovery area), (4) time
      to cecum (for colonoscopy) total doses of medications given (midazolam, fentanyl, and
      ketamine), (5) overall time of the procedure, (6) adverse events, (7) changes in vital signs,
      (8) and the need for additional medications, in particular reversal agents.

    <description>Measured with PSSI score. This consists of a questionnaire administered to the provider following the procedure with questions detailing different aspects of the procedure. Answers will be summed and the scores are normalized to a scale of 0-100 (high scores denote higher satisfaction). Criteria for discharge are at least 30 minutes elapsed since the last dose of sedative medication was administered, presence of protective reflexes (swallow and gag), stable vital signs, patient passes trial of ambulation (if was ambulating prior to procedure, a responsible adult is present to drive patient home and remain with the patient the length of two half-lives of the medications administered for sedation, and there are no staff concerns about safety. After the patient meets discharge criteria, a survey will be preformed. It will also be repeated once at the 48 hour post-procedure time. Conclusion of the two surveys concludes patient participation in the study.</description>
