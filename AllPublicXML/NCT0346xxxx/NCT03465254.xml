      This is an observational study for 5 years, and aims to determine the risk of developing
      dengue among Philippine children who are eligible to receive the dengue vaccine during the
      DOH mass dengue vaccination, by dengue serostatus at baseline.

      This is a cohort study that aims to determine the relative risk of developing
      virologically-confirmed dengue among Philippine children who are eligible to receive dengue
      vaccine during the DOH Mass Dengue Vaccination. Additionally, it also aims to determine the
      relative risk of developing severe and/or hospitalized virologically-confirmed dengue among
      Philippine children who received the Dengue vaccine, describe the epidemiologic trends and
      characteristics of virologically-confirmed dengue among these children, and assess the
      performance of simpler tests such as dried blood spots and serum IgG for the assessment of
      dengue seroprevalence at the population level. We will enroll children who are residents of
      selected areas in Region 7, Philippines. Children should be eligible to participate in the
      Department of Health mass dengue vaccination. They will be prospectively venipunctured for
      baseline dengue serologic status. The blood samples will be stored for serologic testing
      using neutralization tests and commercial IgG tests. Children in the cohort will be followed
      up, and those who present with &lt;5 days of fever will be identified and blood drawn for dengue
      LAMP and RT-PCR.

      Any leftover sera will be used for future studies and stored at UPM-NIH for fifteen (15)
      years after the end of this study. Future studies using the sera will undergo appropriate
      ethical reviews as required. After this period, specimens will be destroyed according to
      local guidelines. Additional consent will be obtained from the parent for storage and future
      use of these samples. Only the Principal Investigator and designated study personnel will
      have access to these specimens.
