  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether Echinacea angustifolia (AnxioCalm) is a safe and effective
      treatment for mild to moderate Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) symptoms. Half the
      participants will receive Echinacea angustifolia and half will receive placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Echinacea angustifolia root extract (AnxioCalm), standardized for the content of echinacoside
      and its alkamide profile, is intended to be used for 'amelioration of sub-threshold and mild
      anxiety which are risk factors in the development of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and
      depression' in symptomatic people 'who are not eligible for anxiolytic medication.' Existing
      medical interventions, which require long periods of repeated administration, have
      significant safety concerns.

    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a physician rating scale consisting of 14 items measuring psychic and somatic anxiety. Each item is scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (severe) where a total score of 14-17 = Mild Anxiety, 18-24 = Moderate Anxiety, 25-30 = Severe Anxiety. The primary outcome is the change over time in the baseline HAM-A score rating for AnxioCalm versus placebo.</description>

    <measure>State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y, 6 item) is a six item patient rating scale consisting of anxiety present and anxiety absent items. Each item is rated from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). For scoring, positive items (calm, relaxed, content) are reverse scored [1=4, 2=3, 3=2, 4=1], the six scores are totaled, and multiplied by 20/6. A normal score is approximately 34-36.The primary outcome is the change over time in the baseline STAI score for AnxioCalm versus placebo.</description>
