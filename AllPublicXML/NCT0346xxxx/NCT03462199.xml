  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low and High doses of Actazin and Livaux will be compared against a control formula and
      placebo to evaluate how each investigational study product effects complete spontaneous bowel
      movements in healthy adults that currently experience less than or equal to 3 complete
      spontaneous bowel movements per week. During the 28-day study period, it is hypothesized that
      participants consuming Acatzin, Livaux, or control formula will have an increased number of
      complete spontaneous bowel movements when compared to participants consuming the placebo. It
      is hypothesized that participants consuming Actazin or Livaux will respond more than
      participants consuming the control formula. It is hypothesized that participants consuming
      Actazin or Livaux will have a favorable microbiome change than placebo.
