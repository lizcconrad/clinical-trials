      Data collection and observation of changes within AMD patients performing visual training on
      mobile devices

      In the presented study a training-therapy in patients with dry AMD war evaluated. The main
      focus was on remote visibility and thus better handling of daily activities.

      Therapy with high-contrast administration is used for amblyopia in childhood. Furthermore,
      simulation therapy is used in hemianopsia in the adult age, in which case the lesion is
      usually not located in the eye.

      This stimulating therapy for children and adult patients led to the hypothesis that this
      treatment could also improve AMD's situation. The entire visual procedure also shows the
      possibility of change even in adult patients.

      The presented study investigates if regular training with a device that provides a moving
      grating-stimulus, the &quot;Medical Eye Trainer&quot; (MET), can improve the subjective perception of
      visual performance during typical activities of daily living. The aims of the study were not
      to show improvement of reading vision nor to show changes in the retinal structure.

    <description>In order to provide a high contrast, dynamic visual stimulus to the patients, we developed an app that allowed the patients to regularly train with this stimulus. The app runs on Android (version 4.2 or later). The display of the screen is divided into 4 rows. In each row, a pattern of black and white squares is moving in one direction. The directions in subsequent rows are opposite to each other. Through the movement in the opposite direction a changing pattern is achieved in vertical and horizontal extension, the pattern alternates between continuous beams and a checkered pattern. The speed of the display on the monitor is 2 cm per second. In a comfortable viewing distance (ca. 40 cm), this leads to an angular velocity of approximately 3°/sec.</description>

        In the study, 11 patients were included. In five of those, both eyes were affected by AMD;
        in the six other patients, only one eye was affected. The age of the patients was 72 ± 14.7
        years (mean ± standard deviation, range 44 - 86 years). Eight eyes had received a lutein
        therapy for more than 2 years, according to the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS)
        study. In two eyes an anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor ) therapy had been
        performed before (3.5 and 4 years ago, respecitvely); and in one eye a photodynamic therapy
        (PDT) had been performed 9 years ago. All eyes had been affected by dry AMD for 3.5 years
        or more. The visual acuity had been unchanged for at least a year in all patients. None of
        the patients reported any previous occurrence of epilepsy.
