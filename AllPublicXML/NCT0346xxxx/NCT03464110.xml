  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a clinician communication coaching
      intervention versus control on an objective measure of the quality of communication (primary
      outcome) and patients' perceptions of the quality of patient-centered care (secondary
      outcome), both overall and within Black and White patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a two-arm cluster randomized controlled design, in which the unit
      of randomization is the clinician. Up to fifty cardiology clinicians will be randomly
      assigned to either the coaching intervention or to a control condition. The investigators
      will recruit up to 50 clinicians to ensure that we have at least 40 clinicians with complete
      pre- and post-intervention measures. Although the unit of randomization is the clinician, the
      unit of evaluation is the patient: 4 patients per clinician who get cardiology care from the
      enrolled clinicians will consent to audio-recording of their encounters and to completing the
      surveys. The intervention will be delivered in the clinic or via video-conference (Skype or
      Facetime), providing individual coaching and professional feedback on the communication
      behaviors encounters. The investigators will also measure Press Ganey scores by clinician
      pre- and post-intervention.

    <description>The intervention will contain elements of Motivational Interviewing coaching but also will teach providers how to address patient emotion and increase the efficiency of their visits. Clinicians randomized to the intervention will receive a tailored communication coaching intervention that includes didactic elements, audio recording encounters and providing feedback, and role-playing.</description>
