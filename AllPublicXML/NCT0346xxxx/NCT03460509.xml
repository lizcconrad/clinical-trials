  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) are among the most commonly used drugs during general
      anesthesia and may induce complete muscle paralysis.They are used clinically to facilitate
      endotracheal intubation and to optimize surgical working conditions. Incomplete recovery from
      non-depolarising NMBAs continues to be a common problem in modern postoperative care unit and
      is associated with significant risk of microaspiration and hypoventilation which leads to
      pulmonary complications.Recently effective reversal of neuromuscular blockade has been
      described by use of lower dose of sugammadex the recommended without providing adequate
      answer to whether the lower dose is safe enough to avoid recurrent block.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Administration of sugammadex 0.25 mg/kg at TOF ratio 0.3 will successfully reverse
           (TOF=1.0) rocuronium induced neuromuscular block within 10 min.

        2. Recurrent block (TOF ratio &lt; 1.0) does not occur after reversal with low dose sugammadex
           0.25 mg/kg.

      Aim of the study:

        1. By inclusion of sufficient number of study object verify previous studies by Pongracz et
           al, Schaller et al and Kaufhold et al 32-34 which indicated that optimal reversal with
           low dose with sugammadex is possible within 10 min from time point of TOF ratio 0.3.

        2. To find the number of study participants where TOF ratio decreases after reaching a
           maximum value (TOF ratio 1.0) post administration of low-dose sugammadex (recurrent
           block).

        3. Find the fraction of study participants within each sugammadex dose group associated
           with successful reversal of neuromuscular block from 0.3 to 1.0 within10 min. after drug
           administration. From these data make a compilation of doses and the effects in a diagram
           showing the correlation between doses and response within a defined time after study
           drug administration.

        4. Find the number of patients with adverse reactions as described in secondary outcomes

      Sugammadex is a very expensive drug which limits its use i anaesthesia department. By
      optimising drug dosage it may have economic impact and contribute to a wider use of
      sugammadex to reverse neuromuscular block before extubation and thus avoid incomplete
      recovery. This may lead to less risk for postoperative pulmonary complications and thereby
      reduce morbidity and mortality after surgery.

      Doses of study drug will be 0 mg/kg Ideal Body Weight (IBW), 0.25 mg/kg IBW, 0.50 mg/kg IBW,
      1.0 mg/kg IBW and 2.0 mg/kg IBW. TOF will be measured every 10th second until full reversal.

    <description>Fraction of study participants within each sugammadex dose group associated with successful reversal of neuromuscular block (i.e. reversal of Train of four- ratio (TOF-ratio) from 0.3 to 1.0 within10 min. after drug administration). TOF is a measurement of muscle strength measured by an accelerometer. From these data we will calculate the dose needed to restore neuromuscular function (TOF ratio 1.0) with an upper limit of 10 min for 95 % of patients.</description>
