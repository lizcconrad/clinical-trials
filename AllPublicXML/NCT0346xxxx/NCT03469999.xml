  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of single event multi level chemoneurolysis with the
      abobotulinumtoxinA drug, Dysport®, on walking energy expenditure and gait in children with
      spastic diplegia Cerebral Palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the leading cause of disability in children, with the most widespread
      type of CP being spastic CP which negatively affects physical function. Specifically it is
      reported that there is an increase in energy expenditure and oxygen consumption in children
      with CP. Single event multi level chemoneurolysis with abobotulinumtoxinA has been found to
      be an effective treatment for patients with spasticity to reduce energy expenditure by
      increasing walking efficiency; however many of these studies have conflicting methodological
      approaches. Therefore this study aims to evaluate the single event multilevel chemoneurolysis
      with Dysport® on energy expenditure and gait in children with spastic diplegia CP.

    <measure>Change in Muscle Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 week prior to injection), 4 weeks post injection, 12 weeks post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) measures muscle spasticity during passive stretching. Scores include 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, and 4. A score of 0 indicates no increase in muscle tone/muscle spasticity and a score of 4 indicates a rigid muscle or maximum spasticity. A lower score after injection would indicate an improvement in muscle spasticity. The MAS will be performed in the hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles.</description>

    <measure>Change in Muscle Spasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (1 week prior to injection), 4 weeks post injection, 12 weeks post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Tardieu Scale measures muscle spasticity during a passive stretch at both slow and fast speeds. First measure determines the maximum range of motion of a target muscle group in degrees. The second measure determines the angle where muscle resistance is felt during a rapid velocity stretch, recorded in degrees. The total score is calculated by subtracting measure one from measure two. A greater difference between measures indicates less muscle spasticity. The Modified Tardieu Scale will be performed in the hamstrings, gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (1 week prior to injection), 4 weeks post injection, 12 weeks post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatrics Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) consists of 23 questions ranging from 0-4 with a higher score indicating a higher quality of life. The total score will be calculated as well as the four subscales: physical (8 items), emotional (5 items), social (5 items), and school functioning (5 items). After injection, a higher total score as well as in each subscale indicated an increase in quality of life.</description>
