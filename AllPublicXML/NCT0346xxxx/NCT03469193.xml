  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty by unicompartmental prosthesis (PUC) is a treatment for
      isolated internal femoro-tibial osteoarthritis. This intervention is justified in cases of
      significant discomfort, failure of medical treatment and the absence of osteoarthritis in
      femoro tibial external and patellofemoral femoro compartments. It aims to replace the native
      internal femoral tibial articulation by a joint between two implants, without intervening on
      the other compartments. The functional results of PUC are superior and faster than those
      obtained with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Its indications and its realization are on the
      other hand very demanding to allow an optimal functional result.

      Robotic-assisted surgery provides an excellent level of precision, which could allow better
      positioning of implants, compared to the use of a mechanical ancillary, according to the
      first published studies. The functional results and survival of these implants could also be
      improved.

      The internal PUC with mechanical ancillary is carried out for many years in the orthopedic
      surgery department of Croix Rousse. For 3 years this surgery is sometimes performed with
      robotic assistance.

      We would like to prospectively evaluate the clinical and radiological impact of
      robotic-assisted surgery when performing a Journey unicompartmental prosthesis (Smith &amp;
      Nephew).

      The assessment of alignment during walking seems to be a paramount parameter in the results
      of the PUC and has not so far been evaluated in this type of robotic-assisted surgery.

    <description>The control group consists of patients operated with a mechanical ancillary (reference surgery in our department). In this technique, bone sections are made with a standardized ancillary (manually adjusted bone cutting guides), according to preoperative radiological planning. The positioning of the implants is done manually and controlled by the placement of test implants.</description>

    <intervention_name>Internal PUC implanted with robotic assistance</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients are operated by robotics (surgery that we want to develop systematically in our service). 3D modeling of the knee allows the operator to perform a dynamic planning taking into account the reducibility of the deformation and the model of the implant. The operator can position the implants in three dimensions of the space without difficulty. This makes it possible to visualize, before the bone resections, the angular correction obtained between 0 and 130° flexion and alignment of the prosthesis by visualizing the contact points between the two implants. Bone resections will be performed using a guided retro bone drill. The system retracts more or less the cutter according to the bone thickness to be removed. This technique requires the insertion of two threaded plugs in the tibia and two in the femur to position the sensors that will allow the acquisition of anatomical landmarks of the lower limb and then 3D modeling</description>
