  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on the existing research results, Osimertinibi is effective not only for patients with
      sensitizing EGFR mutations, but also for other less common EGFR mutations. However, no
      studies have been done so far regarding the difference in efficacy of various EGFR mutation
      subtypes. Meanwhile, the presenting studies data of the safety and efficacy of Osimertinib as
      first-line therapy for NSCLC is very limited. Therefore, this study aims at assessing the
      safety and efficacy of Osimertinib as First-line therapy for patients with EGFR
      mutation-positive locally advanced or Metastatic Non-squamous NSCLC as well as the its
      difference in efficacy of various EGFR mutation subtypes.
