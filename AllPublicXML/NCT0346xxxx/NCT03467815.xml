  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients admitted to the medical ward, it is usually difficult to predict if their
      clinical condition will deteriorate, however subtle changes in vital signs are usually
      present 8 to 24 hours before a life-threatening event such as respiratory failure leading to
      ICU admission, or unanticipated cardiac arrest. Such adverse trends in clinical observations
      can be missed, misinterpreted or not appreciated as urgent. New continuous and wearable 24/7
      clinical vital parameter monitoring systems offer a unique possibility to identify clinical
      deterioration before patients progress beyond the point-of-no-return, where adverse events
      are inevitable. The WARD-COPD project aims to determine the number and duration of
      cardiopulmonary micro events during the first 4 days after hospital admission with Acute
      Exacerbation of COPD. We will also test the server installation, develop a database of core
      data and assess the frequency of artefacts and failure to capture the continuous monitoring
      signal.
