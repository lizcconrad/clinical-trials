  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double blinded, vehicle and active comparator controlled, multiple
      dose study in subjects with chronic plaque psoriasis. The study will have approximately 15
      completers. Each subjects will receive three different topical doses of PF 06763809, PF
      06763809 vehicle, and two active comparators. These will be applied to six different
      treatment fields for 18 days. The total duration of participation in the study will be
      approximately 7 weeks (minimum) to approximately 11 weeks (maximum), including the interval
      from Screening to the Follow up phone call visit.
