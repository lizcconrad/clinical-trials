      The aim of this Real-world study in China is evaluating the Safety and Efficacy of Paclitaxel
      Eluting Balloon Catheter in Coronary de-novo lesions(target vessel
      diameter:2.5mm-4.0mm)Treatment. And the primary point of this study is the target lesion
      failure of 12 months after surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18-78 years of age, male or non-pregnant female;

          2. patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic myocardial ischemia, stable or unstable
             angina pectoris, myocardial infarction with a course of more than two weeks, and
             patients with indications for percutaneous coronary intervention;

          3. the target lesions were primary, in situ coronary artery stenosis, located on one or
             two different coronary artery vessels, the number of target lesions on each coronary
             artery was not more than one;

          4. the length of the target lesion ≤ 26mm (visual), which can be covered by a single drug
             balloon (it is suggested that the balloon should cover at least 4mm healthy partition,
             2 mm at each end; The reference diameter of target vessel was 2.5mm-4.0mm (visual);

          5. the stenosis degree of the target lesion was ≥ 70%;

          6. left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 45.

          7. patients who can understand the purpose of the trial, voluntarily participate and sign
             informed consent, and are willing to follow up the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke within half a year;

          4. patients with a life expectancy less than one year or with difficulties in clinical
             follow-up;

          5. patients who had a history of PTCA or had other operations scheduled during the
             follow-up period of one year;

          6. patients who are participating in any other clinical study and who have not reached
             the main end point of the study;

             creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg / dl( 176.8 umol / L) or undergoing hemodialysis therapy.
             Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of angiography;

          8. patients with left ventricular ejection fraction below 45%;

          9. for other reasons, the researchers did not think it was appropriate for a patient to
             be selected.

        Related to lesions:

          1. left main lesion and the bifurcation with side branch &gt;2.5 mm;

             right coronary artery.

          3. severe calcification and twisted lesions which can not be successfully predilated, are
             not suitable for drug balloon delivery and expansion.

          4. lesion length ≥ 26 mm;

          5. evidence of severe thrombosis in target vessels before intervention;

          6. lesions that cannot be treated with PTCA or other interventional techniques;

          7. after predilation of the target lesion, residual stenosis ≥ 30% or TIMI blood flow &lt;
