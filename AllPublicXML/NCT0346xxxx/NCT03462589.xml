    <description>The study will be initiated in healthy subjects at a 2-mg dose that is expected to have minimal pharmacologic effect. Doses will be escalated in subsequent dosing process, after appropriate review of safety data. The subsequent planned doses are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30mg successively. The increment of the dose escalation may be reduced, a lower dose may be administered following data review.</description>
