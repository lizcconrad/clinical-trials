  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive deficits have been shown to have negative impact on social functioning and
      functional goals such as ability to work and perform daily tasks in people with
      schizophrenia. There is evidence that Cognitive Remediation Therapy, a form of psychological
      therapy, is effective in improving cognition and functioning but there is still a limited
      understanding of what influence people's different response to this therapy. A tailored
      treatment is likely to be more effective because it will adapt to service users' unique
      characteristics.

      The investigators are planning a study exploring at the feasibility and acceptability of
      novel form of Cognitive Remediation Therapy which is personalised (pCRT) to the person
      individual characteristics. The personalised therapy will consist of task practice using
      computerized Cognitive Remediation software (i.e. called CIRCuiTS). The knowledge gathered in
      this work will contribute to develop the next generation of personalised treatment approaches
      for people with schizophrenia.

      Cognitive deficits in people with psychosis have been shown to have negative impact on
      functional goals including the ability to work and perform daily tasks. Cognitive Remediation
      Therapy (CRT) is a psychological therapy developed to improve cognitive functions in people
      with schizophrenia but ultimately with a focus on improving social and functional outcomes.
      There is evidence that CRT is effective in improving cognition and functioning but there is
      still a limited understanding of the mechanisms responsible for different treatment
      responses. This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and testing a new form of CRT,
      which will personalise therapy elements according to participants' characteristics. The
      therapy will consist of task practice using a computerised Cognitive Remediation software and
      supervised activities supported by a therapist to boost functioning. The knowledge gathered
      in this work will contribute to develop the next generation of personalised treatment
      approaches for people with schizophrenia.
