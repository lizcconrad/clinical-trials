  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, few studies have assessed the efficacy and safety of Cannabinoids, compounds derived
      from the Cannabis plant, in patients with Crohn's disease. Our study seeks to pilot a
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of oral cannabinoids
      as an adjunct therapy in patients with Crohn's disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory disease which can affect any portion of the
      gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the perianal area. Symptoms depend on location of
      the disease, however, many patients experience some aspect of recurrent abdominal pain,
      nausea, emesis, and unintentional weight loss. A common and challenging dilemma is how to
      manage patients who continue to have some degree of symptoms despite a common treatment
      regimen typically consisting of corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti-TNF alpha
      therapies. With the recent wave of medicinal cannabis legalization in many states, many
      patients have begun using cannabis or commercially available cannabidiol-containing compounds
      as an adjunct therapy for their symptoms related to chronic inflammation and pain.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CDAI (Clinical Disease Activity Index) score</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A statistically significant decrease in CDAI score. The short CDAI score will be utilized for this study. This validated score consists of three subjective, patient-derived measures: (1) number of liquid or soft stools each day for 7 days (2) the sum of seven daily abdominal pain ratings (3) the sum of seven general well-being ratings. The calculation of CDAI score will be as follows: Short CDAI = 44 + (2 × the number of liquid or soft stools each day for 7 days) + [5 × the sum of seven daily abdominal pain ratings (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe)] + [7 × the sum of seven general well-being ratings (0 = generally well, 1 = slightly under par, 2 = poor, 3 = very poor, 4 = terrible). Outcome measures considered to be consistent with benefit from intervention includes either (1) disease remission (CDAI less than 150) or (2) CDAI score reduction of 60 points.</description>
