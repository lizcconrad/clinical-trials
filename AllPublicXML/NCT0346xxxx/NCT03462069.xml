      Primary Objective:

      To compare the metabolic and gastrointestinal pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of an 8 weeks
      treatment with sotagliflozin once daily (QD) to an 8 weeks treatment to empagliflozin QD in
      mild or moderate hypertensive T2DM patients on a stable treatment regimen with metformin and
      an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (ARB) under
      standardized diet conditions.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare the renal and cardiovascular PD effects of an 8 weeks treatment with
           sotagliflozin QD to an 8 weeks treatment to empagliflozin QD in mild or moderate
           hypertensive T2DM patients on a stable treatment regimen with metformin and an ACE
           inhibitor or ARB.

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of an 8 weeks QD treatment with sotagliflozin or
           empagliflozin in mild to moderate hypertensive T2DM patients on a stable treatment with
           metformin and an ACE inhibitor or ARB.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of sotagliflozin in steady state
           conditions.

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus.

          -  Secondary hypertension of any etiology (eg, renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma,
             Cushing's syndrome).

          -  Clinically significant pulmonary hypertension, in particular World Health Organisation
             (WHO) Classes IV (Pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic
             disease [CTEPH]) and V (miscellaneous).

          -  Diabetic retinopathy.

          -  History of diabetic ketoacidosis or non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma within 12 weeks
             prior to the Screening Visit.

          -  History of severe hypoglycemia resulting in hospitalization or
             unconsciousness/seizures within 6 months prior to the Screening visit.

          -  History of prior gastric or intestinal surgical procedure including gastric banding
             within 3 years before the Screening Visit. Any gastrointestinal surgery with removal
             of part of the bowels or the stomach

          -  History of unexplained pancreatitis, chronic pancreatitis, stomach/gastric surgery,
             inflammatory bowel disease.
