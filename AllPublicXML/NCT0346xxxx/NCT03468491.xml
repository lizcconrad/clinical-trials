  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to investigate the effectiveness of a program combining biomechanical
      taping with lower extremity neuromuscular exercises for runners with patellofemoral pain
      syndrome (PFPS) and hallux valgus
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single-blind, experimental study with two treatment groups. A total of 30
      college athletes with PFPS and hallux valgus and majoring in long distance running or soccer,
      or recreational runners in Taipei metropolitan area will be recruited. A set of clinical
      examination will be conducted to rule out abnormal knee structures, pathologies, or injuries
      apart from PFPS. The lower extremity alignment as well as hip and knee kinematics during a
      step down test will be tracked using Noraxon's myoMOTION system. Muscle activation of the
      muscles controlling the hip and knee movements during the step down test will be recorded
      using TELEmyo DTS of Noraxon. Hallux valgus angle will be measured with surface markers on
      photographs. Knee pain level will be rated in a visual analog scale. The investigators will
      analyze the data with Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) for Windows.
      Repeated-measure ANOVAs will be used to examine group-by-time interaction on all the outcome
      variables. All significance level will be set at 0.05.

Lower extremity neuromuscular exercises: (10-15 times/set, 3 sets/visit) 1.1 Single lunge 1.2 Stepping down 1.3 Vertical squat 1.4 Vertical jumping All exercises will first start on firm surface without additional resistance/weight. Later, settings will be gradually shifted into on firm surface with resisted band from random direction, on a cushion with/ without resisted band, on a BOSU balance trainer. Progression are made every 2 weeks ideally, while adjustments may be taken into concern due to individual differences.</description>
