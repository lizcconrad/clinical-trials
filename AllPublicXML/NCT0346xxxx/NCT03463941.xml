  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore how working with a partner can influence
      participation in a church wellness program. There are many different types of church wellness
      programs. Church members are more likely to participate and achieve goals in these programs
      when they have peer support. The researcher would like to know what African American men and
      women think about working with a support partner. This information will help researchers
      design better church wellness programs. The participants are being asked to take part in this
      research because the investigators believe that it is helpful to share feelings and thoughts
      about experiences working with a partner to achieve health goals. This knowledge will be used
      to create church wellness programs that will help African American men and women prevent
      disease and live healthier lives.

    <description>Recruitment will be calculated from the number of churches who agree to participate divided by the total number who are contacted, and the number of members who consent to join the program divided by the total number of participants who come to the informational meeting. Retention will be calculated from the mean number of sessions participants attended out of the total number of sessions offered in Phase I and Phase II; the number of participants who continue to Phase II out of the number who complete Phase I (&gt;50% attendance), and the attrition rate.</description>

    <description>Phase I: At baseline and at post-intervention, participant height, weight, BMI, fruit and vegetable intake and exercise habits will be measured. Participants will complete surveys and meet each week to learn about nutrition and exercise.
Phase II: Dyads will attend a communication training session to discuss 1) benefits of working with a partner; 2) supportive communication tips; and 3) expected activities for the next 8 weeks, including filling out daily logs. After the training session, the dyads will work together to achieve their health goals. The dyads will return to the church for two check in sessions. At these sessions, participants will turn in their logs, and be weighed. At the end of the intervention, BMI will be reassessed, and surveys and interviews will be completed.</description>
