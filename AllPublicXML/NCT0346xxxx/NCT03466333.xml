  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double blind randomised controlled feasibility study investigating the effect of
      postnatal enalapril on cardiovascular function in women who have had preterm pre-eclampsia.
      Participants will be randomised to 6 months of enalapril or placebo within 3 days of
      delivery. Cardiovascular function will be assessed using serial echocardiography and
      biomarkers.

    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a condition in pregnancy, identified by a combination of high blood
      pressure and protein in the urine. It affects 3-5% pregnancies. Women with preterm PE (pPEÍ¾
      delivery before 37 weeks) frequently develop abnormal heart function after pregnancy, which
      increases their risk of heart disease in later life. Subtle changes in heart function have
      also been shown to increase the chance of a woman getting PE again in her next pregnancy.
      Despite this, research to date has focused on the pregnancy and relatively little is known
      about what happens after pregnancy and whether outcomes can be improved with treatment. sFlt
      is a protein that prevents blood vessel growth and causes blood vessel constriction. sFlt
      levels are raised in pPE and correlate with the degree of abnormal heart function. In animal
      studies, sFlt has been shown to directly cause injury to the heart and it is therefore
      possible that sFlt mediates pPE associated heart damage. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
      inhibitors are commonly used to protect against heart damage following myocardial infarction,
      but their use has never been tested following pPE.

      Objectives:

        1. To characterise abnormal heart function following pPE

        2. To determine if this can be modified by treatment with enalapril.

      Study design:

      Women who have had pPE, will be randomly allocated to enalapril or placebo from delivery for
      6 months. Heart function will be assessed using blood tests and ultrasound scans
      (echocardiography). This will allow us to learn more about how pPE affects the heart (from
      the placebo group) and measure the protective effect of enalapril on the heart. Recruitment
      rates and acceptability of the intervention will also be assessed in this feasibility study.
