      CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE EFFECT OF TOMATO PRODUCTS IN OBESE CHILDREN WITH NON ALCOHOLIC FATTY
      LIVER DISEASE

      Aim of the study To evaluate the effect of the addition of a daily dose of lycopene enriched
      tomato sauce on the progress of NAFDL in obese children.

      Participants Children with obesity referred to the Hepatology unit of Dept.of Pediatric
      Clinic of the University Federico II of Naples. Diagnosis of NAFLD is made on the presence of
      fatty liver at ultrasound examination, with or without hypertransaminasemia.

      Patients are eligible on the basis of:

        -  Age 4-14 years

        -  BMI &gt; 85°percentile

        -  Liver Steatosis evaluated as mild, moderate or severe by US (hyperechogenic liver tissue
           compared with the adjacent kidney cortex)

      Patients are excluded on the basis of:

        -  Liver disease

        -  Diabetes or manifest metabolic alterations

        -  Associated diseases Informed consent is obtained from the parents of the participating
           children. Sample size estimation To provide an 80% power to detect a 25% or greater
           relative shift of outcome variables, with a first degree error of .05 a sample of 50
           cases is estimated in a cross over trial.

      Study design This is a randomized, crossover, one side open trial with blinded outcome
      evaluation. A statistician who is not otherwise involved in the trial generated the
      randomized assignment sequence. At the enrollment all participants received a low carotenoids
      diet for two weeks (wash out), then children are assigned to the first intervention for 8
      weeks, and subsequently, in the crossover phase, they are switched to the second intervention
      for the next 8 weeks. No wash out is planned between the two treatments.

      Interventions

        1. Supplemented diet: 100 gr/day of Lycopene enriched tomato products (weekly average)

        2. Control diet: ordinary healthy diet, with no special encouragement to eat carotenes
           products All children are put on a 'mediterranean style' diet, with a controlled amount
           of calories: a dedicated dietitian for the whole study, irrespective of the treatment,
           checked their diet twice a week.

      At beginning (T0) and at the end of each treatment (T1 and T2) all patients underwent
      anthropomorphic measurements, including weight, height, waist, abdomen and hips
      circumferences. BMI and its standard deviation score are calculated.

      Regardless of group assignment, all participants are seen by a hepatologist at the end of
      each intervention and checked for liver steatosis, by US. Fasting blood samples are collected
      at beginning (T0) and at the end of each treatment (T1 and T2) to evaluate IR (assessed by
      HOMA), transaminases levels, lipids profile, oxidative state (assessed by antioxidant enzymes
      activity, serum levels of MDA and carbonylated proteins), inflammatory state (by cytokines
      serum levels, typing of lymphocytes subpopulations, metabolism of lymphocytes).

      Data collection are performed in a partially blind fashion: the statistician performing data
      analysis is blind to treatment.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is reduction of the liver steatosis estimated by US Scan,
      according to the following parameters: parenchyma echogenicity (compared with that of the
      cortical of the right kidney), far gain attenuation, diaphragm blurring. steatosis.

      Secondary outcomes is reduction in Insulin resistance, Oxidative state, Inflammatory state.

      Statistical Analysis Data are inspected for normality and paired t-test (before/after) of
      each phase of the trial are performed when appropriate. The Median % change of each variable
      between the values at Time 8 and 16 weeks and values at enrollment are also looked. Ordinal
      logistic regression analysis, hierarchical, mixed model with adjustment variables are adopted
      to estimate the size of the effect.

      The study is approved by the Ethical Committee of University Federico II of Naples.

    <description>The presence and severity of liver steatosis are graded by using the following criteria:
2. The presence of hyperechogenic liver tissue (compared with the adjacent kidney cortex) with fine and tightly packed echo targets and of normal beam penetration with normal visualization of diaphragm and portal vein borders is considered as mild steatosis.
3. The moderate and diffuse increase of echo intensity with decreased beam penetration (with slightly decreased visualization of diaphragm) associated with a decrease in visualization of silhouetting of the portal vein borders is considered as moderate steatosis.
4. The marked increase in echoes intensity with no visualization of portal vein border, obscured diaphragm and posterior portion of the right lobe, and reduced visibility of kidney is considered as severe steatosis.</description>
