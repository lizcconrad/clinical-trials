      A pre-post descriptive study was performed to examine the immediate effects of ultrasound
      (US) guided femoral nerve block with phenol (UGFNBwP) in managing lower limb spasticity of
      individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Study Design: A pre-post descriptive study was performed. Objectives: To examine the
      immediate effects of ultrasound (US) guided femoral nerve block with phenol (UGFNBwP) in
      managing lower limb spasticity of individuals with traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).

      Setting: Ankara, Turkey Methods: Nineteen patients with traumatic SCI presenting with lower
      extremity spasticity were treated with UGFNBwP. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) of hip flexion
      and knee extension, functional independence measure (FIM) motor subscale, difficulty of
      catheterization (DoC), hygiene score (HS), spasm frequency (SF), sleep quality (SQ) and
      patient satisfaction (PS) were measured in all patients prior to treatment, at first week and
      second month.
