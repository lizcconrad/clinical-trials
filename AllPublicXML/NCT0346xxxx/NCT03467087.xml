  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive chemotherapy, with or without following autologous or allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation (HSCT), is often the only curative treatment option for patients with
      haematological malignancies, leave many survivors physically and psychologically impaired
      because of side effects, many caused by weeks of immobilisation. Electrical muscle
      stimulation (EMS) is a proven training tool to improve physical performance in seniors and
      patients with chronic disease. The investigators therefore intend to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of EMS in patients undergoing autologous HSCT, allogeneic HSCT and intensive
      chemotherapy. To assess feasibility all patients are asked to document training time during
      hospitalization in an EMS diary.

      Furthermore, physical Performance will be measured using the 6-minute-walking distance (6MWD)
      and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) as well as psychological performance using the
      Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and EORTC QLQ-C30 at the start of chemotherapy (T1)
      and when patients are discharged from hospital (T2).

      At the time intensive chemotherapy is started and all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are
      met, patients will receive an EMS device with electrodes and will be instructed on how to use
      the device. After that, baseline tests using the above mentioned tools will be performed.

      EMS will be conducted with a &quot;Myopuls 2000&quot; (Curatec Services GmbH, Moers, Germany) device
      using 13 cm x 5 cm electrodes. Electrodes are placed subsequently on both thighs and upper
      arms with instructions to stimulate each limb for at least 15 minutes on at least 5 days per
      week. Stimulation settings were as follows: 300 µs pulse width, 60 Hz frequency, 5 seconds
      on, 5 seconds off. The amplitude is initially set to elicit a visible muscle contraction and
      patients are encouraged to increase the amplitude as much as tolerated. After an initial
      training session, patients are to use the devices on their own and document their activities
      in an EMS diary.

      Patients are then asked to use EMS throughout their therapy in addition to physical therapy
      until the day of their discharge when the initially performed tests are repeated.

      The investigators hypothesis is, that EMS can be safely applied in patients undergoing
      intensive chemotherapy regimens and that patients are able to administer EMS by themselfs.

    <description>Patients were told to walk on a 40-meter floor with instructions to cover as much distance as possible in 6 minutes. Patients were allowed to stop and rest as often as necessary. Time was stopped by a technician who was also allowed to encourage participants with standardized phrases during the walk.</description>

    <measure>Physical performance as assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of discharge of every patients, after an average of 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery as developed by Guralnik and colleagues ranges from 0 - 12 points with 0 points indicating the worst possible performance and 12 points as best result. The battery consists of 3 objective tests of lower body function with maximally 4 points to be reached in one test:
A timed walk of 8 feet
The time it takes to rise from a chair 5 times
A standing balance test</description>

    <measure>Psychological performance as assessed by the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of discharge of every patients, after an average of 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) consists of 5 subscales including general, physical and mental fatigue, reduced motivation and reduced activity with 20 items in total (4 items per subscale). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale (1-5) and each subscale ranges from 4 to 20. Patients were asked to fill out the test form before or within 3 days from start of treatment (timepoint 1) and at the day of discharge (timepoint 2). Contrary to physical assessment, high scores in the MFI subscales mean greater fatigue and therefore worse psychological functioning.</description>

    <measure>Psychological performance as assessed by the EORTC QoL 30 questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of discharge of every patients, after an average of 30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QOL-C30 questionnaire contains 30 items that are divided into five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / Quality of Life (QoL) scale, and six single items. Functional scales assess physical function (ability to manage daily life), role function (at work and daily activities), emotional function (tension, anxiety, irritability and depression), social function (family life or social activities) and cognitive function (concentration and memory). Symptom scales ask for fatigue, nausea or pain and single items measure dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial impact. The global health status / QoL scale rates overall health and quality of life. Original data was processed according to the EORTC scoring manual into a 0- to 100-point scale. High scores in functional scales and QoL indicate adequate function and QoL. Patients with high scores on symptom scales and single items show more severe symptoms and impairments.</description>
