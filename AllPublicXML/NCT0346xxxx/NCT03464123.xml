  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is aimed to assess (a) the incidence of hyperoxia at the point of return of
      spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and (b) the role of arterial blood oxygen partial pressure to
      brain oxygenation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 80 adult patients will be recruited
      in a physician staffed helicopter emergency medical services. Brain regional oxygen
      saturation and invasive blood pressure are monitored until hospital admission and arterial
      blood gases are analyzed immediately when the unit arrives to the patient and again at the
      time of ROSC.

        All adult patients met in cardiac arrest by the physician-led prehospital critical care
        team are to be screened and recruited based the eligibility criteria. The patients include
        patients in all primary rhythms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac origin

          -  resuscitation will be continued at least 5 minutes (if return of spontaneous
             circulation not achieved earlier) after arrival of physician team

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) order or withdrawal of treatment by prehospital
             critical care physician

          -  return of spontaneous circulation achieved before physician-led critical team arrives

          -  external cause for cardiac arrest (e.g. trauma, suffocation)

          -  workload too high or environment too dangerous to perform study procedures
