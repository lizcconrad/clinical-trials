  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to this confirmatory pivotal study, the multicenter Br-002 feasibility study was
      completed. 98% of tumors less than or equal to 15mm were completely ablated in one
      procedure.This study will evaluate Novilase for the focal destruction of malignant tumors of
      the breast that are less than or equal to 15 mm against a performance goal for the standard
      of care, lumpectomy. The ASBrS' goal of less than 20% retreatment by 2020 was selected as a
      representative performance goal, i.e., 80.0%, and is consistent with published effectiveness
      rates for lumpectomy.

      Subjects with biopsy-diagnosed malignant breast tumors less than or equal to 15 mm will be
      invited to participate. Subjects will receive a screening MRI and if eligible will then have
      laser ablation, followed by MRI and an excision at 4-6 weeks following the laser procedure.
      This study will be deemed successful if the lower limit of a 95% confidence interval for the
      proportion of patients who have complete tumor ablation with one Novilase laser ablation
      procedure at 4-6 weeks post-procedure is greater than the performance goal. Specifically,
      Novilase will have demonstrated success if the complete tumor ablation rate is greater than
      87.85%.
