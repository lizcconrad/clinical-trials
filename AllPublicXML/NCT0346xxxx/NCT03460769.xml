    <textblock>
      The Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) at MD Anderson Cancer will be responsible
      for the coordination and data management for the Evaluation of a mixed meal test for
      Diagnosis and characterization of Type 3c diabetes mellitus secondary to pancreatic cancer
      and chronic pancreatitis (DETECT), which is part of the NIH U01 funded Consortium for the
      Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). Similar to all
      studies that will be coordinated and managed by the CDMC, no patient enrollment will occur at
      MDACC. All patient recruitment will occur at external sites that are a part of the CPDPC,
      which are listed in the appended DETECT protocol. The data management systems, auditing, and
      monitoring effort are supported by the CDMC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. All patients must sign an informed consent indicating that they are aware of the
        investigational nature of this study. Patients must have signed an authorization for the
        release of their protected health information.

        2 Patients must be ages ≥40 and &lt;85.

        3 Patients must have a diagnosis of one of the following based on study definitions; New
        Onset Diabetes in subjects with Pancreatic Cancer (PDAC); New Onset Diabetes in subjects
        with Chronic Pancreatitis; New Onset Diabetes in subjects without Pancreatic disease (i.e.,
        T2DM) Long standing T2DM without Pancreatic disease Long standing diabetes in subjects with
        PDAC Long standing diabetes subjects with chronic pancreatitis non-diabetic subjects with
        PDAC non-diabetic subjects with chronic pancreatitis non-diabetic controls without
        Pancreatic disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must not have any significant medical illnesses (including diabetes) that in
             the investigator's opinion cannot be adequately controlled with appropriate therapy or
             would compromise the patient's ability to tolerate study interventions. Specifically,
             diabetes must be stable enough to permit holding diabetes medications following the
             criteria below:

             The following oral anti-diabetic agents will be held on the day of the meal tolerance
             test but may resume once test is completed: metformin, sulfonylureas, repaglinide or
             nateglinide, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol), pramlintide,
             colesevelam, bromocriptine Those on low doses of insulin (&lt; 0.5 U/kg/day) will not
             take insulin on the day of study procedures.

             Subjects taking higher doses of insulin (≥0.5 unit/kg/day) will be excluded from this
             study.

             Subjects taking, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, or short acting GLP-1 analogs
             (Byetta [exenatide], Victoza [liraglutide], Adlyxin [lixisenatide]) will be asked not
             to take these medications on the day of the meal tolerance test (they can be taken the
             day before if taken in the morning; for those taking these medications in the
             afternoon or evening, they will be asked to withhold such dosing on the day prior to
             testing).

             Subjects on longer acting agents, including thiazolidinediones and once-weekly GLP-1
             agonists (Bydureon [exenatide], Tanzeum [albiglutide], Trulicity [dulaglutide]) will
             be excluded from the study.

          2. Patients currently receiving oral steroid medications.

          3. Hospitalization for acute pancreatitis within 2 months before study visit

          4. Presence of one or more pancreatic cysts ≥2 cm in size

          5. Any subject with a pancreatic cancer histologic subtype other than adenocarcinoma
             (e.g., subjects with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are excluded).

          6. Previous pancreatic surgery (including total pancreatectomy, pancreaticoduodenectomy,
             distal pancreatectomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, enucleation, or Frey procedure).

          7. Previous treatment for pancreatic cancer, including chemotherapy or radiation.

          8. Previous vagotomy or gastric surgery, including endoscopic gastric reduction
             procedures.

          9. Previous diagnosis of gastroparesis.

         10. Patients on treatment for any cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer or carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix).

         11. Allergy or intolerance to ingredients in Boost drink.
