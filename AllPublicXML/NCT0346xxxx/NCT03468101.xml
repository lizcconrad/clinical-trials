  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the BALISTIC research program is to characterize COPD related to
      organic particles (of which the model is agricultural COPD) in comparison with
      tobacco-related COPD, at the clinical, functional (at rest and exercise), inflammatory and
      physiopathological level.

      The cross-sectional step BALISTIC 1 made it possible to include 400 patients between 2011 and
      2015, and to identify approximately 100 dairy farmers COPD and 100 non-dairy farmers COPD
      (tobacco COPD). Preliminary results, as well as those of an ancillary study that included a
      group of subjects exposed to mineral dust and fumes, suggest that agricultural COPD is a
      predominantly non-emphysematous or essentially bronchial disease with IgE-mediated allergic
      mechanisms.

      The current project BALISTIC 2 proposes to conduct a comparative study at + 6 years on
      average of the two groups of COPD subjects identified in BALISTIC 1 in order to specify the
      phenotype of COPD in dairy farmers by, in particular, the study of the rate of decline of
      resting and exercise respiratory function parameters, its computed tomography presentation
      and its genetic and epigenetic profile.

      The prospects of this work are to improve the management of COPD in any cause by setting up
      preventive and curative therapeutic approaches in order to provide answers to the progression
      of a disease that makes part of the few major public health problems of the 21st century.
