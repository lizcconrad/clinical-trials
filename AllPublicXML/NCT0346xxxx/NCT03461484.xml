  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center observational study to be conducted in up to 30 French
      interventional cardiology centers. The purpose of this observational study is to capture, in
      French Centers, clinical data of the BioMatrix Flex™ and BioMatrix NeoFlex™ Drug Eluting
      Coronary Stents System (Biolimus A9, BA9™-) in normal practice, in patients treated with
      6-month DAPT, and to compare the outcomes to those of previous e-biomatrix registries with
      longer DAPT durations. The patients will be followed up for 2 years for data collection.
