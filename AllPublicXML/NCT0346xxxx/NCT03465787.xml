    <description>The PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) is a 30-item scale (range 30-210) designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>Clinical Global Impression of Severity is a clinician-rated assessment of the subject's current illness state on a 7 point scale, where a higher score is associated with greater illness severity. The scale has a single item measured on a 7 point scale from 1 ('normal', not ill) to 7 (extremely ill).</description>
