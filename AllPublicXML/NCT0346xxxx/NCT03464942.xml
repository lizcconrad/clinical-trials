      This is a multi-centre, open label, phase 2, randomised controlled trial of patients with
      advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received no more than one line of
      chemotherapy (not including neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy) who will be randomised to be
      treated with SABR 20Gy in 1# followed by atezolizumab or SABR 24Gy in 3# followed by
      atezolizumab.
