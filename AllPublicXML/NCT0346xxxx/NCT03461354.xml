  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if the administration of prophylactic MucoLox formulation versus
      sodium bicarbonate mouthwash in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ±
      chemotherapy will result in significantly fewer subjects experiencing severe mucositis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-arm, single-blinded, Phase II randomized study is to
      compare the area under the curve (AUC) for the Oral Mucositis Daily Questionnaire (OMDQ)
      mouth and throat soreness (MTS) question 2 (Q2) score over a one-month period in subjects
      receiving the MucoLox formulation versus sodium bicarbonate rinse (as the control) for the
      prevention of severe mucositis in subjects with head/neck cancer receiving radiation ±
      chemotherapy. Secondary objectives include comparing the time to OMDQ MTS Q2 &gt; 2 between the
      two arms; estimating and comparing opioid use defined as the average morphine equivalent
      daily dose (MEDD) at each clinic visit; assessing and comparing changes in the remaining OMDQ
      questions longitudinally throughout study; evaluating and comparing the duration of symptom
      relief in those who experience any degree of oral mucositis; evaluating and comparing the
      frequency of delays in [chemotherapy and/or radiation] therapy throughout the study period;
      and summarizing and comparing the prevalence and grade of oral mucositis at each clinic
      visit. The safety objective is to summarize the rates of potential side effects related to
      each oral formulation. A total of 60 eligible subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a
      1:1 fashion to one of the treatment arms. Subjects on the control arm (sodium bicarbonate)
      who experience severe mucositis will have the option to crossover to the Mucolox arm for an
      additional 7 ± 2 days or until day 29 ± 5 days, whichever is longer.

             Investigator

          6. Able and willing to provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria

        Subjects must not meet any of the following criteria:

          1. Receiving any other pharmacological treatment within 1 week of initiation of study
             treatment for oral mucositis, excluding analgesics, antibiotics, antifungals, and
             hydration for symptom management. Subjects must also agree to not use any other
             mouthwash formulations to prevent or treat mucositis during the course of the study.

             a. Agents suggested to modify oral mucositis risk or course that are excluded include
             sodium bicarbonate, magic mouthwash formulations, amifostine, benzydamine, cevimeline,
             glutamine rinse, topical GM-CSF, interleukin-11, chlorhexidine, hydrogen peroxide,
             diphenhydramine, palifermin, pilocarpine, steroid rinses, sucralfate, and various oral

             due to oral herpes simplex virus infection.

          3. Signs and symptoms of any mouth and/or throat condition or active dental disease that
             would impair the ability to administer the mouthwash and/or assess the development of
             oral mucositis, as determined by the Investigator.

          4. Presence of baseline grade &gt; 1 mucositis or stomatitis as determined by the treating
             investigator

          6. Known hypersensitivity to any ingredients in the mouthwash formulations that may
             result in anaphylaxis.

          7. Use, or suspicion of use, of illicit drugs or substances (self-reported) that may, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, have a reasonable chance of contributing to
             non-compliance, opioid abuse, drug toxicity, and/or otherwise skewing the trial result
