  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study to investigate the effect of combined bilateral tDCS and VR-based
      therapy on distal upper extremity training in patients with stroke. We hypothesized that
      experimental group (VR-based training with dual-tDCS) would improve distal upper extremity
      function rather than control group (VR-based training with dual sham tDCS).

      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to 1 : 1
      ratio to experimental group (VR-based training with dual-tDCS; VR-Dual) or the control group
      (VR-based training with dual sham tDCS; VR-Sham) . For both conditions, VR-Dual and VR-Sham
      group commenced at the same time (20 minutes). The therapist and patients were blinded as to
      whether the patients received real or sham tDCS. The study was approved by the Ethics
      Committee of the National Rehabilitation Center, Korea, and all participants provided written
      informed consent before enrollment.
