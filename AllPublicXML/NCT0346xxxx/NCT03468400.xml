  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop and test a user-friendly, accessible approach to sleep assessment
      which can function as an initial &quot;triage&quot; of targeted sleep conditions, such as insomnia,
      insufficient sleep syndrome, sleep apnea syndromes/snoring, and circadian sleep/wake
      disorders, within the clinical and community population. Specifically, this study will test
      the validity and reliability of a self-rated, digitized, and cost-effective diagnostic
      measure with sufficient sensitivity to accurately assess/diagnose common sleep conditions
      and/or risk for these conditions. Such an approach, would allow for faster assessment of
      common sleep conditions and disorders, and provide clinical knowledge to the individual, the
      physician, and if required insurance companies, as to those persons who need more immediate
      attention or treatment for their sleep condition.
