  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orofacial pain encompasses painful conditions, such as temporomandibular disorder.
      Multidisciplinary health teams seek to control such musculoskeletal disorders to improve the
      quality and functional capacity of the muscles of mastication. The aim of the proposed study
      is to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy as a form of treatment for the
      prevention of initial fatigue of the muscles of mastication (masseter and anterior temporal
      muscles) as well as the recovery of these muscles after induced exhaustion (caused by
      isometric contraction) in young adults. The participants will be 78 (n obtained from
      calculation of the sample size with p &lt; 0.05) healthy male and female volunteers between 18
      and 34 years of age. The volunteers will be randomly allocated to a laser group (n = 26),
      sham group (n = 26) and control group (n = 26). All participants will be submitted to a
      clinical evaluation to record mandibular movements, bite force, muscle sensitivity to
      palpation and initial muscle fatigue. Initial fatigue will be induced by isometric
      contraction of the jaws. Maximum voluntary contraction will be performed to record the time
      until initial exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). The groups
      will then be submitted to the interventions: 1) active laser therapy (wavelength: 780 nm;
      fluence: 134 J/cm2; power: 50 mW; irradiance: 1.675 W/cm2; exposure time: 80 seconds per
      point) on three points of the masseter and one point on the anterior temporal muscles on each
      side, 2) sham laser (placebo effect) or 3) no intervention (control). Maximum voluntary
      contraction will be performed again after the interventions to record the time until initial
      exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). Differences in individual
      time until exhaustion between the pre-intervention and post-intervention evaluations will be
      measured to determine the effect of low-level laser therapy.

    <intervention_model_description>Tiredness will be induced by isometric contraction occlusion time. Patients will be evaluated in two stages. The first moment will be maximum occlusion in all patients in order to be able to measure the individual time for fatigue of the masseter muscle (evaluation by electromyography). The second will have the application of the laser in a group (at the wavelength of 780nm, 134 J / cm2, power of 50 mW irradiance of 1.675 W / cm2, for 80 seconds per point in 3 points in the masseter muscle and one in the temporal muscle on each side); simulation of the application (placebo-psychic factor), control (without application); after this first moment, we will have maximum occlusion in all the patients in order to be able to measure the individual time for fatigue (evaluation by electromyography).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>MVC (clenching the teeth in maximum intercuspation) will be performed to record the time until initial exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). The groups will then be submitted to the interventions and MVC will be performed a second time to record the time until initial exhaustion of the masseter muscle (determined by electromyography). During the procedures, the volunteers will receive verbal encouragement as well as visual feedback on the monitor to maintain MVC. Before the readings, the volunteers will undergo training of the procedure for the acquisition of the EMG signal.</description>
