  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Candida species are both known to colonize physiologically mucosal surfaces in the human body
      without causing signs or symptoms of infection and to cause a wide variety of diseases,
      including mucocutaneous infections and potentially fatal invasive infections of the
      bloodstream or organs. Throughout the past decades, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are of
      increasing importance even in non-neutropenic patients who are in need of treatment in
      intensive care units (ICU) or have undergone major surgeries. Several factors like parenteral
      nutrition, central venous catheters, broad spectrum antibiotics admission, disturbance of
      gastrointestinal mucosa integrity have been associated with an increased incidence of IFIs.
      Positive testing for 1,3-ß-D-Glucan (BDG) in serum is widely used to assess invasive fungal
      infections. It detects circulating BDG, which is part of the fungal cell wall of clinical
      relevant fungi such as Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp..

      The issue of BDG kinetics after intestinal mucosal damage (e.g. mucositis or gut surgery) is
      poorly understood. Intestinal mucosal damage is characterized by a loss of integrity of the
      intestinal mucosal barrier and increasing translocations of bacterial and/or fungal
      commensals of the gastrointestinal tract.

      In abdominal surgery a key concern in serum BDG kinetics is the potential introduction of BDG
      from surgical sponges and gauze or mucosal damage due to surgical damage of the mucosal
      integrity. Compared to open abdominal surgery in laparoscopic abdominal surgery sponges and
      gauze are rarely used. As life-threatening intraabdominal candidiasis occurs in 30 to 40% of
      high-risk abdominal surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients it is of utmost importance to
      obtain reliable BDG values for diagnosis or exclusion of invasive candidiasis.
