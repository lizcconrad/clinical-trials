  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      New treatments are continually being developed to help patients living with advanced cancer,
      which require extensive clinical trials before authorisation for standard clinical use.
      Reporting of adverse events (AE) in this setting is essential to ensure treatment safety and
      tolerability. The current system for reporting AEs, the Common Toxicity Criteria and Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) relies on the clinician's interpretation of patient symptoms, but a
      substantial body of evidence suggests clinicians miss/underestimate AEs experienced by
      patients. The aim of the overall project is to explore the implementation of an electronic
      patient-reported outcomes (ePRO) system to gather adverse events data in early phase clinical
      trials (EPCT) patients. In Phase 1 of this study, through semi-structured interviews, we
      explored patient, healthcare, and clinical trial staffs' views about collecting electronic
      patient-reported outcomes in this setting. This work informed the direction of the current
      pilot. This proof-of-principle feasibility study will explore the feasibility and
      satisfaction with using an electronic system to remotely self-report AEs whilst on EPCT. The
      key objectives are to:

        1. Evaluate the feasibility of using a secure online method (ePRIME system) to collect
           PRO-AEs in EPCT patients.

        2. Explore patient satisfaction with the use of the ePRIME system to collect PRO AEs in
           EPCT patients.

        3. Monitor the number of notifications for severe AEs generated by the system to address
           concerns from the interviews that ePROs will lead to increased workload.

      To this end, a prospective longitudinal pilot will be conducted of the ePRIME system in early
      phase clinical trial patients in Leeds and Sheffield. A convenience sample of patients
      enrolled in Phase I or Phase II trials will be recruited. Patients in general oncology and
      haematology clinics will be included if diagnosed with metastatic or progressive disease and
      are presently receiving novel agents in an academic early phase clinical trial, such as
      chemotherapy, targeted agents, or chemo-radiotherapy. Patients will be included in this pilot
      whether the trial is a test of a novel drug, drug combination, or dose escalation. The study
      will aim to identify, approach, and consent all eligible patients over a 12 month period. If
      they are over 18, able to give informed consent, have access to internet via any device, and
      able to read and understand English. Patients will be approached and consented within 1 month
      of having been entered in the clinical trial. Patients will not be eligible if they will be
      on the clinical trial for less than 3 months. Each patient will complete a patient-reported
      AE checklist at baseline (i.e. time of consent) and then weekly for 12 weeks. At the end of
      the 12 weeks an end-of-study interview will be conducted to explore patient satisfaction with
      the system. It is envisaged that this project will provide initial information on the
      feasibility and acceptability of a novel electronic system to facilitate the collection of
      patient-reported AEs in early phase trials.

    <description>Feasibility of using a secure, online system to record, monitor, and help patients report AEs. It will be measured through:
the number of participants consenting versus declining;
compliance with the ePRIME trial through the number of missed completions, out of the 12 weeks (minimum) prompted by the research team;
number and timing of participant withdrawals and reasons;
number of completions in addition to the weekly prompts;
number of completions that generate notifications to the early phase clinical trials ePRIME email address.</description>

    <measure>Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>2018-2020</time_frame>
    <description>We will explore participant satisfaction with the use of the system. Through an end-of-study interview with patients and healthcare professionals we will explore the perceived burden, barriers, and opportunities and benefits of using the novel system. In addition to this, we will also explore system usability parameters such as time of log-on and log-off, time taken to complete the measures, time outs, and time spent on each page/section.</description>

    <description>Participants in the study will receive training in using the ePRIME system to report their symptoms and side effects on a weekly basis from home via the internet for 12 weeks while receiving early phase trial treatment. Patients will be sent email/text reminders to enter their symptoms on the system once a week. Patients will be reminded that the data they enter via the online system will not be reviewed promptly by their hospital team and therefore they should continue to contact their treatment team via the contact numbers they have been given.
As part of the research project, we will monitor the number of notifications for severe AE generated by the system to address concerns from the interviews conducted in the first phase of this research project that ePROs will lead to increased workload for clinicians.</description>

    <description>ePRIME is an online system for patients to self-report symptoms and AE during cancer treatment. ePRIME allows AE reporting from home or hospital and enables patient reported data to be integrated into existing EPR to allow for the reports to be used in routine care. In addition the system is capable of generating notifications for severe AE to the relevant clinical team and providing patient advice on managing mild and moderate AE.</description>
