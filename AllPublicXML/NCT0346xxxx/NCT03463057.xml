  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients with an early relapse is
      dismal. Atezolizumab has shown promising activity in relapsed DLBCL patients. Toxicity data
      on atezolizumab are available for &gt; 6000 patients and is manageable. The assumption of this
      study is that atezolizumab consolidation will result in higher disease free survival by
      eradicating minimal residual disease In melanoma and lung cancer consolidation immunotherapy
      after chemoradiotherapy has shown an increase in survival.
