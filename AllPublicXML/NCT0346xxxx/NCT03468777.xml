    <textblock>
      The main purpose of study is to evaluate the effect of multiple-dose administration of
      lansoprazole (and optional: time-separated single dose administration of ranitidine) on the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of JNJ-63549109 after a single dose of lumicitabine in healthy adult
      participants, under fasted (and optional: fed) conditions.
