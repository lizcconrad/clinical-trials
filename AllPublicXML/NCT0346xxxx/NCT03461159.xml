  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence demonstrates that animals and people can exert control over the level of
      excitability in spinal and corticospinal neural circuits that contribute to movement. This
      discovery has important implications, as it represents a new strategy to improve motor
      control in people of all ability levels, including those with neurological conditions.
      Operant conditioning is a well-studied mechanism of learning, in which the modification of a
      behavior can be brought about by the consequence of the behavior, and reinforcement causes
      behaviors to become more frequent. In recent years, operant conditioning has been applied to
      spinally-mediated reflex responses in mice, rats, monkeys and people. By electrically
      stimulating a peripheral nerve, recording the muscle response, and rewarding responses that
      are within a desirable range, it is possible to increase or decrease the neural circuit's
      excitability. This may alter the level of resting muscle tone and spasticity, as well the
      muscle's contribution to planned movements and responses to unexpected events. Operant
      conditioning of spinal reflexes has been applied to a lower limb muscle in healthy people and
      those with spinal cord injuries. In this project, we will expand the use of operant
      conditioning to muscles of the upper limb, demonstrating feasibility and efficacy in healthy
      people and people post-stroke. We will determine whether operant conditioning can be used to
      decrease excitability of spinal reflexes that activate a wrist flexor muscle. Additionally,
      in a separate group of healthy people, we will determine whether operant conditioning can be
      used in a similar way to increase corticospinal excitability. We will stimulate the motor
      cortex with transcranial magnetic stimulation to elicit motor evoked potentials in the same
      wrist flexor muscle, and will reward responses that exceed a threshold value. We will examine
      the effects of these interventions on motor control at the wrist, using an innovative
      custom-designed cursor-tracking task to quantify movement performance. We will determine
      whether changes in spinal reflex excitability or corticospinal excitability alter motor
      control. The overall goal of this research is to develop a new, evidence-based strategy for
      rehabilitation that will improve recovery of upper limb function in people after stroke.
