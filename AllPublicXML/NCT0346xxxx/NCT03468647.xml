  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The object of the present project is to promote the prevention of disability by providing 1)
      a feedback and motivational coaching to the user, 2) relevant clinical parameters to the
      healthcare professionals in order to support the patient's follow-up, and 3) supporting the
      detection of preliminary signs of functional loss. The technical solution will contain
      wearable (e.g. smart insole) and ambient unobtrusive devices (e.g. weigh scale including
      balance analysis), and analysis and diagnosis assistance software. The devices transmit
      wirelessly the collected data to a remote server through a tablet. Data will then be
      available remotely for consultations by users (i.e. patients or physicians). The clinical
      evaluation will be a multi-phased design with a first living lab evaluation followed by a
      real life home trial to finalize the evaluation. Comprehensive assessments will be conducted
      to highlight the feasibility and acceptability.

    <textblock>
      Functional decline challenges the sustainability of healthcare systems. There are
      difficulties in implementing effective interventions to prevent disability, to promote
      adherence to lifestyle recommendations and to perform seamless follow-up at home. A
      technological solution addressing this challenge and improving individual participation would
      be welcome. Our aim is to evaluate an instrument for supporting physical activity and
      monitoring multiple parameters of frailty (a pre-disability condition) in frail elderly
      persons. The investigator and collaborator are therefore developing a solution to monitor key
      parameters of frailty during subject daily life and to promote walking. This tools are :

        1. connected soles to evaluate different parameters of the volunteer walking

        2. connected weighing machine to evaluate the volunteer weight and equilibrate

        3. machine to measure gripping force because gripping force is correlated to physical
           condition.

      The primary aim is to assess the acceptability of the solution for the follow up and the
      motivational coaching of frail patients at home. Results from this study will also be used to
      elaborate the design of a further larger national multicenter randomized control trial
      assessing the efficiency of the solution to prevent disability.
