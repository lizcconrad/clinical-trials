  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although recent global trends indicate reduced postoperative mortality after esophagectomy,
      major morbidity, in particular pulmonary, remains high, with considerable health and economic
      costs. In a recent modern international collaborative series of 2704 patients from
      high-volume centers, with an approximate equal mix of open and minimally invasive approaches,
      respiratory complications were evident in 28% of patients, pneumonia in 15%, and respiratory
      failure in 7%.1 In other series, respiratory failure is reported in up to 15% of patients and
      is the most common cause of mortality. Prediction of risk and prevention of respiratory
      morbidity is therefore of considerable importance, and in this context baseline assessment of
      respiratory physiology compliments clinical assessment, history and enhanced recovery
      pathways representing key elements of current patient management.

      In this study, which will include all prospective patients with locally advanced esophageal
      cancer treated at a National Center, pulmonary function will be systematically measured
      before and after neoadjuvant therapy. The investigators seek to evaluate the incidence of
      radiation induced lung injury (RILI), as well as subclinical changes in pulmonary physiology
      that may be linked to postoperative complications, and quality-of-life in survivorship, and
      to compare cohorts who received radiation therapy or chemotherapy alone, preoperatively.

        Records for all patients with LAEC treated with multimodal therapy with curative intent
        between 2010 and 2016 will be assessed for inclusion. Patients undergoing emergent or
        palliative surgery, or salvage esophagectomy will be excluded. All eligible patients for
        whom pulmonary function testing was undertaken at our Centre at a minimum of one
        preoperative timepoint will be included for analysis of operative and/or oncologic outcome.
        Then, HR-QL among disease-free patients at least one year postoperatively will be assessed
        using validated questionnaires (EORTC QLQC30, OG25 and OES18).
