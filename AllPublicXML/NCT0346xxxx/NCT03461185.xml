      Epidermal growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to
      treat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, the acquired resistance
      of EGFR-TKI is a common and severe problem.The study explore the superiority of
      anti-angiogenesis drugs (Apatinib, endostatin, anlotinib) plus EGFR TKI versus single
      EGFR-TKI.

      Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause from cancer in China. Epidermal
      growth factor receptor Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) have been approved to treat NSCLC
      harboring EGFR mutation as first-line therapy. However, a large proportion of patients would
      become acquired resistant of EGFR-TKI after about one year although initially sensitivity.
      Anti-angiogenesis therapy plus EGFR-TKI has been demonstrated valid and safe in NSCLC
      patients. Apatinib, endostatin, anlotinib belong to anti-angiogenesis drugs and can inhibit
      tumor growth. In this study, we plan to recruit NSCLC patients who are assessed as stable
      disease ( according to RECIST) under treatment of EGFR-TKI. Then, these patients would be
      divided into two groups: single EGFR-TKI or EGFR-TKI plus anti-angiogenesis drugs.
      Progression free survival, overall survival and safety are our evaluation events.
