    <masking_description>According to the allocation sequence obtained from the computer software the numbers will be written in small folded opaque papers and put in opaque sealed envelopes. All those papers will be ready before conducting any procedure. The patients will be allowed to pick his/her number from the pile of envelopes and will be assigned accordingly. The number of papers will decrease as each patient picks his number and so on.</masking_description>

    <description>On the lingual side of mandible, a full-thickness muco-periosteal flap is elevated until reaching mylohyoid line. Using a blunt instrument, a connective tissue band is localized continuing with the epimysium of the mylohyoid muscle and is inserted into the inner part of the lingual flap . The blunt instrument is inserted below the connective band, and with gentle traction in the coronal direction, this muscular insertion was detached from the lingual flap. Using a &quot;periodontal probe&quot; the amount of advancement is measured.</description>

    <description>A full-thickness muco-periosteal flap is reflected on the buccal side. Near the base of muco-periosteal flap, the periosteum is incised less than 0.5mm in depth, creating two segments, &quot;coronal segment&quot; and &quot;apical segment,&quot; of the periosteal flap. The flap is pulled with a pair of periodontal forceps laterally. Subsequently, the &quot;lateral stretching&quot; of the coronal segment of the flap is performed by applying pressure using the blunt face of scalpel blade, or a blunt instrument, with sweeping motion. This motion helps stretching the flap over the submucosa, thereby permitting the flap to be mobile.Using a &quot;periodontal probe&quot; the amount of advancement is measured</description>

    <description>: A full-thickness crestal incision is performed from the distal surface of the more distal tooth to retromolar pad and finishing with releasing incision. On the lingual side, a full-thickness muco-periosteal flap was elevated until reaching mylohyoid line. Then using a blunt instrument, it was localized a connective tissue band continuing with the epimysium of the mylohyoid muscle. It is inserted into the inner part of the lingual flap about 5mm from the crest in an apical direction. The blunt instrument is inserted below the connective band, and with gentle traction in the coronal direction, this muscular insertion was detached from the lingual flap. Using a &quot;periodontal probe&quot;, the amount of advancement is measured.</description>
