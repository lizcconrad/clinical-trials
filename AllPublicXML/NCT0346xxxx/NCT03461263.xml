  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been observed that out of all visits to the clinics by the young and middle age men
      for grievances including the genital and urinary frameworks, about 25% of the visits account
      for Prostatitis. A significant number of men, aged less than 50, visits to urologist due to
      Interminable prostatitis. Nevertheless, just 5 to10% of &quot;prostatitis&quot; cases is really caused
      by a bacterial contamination.

      The purpose was to investigate thoroughly the effect of pumpkin seeds oil phonophoresis among
      males who are diagnosed with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      sixty male outpatients diagnosed with chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. Through sample
      random sampling procedure the total study population was categorized into three treatment
      groups; Group A, wherein patients received phonophoresis treatment using pumpkin seeds oil;
      Group B, where members of the group received trans-perineal continuous low-intensity
      ultrasound; and Group C, in which the participant received placebo low- intensity ultrasound.
      All of The three groups of the organized trail received their corresponding treatment daily
      up-to 3 weeks.

      For the analysis participants were recruited from a registry of patients with a diagnosis of
      CNBP. To be included in the analysis a patient must be evaluated with a confirmed diagnosis.
      They were examined and diagnosed accordingly by a medical practitioner/urologist.

      Patients with concomitant infection, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, heart
      problems/pacemaker, implants (metal, silicone, saline), acute and post-acute injury,
      thrombophlebitis, impaired sensation, psychiatric diseases, and those with well-known
      contraindications of ultrasound treatment were excluded from the study. Similarly, those with
      known hypersensitivity to pumpkin seeds oil and its derivatives, along with those who had
      received other forms of therapies that could influence the therapeutic outcomes of the study
      were excluded from the study sample.
