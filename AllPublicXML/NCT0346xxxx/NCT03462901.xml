    <textblock>
      Clavicular fracture, constitutes 2.6% e 5% of all adult fractures, most are located in the
      midshaft clavicle with different degrees of displacement. Conservative methods are commonly
      used for midshaft clavicular fractures treatment, but with various unsatisfactory
      complications such as nonunion, malunion and shoulders asymmetry. The rate of malunion after
      conservative treatment for the midshaft clavicular fractures reached 15%, and 30% patients
      were unsatisfied. Recently, early midshaft clavicular fractures could greatly reduce the
      incidence rate of nonunion and malunion. Open reduction and plate-screw ﬁxation was
      considered as the gold standard with the advantages of ﬁrm ﬁxation and earlier postoperative
      mobilization, but also with disadvantages of larger incision and more organizations being
      exposed, presenting with many postoperative complications. Intramedullary ﬁxation treatment
      for mid-clavicular fractures has been favored due to its strengths including small incision,
      less periosteal striping, dispersion of stress and simple to operate However, early
      intra-medullary implants, such as Hagie pins and Kirschner wires, have been gradually
      replaced due to insufficient stability. In addition, various nails such as elastic stable
      intramedullar

      Fixation of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures with minimally invasive technic as it
      helps for early mobilization to the shoulder and more safe, more cosmetically in comparison
      to other options.
