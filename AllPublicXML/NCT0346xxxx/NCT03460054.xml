  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis (GN) is one of the most important causes of kidney failure in Canada.
      These comprise a group of &quot;rare&quot; diseases (&lt;5 per 250,000 population), yet GN is a leading
      cause of kidney failure and accounts annually for close to 20% of incident cases of end stage
      kidney disease (ESKD) in Canada. Prevention of progression to kidney failure is possible,
      however several barriers and gaps in knowledge challenge our ability to provide patients with
      individualized effective therapy. These include a lack of sensitive non-invasive tools for
      monitoring disease activity, prognosis, and response to therapy. A gap in understanding of
      the core molecular processes underlying the development and progression of GN, and a lack of
      cohesive networks for evaluation of novel treatment approaches contribute to a lack of
      targeted and personalized therapies for GN. To address these challenges we will create a
      national, multi-dimensional platform for application of human-based molecular research and
      advanced therapeutics in GN.

      To accomplish the goals set out in this project, the CGNR network will recruit and maintain a
      large cohort of patients 350 with glomerular diseases and follow them prospectively with
      standardized clinical data and biospecimen collection. The infrastructure and study design
      presented in this protocol will form the backbone for a broad range of scientific approaches
      and inquiries, essential to moving the field forward and improving the outcomes of patients
      affected by these diseases. Successful recruitment of 350 patients from across the country,
      creating a rich biobank and data repository. Our aims are to identifying patient
      characteristics associated with glomerular diseases and complications, characterizing disease
      trajectory under current clinical care, estimating event rates of clinically meaningful
      outcomes, identify predictors of short and long-term outcomes including therapeutic outcomes.
      We also aim to identify and characterize clinical, histological, molecular and genetic
      biomarkers that are linked to glomerular diseases and outcomes that might improve disease
      classification, and biomarkers that may be employed in clinical practice or in clinical
      trials that predict disease activity or response to therapy. Furthermore, we propose to study
      sequence variations, transcriptome profile and their impact on disease presentation and
      clinical outcome. On the patient level, we will identify patient reported outcomes such as
      disease burden, physical function and quality of life associated with GN diseases and
      validate tools to assess impact of disease and therapy on patients. Achievement of our goals
      will be determined by the success of the research studies that evolve from the biobank, and
      data repository.
