    <textblock>
      The co-primary objectives of the trial are to investigate the effect of the use of inhaled
      colistimethate sodium, administered twice daily via the I-neb for 24 months, compared to
      placebo in subjects with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFB) chronically infected with
      P. aeruginosa on:

        -  the frequency of pulmonary exacerbations;

        -  the number of exacerbation-free days.
