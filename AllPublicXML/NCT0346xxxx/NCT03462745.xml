  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The AccuVein AV300 device helps in venepuncture and intravenous (IV) cannulation.
      It uses infrared light that can be absorbed by the blood hemoglobin so that veins location is
      clearly viewed on the skin's surface.

      Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of the AV300 device over the standard technique in
      increasing the ﬁrst-time success rate (SR) for pediatric patients who needed IV cannulation.

      Methods: This was a prospective cross study of patients aged 0-18 years scheduled for surgery
      or examination under anesthesia but without having an existing IV access and after providing
      consent form. Patients were randomized into two groups; cannulation with AV300 or standard
      insertion performed by experienced pediatric anesthesiologists and residents under training.

      Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided informed consent were assigned to
      one of two groups using a randomization program that assigned research participants into
      group A (AccuVein AV300 assisted intravenous catheter insertion) or group B (standard
      technique of insertion of the intravenous cannula). After pre-anesthetic evaluation, the
      research participant was brought to the operating room and standard monitoring were applied
      (EKG, SpO2, BP) if tolerated. Anesthesia was induced via face mask with sevoflurane in 100%
      O2. The anesthesiologist and resident decided on a site believed to be the best for
      cannulation and on the size of the venous cannula as 22g or 24g. When the supervising
      anesthesiologist deemed it appropriate, the venous cannulation was attempted, according to
      the randomization groups, either with the AccuVein device (group A) or blindly (group B). A
      rating of the vein attempted as either difficult or easy was established by the attending
      anesthesiologist.
