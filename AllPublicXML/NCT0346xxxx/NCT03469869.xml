      This study evaluates the effect of balanced and sustainable diet application on fat
      composition, insulin resistance and inflammation marker in obese people.

      Intervention: Obese subject will receive intervention on balanced and sustainable diet
      application Control: Obese subject will receive a balanced diet application only

    <textblock>
      Maintaining the adherence of weight loss programme while selecting healthy and sustainable
      foods will become a worldwide future challenge in nutrition. Therefore, we investigated the
      suitable content, graphic, and flow in developing a mobile application as an alternative
      solution for enhancing the compliance of weight control and selecting healthy food with the
      least environmental impact.

      The treatment for obesity consists of dieting, physical exercise, pharmacology, and surgery.
      Restricted balanced diet is a well known diet recommendation for people with obesity.
      Sustainable diet is an alternative form of diet which contributes to healthy life and is
      protective of biodiversity.

      The main challenge in obesity management is the sustainability of weight loss programme.
      Mobile apps are an alternative solution for enhancing compliance.
