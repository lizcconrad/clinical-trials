    <textblock>
      The social processes depend on complex cognitive mechanisms, which involve mainly the frontal
      and temporal lobe regions. Patients with early onset frontal and temporal lobe lesions might
      later develop important deficits in social integration. Accordingly, children with early
      onset temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) demonstrate altered emotion recognition.

      Study design: Multicentre, Case-control study.

      Emotion recognition is a first step for the development of the capacity to judge the
      thoughts, intentions, and desires of others. In infants, the capacity to identify,
      distinguish, and interpret emotions is limited, but these processes are developing rapidly
      and innately during the first years of life, on the same neural bases as those described in
      adulthood. Children with BECTS show altered social behavior. In fact, deficit in social
      cognition could derive from brain dysfunction in the frontotemporal regions primarily
      affected in BECTS, since these regions are also viewed as playing an important role in social
      cognition and development of social skills.

      The investigators hypothesized that children with BECTS might have altered social cognitive
      skills and underlying neural networks.

    <description>Children with active BECTS according to state-of-the-art diagnostic criteria of ILAE (International League Against Epilepsy). Eligible subjects will be recruited at their first clinical observation in the epilepsy centers involved in the study.
All subjects will perform five diagnostic evaluations named:
IDS (Intelligence and Development Scale) MMSPE (Mini Mental State Pediatric Examination) CDI 2 (Children Depression Inventory 2) CBCL (Child Behavior Check List) Tests of facial expression evaluation</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Healthy children</arm_group_label>
    <description>Healthy controls matched for sex, age range, and education with no family history for epilepsy or other neuropsychiatric disorders.
