  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study uses an experimental design to conduct a double-blind, randomized, crossover study
      where participants receive both diesel exhaust and a mental stress test in a controlled
      setting. My hypothesis is that the synergistic effect of stress and air pollution will result
      in higher levels of stress and inflammation (measured via biological markers) as well as
      poorer cardiovascular disease related outcomes compared to the independent effect of each
      exposure separately.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Non-smokers without history of high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes, high cholesterol,
        post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or any other chronic condition that requires ongoing
        care.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Smoking: We rule out active smoking by checking urine cotinine during our study.

          2. History of high blood pressure: We objectively measure BP during in-person screening
             and exclude those with blood pressure (&gt;130/85 mmHg).

          3. Asthmatic: Spirometry is done at screening to rule out asthma.

          4. Diabetic: We obtain fasting blood sugar to rule out diabetes at screening (&gt;125 mg/dL)

          5. Cholesterol: We obtain fasting blood lipid levels to rule out hypercholesterolemia at
             screening (&gt;200 mg/dL).

          6. History of PTSD: Subjects will be asked about prior PTSD diagnosis during the phone
             and in person screen.

          7. Any other chronic condition requiring ongoing care based on medication use.

          8. A body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) greater
             than 26 and less than 18.5

          9. A female of childbearing age with a positive pregnancy test

         10. A female of childbearing age who is unwilling to use effective contraception during
             the study
