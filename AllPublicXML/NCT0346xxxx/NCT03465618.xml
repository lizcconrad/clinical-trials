  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if PET scans using 89Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-Cy5-C' dot
      particles, can be used to take pictures of brain tumors. The investigators want to understand
      how the particles are distributed and removed from the body, which may help others be treated
      in the future. This will be the first time that 89Zr-DFO-cRGDY-PEG-Cy5-C' dot particles are
      being used in people. The amount of particles given in this study is very small compared to
      the amount that was used in mice animal studies.

    <masking>Single (Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Two expert PET scan readers, who are board-certified in Nuclear Medicine, will be designated to read and evaluate PET-CT scans. Volumetric region-of-interest analysis and extraction of the mean and maximum standard uptake values (SUVs) will be provided. Both readers will initially be blinded to the patient's clinical information for scan interpretation. A second interpretation will then be performed after both readers are provided with clinical information about the primary tumor site.</masking_description>

    <description>A low dose spiral CT is performed first per the standard procedure. These images will be used for both attenuation correction and registration of the serial image set. The initial PET brain scan will be acquired up to about 24 hours post injection. Based upon the discretion of the physician, non-surgical patients have the possibility of a second scan and third up to about 48 hours post injection. The times per bed position may be adjusted after the first patient is imaged, and his/her scans evaluated. Additional low dose CT scans will be performed at the image session for attenuation correction and image registration. PET study may be done on a PET-MR scanner for ease.</description>
