  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibrosis of the liver is excessive accumulation of scar tissue that results from ongoing
      inflammation and liver cell death that occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases.
      Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by
      regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Fibrosis
      refers to the accumulation of tough, fibrous scar tissue in the liver. The potential for stem
      cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. Particularly,
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) has been demonstrated to decrease model for end-stage liver
      disease (MELD) score and increase serum albumin in liver injury patients. Therefore, the
      investigators propose a hypothesis that MSCs can also improve the disease conditions of liver
      fibrosis patients, particularly reducing the decompensated conditions in these patients.

      Fibrosis of the liver is excessive accumulation of scar tissue that results from ongoing
      inflammation and liver cell death that occurs in most types of chronic liver diseases.
      Nodules, abnormal spherical areas of cells, form as dying liver cells are replaced by
      regenerating cells. This regeneration of cells causes the liver to become hard. Fibrosis
      refers to the accumulation of tough, fibrous scar tissue in the liver. The potential for stem
      cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed. In particular,
      mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation has been applicated in the clinic for treat
      several human diseases such as graft-vesus-host disease (GVHD), liver injury and displayed
      good tolerance and efficiency. The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how MSCs can
      improve the disease conditions in patients with liver cirrhosis. This study will also look at
      its safety in liver fibrosis patients.
