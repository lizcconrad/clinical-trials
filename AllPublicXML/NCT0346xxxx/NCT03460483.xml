    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies universal screening for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch
      repair deficiency in patients with endometrial cancer, mutations in the genes responsible for
      Lynch syndrome (inherited forms of endometrial cancers) and other DNA changes that could help
      guide treatment strategies. Universal tumor DNA sequencing may help doctors better understand
      how to personalize care, increase length of life, and increase quality of life in patients
      with endometrial cancer and their relatives.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Molecular classification of tumor abnormalities through innovative upfront next-generation
      DNA sequencing.

      II. Identify endometrial cancer (EC) patients with inherited EC, specifically Lynch syndrome
      (LS), using both tumor and normal (blood) DNA testing.

      III. Develop a comprehensive approach to genetic risk assessment and management including
      improved cascade testing in at-risk relatives.

      IV. Provide local access to genetic counseling for patients with harmful germline mutations.

      V. Identify molecular signatures that may be associated with favorable response to specific
      treatments (including chemotherapeutic agents, non-surgical options, and novel clinical
      trials [in particular, patients with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient or POLE-mutant tumors]).

      VI. Determine if recurrence likelihood can be predicted from molecular signature.

      VII. Identify EC patients with select molecular signatures for recruitment to long-term
      follow-up, cancer prevention, and treatment studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients with endometrial cancer undergo clinical testing for inherited cancer mutations
      using blood DNA and via next-generation sequencing of tumor samples. Patients testing
      positive for Lynch syndrome or other cancer susceptibilities will undergo genetic counseling
      and testing and counseling will be offered to their family members.
