      ATLAS study is a clinical trial to evaluate the potential role of subcutaneous
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) gel, in the management of scleritis.

      Specifically, the ATLAS Study aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect of 2
      different dose regimens of ACTH gel administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in patients
      with scleritis, over a period of 12 months. The patients will be randomized (1:1) at their
      first visit to one of the two treatment arms: Twice-weekly or thrice-weekly SC administration
      of 80 Units of ACTH Gel. The effect of two dose regimens of subcutaneous ACTH gel in patients
      with scleritis will be monitored and evaluated.

      Patients enrolling to the study include those with non-infectious scleritis, which is an
      inflammatory disease affecting the sclera (white outer coating of the eye) and cause blurring
      of vision, redness, tearing and painful ocular inflammatory episodes in one or both eyes.
      Scleritis may results in vision threatening ocular complications (corneal ulceration,
      cataract, glaucoma, retinal detachment) and subsequent blindness, if left untreated.
      Treatment of scleritis is usually chronic and requires systemic therapy with non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, along with immunosuppression therapy. Due to its
      treatment resistance nature, scleritis remains a therapeutic challenge for many
      ophthalmologists.

      H.P. Acthar Gel (ACTH Gel) is a highly purified preparation of adrenocorticotropic hormone
      (ACTH) in a gel that is designed to provide extended release of the ACTH following injection.
      ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex gland to secrete cortisol, corticosterone, and
      aldosterone. It is FDA approved treatment for flares or on a regular basis (maintenance) in
      people with systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), infantile spasms in infants and children
      under 2 years of age, adults with acute relapses or flares of multiple sclerosis (MS),
      patients with kidney diseases, among other indications. ACTH Gel is also approved for a wide
      range of allergic and inflammatory diseases of the eye.

      Given the established role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of scleritis and the
      anti-inflammatory effects of ACTH Gel treatment by blocking various inflammatory pathways, a
      beneficial outcome could be anticipated from ACTH Gel in patients with scleritis.

      ATLAS is an Investigator-initiated, open-labelled, multi-center, randomized, phase II
      clinical trial, to evaluate the effect of two dose regimens of subcutaneous ACTH gel in
      subjects with non-infectious anterior scleritis over a period of 12 months (52 weeks), with
      the primary endpoint at month 4 (week 16). ATLAS study will be conducted at up to 6 clinical
      sites in USA. The study will be coordinated by the Ocular Imaging Research and Reading Center
      (OIRRC), which will serve as the coordinating and reading center for the ATLAS Study.

      The ATLAS Study aims to evaluate the potential role of subcutaneous adrenocorticotropic
      hormone (ACTH) gel, in the management of non-infectious anterior scleritis. Specifically, the
      ATLAS Study aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 2 different dose regimens of ACTH
      gel administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection in patients with non-infectious anterior
      scleritis and to evaluate the bioactivity of 2 different dose regimens of ACTH gel
      administered by SC injection in patients with non-infectious anterior scleritis.

      Scleritis refers to red and painful inflammation, centered in the sclera that may involve
      adjacent ocular structures including the cornea, episclera and uvea. Scleritis may results in
      vision threatening ocular complications (corneal ulceration, cataract, glaucoma, retinal
      detachment, choroidal effusion) and subsequent blindness. Up to 50% of patients with
      scleritis have an associated systemic inflammatory disorder, such as sarcoidosis, rheumatoid
      arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and polyangiitis with granulomatosis. Scleritis is
      classified based on the anatomic site, as anterior or posterior, with 90% of cases anterior.
      Anterior scleritis may manifest as necrotizing or non-necrotizing. Non-necrotizing,
      noninfectious scleritis is the most prevalent form.

      The course of scleritis is usually chronic, similar to uveitis, and requires systemic therapy
      with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and glucocorticoids, along with immunosuppression,
      as steroid-sparing therapy. Due to its treatment resistance nature, scleritis remains a
      therapeutic challenge for many ophthalmologists. The ultimate goal is to control the
      inflammation, which serves as the cornerstone of the scleritis pathophysiological basis.

      Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is a member of a group of peptide hormones, called
      melanocortins (MCs). ACTH is released from the pituitary gland and acts primarily on the
      adrenals to stimulate and regulate steroid hormones production. It has been demonstrated that
      MCs can be produced by immune cells at the inflammation site, which created a special
      interest in immunomodulatory properties of these peptides. Latest evidence proposes other
      anti-inflammatory mechanisms of ACTH actions in addition to steroidogenesis, including
      leukocyte transmigration inhibition, cytokine synthesis reduction and generation of
      anti-inflammatory signals locally at the inflammation site. ACTH gel has been reported to be
      effective in various systemic inflammatory diseases including nephrotic syndrome, multiple
      sclerosis, opsoclonus myoclonus,dermatomyositis and polymyositis. These reports also include
      cases that were resistant to steroids and other immunomodulatory drugs, supporting the
      immune-modulating properties of ACTH. H.P. Acthar® Gel (Repository Corticotropin Injection,
      Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals) is a 39-amino-acid, pituitary-derived ACTH analogue. ACTH gel
      has been demonstrated to have additional therapeutic effects on the humoral immune system,
      independent of its role in the adrenal steroidogenesis regulation. It is approved by the US
      FDA for treatment of a number of inflammatory conditions, including multiple sclerosis,
      rheumatic and collagen disorders, as well as ophthalmologic diseases, such as ocular allergy,
      keratitis, uveitis and optic neuritis. However, due to the scarcity of data from clinical
      studies, many physicians are unaware of ACTH gel as a treatment option for inflammatory
      diseases.

      The proposed study aims to evaluate the potential role of ACTH gel in the management of
      non-infectious anterior scleritis. Given the established role of inflammation in the
      pathogenesis of scleritis and the ability of ACTH to bind to cellular and tissue melanocortin
      receptors, thus blocking various inflammatory pathways, a beneficial outcome could be
      anticipated from ACTH analogue in patients with scleritis.

      Thirty (30) subjects with non-infectious anterior scleritis will be enrolled in the study.

      The primary endpoint of the study will be at week 16, with an active, as-needed treatment
      extension phase from week 17 to week 52.

      All study participants will be randomized (1:1) at their Baseline (BL) visit (visit 2) to one
      of the two treatment arms. All subjects will be started on oral corticosteroids (at a maximum
      dosage of 1 mg/kg of prednisone or equivalence a day) at the screening visit which will
      continue to be administered at the same dose throughout the screening period until BL/Visit
      2. Steroid dose will be tapered from BL/Visit 2 onwards until week 9 (Visit 5). If the
      scleritis is still greater than 0.5+ on the grading scale, the investigators have the
      discretion to continue on the tapering course of steroid while the subjects are also being
      treated with ACTH gel.

      Thereafter, at the baseline visit (visit 2, day 0), they will be treated according to their
      randomization group to either of the two treatment arms, while they are on the tapering
      course of oral corticosteroids. The tapering schedule is at the discretion of the
      investigators. However, the tapering schedule should be planned so that corticosteroids can
      be discontinued by week 9.

      The two treatment arms are as follows:

        1. Mandatory 80 U twice weekly treatment with SC ACTH gel, starting at the Baseline visit
           (Day 0) until end of week 16.

        2. Mandatory 80 U thrice weekly treatment with SC ACTH gel, starting at the Baseline visit
           (Day 0) until end of week 16.

      Starting at week 17, treatment regimen will be determined according to clinical response to
      treatment as follows:

        1. No evidence of active disease/disease resolved - treatment dose will be reduced to 80 U
           once a week with SC ACTH gel.

        2. Evidence of disease improvement, but still active/partial response - corticosteroids
           (such as prednisone) will be added and treatment with ACTH gel will be evaluated as
           adjunctive therapy.

        3. No evidence of improvement/disease progression - treatment with ACTH gel will be
           discontinued and rescue therapy will be initiated as per investigator based on standard
           of care.

      At the primary end point (week 16) and at the end of follow-up period (week 52) efficacy will
      be assessed by standard ophthalmic examination procedures and response to treatment, which
      will be graded according to established scleritis grading scale. Evaluation of response will
      be based on changes in scleral inflammation grade at various time points during the study,
      changes in pain grade scale at various time points during the study, changes in the dosage of
      prednisone required to maintain disease quiescence and stability and changes on ancillary
      testing such as FA, OCT, among others. Retreatment will be offered to study subjects who have
      demonstrated any level of response during the first 16 weeks and who meet any of the
      Retreatment Criteria listed below. Subjects receiving retreatment will receive the dose that
      was assigned to them at randomization. There is no placebo arm in this study.

      Approximately 30 subjects from at least three (3) clinical sites will be enrolled.

      Eligible subjects who have provided informed consent will be identified and recruited. Every
      effort will be made to enroll eligible subjects from men and women of all ethnic and social
      backgrounds. Subjects who meet entry criteria will be able to enroll in the study until the
      quota of subjects has been achieved.

      As the ATLAS Study is an exploratory, early phase 2 study, the sample size is not chosen
      based on statistical calculation or to compare the two doses. Rather, descriptive analyses
      will be performed for both doses of H.P. Acthar Gel, evaluating ocular and systemic adverse
      events for safety and tolerability and changes in visual acuity and scleral inflammation for
      bioactivity.

      Key Study Activities:

        1. Screening visit (-14 to -1 day) will be performed within 14 days prior to Baseline (Day
           0 with window period of +/- 1 day). At the Day 0 visit, subject will be taught how to
           self-administer the SC ACTH gel.

        2. The total study duration is approximately 1 year/52 weeks.

        3. At Baseline (Day 0) visit, ACTH gel 80 U will be administered either twice or thrice a
           week (according to randomization) until week 16 (window period: +/- 3 days). Visit 7
           (week 16) will consist of a follow-up phone call 7 days after the visit to collect
           safety data.

        4. Visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp examination and indirect
           ophthalmoscopy will be performed at each study visit.

        5. Fundus photography and fluorescein angiography will be performed at day 0 (visit 2),
           primary endpoint (visit 7) and last follow-up (visit 13).

        6. Anterior Segment photography will be performed in each visit.

        7. OCT will be performed at Day 0 (visit 2), at primary endpoint (visit 7) and last
           follow-up (visit 13).

        8. Blood serum will be collected for analyses of various biomarkers at Baseline (visit 2),
           primary endpoint (visit 7), and at last follow-up (visit 13) or at termination visit in
           case of early termination.

        9. All subjects will be started on oral corticosteroids (at a maximum dosage of 1 mg/kg of
           prednisone or equivalence a day) at screening visit, which will continue to be
           administered at the same dose throughout the screening period until Baseline/Visit 2.
           Steroid dose will be tapered from BL/Visit 2 onwards until week 9 (Visit 5). The
           tapering schedule is at the discretion of the investigators. However, the tapering
           schedule should be planned so that corticosteroids can be discontinued by week 9. If the
           scleritis is still greater than 0.5+ on the grading scale, the investigators have the
           discretion to continue on the tapering course of steroid while the subjects are also
           being treated with ACTH gel.

       10. Subjects that have been on IMT before enrollment, will either stop IMT, if given solely
           for their ocular disease or continue IMT at the same dosage, if it is necessary to
           control the underlying systemic disease. In the latter case, IMT will be discontinued
           prior to or at the screening visit (at least 2 weeks before the initiation of therapy
           with the study drug).

       11. Starting at week 17 (after primary endpoint) follow-up study activities will be
           performed every 6 weeks for a total of 52 weeks.

             screening. In addition, sexually active females of childbearing potential must agree
             to use TWO of the following adequate forms of contraception while on study medication:
             oral, injectable, or implantable hormonal contraceptives; tubal ligation; intrauterine
             device; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized partner.

          -  Males must agree to use barrier contraception (latex condoms) when engaging in sexual
             activity while on study medication and for 28 days after taking the last dose of study
             medication.

          -  Prior to study screening, potential subjects must have been evaluated and screened for
             infectious etiologies by the investigators, possibly as part of standard clinical
             acre; all testing to rule out infectious causes must be performed within 3 months of
             screening for the ATLAS study.

          -  Currently active and uncontrolled scleritis, that at the determination of the
             investigator, requires the initiation of corticosteroid monotherapy (or equivalent),
             or prednisone therapy and immunomodulatory therapy or injections of corticosteroid
             (periocular); or scleritis in subjects for whom oral corticosteroid is
             contraindicated, relatively or absolutely.

          -  Evidence of active non-infectious scleral inflammation that at the determination of
             investigator requires therapy. Such evidence can be documented by clinical
             examination, photography, or ancillary testing (e.g. B-scan ultrasonography,
             fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography). As long as the investigator
             determines that the degree of inflammation can be monitored for regression or
             progression, the inflammation criterion can be met.

             systemic disease can be enrolled in the study only if the systemic therapy will not be
             altered throughout the study span. If at any point during the study, the ongoing
             systemic therapy needs to be altered (e.g. increase in the dose), the subject will
             have to exit the study.

          -  If scleritis is the initial manifestation of an underlying systemic disease, and the
             subjects need to be started on systemic therapy in the form of corticosteroids or
             immunomodulatory therapy for the underlying disease, then the subjects will not be
             eligible to participate in the study.

          -  Subjects with any or all of the following ocular complications associated with or
             secondary to scleritis may also be eligible for enrollment:
