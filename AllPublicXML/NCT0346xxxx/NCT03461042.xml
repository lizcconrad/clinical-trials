      To investigate effects on combination use of Ramelteon in the dose reduction or interruption
      process of (non-)BZD hypnotics during the dose reduction or interruption algorithm.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypnotic 'Ramelteon' does not have effect on Gamma Aminobutyric Acid (GABA-A) receptor
      that relates to the formation of addiction to the BZD or non-BZD hypnotics. Some results of
      clinical trials has been reported that the dose reduction or interruption of (non-)BZD
      hypnotics was achieved on combination use of Ramelteon by using its characteristic of the
      action mechanism with safely and effectively. However, these results have not been confirmed
      with randomized controlled trials.
