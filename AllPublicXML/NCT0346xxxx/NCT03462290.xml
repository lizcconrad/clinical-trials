    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Persistent Idiopathic Facial Pain fulfilling diagnostic criteria as classified in The
             International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3 beta version)
             as modified by the authors of this trial. See below.

          -  Unsatisfactory effect of available treatment methods as evaluated by a neurologist,
             ENT specialist or maxillofacial surgeon. The patient should have failed treatment with
             both anticonvulsant as carbamazepine (Tegretol, Carbatrol) and antidepressant as
             tricyclic antidepressants

          -  Average Pain intensity ≥4 (0-10) in Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) on the affected
             side during the 4-week baseline period

          -  Written informed consent from the patient

        Modified diagnostic criteria for PIFP according to The International

        Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3 beta version):

        A. Facial and/or oral pain fulfilling criteria B and C.

        B. Recurring daily for &gt;2 hr per day for &gt;3 months

        C. Pain has both of the following characteristics:

          1. Poorly localized and may radiate beyond the trigeminal nerve distribution

          2. Dull, aching or nagging quality D. Clinical neurological examination is normal,
             however patient may denote paresthesia E. A dental cause has been excluded by
             appropriate investigations; signs of structural pathology or other specific causes of
             pain are not identified. Minor operation and injury (insignificant trauma e.g. tooth
             extraction) to the face, maxilla, teeth and gums without a direct causal relationship
             with the pain regarding both time and site is accepted. F. Not better accounted for by
             another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bilateral symmetrically affected

          -  Neurological disorders or other related systemic diseases that can explain the pain

          -  MRI/CT examination confirming intracranial pathology.

          -  Systemic or local disease or condition that can give a significantly increased risk of
             complications to the particular procedure

          -  Not competent to asses informed consent based on neurological assessment

          -  Psychiatric disorder that prevents the completion of the study

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Inappropriate use of contraception

          -  Breastfeeding

          -  Abuse or unauthorized use of medication, drugs or alcohol

          -  Allergy or other hypersensitivity reactions to marcaine, lidocaine, xylocaine, or
             adrenaline, possibly similar related drugs

          -  Anatomical factors that prevent or impede the injection

          -  Known hypersensitivity to botulinum toxin type A or to any of the excipients

          -  Treatment with drugs that can interact with botulinum toxin type A: aminoglycoside
             antibiotics, spectinomycin, neuromuscular blockers, both depolarizing
             (succinylcholine) and non-depolarizing (tubocurarine derivatives), lincosamides,
             polymyxins, quinidine, magnesium sulfate, anticholinesterases.
