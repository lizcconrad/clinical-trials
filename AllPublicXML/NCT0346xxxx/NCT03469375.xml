  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FOLFIRINOX regimen is first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapies for patients with locally
      advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) worldwide. However, FOLFIRINOX is not well accepted in
      China because of the high prevalence of adverse events and poor tolerance. To evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of modified-FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in Chinese LAPC patients and compare
      survival between LAPC patients with mFOLFIRINOX-based preoperative therapy and LAPC patients
      who underwent surgery alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At this institution, a mFOLFIRINOX regimen has been adopted for metastatic pancreatic cancer
      (MPC) patients and promising results obtained. The modification resulted in a significantly
      reduced prevalence of severe adverse events in MPC patients, whereas the OS and PFS were
      extended to 10.3m and 7.0m, respectively, which is similar to that for patients on a
      full-dose regimen. Therefore, the investigators further evaluated the efficacy of mFOLFIRINOX
      in LAPC patients. Here, investigators want to prospectively enroll LAPC patients who
      underwent preoperative therapy with mFOLFIRINOX from April 2014 and compared the surgical
      resectability and surgical morbidity/surgical mortality among patients with surgically
      resectable pancreatic cancer (RPC) or LAPC who underwent surgery alone retrospectively. For
      patients with LAPC, mFOLFIRINOX was administrated for several cycles until the optimal
      response was obtained and then patients were evaluated for surgery. Moreover, survival data,
      including OS and PFS, were determined.
