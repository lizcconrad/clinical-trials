    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) total score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MoCA scale assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. It is useful to characterize global cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies. The total possible score is 30 points; a score of 26 or above is considered normal.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-Plus) scale score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CIBIC-Plus scale is designed to measure various domains that describe participant function: general, mental/cognitive state, behavior, and activities of daily living. It is a semi-structured global rating derived from a comprehensive interview with the participant and caregiver or informant by an independent rater who has no access to the source data or other psychometric test scores conducted post-randomization as part of the protocol. The CIBIC-Plus scores are: 1 (marked improvement), 2 (moderate improvement), 3 (minimal improvement), 4 (no change), 5 (minimal worsening), 6 (moderate worsening), and 7 (marked worsening).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) total score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>This NPI scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The scale also assesses the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by each of the symptoms. It is rated from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater neuropsychiatric disturbance. A subscore covering the domains of delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and depression (NPI-4) will also be derived.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the NPI subscore at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The NPI subscore covers the 4 domains of delusions, hallucinations, apathy, and depression.</description>

    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the NPI caregiver score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The NPI scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The scale also assesses the degree of caregiver distress engendered by each of the symptoms. It is rated from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating a greater neuropsychiatric disturbance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The MMSE is a 30-point scale that measures orientation to time and place, registration, immediate and delayed recall, attention, language, and drawing. Scores range from 0 (most impaired) to 30 (no impairment).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change from baseline in the Cognitive Fluctuation Inventory (CFI) score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CFI scale assesses cognitive fluctuation with the same format as the NPI. It evaluates fluctuation in various domains including attention, ability to perform daily functions, orientation, verbal communication and behavior. It is scored based on frequency and severity with a score range of 0 to 12. The scale also assesses the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by the symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Clinician's Global Impression of Change - In Dementia With Lewy Bodies (CGIC-DLB) scale score at 12 weeks of treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGIC-DLB scale provides an overall clinician-determined summary measure of change from the participant's clinical status at the Baseline Visit that takes into account all available information from the efficacy endpoints (which include cognitive function, non-cognitive symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function) and safety data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with any treatment-emergent (TE) serious adverse event (SAE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (an adverse event [AE] is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment or within 28 days following the last dose of study drug, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with any non-serious TEAE</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 22 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A TEAE is defined as an AE that emerges during treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (baseline) or reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (baseline) but stopped before treatment, or worsens in severity during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is continuous. An AE is identified as: any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product (IP), whether or not related to the IP; any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease; any deterioration in nonprotocol-required measurements of a laboratory values or other clinical tests that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or discontinuation of study drug; recurrence of an intermittent medical condition not present pretreatment (Baseline); an abnormal laboratory test result if leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study drug, or withholding of study drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not.</description>
