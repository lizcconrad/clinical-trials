  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common malignant primary brain tumors. Despite
      multimodality aggressive therapies (surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy based on TMZ and
      adjuvant TMZ), median overall survival is only 12 to 15 months. This dramatic behavior is
      mainly due to the high invasiveness and proliferation rate of GBM.

      In addition, GBM exhibits a high resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
      Current strategies for the treatment of GBM are only palliative, and include surgical
      resection (which is frequently incomplete due to the proximity of the tumour to vital brain
      structures) and focal radiotherapy. A large number of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g.
      alkylating agents such as TMZ and nitrosoureas such as carmustine) have also been tested, but
      they display limited efficacy.

      The current gold standard first line treatment for glioma for patients less than 70 years old
      includes radiation and concurrent TMZ followed by adjuvant TMZ (i.e., the &quot;Stupp regimen&quot;).
      However, results are disappointing and there is an unmet medical need of new drugs in this
      setting.

      Glasdegib (SHH pathway inhibitor) is a rational therapeutic agent for patients with newly
      diagnosed Glioblastoma since inhibits SHH pathway interfering with cancer stem cells and
      endothelial migration.

          -  The effects of SHH pathway inhibitors on the developing human fetus are unknown. For
             this reason, women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence; surgical
             sterilization) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation and
             for at least 3 months thereafter. The definition of effective contraception will be
             based on the judgment of the principal investigator or a designated associate.

        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
        study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. All female patients with
        reproductive potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) within 2 weeks
        prior to starting treatment.

          -  Female subjects must either be of non-reproductive potential (ie, post-menopausal by
             history: ≥60 years old and no menses for ≥1 year without an alternative medical cause;
             OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of
             bilateral oophorectomy) or must have a negative serum pregnancy test upon study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of extracranial metastatic disease.

          -  Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Any surgery (not including minor diagnostic procedures such as lymph node biopsy)
             within 2 weeks of baseline disease assessments; or not fully recovered from any side
             effects of previous procedures.

          -  Any psychiatric or cognitive disorder that would limit the understanding or rendering
             of informed consent and/or compromise compliance with the requirements of this
             protocol.

          -  Any clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities, which may impair intake,
             transit or absorption of the study drug, such as the inability to take oral medication
             in tablet form.

          -  Congenital or known history of long QT syndrome, Torsades de pointes, arrhythmias
             (including sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, right or left bundle branch block
             and bifascicular block, unstable angina, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft,
             symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF New York Association class III or IV).

          -  Current (or within 6 months) significant cardiovascular disease, including, but not
             limited to myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack
             or symptomatic pulmonary embolism, bradycardia defined as &lt;50 bpms.

          -  Active cardiac dysrhythmias of NCI CTCAE Grade ≥2 (eg, atrial fibrillation) or QTcF
             interval (QTc using Fridericia's formula) &gt;470 msec.

          -  Active and clinically significant infections.

          -  Current use or anticipated requirement for drugs known to be moderate or strong
             cytochrome p450 inhibitors.

          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the
             following circumstances: Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible
             if they have been disease-free for at least 3 years and are deemed by the investigator
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 3 years: cervical cancer
             in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.

        Patients will not be eligible if they have evidence of other malignancy requiring therapy
        other than surgery within the last 3 years.

          -  Patients who have had prior stereotactic radiotherapy, convection enhanced delivery or
             brachytherapy (as gliosis/scarring from these modalities may limit delivery).

          -  Patients will not be eligible if they present with leptomeningeal dissemination.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the potential for teratogenic or
             abortifacient effects is unknown (glasdegib has been shown to be teratogenic in
             nonclinical embryo-fetal development studies in rats and mice at subtherapeutic
             exposures). Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in
             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated.

          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because
             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions. In addition, these individuals are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to glasdegib.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical condition, uncontrolled intercurrent illness or
             laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated with trial participation
             or investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             trial results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the patient
             inappropriate for entry into this trial.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or male or female patients of
             reproductive potential who are not willing to employ highly effective birth control
             from screening to 180 days after the last dose of the study treatment.
