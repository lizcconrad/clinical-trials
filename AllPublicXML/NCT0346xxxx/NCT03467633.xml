  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study looking at the feasibility of conducting a larger definitive research trial
      looking at the effectiveness of high intensity interval training in individuals who are
      scheduled for electro-cardioversion. Usual care for these participants is to go home and
      continue with their typical daily routine. The investigators will test whether participating
      in 3-weeks of thrice-weekly high intensity interval training before electro-cardioversion can
      lengthen the time to recurrence of atrial fibrillation after electro-cardioversion in these
      individuals. Participants will be asked to come to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute
      for a baseline visit at which fitness (cycle ergometer), body composition (weight, height,
      waist circumference and percentage body fat), heart rate variability and habitual exercise
      levels will be measured. Participants will then be randomized to either the exercise group or
      the usual care group. Those randomized to the usual care group will go home for 3-weeks and
      continue with their typical daily routine. Those randomized to the exercise group will return
      to the Heart Institute three times per week for 3-weeks to participate in a high intensity
      interval training program prior to their electro-cardioversion. All participants will be
      asked to measure daily heart rate and rhythm using the AliveCor system which is compatible
      with their Smartphones, for up to 12-months following their electro-cardioversion. All
      participants will be asked to return at 3-weeks (and prior to their electro-cardioversion) to
      measure fitness (cycle ergometer), body composition (weight, height, waist circumference and
      percentage body fat), heart rate variability and habitual exercise levels. The entire study
      should last approximately 15-months. Participants will be involved for 52-weeks. The
      investigators are looking to recruit 40 participants total for the feasibility trial. The
      investigators hypothesize that recruitment rates, drop-out rates, and adherence to the
      intervention will support a larger definitive trial.

    <description>Participants will also be asked to complete a questionnaire related to habitual physical activity (modified Godin) at baseline and follow-up. The modified Godin asks participants to recall the last 7 days and report the number of days and the number of minutes per day they participated in mild, moderate and vigorous bouts of physical activity. These values are then multiplied together to calculate minutes/week of mild physical activity and minutes/ week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity.</description>
