  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to better understand and test if the investigators can minimize
      narcotic medication for controlling pain after thyroid or parathyroid surgery. This research
      will be performed at Doctors Hospital At Renaissance in the investigators clinic and the
      perioperative area.

      Participants will be randomly chosen to receive one of two options for pain management that
      the investigators are already using in the care of patients after surgery. One option
      includes a narcotic medication and one option includes a non-narcotic and a narcotic as
      needed.

      Participants will be asked to complete a form about the level of pain and how much pain
      medication was needed after surgery in the hospital and while at home. Participants will not
      have to do any additional visits to participate in this study. The investigators will obtain
      the research materials at the same time as the usual care visits around the participants'
      surgery.

      A study team member will give the participant a copy of the informed consent form to read.
      Participants will have a chance to ask questions about the study before agreeing to
      participate. If participants agree, they will be randomly chosen to receive one of two
      options for pain management that the investigators are already using in the care of patients
      (option 1: Tylenol (also known as acetaminophen) with tramadol if needed, or option 2:
      Tylenol #3 as needed) after surgery.

      Participants will be asked to complete a form about the level of pain and how much pain
      medication was needed after surgery in the hospital and while at home. Participants will come
      to the GME General Surgery Center approximately one week after surgery for a post-operative
      visit so that the investigators can see how much pain medication was used and how much pain
      the participant had in the first few days after surgery.

      Participants will not have to do any additional visits to participate in this study. The
      investigators will obtain the research materials at the same time as the usual care visits
      around the participants' surgery. It should take approximately 2 minutes each day to
      complete.

             only.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who undergo lateral neck lymph node dissection will be excluded from the
             study due to the extent of the operation requiring a different analgesic regimen;
