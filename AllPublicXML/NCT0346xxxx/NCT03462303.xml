  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and dopamine (DA) have been implicated in the
      control of cognitive flexibility. However, while a great deal of what it is know regarding a
      causative relationship between cognitive flexibility and its neuronal underpinning comes from
      animal studies, human data have largely been correlational (i.e. imaging investigations). In
      a recent study, the current research group examined whether putative increases in dopamine
      levels through tyrosine administration and blockage of these by cathodal (i.e. inhibitory)
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dlPFC could be causally related to
      cognitive flexibility as measured by task switching and reversal learning.

      The next step involves finding a way of lowering dopamine concentrations while anodal (i.e.
      excitatory) stimulation of the dlPFC is applied and cognitive flexibility measured. One
      experimental approach to reduce global DA synthesis and transmission is through acute
      phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD). This dietary intervention involves the
      administration of an amino-acid mixture lacking in tyrosine and phenylalanine, which can be
      used to selectively lower DA synthesis in humans.
