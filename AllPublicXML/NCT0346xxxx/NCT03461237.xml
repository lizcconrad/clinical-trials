      1. To Compare overall rates of second hip fractures in both genders,

        2. To determine the effect of hip fracture on proximal femoral volumetric bone mineral
           density (vBMD), bone structure and muscle by quantitative computed tomography(QCT),

        3. To evaluate the contribution of QCT-image analysis to the prediction of the second hip
           fracture risk.

        4. To identify the differences between femoral neck fracture and trochanter fracture
           following hip fracture

      Osteoporotic hip fracture is a great harm among elderly people, for whom disability and death
      often occurs. Furthermore, sustaining an osteoporotic hip fracture increases the risk of a
      subsequent fracture. However, the risk factors of subsequent hip fractures are less studied
      and the proximal femur bone structure and muscle changes following first hip fracture are
      little known.

      Therefore, we propose to conduct an observational and perspective study to assess the effect
      of hip fracture on proximal femoral bone and muscle using quantitative computed tomography
      (QCT), as well as to evaluate the contribution of QCT-image analysis to the prediction of the
      second hip fracture risk. As hip fractures are divided into two major anatomic based types in
      clinical: femoral neck fractures (intracapsular) and trochanter fractures (extracapsular),
      the fundamental objective also includes identifying bone and muscle differences in a union
      activity between the two type fractures. Compared with duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry
      (DXA), QCT offers the advantage of selective measurement of the metabolically active and
      structurally important trabecular bone in the proximal femoral. Volumetric BMD and structure
      of proximal femoral and muscle around hip will be measured with QCT. The CT scanner will be
      the clinical CT scanner of the local participated center. Quality control and monitoring will
      be conducted by Beijing Jishuitan hospital, as well as the centralised image interpretation.
