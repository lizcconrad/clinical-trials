  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a condition that results in long-term
      bladder and pelvic pain. IC/BPS affects women more often than men. How the disorder develops
      is not completely known, but one thought is that IC/BPS is closely related to other chronic
      pain conditions like irritable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Although several options are
      available to treat IC/BPS, the therapy effects often don't last long. Studies in chronic pain
      disorders have shown that oral gabapentin is effective in relieving pain in these patients
      and some studies suggest that oral gabapentin also improves IC/BPS symptoms. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the effectiveness of oral gabapentin combined with bladder
      instillations to treat IC/BPS in women. The study hypothesis is that women with IC/BPS
      treated with bladder instillations and gabapentin will have improved outcomes compared to
      women treated with bladder instillations and placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a chronic pain disorder involving the
      genitourinary tract. IC/BPS disproportionately affects women, with women constituting over
      80% of patients with IC/BPS. Like other chronic pain conditions, IC/BPS is physically and
      emotionally taxing on patients. IC/BPS costs the United States over $100 million annually due
      to direct healthcare costs and loss of worker productivity. The exact pathophysiology of the
      disease is unknown, leading to a limitation in our ability to treat the disorder effectively.
      The current leading etiologic theory is that IC/BPS is a neurologically-derived chronic
      systemic pain syndrome due to its association with musculoskeletal pelvic pain, irritable
      bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. Although several
      options exist to treat IC/BPS, therapeutic effects are often transient. Previous studies in
      chronic pain disorders have shown that multimodal treatment is more effective than
      single-agent treatment, so future therapy should aim to augment rather than replace current
      treatments. Gabapentin is a safe and cost-effective anti-epileptic medication that is
      commonly used to manage both acute and chronic pain. There are limited data to suggest that
      perioperative use of gabapentin potentiates analgesic effect and decreases the risk of
      developing chronic pain for up to six months after surgery. Gabapentin has even shown
      efficacy in bladder pain associated with catheters. Small clinical studies have demonstrated
      that oral gabapentin improves IC/BPS symptoms. Gabapentin is an effective adjuvant in
      treating general pain and likely helps prolong treatment effects, but it has not been trialed
      in this mode for IC/BPS. The knowledge gap that exists is whether gabapentin can improve
      patient response when used as an adjuvant treatment for IC/BPS symptoms.

      To evaluate the utility of gabapentin in the treatment of IC/BPS, the study investigators
      propose a randomized, triple blind, placebo-controlled trial that will compare the efficacy
      of bladder instillations with and without adjuvant oral gabapentin on IC/BPS symptoms in
      women. The hypothesis is that combining oral gabapentin and bladder instillation therapy will
      result in a more robust treatment response than bladder instillations alone. This rationale
      is based on 1) the shared pathophysiology of chronic pain and IC/BPS, 2) the effectiveness of
      multimodal treatment in both chronic pain and IC/BPS, and 3) the success of gabapentin in the
      treatment of chronic pain.
