      This is a Phase I single-center, two-arm, open-label, randomized study in healthy
      HIV-negative women to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and bleeding patterns associated
      with 90-day use of matrix vaginal rings containing 200 mg Dapivirine and 320 mg
      Levonorgestrel.

      This 26 week study will be conducted at one site. The site will enroll 24 subjects. Subjects
      will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens:

      Regimen A: vaginal ring used continuously for approximately 90 days Regimen B: vaginal ring
      used cyclically for approximately 90 days: used for ~28 days, then removed,washed and stored
      for 2 days. The same ring will be used for 2 additional cycles in a similar fashion.

             1 (Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies [Dated November 2007])
             Note: Cervical bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or specimen collection
             judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical judgment of the
             IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.
