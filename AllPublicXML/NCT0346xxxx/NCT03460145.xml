      This study aims to use aromatherapy (Lavender oil) to reduce Preoperative Anxiety among
      Female patients coming for elective surgeries under General Anesthesia.

      As a consequence of that, the effect is also evaluated on how that influences the amount of
      intravenous sedation is required during induction for General Anesthesia.

    <description>Self reported anxiety score before and after inhalation of aromatherapy. 3 questions about preoperative anxiety are asked and scoring is done based on a 0-10cm scale (0= no anxiety, 10= agonizing anxiety). Cumulative scores for all 3 questions above 5 indicates preoperative anxiety.</description>
