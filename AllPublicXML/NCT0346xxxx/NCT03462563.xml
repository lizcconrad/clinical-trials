  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled study. The study population will include 220
      subjects scheduled to undergo laparoscopic radical resection of rectal carcinoma with
      preventive ileostomy (Phase 1 operation).

      During the Phase 1 operation, when the definite decision to create a temporary ostomy is
      made, patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to either the treatment arm (INTERCEED™) or
      the control arm (standard of care treatment: no adhesion barrier, no placebo). In subjects
      assigned to the treatment arm, the INTERCEED™ must be applied beneath the target incision
      site (the midline incision mainly for the removal specimen). The subjects will return 6-9
      months after the phase 1 operation (colorectal resection with temporary ileostomy) for phase
      2 operation, to have their diverting ostomy taken down (ileostomy reversal). During the phase
      2 operation (ileostomy reversal), the incidence, extent and severity of adhesions will be
      evaluated through the laparoscope from the ostomy site abdominal wall opening before
      submersion of the bowel loop into the peritoneal cavity and abdominal wound closure

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects elder than 18 years of age who require laparoscopic colorectal resection with the
        formation of a temporary diverting loop ileostomy and a planned closure of diverting
        ileostomy within 6 to 9 months The subjects should be willing to participate in the study,
        comply with study requirements, follow-up schedule, and give written informed consent prior
        to any study-related procedures The target incision length less than 8cm allowing the
        INTERCEED (product length 10.2cm) to overlap at least 1cm beyond each pole of the incision
        The subject is believed to have life expectancy more than 12 months after Phase 1
        operation, based on investigators assessment.
