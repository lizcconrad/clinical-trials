  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since diabetes is a chronic disease closely related to unhealthy lifestyle, the improvement
      and management of living habits are as significant as medical care with regard to the
      disease. In addition, this is regarded as the most effective method for prevention and
      treatment of diabetes. However, many diabetic patients are now reported to lack proper
      management in Korea with a low level of compliance with treatment instruction. In that sense,
      it is urgently necessary to develop a program in which diabetic patients are able to
      effectively manage their own blood glucose at home, and to grasp the real state of self-blood
      glucose measurement. Accordingly, a system to manage diabetes using electronic equipment such
      as mobile phone or the Internet is currently being developed and studied, for the effective
      management of diabetes with the help of highly evolving information technology. These
      investigators have developed a diabetes management program that provides an optimal solution
      based on a mobile device and software, so that individual patients can undergo a regular
      blood glucose test and achieve improvement and constant management of living habits by being
      properly informed of how to manage diabetes. This clinical study was designed to evaluate the
      effectiveness and efficacy of the application through the comparison between usual medical
      care and additional care using the smartphone application, targeting patients with type 2
      diabetes who lack blood glucose control. This study is targeted at the subjects who are being
      treated at this hospital's endocrinology, are using a smartphone, and voluntarily signed the
      informed consent form (ICF). The subjects who pass the subject eligibility evaluation provide
      information regarding assessment items and demographic information using the smartphone
      application and questionnaire. Based on the information given by subjects, the medical team
      offers a management system that supports and improves the existing treatment process of
      diabetes using the application developed on its own. The feasibility and effectiveness of the
      management using the application are evaluated through the result values of the laboratory
      tests performed during the subject's usual medical care.
