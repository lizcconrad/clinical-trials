  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disordered gambling is associated to high impulsivity and excessive risk-taking behaviour.
      These behavioural characteristics related to addiction are linked to cognitive processes in
      specific brain areas located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

      With the aim of studying the role of PFC in disordered gambling, the investigators employ
      transcranial current direct stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique
      that applies a very weak electrical current to the superficial areas of the brain.

      The clinical phase of the research consists on studying the effects of tDCS in combination
      with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in patients that attend the United Kingdom (UK)
      National Problem Gambling Clinic. The main objective of the project is to investigate whether
      this technique can help to decrease impulsivity and risk-taking behaviour, and therefore
      offer improved opportunities for the treatment of disordered gambling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to have a total of 96 participants diagnosed with disordered gambling
      with the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI). There will be 24 participants per condition
      (2 treatment groups x 2 conditions per group).

      Participants will be split into two different treatment groups depending on whether they
      receive cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) after their tDCS session or not:

      Treatment 1. Participants will attend 5 weekly sessions where they receive tDCS stimulation
      for 20 minutes, while complete CANTAB cognitive tasks to measure Executive Functions (EF) and
      gambling behaviour.

      Treatment 2. Participants will attend 5 weekly sessions where they receive tDCS stimulation
      for 20 minutes, while complete CANTAB cognitive tasks to measure Executive Functions (EF) and
      gambling behaviour, and following this, they will also attend to a weekly CBT session.

      In each treatment group, participants will be allocated to either one of two different
      stimulation conditions: &quot;Real stimulation&quot; condition involves the application of tDCS or
      &quot;Sham stimulation&quot; condition that is used as a control (similar to a placebo).

      Participants will complete cognitive questionnaires (Gambling Related Cognitions Scale,
      Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance and Sensation Seeking (UPPS) Impulsivity Scale and
      Active Open Minded Thinking Scale) in the first and last sessions (session 1 and session 5).

    <description>It contains 23 items using a 1-7 point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree, related to 5 types of gambling-related biases measured by the following subscales: illusion of control (possible values: 1-28), predictive control (possible values: 1-28), interpretative bias (possible values: 1-42), gambling expectancies (possible values: 1-35) and inability to stop gambling (possible values: 1-28). The total raw GRCS score (possible values: 5-161) will be measured by adding the five raw subscale scores. Higher scores represent higher level of cognitive distortions.</description>
