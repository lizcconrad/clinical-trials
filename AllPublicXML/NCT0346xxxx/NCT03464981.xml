  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this pilot analysis is to characterize the hemodynamic changes that
      occur during implantation of a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in patients with
      advanced heart failure - specifically, how right ventricular function is compromised as a
      result of LVAD implantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  individuals ≥ 18 years of age with severe heart failure (HF) and who have been
             approved by the advanced HF selection committee for LVAD implantation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with pre-existing right ventricular (RV) dysfunction/failure, defined as:

               1. Imaging evidence of moderate-severe RV dysfunction on echocardiography

               2. Hemodynamic evidence of RV dysfunction with:

                    -  a right-atrial pressure (RAP): pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP)
                       ratio of ≥ 0.67 (note: this index compares pressures on the right [RAP] and
                       left [PCWP] side of the heart;

                    -  an RAP/PCWP ratio ≥ 0.67 provides hemodynamic evidence of RV dysfunction.

               3. Clinical evidence of preexisting RV dysfunction, as indicated by significant
                  (3-4+ peripheral edema) and/or elevated jugular venous pressures on clinical
                  examination.

               4. Patients with end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis

               5. Patients requiring temporary hemodynamic support prior to LVAD implantation with
                  temporary LVADs, and/or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenators
                  (&quot;ECMO&quot;).

               6. Planned concurrent implantation of right ventricular assist device
