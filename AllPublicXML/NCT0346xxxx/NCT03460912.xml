  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative nerve monitoring is often used in many centers during thyroidectomy. According
      to the investigators' knowledge, there's no study showing superiority between bipolar and
      monopolar stimulation probes used for nerve monitoring during thyroid surgery. In this study,
      the investigators aimed to compare two different types of probes and find out
      superiorities.Twenty-one patients who underwent primary total thyroidectomy or
      hemithyroidectomy were included in the study. During surgery, amplitude and latency values
      obtained in the same patient with both bipolar and monopolar stimulation probes from 10
      different anatomical spots [vagal nerve, recurrent laryngeal nerve inferior portion,
      recurrent laryngeal nerve superior portion, external branch of superior laryngeal nerve
      (EBSLN)] were recorded prospectively, both when sheath was intact and after being dissected.
