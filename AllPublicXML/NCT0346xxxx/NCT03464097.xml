    <description>CDEIS (Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity) is an index for determining the severity of Crohn's disease with endoscopic localization to ileum and colon. CDEIS score considers 4 parameters (deep ulcerations, superficial ulcerations, surface involved by disease, and surface involved by ulcerations), each one evaluated in 5 pre-defined segments of the colon (ileum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon and sigmoid loop, and rectum). The score can be calculated even in case of incomplete investigations, as the results of the individual segments are divided by the number of segments investigated. The presence of stenosis, as a result of ulcer or not, increases the score at the end of the computation.</description>
