  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders, with a
      global prevalence of 11% according to a recent meta-analysis. The total cost of managing IBS
      in the United States is in excess of $30 billion per year, including indirect costs relating
      to loss of productivity of more than $20 billion. Abdominal pain/discomfort (i.e. visceral
      hypersensitivity) is present in all patients with IBS and remains the most therapy-resistant
      symptom. Apart from abdominal pain, which is measured subjectively using visual scales,
      several studies have shown a significant increase in rectal sensitivity, which is measured
      objectively using an inflatable balloon. Drugs which are shown to have objective effects on
      visceral hypersensitivity are crucial in the management of IBS.

      While certain drugs have shown to decrease abdominal pain, there is very little data to
      substantiate objective changes in visceral hypersensitivity. Rifaximin is a poorly absorbed
      antibiotic and the exact underlying mechanism of action for rifaximin in reducing the pain
      component of IBS remains unknown. However, rifaximin has been shown in randomized controlled
      trials to decrease abdominal discomfort in all subtypes of IBS.

      The investigators hypothesize that rifaximin is effective in decreasing rectal visceral
      hypersensitivity in IBS patients. In this study, the investigators propose to test this
      hypothesis by measuring visceral hypersensitivity using the graded balloon distention test,
      before and after a course of rifaximin. To test whether this effect is accompanied by
      treating SIBO, the investigators will also perform lactulose breath tests before and after
      rifaximin therapy.

    <description>40 subjects with diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) or mixed IBS (IBS-M) will be enrolled in the study. At the first clinic visit, subjects will undergo rectal sensitivity testing, as well as lactulose breath testing. Subjects will be asked to record their symptoms and bowel habits in a diary over the next 7 days. During the second clinic visit, subjects will receive a 14-day course of rifaximin (550 mg PO TID). During these 14 days, subjects will record their symptoms and bowel habits. Subjects will return to the clinic after completion of the medication and will undergo repeat evaluation via rectal sensitivity testing to assess for change in rectal sensitivity.</description>
