    <textblock>
      The current project seeks to explore the use of emergent biosensor technology to detect
      opioid use. The investigators goal is to recruit 60 opioid naïve patients presenting at the
      College of Dentistry at UTHSC. Candidate participants must be scheduled for an upcoming
      dental procedure that will involve subsequent pain management using oral opioid medication.
      Participants will be consented prior to any study procedures. All participant information
      from this study will be kept strictly confidential (e.g., no individual data will be shared
      with the College of Dentistry).

    <textblock>
      Opioid overdose is a leading cause of accidental death in the USA, with death rates rising
      steadily over the last 20 years (CDC, 2015). Of the over 22,000 deaths relating to
      pharmaceutical overdose in 2011, three quarters involved opioid analgesics (Fletcher et al.,
      2011). Increases in problematic opioid use have paralleled a corresponding increase in drug
      treatment admissions (DOHH, 2014). Drug treatment programs currently focus on behavioral and
      pharmacologic interventions to sustain abstinence, and success is typically measured by
      self-reports or urine drug screening (NIDA, 2016). Both measurement methods are limited by
      such factors as recall bias, distortion, and lack of precision (Fishman et al., 2000). A
      detection method that accurately detects opioid use as it occurs in real time would provide
      several distinct advantages, including the ability to obtain environmental and behavioral
      contexts surrounding relapse as well as an opportunity for targeted interventions.

      The current project seeks to explore the use of emergent biosensor technology to detect
      opioid use. The investigators goal is to recruit 60 opioid naïve patients presenting at the
      College of Dentistry at UTHSC. Candidate participants must be scheduled for an upcoming
      dental procedure that will involve subsequent pain management using oral opioid medication.
      Participants will be consented prior to any study procedures. All participant information
      from this study will be kept strictly confidential (e.g., no individual data will be shared
      with the College of Dentistry).

      Participants who are enrolled will complete baseline questionnaires regarding psychological
      and behavioral risks of substance use. Next, participants will be asked to wear the wristband
      sensor for 1 day prior to surgery, and up to 30 days post-surgery, or as long as opioid
      medication is prescribed. Physiological measurement will be conducted via the Empatica E4
      wristband biosensor, which measures electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and locomotion
      data. Opioid use will detected through biosensor activity. Participants will be recruited
      over a 6 month period, in cohorts of 10. All study procedures will be approved by the UTHSC
      IRB.

      Hilbert transform analyses combined with paired t-tests will be used to compare the biosensor
      data: (A) within subjects, before and after administration of opioids; and (B) between
      subjects, controlling for hand dominance, gender, and length of prescription.

      Results of analyses will be shared with the College of Dentistry, and will subsequently be
      disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication.

      Role of the College of Dentistry:

        -  To refer patients to Karen Derefinko's study team for possible recruitment into the
           study prior to the scheduled surgery.

        -  If possible, to allow a research coordinator to consent and interview participants on
           site in an available private room.

        -  To provide prescription data (type, dose, and duration) to study team, with signed
           participant consent.

      Epigenetics:

      Environmental exposures including prescription drugs and drugs of abuse can have a pronounce
      effect on the epigenome (Nestler, 2014; Nielsen et al., 2012). There is growing evidence that
      use of opioids results in changes in DNA methylation, an important epigenetic modification
      that can alter gene expression. Such changes may play a mechanistic role in forming an
      &quot;epigenetic memory&quot; of drug exposure and development of dependence (Doehring et al., 2013;
      Tuesta &amp; Zhang, 2014). For this study, the coordinator will collect buccal swabs (cheek
      epithelial cells) from study subjects at the start of study and at follow up visits. Buccal
      cells will be collected non-invasively using the DNA Genotek sample collection kits
      (http://www.dnagenotek.com). The investigator will then perform genome-wide DNA methylation
      assay using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array (https://www.illumina.com). The
      investigator will evaluate the longitudinal change in the methylome that may be induced by
      short-term opioid use.
