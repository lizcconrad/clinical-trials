  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study had the goal of analyse the neurophysiologic effects of both mechanical and manual
      cervical manipulation, in asymptomatic individuals.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators compared the effects of manual manipulation and instrument
      assisted manipulation of C3/C4 on muscle tone, elasticity and stiffness and on pressure pain
      threshold , and pressure pain perception. The muscles evaluated were upper trapezius and
      biceps brachialis, bilaterally. The study also had a placebo and a control group. All
      individuals were asymptomatic.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain thresholds</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the pressure pain threshold, it was used an electronic pressure dynamometer FORCE ONE™ FDIX (Wagner Instruments - Greenwich, USA), with 1cm2 of surface. The values were expressed in Kg/cm2. The pressure was increased at a rate of 1 kg/cm2/s until the subject inform that the sense of pressure has become a sense of pain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the pressure pain perception, it was used a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The pressure increased until 2,5 kg/cm2 and was hold for 5 seconds, and the subject used the VAS scale to record the pressure pain perception he felt.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle tone</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To measure muscle tone it was used the MyotonPro device. It was used to evaluate those parameters both on the biceps and on the upper trapezius, bilaterally. The device was located perpendicular to the middle point of each muscle and it were recorded 6 impulses in each one of them. The non-neural tone was recorded as frequency.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To measure muscle stiffness it was used the MyotonPro device. It was used to evaluate this parameter both on the biceps and on the upper trapezius, bilaterally. The device was located perpendicular to the middle point of each muscle and it were recorded 6 impulses in each one of them. The muscle stiffness was recorded as N/m.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Muscle elasticity</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after the intervention</time_frame>
    <description>To measure muscle elasticity it was used the MyotonPro device. It was used to evaluate those parameters both on the biceps and on the upper trapezius, bilaterally. The device was located perpendicular to the middle point of each muscle and it were recorded 6 impulses in each one of them. The elasticity was indicated by logarithmic decrement.</description>

    <description>In the Manual manipulation group, the thrust was applied in the right side of C3/C4 with neutral flexion/extension, ipsilateral side bending and contralateral rotation. Then, a low amplitude, high velocity thrust in rotation was delivered.</description>
