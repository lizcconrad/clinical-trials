      Demonstrate the ability of subjects suffering from sinus pain to self-treat with the SYNUS
      Pain Relief device and to obtain pain relief compared to a sham/placebo device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A prospective study of at least 58 recruited subjects suffering from sinus pain. At least 30
      of the subjects will be randomly selected to use the SYNUS Pain Relief device, a device that
      uses micro-currents to stimulate major nerve fibers passing from the sinus passages through
      various foramina to the facial skin. Subjects will read manufacturer's provided
      Instructions-For-Use (IFU's) and without help from staff will proceed to self-perform the
      treatment. The other subjects will follow the same procedure but use a sham/placebo device
      with no stimulating current. Subjects will be blinded as to the device they use. Prior to and
      10 minutes following the stimulation, subjects will score their pain level on a visual
      analogue scale.
