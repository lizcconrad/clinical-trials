  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The guidance on Safe abortion technology by the World Health Organization (WHO 2012) suggests
      the evaluation of internet provision and telemedicine, as further alternative service
      delivery channels of safe abortion, as a subject for future research (WHO 2012) Our studies
      have shown that telemedicine and provision of medical abortion through wow is safe,
      acceptable and with outcomes similar to medical abortion provided traditionally following
      face-to-face counselling. Furthermore, recently home self-assessment of the abortion outcome
      through a low sensitivity U-hCg test was shown to be highly acceptable to women. To evaluate
      whether counselling through telemedicine is non-inferior to face-to face counselling a RCT
      will be conducted including women who chose medical abortion up to 63 days of gestation with
      home administration of misoprostol and self assessment of the outcome. The results of this
      study could be of major importance to increase access to safe and acceptable abortion
      services.
