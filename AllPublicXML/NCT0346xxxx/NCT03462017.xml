      Primary Objective:

      To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of SAR247799 on macrovascular endothelial function of
      the brachial artery using flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus (T2DM).

      Secondary Objective:

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of SAR247799 on microvascular endothelial function
           using laser Doppler perfusion monitoring in patients with T2DM.

        -  To assess the safety profile of SAR247799 in patients with T2DM.

        -  To assess the plasma pharmacokinetic profile of SAR247799 in patients with T2DM.
