  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of a combination of
      Astaxanthin (2 mg), Lycopene (1.8 mg), and d-alpha-Tocopherol (10 IU) in terms of its skin
      anti-aging properties. Specifically, the investigators aim to determine the increase in
      hydration levels of the skin, decrease in atypical skin pigmentation, and reduction of signs
      of photoaging, particularly facial fine lines.
