  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incompatibility between non-genetically identical donors and recipients has been increasingly
      recognized as the main contributing factor to solid allograft rejection and failure, through
      the triggering of donor-specific responses mediated by T- and B-lymphocytes. The Human
      Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) system has been identified as the main target of donor-specific
      responses, especially through the production by the recipient of antibodies directed toward
      non-self donor HLA molecules expressed on the allograft endothelium. As a consequence, in
      organ transplantation, the current approach to immunological risk stratification, patient
      monitoring and rejection diagnosis is based on biomarkers derived from the HLA system.
      However, this approach does not provide a sufficient accuracy for the risk stratification and
      the diagnosis of immunological complications in solid organ transplantation, which still
      remain the dominant cause of allograft failure.

      A recent body of evidence supports that specific non-HLA antigens expressed on the allograft
      endothelium may be relevant to allograft rejection, suggesting that a new strategy to
      transplant diagnostic testing at a non-HLA level would help to overcome the limitations of
      the current HLA-based approach to immunological assessment of transplant recipients. Among
      antibodies to non-HLA endothelial antigens, angiotensin II type 1 receptor activating
      antibodies have been the most widely reported antibodies to associate with the occurrence of
      allograft rejection, dysfunction and loss, even if their independent role, with respect to
      the presence of concomitant anti-HLA antibodies, has not been demonstrated.

      The aims of this study are:

        1. To assess the incidence of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor
           antibodies within the first year after transplantation in an unselected population of
           kidney transplant recipients.

        2. To investigate the incidence of biopsy-proven kidney allograft rejection according to
           the presence of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies and of
           post-transplant concomitant donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies within the first year
           after transplantation, and to evaluate the incidence of rejection cases associated with
           anti-angiotensin II type 1-receptor antibodies that are not recognized by the current
           diagnostic approach based on HLA testing.

        3. To investigate the allograft injury phenotype associated with post-transplant
           anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor, using histopathology, immunochemistry and
           measurement of endothelial-associated transcript (ENDAT) expression level in allograft.

        4. To evaluate the impact of post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies
           on kidney allograft survival up to 7 years after inclusion, in univariate and
           multivariable survival models including clinical, histological and immunological risk
           factors for allograft loss.

      This study includes kidney recipients transplanted between January 1, 2008 and December 31,
      2012 at Necker and Saint-Louis Hospitals (Paris, France), who undergo screening for
      post-transplant anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor antibodies and simultaneous kidney
      allograft biopsy within the first year after transplantation, either at the time of an
      episode of rejection in the first year after transplantation or at 1 year after
      transplantation in the absence of previous rejection episode.
