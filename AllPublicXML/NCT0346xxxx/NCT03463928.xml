  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (Allo-HSCT) is routinely used for treatment of
      aggressive hematological malignancies. The biological foundation of allo-HSCT is the
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which is primarily mediated by donor T cells present in
      the graft and is able to eradicate malignant B cells either CD19+ or CD19-. Relapse following
      an allo-HSCT remains a major challenge in the treatment of B-ALL. CD19-directed CAR-T cell
      therapy has shown promising results for the treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell
      malignancies; however, a subset of patients relapse due to the loss of CD19 in tumor cells.
      Co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and
      donor-derived-HSCT has the potential to combine the CAR-T cell mediated targeted elimination
      of CD19 expressing B cells with GVL effect, which could have clear advantages in reducing the
      risk of relapse and the evolution of CD19− escape variants or clonally related malignancies
      in other lineages. Therefore, a complete and durable tumor responses induced by this
      immunotherapy could be expected.

      1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. To evaluate the feasibility and safety of donor-derived HSCT following
                donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells in
                patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia.

             2. To evaluate the duration of in vivo persistence of adoptively transferred CAR-T
                cells, and the phenotype of persisting T cells. Real Time polymerase chain receptor
                (RT-PCR) and Flow cytometry(FCM) analysis of PB,BM will be used to detect and
                quantify survival of infused allo-CAR-T cells over time.

             3. To evaluate the donor chimerism after co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22
                bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T cells and donor-derived-HSCT

        2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

             1. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to
                co-infusion of donor-derived CD19/22 bispecific CAR-T cells or CD19-directed CAR-T
                cells and donor-derived-HSCT.

      The allo-CAR-T cells will be infused in a fractionated manner, 1/3 on day 0, 2/3 on day 1.The
      allo-HSCT will be infused on day 2.
