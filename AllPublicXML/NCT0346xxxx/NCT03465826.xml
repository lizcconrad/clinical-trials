    <textblock>
      This ClinicalTrials.gov record pertains only to the clinical trial described below in Aim 4.
      Aims 1-3 and 5 are described here as background information. This study will be a two-site
      collaborative research effort (Wake Forest &amp; Duke Univ.) drawing on expertise of
      investigators steeped in PCST, Internet-based treatment delivery, and development of
      cost-efficient and maximally-accessible behavioral interventions for migraine and chronic
      pain. This research will address four specific aims via a mixed-methods approach. In Aim 1
      subjects (n=20) will be recruited to participate in user testing of the extant program
      (PainCOACH1). In Aim 2 subjects (n=64, including migraineurs, members of migraine patient
      advocacy groups, and clinical professionals trained in headache medicine) will participate in
      focus groups to provide guidance for appropriately tailoring the program for the treatment of
      chronic migraine. In Aim 3 feedback from Aims 1 and 2 will be employed to build and develop
      PainCOACH Migraine which will be beta-tested and refined. In Aim 4 subjects (n=144) will be
      recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled trial of the PainCOACH Migraine program
      (versus Medical Treatment as Usual) to demonstrate its feasibility, acceptability and
      engagement, and promise. Guided by findings from these aims a final exploratory aim will be
      conducted to optimize the program using prediction models to identify patients at risk for
      poor outcomes or attrition, and an adaptive therapeutic process targeting improved outcomes
      for such patients. Ultimately these research efforts will provide data and experience needed
      to support a subsequent large-scale and methodologically rigorous adaptive trial to test
      PainCOACH Migraine and enhance understanding of the potentials for Internet-based delivery of
      behavioral programs for individuals with chronic migraine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to experiencing chronic pain, disability, and diminished quality of life,
      individuals with chronic migraine face critical access barriers to traditional, validated,
      clinic-based behavioral headache treatments (eg, availability of trained therapists, cost,
      absences from work). Internet-based and mHealth technologies show promise for the treatment
      of chronic pain conditions and are primed to address barriers to treatment, but have not yet
      been optimally translated into interventions for chronic migraine. A program of development
      is proposed to transform a validated, 8-week Internet-based pain-coping skills training
      (PCST) program (PainCOACH I; original) into a version specific for chronic migraine.

      PainCOACH I was designed to retain key therapeutic components of in-clinic protocols and
      includes 8 modules of self-directed, tailored, interactive training in cognitive behavioral
      pain coping skills. A &quot;virtual coach&quot; provides verbal and visual instruction, feedback, and
      encouragement guided by theoretically-based learning principles. PainCOACH I has been
      successfully tested for populations with osteoarthritis and cancer pain, and has been studied
      in the US and Australia.

      This clinical trial registration pertains only to Aim 4 of the study. In Aim 4 subjects
      (n=144) will be recruited to participate in a randomized, controlled trial of the PainCOACH
      Migraine program (versus Medical Treatment as Usual) to demonstrate its feasibility,
      acceptability and engagement, and promise.

    <description>&quot;Feasibility and Engagement&quot; represent a single outcome measure that is measured using the PainCOACH Feasibility Questionnaire, which was developed by Co-Investigators Dr. Christine Rini and Dr. Francis Keefe for evaluating patients'experiences and satisfaction with PainCOACH. This measure has been used extensively in past and present studies conducted by their research teams and others. These instruments will be administered ONLY during the post-treatment assessment interval and includes both qualitative and quantitative survey items. Quantitative survey items will be scaled from 1 to 5 to indicate level of agreement, where &quot;1&quot; indicates &quot;strong agreement&quot; and &quot;5&quot; indicates &quot;strong disagreement&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Change in Migraine Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The MIDAS (NINDS CDE 2.0 &quot;highly recommended&quot;) was developed to assess headache-related disabilities focusing on care for persons with migraine [[Stewart 2000, 2001]]. Headache sufferers answer 5 questions (self-administered) related to the last 3 months, indicating the number of days their everyday life has been limited by migraines. MIDAS assesses disability in 3 areas: a) household work, b) paid work and/or school, and c) social, leisure, and family activities. MIDAS is valuable for quantification of headache disability and as a reference for measuring improvement. The MIDAS is widely employed, internally consistent, highly reliable, valid, and correlates with physicians' clinical judgments. The instrument usually takes less than 5 minutes to complete and is easy to understand.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HIT-6 (NINDS CDE 2.0 &quot;highly recommended&quot;) is a 6-question self-report tool that measures the impact headaches have on a person's ability to function on the job, at home, at school, and in social situations, with items that address a spectrum of health outcomes (ranging from pain to emotional distress)81,82. The HIT-6 is widely use and well validated, and employs a recall period of 4 weeks</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pain NRS (Numeric Rating Scale) will be used to assess pain intensity and to facilitate comparison of findings across trials examining PainCOACH. Specifically, patients are asked to rate average, worst, and least levels of pain intensity over the past week on a scale with ratings ranging from 0 &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 &quot;worst possible pain.&quot; Minimally, moderately, and substantially important clinical change are represented by a decrease in score by 10% to 20%, &gt;=30%, and &gt;=50%, respectively80. The Pain NRS has been validated as a treatment outcome measure and is recommended as a core outcome measure of clinical trials in chronic pain patients at the IMPAACT-II consensus meeting.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in headache management self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HMSE (Headache Management Self-Efficacy scale) is a 25-item headache-specific measure of self-efficacy employing Likert-type rating scale ranging from 1 to 7 with questions in order to quantify headache patients' confidence in their own ability to prevent and manage headache attacks. The HMSE is established as both reliable and valid.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in headache locus of control scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The HSLC (Headache Specific Locus of Control Scale) is a 33-item self-report questionnaire designed specifically for recurrent headache sufferers to assess the individual's perceptions that headache problems and headache relief are determined primarily by the individual's behavior (Internal Locus of Control), the actions of health care professionals (Health Care Professionals Locus of Control), or chance factors (Chance Locus of Control). The Likert-type item responses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Factor analysis confirmed the 3-factor structure of the HSLC, and the reliability of the subscales is established (Cronbach ́s α of .86, .84 and .88 for each factor, respectively) and confirmed.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain catastrophizing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2 months, 5 months, and 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS (Pain Catastrophizing Scale) is a 13-item self-report measure of the tendency to ruminate, magnify, or feel hopeless about, that is, catastrophize about pain. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 &quot;all the time,&quot; with a total summed scale score ranging from 0 to 52. A score of &gt;=30 is suggestive of clinically relevant levels of catastrophizing. The PCS was administered at the beginning of each session.</description>
