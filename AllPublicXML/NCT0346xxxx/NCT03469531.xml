  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II trial is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of
      nimotuzumab combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy for initially inoperable locally
      advanced cervical squamous cell carcinoma.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well giving nimotuzumab together with radiation therapy
      and cisplatin works in treating patients with previously untreated locally advanced cervical
      cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nimotuzumab, a humanized anti-epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody that is approved in many countries for the treatment of
      EGFR-positive cancers. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find
      tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Nimotuzumab also
      stop the growth of cervical cancer by increasing the effect of chemotherapy. Radiation
      therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving nimotuzumab together with radiation therapy
      and cisplatin may kill more tumor cells.
