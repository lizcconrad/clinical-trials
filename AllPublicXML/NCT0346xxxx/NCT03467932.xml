  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to explore efficacy of ORMD-0801 when given in different regimens
      across a dose range for up to 12 weeks in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 240 subjects with T2DM will initially undergo a 2-week, single-blind placebo
      run-in period, followed by a 12-week treatment period. The total 12-week treatment period
      will include a Part 1&quot;titration&quot; interval (2 weeks, Visits 3 and 4) and a Part 2 stable dose
      &quot;maintenance&quot; interval (10 weeks, Visits 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The stable dose interval will be
      sufficient to allow for a robust assessment of treatment effect based on the mean change from
      baseline in HbA1C (A1C).

During Part 2, subjects will remain on fixed doses of ORMD-0801 or matched placebo for 10 weeks. Doses will not be adjusted unless clinically indicated for adverse events or hypoglycemia.
