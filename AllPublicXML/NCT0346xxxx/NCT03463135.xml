      Primary Objective:

      To assess tolerability and safety of SAR439794 [peanut extract (PE) sublingual immunotherapy
      (SLIT) adjuvanted with Glucopyranosyl Lipid A (GLA)] after repeated sublingual (SL) daily
      administration in peanut allergic adult and adolescent patients.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess pharmacodynamics of SAR439794 after repeated SL daily administration in peanut
      allergic adult and adolescent patients.

             between 12 and 17 years of age (after enrollment of 20 adult patients completed the 6
             weeks dose escalation period and the safety and tolerability is deemed acceptable).

          -  Physician-diagnosed peanut allergy OR convincing history of objective clinical
             symptoms consistent with immediate hypersensitivity within 4 hours following known
             ingestion of peanuts or peanut-containing food AND by the following combined criteria:

          -  Peanut-specific IgE (P-sIgE) &gt;5 kUA/L and Arah2-specific IgE (Arah2-sIgE) &gt;2 kUA/L,
