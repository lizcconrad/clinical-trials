      comparing the effect of general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia on brain natruretic
      peptide hormone levels preoperatively and postoperatively in parturient cardiac patient

    <textblock>
      In our study, investigators will detect changes in brain natruretic peptide (BNP) levels in
      parturient patients at risk undergoing cesarean section, in relation to type of anesthesia
      used, general anesthesia versus spinal anesthesia, in order to evaluate the safety of type of
      anesthesia used for this kind of patient.

      It is very important to assess and predict risk in the cardiovascular system in such cases. A
      number of cardiac indexes for predicting risk have been developed like Goldman Multifactorial
      risk index, Eagle's risk index and Detsky's cardiac index. It is recommended to evaluate
      patients using these indexes and to institute preoperative medical treatment based on the
      results. These clinical scoring systems, although simple to use, are somewhat inconvenient
      and have limitations in their predictive value, whereas other cardiac investigations such as
      exercise or pharmacologic stress imaging are sensitive, but limited in practice by time and
      resources. Recently brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was spotlighted as a predictor for
      diagnosing and predicting the prognosis of various heart diseases. BNP is a cardiac hormone
      that is synthesized by ventricular myocytes in response to ventricular dysfunction. Recent
      studies have demonstrated that elevated serum BNP levels predict first cardiovascular event
      and death in the general population. In addition, it has been reported that BNP measured
      before major surgery can be used as a predictor of postoperative cardiac complications.

    <description>Group A: n= 15 Parturiant patients will receive general anesthesia. General anesthesia will be conducted After pre-oxygenation for 3-5 minutes. 5% thiopental (5 mg/kg) will be administered intravenously over 30s, followed by succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg. After tracheal intubation, the patients will be ventilated with 100% oxygen. isoflurane 0.8% will be added, to maintain the anesthesia. Further neuromuscular block will be maintained by using atracurium as needed. After delivery of the fetus, fentanyl IV will be given 1ug/kg as analgesia and 20 IU oxytocin will be given by intravenous infusion .Reverse neuromuscular blockade as necessary at completion of surgery. Extubate when the patient is awake, the anesthesia is adequately reversed, and the patient is following commands</description>

    <description>Group B: n= 15 Parturiant patients will receive spinal anesthesia. In the sitting position and after complete aseptic precaution are taken, 2-3 ml of Lidocaine will be injected subcutaneously, spinal anesthesia will be performed at interspace L3-4 or L4-5, either via midline or paramedian approaches using 22 guage Quinke needle with the bevel directed laterally. 2.5 ml of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in addition to 25 μg fentanyl (0.5 ml) will be injected into the subarachnoid space after successful dural puncture and confirmation by barbotage.
The patient will be put flat in the supine position with left uterine displacement using wedge under the right loin and the surgeon will be allowed to sterilize and wrap the field after confirmation of the solidity of the block its level.
All patiens will be observed for cardiac complications in the form of non-fatal MI, arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death until discharged after at least 72h.</description>
