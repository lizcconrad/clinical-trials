    <textblock>
      Up to 48 subjects will be enrolled in 8 cohorts of 6 subjects each. The treatments are
      intended to establish the maximum tolerated dose in healthy normal volunteers, starting at 30
      mcg. Each subject will receive one dose of Treprostinil Inhalation Powder by oral inhalation
      during the treatment period.

      A total of 12 pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from each subject. Plasma
      pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed for treprostinil.

             benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates) or cotinine.

         20. Has a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at screening or has been previously treated for hepatitis
             B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection.
