  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the medicines, probenecid and
      ciclosporin on the concentrations of SNAC. SNAC is an ingredient of the semaglutide tablets.
      Participants will get 3 different treatments (that is 3 treatment periods): 1) a single dose
      of 3 mg semaglutide, 2) a single dose of 600 mg ciclosporin with 3 mg semaglutide, 3) 500 mg
      probenecid twice a day for 3 ½ days with a single dose of 3 mg semaglutide on the last day.

      The sequence of treatments participants get is decided by chance. Probenecid and ciclosporin
      are available medicines. They are given by doctors. Semaglutide contains SNAC. It cannot be
      prescribed yet.

      The study will last for up to 125 days. Participants will have 17 to 18 visits at the study
      centre. This includes short visits at the centre for blood sampling only. Participants will
      have several blood draws.

    <intervention_model_description>This is a 3-period cross-over study. The participants will be randomised to three treatment sequences each consisting of three treatment periods. One treatment period with a single dose of 3 mg oral semaglutide alone, one treatment period with a single dose of 600 mg ciclosporin 1 hour prior to administration of a single dose of 3 mg oral semaglutide and one treatment period with 500 mg probenecid administered twice daily for 3½ days with the last dose 2 hours prior to administration of a single dose of 3 mg oral semaglutide. Pharmacokinetics of sodium N-(8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino) caprylate (SNAC) and SNAC metabolites will be assessed after each single dose of 3 mg oral semaglutide.</intervention_model_description>
