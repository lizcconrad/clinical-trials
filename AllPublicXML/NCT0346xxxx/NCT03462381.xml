      Participants will perform three endurance training sessions weekly for 12 weeks. All
      participants will be randomly assigned to the protein supplementation group or the placebo
      (iso-caloric carbohydrate) group. During the 12 weeks endurance training program participants
      allocated to the protein group (30 g protein per beverage) will receive a protein drink after
      exercise and prior to sleep at night on training days. On non-training days participants will
      only receive a protein drink before sleep. Participants allocated to the carbohydrate group
      (30 g carbohydrates) will receive a carbohydrate drink instead of a protein drink.

      In the proposed study, the effects of protein supplementation after training and before sleep
      on VO2max and performance will be assessed during 12 weeks endurance exercise training in
      untrained healthy young men. The ready to drink carbohydrate beverage consists of 30g
      carbohydrate or 30g protein. Previous studies show that the supplementation of 30g protein is
      in the optimal range to stimulate the muscle protein synthetic response following resistance
      type exercise. The protein supplementation group in the present study will be compared with
      an iso-caloric carbohydrate group. In addition, to the pre- and post-intervention biopsies 1
      additional muscle biopsies will be taken (in week 6) during the 12 week intervention period.
      This will create a unique opportunity to establish the timeline of the skeletal muscle
      adaptive response at functional and mechanistic level following prolonged endurance exercise
      training, including potential differences between both groups.
