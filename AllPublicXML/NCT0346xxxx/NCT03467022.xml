  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Scurvy, or latent scurvy, may be underestimated in developed countries, but continue to be
      described, often as case report. Little is known about the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency
      in a specific population as withdrawal alcoholics and about his possible consequences, latent
      scurvy.

      In an observational study, the investigators will evaluate prospectively the prevalence of
      vitamin C deficiency in alcoholic withdrawal patients, its correlation with latent scurvy,
      mainly tiredness and weakness, and the evolution of the latter at three months after oral
      vitamin C supplementation.

      This study aims to examine:

        1. the level of plasma vitamin C for patients that volunteered for alcohol withdrawal.
           Measurement of vitamin C plasma level will be performed as soon as possible after the
           agreement as the discussion with the physician could lead to a change in dietary habits.
           It will be performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (Cerba Laboratory, F-Cergy
           Pontoise) according to Lee et al.

        2. the correlation between plasma vitamin C level and clinical signs of scurvy, especially
           signs of latent scurvy like tiredness, leg pain, gums involvement, previously loss of
           healthy teeth. These signs will be recorded in a structured questionnaire during the
           first consultation, before knowing the laboratory result patient. All patients who are
           smoking will perform systematic otorhinolaryngology examination in search of cancer.
           Other reasons for weakness will be searched by clinical anamneses, body examination,
           blood probe and abdominal ultrasound examination.

        3. the decrease or disappearance of tiredness and/or purpura and/or gums involvement will
           be studied after vitamin C supplementation in patients whose vitamin C plasma
           determination is under normal levels and that don't have another explanation for their
           tiredness. Patients will be evaluated after receiving 1 g oral vitamin C for at least
           three months.

      Ethical considerations The study was approved by the institutional ethics committee of the
      clinic and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
      Informed consent was obtained before entry study and each participant agreed to pay for the
      plasma vitamin C determination.

      Dissemination findings Findings for the present study will be reported in manuscripts that
      will be submitted for publication to a leading medical or nutrition journal in a appropriate
      field (i.e.alcoholism, nutrition). In addition, findings will be presented as abstracts,
      posters and presentations at conferences.

    <description>Using Excel, we will apply a transformation to convert status of tiredness, skin symptoms and gum involvement/ loss of healthy teeth into binary variables.This is in order to provide a better graphical representation. One graph will be displayed per symptom. When it comes to the binary variables, 0 corresponds to &quot; absence of tiredness&quot; whereas 1 corresponds to &quot;presence of tiredness&quot; for the first graph; 0 corresponds to &quot;absence of purpura&quot; whereas 1 means &quot;presence of purpura &quot; for the second graph; 0 corresponds to &quot;absence of gums involvement or absence of loss of healthy teeth &quot;whereas 1 means &quot;presence of gums involvement or loss of healthy teeth&quot;.</description>

      Measurement of vitamin C ail be performed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (Cerba
      Laboratory, F-Cergy Pontoise).

      Results are expressed in micromol per liter (µmol/L) with a normal range from 26,4 to
      84,0µmol/L. These measures are in correlation with those quoted by O.Frain et al concerning
      healthy French men and women (5 to 15 mg/L equal to 28,4 -85,5µmol/L). According to
      Johnston's criteria, plasma vitamin C level lower than 11,4µmol/L (2mg/L) will be considered
      as vitamin C deficiency, lower than 28,4µmol/L (5 mg/L) as vitamin C depletion. The lower
      limit of quantification is 3µmol/L (&lt; 0,5 mg /L); the patient is considered biologically as
      having scurvy or at high risk for development of scurvy.

        51 patients volunteered to alcohol withdrawal, 14 women at a mean age of 52+/-8 (extreme 38
        to 62 years) (range 24) and 37 men at a mean age of 58 +/-12 (extreme 34 to 83) (range 49).

        Three men refused the blood test and one didn't show up for the appointment. The mean age
        of the 33 remaining male patients was not impacted: mean age of 58 with quite the same SD
        (13) and the same range.

        Therefore 47 patients were included.
