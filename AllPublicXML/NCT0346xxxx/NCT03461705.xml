  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who are referred for coronary angiography and require
      physiological assessment to see if the lesion can be treated as per the local standard of
      care. Approximately 92 participants will be enrolled. There are no follow up visits required
      so participation in this study will end when subjects are discharged from the hospital.The
      study will be comparing the resting flow reserve against the instantaneous wave-free ratio
      (iFR) and fractional flow reserve. All these tests offer a way to image a legion and
      determine if it is suitable to be treated. FFR measures the pressure differences across
      (narrowed coronary arteries usually due to atherosclerosis), iFR's are performed during
      cardiac catheterisation (angiography) using invasive coronary pressure wires which are placed
      in the arteries of the heart that are to be assessed and the Resting flow reserve looks at
      the maximum increase in blood flow through the coronary arteries above the normal resting
      volume.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement by under hyperemic conditions has become the
      invasive gold standard for determining the physiologic extent of cardiac ischemia, and which
      has been validated in several clinical outcomes studies as a way of optimizing case selection
      for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). More recently in two large-scale randomized
      controlled trials using a non-hyperemic resting measurement, the instantaneous wave free
      ratio (iFR) showed non-inferiority in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) comparing
      iFR to FFR for physiological assessment of moderate coronary stenosis. FFR is calculated as
      the ratio of the distal coronary pressure to the aortic pressure (Pd/Pa) during maximal
      micro-circulatory relaxation. iFR is a diagnostic tool used to assess whether a stenosis is
      causing a limitation of blood flow in coronary arteries with subsequent ischemia. iFR is
      performed during cardiac catherisation (angiography) using invasive coronary pressure wires
      which are placed in the coronary arteries that are to be assessed. The iFR negates the time
      averaging and administration of vasodilators necessary for FFR by identifying from the
      resting pressure waveform a period when the native microcirculatory resistance is constant
      and minimized in diastole. The study is looking at the accuracy and precision of a novel
      adenosine-independent index of coronary artery stenosis, the resting flow reserve, against
      the instantaneous wave-free ratio and fractional flow reserve.
