      This RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes Emergencies)
      vs. intensive home-based diabetes (DM) education [i.e., Enhanced Usual Care (EUC)] to reduce
      DM-related emergency department (ED) visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary
      outcome) in 230 blacks with diabetes, 50 years and older, after an ED visit. A moderation
      analysis will determine whether participants who reside in low- vs. high-need communities
      [defined by Community Need Index scores (i.e., an indicator of the built environment)]
      respond differently to treatment.

      COPDE is a collaborative intervention of Primary Care Physicians, (PCPs), a DM nurse
      educator, and Community Health Workers (CHWs) that extends from the ED into the community.
      The CHWs will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase participants' knowledge and skills
      to manage DM; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to reinforce DM self-care; and 3)
      facilitate telehealth visits with PCPs and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care.
      The control treatment, EUC, is home-based intensive DM education. EUC matches COPDE in
      treatment intensity (i.e., number and duration of in-home visits) and delivery of DM
      self-care education, but does not include COPDE's other active elements (i.e., Behavioral
      Activation and telehealth). The treatment comparison will identify COPDE's specific efficacy
      over and above EUC. We hypothesize that COPDE will halve the rate of incident DM-related ED
      visits and/or hospitalizations relative to EUC. The three secondary outcomes are: 1)
      subjective perceptions of access to care; 2) receipt of DM Quality Metrics (i.e., objective
      indicators of realized access to care); and 3) DM self-care.

      This Phase-III RCT will compare the efficacy of COPDE (COmmunity Care to Prevent Diabetes
      Emergencies) vs. intensive home-based DM education to reduce the number of DM-related ED
      visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome), in 230 AAs with DM, 50 years
      and older, who are recruited from the ED after an ED visit. COPDE is a culturally relevant
      intervention that extends from the ED to the community, and aims to improve access to care
      and DM self-care (secondary outcomes). A mediation analysis will determine whether changes in
      access to care and/or DM self-care explain COPDE's efficacy. A moderation analysis will
      determine whether participants who reside in low- vs. high-need communities [defined by
      Community Need Index scores (i.e., an indicator of the built environment)] respond
      differently to treatment.

      COPDE will begin soon after the participant's index ED visit, when many patients remain
      uncertain how to manage DM or how to access follow-up care. Community Health Workers (CHWs),
      who are race-concordant with participants, will: 1) deliver in-home DM education to increase
      participants' knowledge and skills; 2) use DM-specific Behavioral Activation to improve DM
      self-care; and 3) facilitate telehealth visits with the participant's primary care physician
      (PCP) and a DM nurse educator to increase access to care. The control treatment, EUC, is
      intensive home-based DM education. EUC matches COPDE in treatment intensity (i.e., 6 in-home
      sessions over 4 months, and 3 booster sessions over the next 8 months) and delivery of
      culturally relevant DM education, but does not include DM-specific Behavioral Activation or
      telehealth visits. The treatment comparison will identify COPDE's specific efficacy over and
      above EUC.

      This RCT is significant as the population ages and becomes more racially diverse, and as ED
      use and costs increase. This RCT is innovative because it: 1) tests the first ED-to-community
      intervention designed to reduce the need for ED care in AAs with DM; 2) assesses both
      subjective and objective indicators of access to care; and 3) defines the specific
      characteristics of COPDE that confer its cultural relevance. If successful, COPDE will meet
      Healthy People 2020's twin goals of reducing the personal and societal costs of DM and
      achieving health equity for all Americans. The Specific Aims of this RCT are:

      Primary Specific Aim: Test the efficacy of COPDE to reduce the number of incident DM-related
      ED visits and/or hospitalizations over 12 months (primary outcome) in AAs with DM.
      Hypothesis: COPDE will halve the number of incident DM-related ED visits and/or
      hospitalizations relative to EUC over 12 months.

      The Secondary Aims are to:

        1. Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase perceived access to care over 12 months
           (secondary outcome). Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Patient Satisfaction
           Questionnaire-18 scores to a greater extent than EUC over 12 months.

        2. Test the efficacy of COPDE to increase realized access to care over 12 months (secondary
           outcome). Hypothesis: COPDE will increase the number of received Diabetes Quality
           Metrics (e.g., hemoglobin A1c testing, urine screening) to a greater extent than EUC
           over 12 months.

        3. Test the efficacy of COPDE to improve DM self-care over 12 months (secondary outcome).
           Hypothesis: COPDE will increase Diabetes Self-Care Inventory scores to a greater extent
           than EUC over 12 months.

        4. Determine if increasing subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or
           DM self-care mediates COPDE's reduction of DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations.
           Hypothesis: COPDE will reduce DM-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations to the extent
           that it increases subjective and/or objective indicators of access to care and/or
           improves DM self-care.

      The Exploratory Aims are to: 1) determine whether COPDE reduces &quot;all cause&quot; ED
      visits/hospitalizations relative to EUC.; 2) determine whether Community Need Index scores,
      literacy, age, and/or sex moderate treatment effects; 3) determine if COPDE improves glycemic
      control (i.e., lowers hemoglobin A1c levels), impacts DM-related health beliefs, reduces
      depression, and/or improves quality-of-life; 4) identify COPDE's treatment features that
      confer its cultural relevance; and 5) estimate COPDE's costs and net financial benefit to the
      healthcare system.

    <description>The primary efficacy analysis will consider the number of incident diabetes-related ED visits and/or hospitalizations (i.e., an &quot;event&quot;) over 12 months after the index ED visit. Each ED visit or hospitalization is counted as a single event (although an ED visit that leads to a hospitalization is counted once). ED visits and hospitalization will be ascertained through chart reviews and subject self-report.</description>
