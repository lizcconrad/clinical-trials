  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Social anxiety disorder affects as many as 12% of Americans, resulting in significant
      distress and disability. Although exposure therapy is one of the best treatments available,
      as many as 25% of patients do not respond and we do not know why. Extinction learning is
      thought to be the mechanism of exposure therapy, and the neuroscience of extinction learning
      has advanced significantly since exposure therapy was developed; however, there has been
      little application towards improved clinical outcomes.

      This project aims to improve exposure therapy response for patients with social anxiety
      disorder by directly linking exposure therapy response to the neurobiology of extinction
      learning. It also aims to increase our scientific understanding of how brain circuits work to
      support extinction learning. To do this, 80 adults with social anxiety disorder will randomly
      be assigned to either receive exposure therapy right away, or to wait before therapy.
      Participants will all complete a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan to assess
      extinction learning before the therapy.

    <textblock>
      The best available treatment for social anxiety disorder is exposure therapy; however, 25% of
      socially anxious patients do not respond to an adequate course of exposure therapy and it is
      unclear why. Prior attempts to identify non-responders using clinical and demographic
      features have been largely unsuccessful, highlighting the need to examine constructs that are
      more closely tied to the mechanism of treatment (i.e., extinction learning and recall) and
      the organ of dysfunction (i.e., the brain). The neurobiology of extinction learning and
      recall is well understood from decades of animal and pre-clinical laboratory work, which has
      highlighted the importance of the amygdala, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), and
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). However, this knowledge has not been leveraged to
      improve exposure therapy response, despite the assumption that response relies on extinction
      learning and its successful recall.

      Thus, a critical long-term goal is to improve exposure therapy response by tailoring therapy
      based on the neurobiological profile of each patient. This project addresses that goal by
      directly linking neurobiological profiles of extinction learning and recall with clinical
      symptoms and therapy response. A major objective of this project is therefore to build a
      mechanistic predictive model of exposure therapy response based on the neurobiology of
      extinction learning and recall.

      To accomplish this goal, the investigators will recruit 80 adults with social anxiety
      disorder who will be randomized to 10 sessions of exposure-focused therapy or waitlist. The
      primary clinical outcome measure will be the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), a
      validated and widely used measure that assesses anxiety and avoidance symptoms. Pre-therapy,
      participants will also undergo an experimental protocol for extinction learning and recall.
      Participants will first view a neutral abstract image repeatedly paired with a loud aversive
      noise, and another image that is never paired (fear acquisition phase). Following this,
      participants will view the same images without aversive consequences (extinction learning
      phase). Better extinction learning will be defined as greater reductions in skin conductance
      within the extinction learning phase. Brain activation during extinction learning will be
      assessed in the amygdala, dACC, and vmPFC. Finally, participants will view the same images
      without aversive consequences one week later (extinction recall phase). Better extinction
      recall will be defined as less skin conductance during extinction recall relative to fear
      acquisition. The central hypothesis is that greater activation in the vmPFC during extinction
      learning will predict both extinction recall and therapy response over and above symptom
      severity.

    <description>Participants randomized to the immediate therapy arm will receive a weekly individual psychotherapy intervention called Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM). The CALM program is an evidence based, exposure-focused therapy (http://calmtoolsforliving.org). Its computer-assisted format guides the therapist through psychoeducation, an introduction to cognitive restructuring, in-session and at-home exposures, and relapse prevention. Therapy will be delivered in 10 weekly 50-minute sessions within a 12 week period.</description>

After this 12 week period they will receive a the same weekly individual psychotherapy intervention as the immediate therapy group: Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM).

    <ipd_description>We plan to voluntarily share the raw fMRI data generated by this project through openfmri.org, a project of the Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience. OpenfMRI is a recommended repository for several academic journals. There is no cost for researchers or analysts for use of this repository; the OpenfMRI repository uses a Public Domain license. We will fully de-identify and anonymize our data before uploading to the database, consistent with the OpenfMRI policy. Furthermore, the purpose, risks, and benefits of data sharing will be included in our consent form, and participants will be given the opportunity to exclude their data from the repository. Only participants who consent to and provide HIPAA authorization for this use will have their data uploaded.</ipd_description>
