      Subjects will be measured with both a sensor and a reference device

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will participate in a study measuring a single set of paired values. In this case,
      measurements will take roughly 2-30 minutes to complete, and will involve: 1) attaching the
      sensor on the subject; 2) attaching one or more reference devices to the subject; 3) making
      measurements with both the sensor and reference device, either simultaneously or
      sequentially; and 4) collecting and analyzing the paired value.

          2. Subject and/or legally authorized person/representative is willing to undergo the
             Informed Consent process prior to enrollment in the study.

          3. Subject selection will not be based on age, height, or weight.

          4. Subject is a candidate for this study based on the PI's opinion and knowledge of the
             subject's condition as well as the features of the investigational device tested
             during the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is participating in another clinical study that may affect the results of
             either study.

          2. Subjects that are pregnant will not be included in the study.

          3. Subject is unable or not willing to wear electrode patches as required for a period of
             up to 168 hours.

          4. Subject is considered by the Principal Investigator to be medically unsuitable for
             study participation.
