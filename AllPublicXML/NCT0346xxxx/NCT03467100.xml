  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The XEN901 Phase 1 clinical trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study
      that will evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of both single
      ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of XEN901 in healthy subjects. It is
      estimated there will be approximately 64 subjects in the planned SAD and MAD cohorts.
