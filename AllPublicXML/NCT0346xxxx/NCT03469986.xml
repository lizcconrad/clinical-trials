  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an outpatient, multicenter, prospective, pivotal, double-blind, within-subject
      comparison trial of the Marcus Autism Center Investigational Device (MAC-ID) diagnostic
      procedure relative to the gold-standard (reference standard), current best practice expert
      clinician diagnosis (ECD) of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children 16-30 months of age.

      Consecutive pediatric patients from the intended population (i.e. children 16-30 months of
      age) recruited from pediatric referrals and general advertisements will be the subjects of
      this trial. All subjects will undergo the MAC-ID diagnostic procedure (test). All subjects
      will also undergo the current best practice clinical diagnostic procedure, using standardized
      ASD diagnostic instruments and standardized developmental assessments, to produce the ECD of
      each child's ASD status (reference/gold standard).

      The study consists of a screening phase and diagnostic evaluation phase to assess the
      validity (sensitivity and specificity), safety, and effectiveness of the MAC-ID when used to
      diagnose ASD.

      Subjects will be enrolled in the trial for a period of 1 day. The trial will be completed in
      approximately 12 months.

      The overall study objective is to assess the safety and effectiveness of the MAC-ID to
      accurately diagnose ASD (primary analysis), as well as to accurately assess severity of ASD
      (secondary analysis) in very young pediatric subjects.

      The primary endpoints of this study are the diagnostic result from the MAC-ID and the
      diagnostic results from the ECD evaluation, both of which are either positive or negative for
      ASD. Each subject will undergo the Social Developmental Testing Device procedure and an
      examination by a clinical expert in the field of ASD diagnosis; all study center site
      personnel (including the expert clinicians responsible for the ECD evaluation) will be
      blinded to MAC-ID results.

    <description>This trial will ascertain whether the binary results of autism or not-autism as determined by the Marcus Autism Center Investigational Device match expert clinical diagnostic opinion. The investigational device is designed to measure visual attention to social information in the environment relative to normative, age-specific benchmarks; these measurements assess presence (primary efficacy outcome) and severity (secondary outcomes) of autism spectrum disorder in 16- to 30-month-old children.</description>

        Subjects will be recruited on the basis of concern for ASD, including children who a
        parent, caregiver, or clinician suspects may have ASD as well as children who are not
        suspected to have an ASD.
