  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the long-term outcome of chronic total occlusion (CTO) patients underwent
      contemporary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques, we design this
      single-center, large-sample, prospective registry with five-year clinical follow-up, based on
      the intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) finding.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plan to include the patients with a CTO lesion in one of the three main epicardial
      coronary artery (diameter more than 2.5 mm) as the only target lesion. The CTO lesion is
      defined as 0 grade of thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow with evidence of
      occlusion duration more than 3 months. All the PCI procedure will be performed by a group of
      certified operators in Fuwai Hospital, Beijing, China. All patients evaluate IVUS with
      automatic pullback (Opticross, Boston Scientific, US) performed after wire crossing. All the
      included patients are planned for five-year follow-up.
