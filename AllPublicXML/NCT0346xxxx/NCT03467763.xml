  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metformin is a safe and effective first-line drug for type 2 diabetes that is also widely
      recommended for weight loss and diabetes prevention. But, metformin is associated with
      gastrointestinal and other side effects which prevent its use in 10-20% of patients and
      appear to limit the usable dose in others. This study is an N-of-1 trial design that will
      recruit 20 previously metformin-intolerant patients for re-challenge with metformin in a
      double-blind scenario. In this setting, 'intolerant' means either unable to take metformin at
      all, or unable to increase the dose past 1,000 mg despite the treating physician's
      recommendation to do so. Patients will be assigned to take their baseline medication regimen
      plus 2 weeks of 250 mg per day of metformin extended release, followed by 500 mg metformin
      XR, 750 mg, and 1,000 mg metformin XR with each treatment period separated by a 2-week course
      of placebo. Initial treatment, placebo or metformin XR, will be decided randomly. At the end
      of each two-week treatment period, participants will complete questionnaires assessing
      overall satisfaction with the medication, gastrointestinal symptoms, and adherence. Six
      months after the conclusion of the intervention, patients will be asked if they are
      continuing metformin at a higher dose than upon entry to the trial. This trial has two aims.
      First, to test the hypothesis that medication satisfaction will be the same during periods of
      placebo treatment and during periods of treatment with the active drug. The second aim is to
      test the hypothesis that &gt; 30% of metformin-intolerant patients in an N of 1 crossover trial
      are able to tolerate higher-dose metformin at 6-months.

    <measure>Aim #2 Primary Outcome: Incidence of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events [Safety and Tolerability]</measure>
    <time_frame>6-months</time_frame>
    <description>For aim 2 of this study, the primary objective is to test the hypothesis &gt; 30% of the patients enrolled in this study are able to tolerate higher-dose metformin at 6 months.</description>

    <measure>Aim #1 Secondary Outcome: GI Symptom Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Reoccurring every 2-weeks for 4-months</time_frame>
    <description>For aim 1, the secondary objectives are to test the hypotheses that scores on a gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire are the same between between placebo and intervention periods; that adherence is the same between periods; and that the answer to the question 'Were you taking placebo or metformin for the past two weeks' is correct no more often than would be predicted by chance.</description>
