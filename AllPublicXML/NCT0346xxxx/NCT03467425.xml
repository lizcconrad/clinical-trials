  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of TRELEGY ELLIPTA relative
      to non-ELLIPTA Multiple Inhaler Triple Therapies (MITT) for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
      Disease (COPD) control within the usual clinical practice setting. The study will be
      conducted once TRELEGY ELLIPTA has been approved in the countries in which the study will be
      conducted and is available commercially. This is a randomized, open-label, effectiveness,
      phase 4 study of 24 weeks' duration in COPD subjects to evaluate TRELEGY ELLIPTA (fluticasone
      furoate [FF]/vilanterol [VI]/umeclidinium bromide [UMEC]: 100 microgram [mcg]/62.5 mcg/25
      mcg) inhalation powder taken once daily using a single ELLIPTA inhaler compared with any
      non-ELLIPTA MITT in the usual care setting. Effectiveness of TRELEGY ELLIPTA will be assessed
      by comparing proportion of COPD Assessment Test (CAT) responders at Week 24 between two
      treatment groups. TRELEGY and ELLIPTA are trademarks of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) group of
      companies. The study will enroll approximately 3000 subjects.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of responders based on CAT at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The CAT is a subject-completed instrument designed to provide a simple and reliable measure of health status in COPD for the assessment and long-term follow-up of the individual subject. The CAT consists of eight items, each formatted on a semantic differential scale. Subjects rated their experience on a 6-point scale for each question, ranging from 0 to 5 with a maximum total score of 40. Higher scores indicate greater disease impact. CAT of each subject was assessed at Baseline (Week 1) and Week 24 or Early withdrawal. Responders are the subjects who will have the change from Baseline of CAT score &gt;=2 at Week 24. Number of responders based on CAT at Week 24 will be presented.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>FEV1 is the volume of air that can be forced out in one second after taking a deep breath, an important measure of pulmonary function. FEV1 measurements will be obtained using spirometer. For FEV1 determination, at least 3 acceptable spirometry efforts (with no more than 8) should be obtained. The largest FEV1 from the 3 acceptable efforts should be recorded, even if they do not come from the same effort. Baseline was Week 1. Change from Baseline is the difference between Baseline value and post-Baseline value.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of subjects making at least 1 critical error in inhalation technique at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>At the start of the study, and whenever subjects are issued with a prescription for a new COPD maintenance therapy, the physician (or delegate) will train the subject on the correct use of their inhaler device(s). A critical error is defined as an error that is most likely to result in no or significantly reduced medication being inhaled. If subjects are unable to perform spirometry they may still participate in the critical error assessment. All subjects who have spirometry measured will also have an assessment of critical errors if an appropriate error checklist is available for the study medication they are using for COPD maintenance therapy at Week 24/Early withdrawal visit. Percentage of subjects making at least 1 critical error in inhalation technique at the Week 24 will be presented.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Capable of giving signed informed consent.

          -  Subjects with a documented physician diagnosis of COPD.

          -  A score of &gt;=10 on the CAT at screening.

          -  Subjects who have a history of treatment with systemic/oral corticosteroids,
             antibiotics and/or hospitalization for at least one COPD exacerbation in the 3 years
             prior to randomization. This will be captured through subject recall and/or medical
             records and must be documented in subject's notes. Prior use of systemic/oral
             corticosteroids and/or antibiotics alone does not qualify as an exacerbation history
             unless the use was associated with treatment of worsening symptoms of COPD.

          -  Subjects currently receiving one of the non-ELLIPTA maintenance therapies listed below
             who have been prescribed it continually for at least 16 weeks prior to randomization.
             Continuous prescription is defined as a minimum of 60 days' prescription cover during
             the prior 16 weeks. The non-ELLIPTA maintenance therapy must be one of the following:
             Inhaled Corticosteroid (ICS) in combination with Long-acting Muscarinic Receptor
             Antagonist (LAMA) and Long Acting Beta-Agonist (LABA) (MITT) or LAMA and LABA used in
             combination as a dual therapy or LABA and ICS used in combination as a dual therapy.
             Subjects who are currently on a dual maintenance therapy for COPD must be considered
             by their physician to require a step-up to triple therapy. The reason for the
             physician decision to step- up must be documented. Subjects who are receiving only
             COPD medication on an 'as required' basis are not eligible.

          -  Subjects must be aged &gt;=40 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of child bearing potential: Women who are pregnant or lactating or are planning
             on becoming pregnant during the study.

          -  Subjects with any life-threatening condition i.e. low probability, in the opinion of
             the investigator, of 6-month survival due to severity of COPD or comorbid condition.

          -  Subjects with resolution of an exacerbation less than 2 weeks prior to visit 1, must
             not be randomized. Subjects may be rescreened 2 weeks after resolution of exacerbation
             (exacerbation is defined by treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or
             antibiotic).

          -  Subjects with historical or current evidence of uncontrolled or clinically significant
             disease. Significant is defined as any disease that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk through participation, or
             which would affect the effectiveness or safety analysis if the disease/condition
             exacerbated during the study.

          -  A history of allergy or hypersensitivity to any corticosteroid,
             anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist, beta2-agonist, lactose/milk protein or
             magnesium stearate or a medical condition such as narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic
             hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction that, in the opinion of the investigator
             contraindicates study participation.

          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the treating investigator, are chronic users of oral
             corticosteroids for respiratory or other indications (if unsure discuss with the
             medical monitor prior to screening). Chronic use is defined as more than 14 days
             continuous use during the 12 weeks prior to visit 1.

          -  Subjects taking any investigational drug treatment within 30 days prior to Visit 1 or
             within five half-lives (t½) of the prior investigational study (whichever is the
             longer of the two).
