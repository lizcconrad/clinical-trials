  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) patients have increased windup (WU). However, WU of FM patients is only
      quantitatively but not qualitatively different from healthy controls (HC). Thus WU
      abnormalities of FM patients could be the result of supra-spinal and not the result of spinal
      pain mechanisms. The study team will test this hypothesis by sensitizing FM patients with
      topical capsaicin. The study team hypothesize that at baseline the slopes of sensitivity
      adjusted WU of FM patients are not statistically different from HC. However, after capsaicin
      application, the slopes of sensitivity adjusted WU will be significantly different from
      baseline and greater than those of HC, suggesting central sensitization. This would imply
      that FM patients are sensitive to heat pain but not sensitized.

    <measure>Progression of Temporal Summation of Second Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hr</time_frame>
    <description>A Peltier device (Pathway, Medoc) will be used to tap the skin surface with a 3 cm x 3 cm probe. The Peltier device will be used to provide very brief, repetitive, thermal stimuli (for approx. 1s) to the skin using computer controlled temperatures. Heat stimuli at intervals of 2.5 sec produce sensations of increasing pain (temporal summation), depending on the number of stimuli presented. The late sensations of warmth are delayed in onset by approximately 1.5 sec after the probe touches the skin, because the sensation depends upon stimulation of slowly conducting unmyelinated peripheral afferents.</description>
