  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effects of an inhaled blend of essential oils on fatigue scores
      among women who have hypothyroidism. Half of the participants will receive an essential oil
      blend to inhale daily for two weeks while the other half will serve as controls and inhale a
      carrier oil.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The inhalation of certain essential oils has been found to increase stamina and reduce
      fatigue among athletes but have not been evaluated for the purpose of reducing fatigue among
      women who experience fatigue as a result of a hypothyroid condition.

      The essential oils used in this study are inhaled mid-afternoon, the time in which women with
      hypothyroidism typically experience the lowest levels of energy during the day, otherwise
      known as the &quot;afternoon slump.&quot; The essential oil is administered during this time to
      evaluate both the immediate effects on fatigue as well as the overall effects, with
      measurements at the end of both the first and second week of the study.

      Fatigue is measured on a multi-dimensional scale, a validated instrument that measures not
      only physical fatigue but also emotional and mental fatigue.
