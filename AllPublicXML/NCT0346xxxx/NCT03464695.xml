  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine if automated oxygen delivery with O2matic is better than
      manually controlled oxygen therapy for patients admitted to hospital with an exacerbation in
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

      O2matic is a closed -loop system based on continuous non-invasive measurement of pulse and
      oxygen-saturation that is processed in an algorithm that controls the flow of oxygen to the
      patient.

      The primary hypothesis is that O2matic increases time within acceptable oxygen-saturation
      interval and reduces time with hypoxia and hyperoxia. Secondary hypotheses are that O2matic
      improves patient's sense of safety compared to manual control, reduces nurse's workload,
      reduces admission time and reduces time spent with oxygen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Closed-loop control of oxygen therapy is described in the literature used for preterm
      infants, trauma patients, medical emergency use and patients with COPD. For the latter,
      closed-loop therapy has been used for patients admitted to hospital with an exacerbation, for
      domiciliary oxygen use and during exercise. O2matic is a closed-loop system that is based on
      continuous and non-invasive measurement of pulse, oxygen-saturation and respiratory
      frequency. The algorithm in O2matic controls oxygen delivery with the aim of keeping the
      saturation within the desired interval, which could be 88-92 % for COPD-patients in
      accordance with international guidelines on this topic. Saturation interval can be set for
      the individual patients, as can the range of acceptable oxygen-flow. If saturation or
      oxygen-flow can't be maintained within the desired intervals an alarm will sound.

      All studies on closed-loop systems have shown that this method is better than manually
      control by nurse to maintain saturation within the desired interval. Furthermore, some
      studies have indicated that closed-loop has the possibility to reduce admission time and to
      reduce time spent with oxygen therapy, due to more efficient and fast withdrawal from oxygen
      supplementation.

      In the present study O2matic will be tested in a randomized, controlled, un-blinded setting
      versus manual control, for patients admitted with an exacerbation in COPD, and in need of
      supplemental oxygen. For the whole duration of the admission patients will either have oxygen
      controlled with O2matic or manually by nursing staff. All patients will have continuous
      logging of pulse, oxygen-saturation and oxygen-flow with O2matic, but only in the O2matic
      active group, the algorithm will control oxygen-delivery.

      In Phase one of the O2matic trial the primary hypothesis will be tested, which is that
      O2matic is better than manual control for maintaining oxygen-saturation within the desired
      interval and reducing time with unintended hypoxia and hyperoxia. For this purpose 15
      patients will be included in the active arm and 15 patients in the control arm. In Phase two
      of the O2matic trial the secondary hypotheses will be tested, which are that O2matic will
      increase patient's sense of safety compared to manual control and that O2matic will reduce
      admission time and time spent with oxygen-therapy compared to manual control. In Phase two of
      the study 150 patients will be included in each arm.

      No safety issues has been reported in the literature. Before use O2matic will be approved by
      The Danish Medicines Agency, The Ethics Committee in the Capital Region of Denmark and by the
      regional Data Protection Board. The study will be conducted according to GCP standards with
      independent monitoring. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be monitored and
      serious adverse events will be reported to Danish Medicines Agency. A follow-up on the study
      will look at mortality and readmissions within 30 days.
