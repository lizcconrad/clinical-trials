  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton pump inhibitor are frequently used and are short term well tolerated ; but few studies
      show there are adverse event in long term prescription like fracture or pulmonary infection
      to Clostridum difficile. The fact is that multi medication in old patient increase the
      iatrogenic risk and decrease the medication compliance. The Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)are
      overused in this patient category.Several studies suggest the existence of a rebound effect
      when people were treated more than 8 weeks ; this effect seems to appear around 14 days after
      with hyperacidity symptoms.

      But there are no studies about old patient. So in this context the aim of the study is to
      evaluate the prevalence of rebound effect occurence after the end of PPI 8 weeks treatment.
