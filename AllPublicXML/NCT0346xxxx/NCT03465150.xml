  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With 24 million results associated with Google's searchon keywords &quot;severe acne&quot;, Pr Dreno's
      team understand better thatthis disease, which affects many French people, is a real concern
      of Public Health and not a &quot;forced evil&quot; of the adolescent period, which will eventually
      resolve itself. Acne does not affect the vital prognosis, but its psychosocial impact is
      major and should not be underestimated. Paradoxically, despite the high prevalence of acne,
      few quality epidemiological studies have been published. Physicians are often helpless when
      faced with patients' questions. They often need a lot of explanations, especially on the
      factors aggravating this dermatosis, which greatly affects their quality of life.

      This cohort, the first of its kind in France, will determine the predictive factors of
      therapeutic response, endogenous and environmental factors impacting on the severity of acne
      assess the quality of life and psychological impact of acne patients, determine the patient's
      course of care and the associated costs. Pr Dreno's team will also build up a bio collection
      (bacteriological samples).

      All patients going for the first time in specialized consultation &quot;acne&quot; at Nantes University
      Hospital , and who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the COPACNE cohort.
      Inclusion will take place at the first consultation, after information and agreement of the
      patient and, if applicable, his or her legal representatives. The frequency of each patient's
      follow-up visits will be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the patient's
      medical needs (generally, the interval between 2 visits is between 1 and 4 months).
