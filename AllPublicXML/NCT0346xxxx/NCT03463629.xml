  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to determine if a specialized multidisciplinary diabetes team (SMDT)
      approach that incorporates the use of the chronic care model can be an effective method for
      improving glycemic control in Hispanic adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes residing in
      the Rio Grande Valley. The study will expand the current model of care used and focus on the
      multidimensional aspects that consist of physical, nutritional, educational and psychological
      needs of this underserved Hispanic population residing in the Rio Grande Valley.

    <description>The implementation of the pilot study will consist of a specialized multidisciplinary diabetes team care (SMDT) that includes endocrinologists, a nurse practitioner, dieticians, pharmacists and a licensed professional counselors (LPCs) to collaborate and coordinate care. Subjects in the pilot study will follow a multidisciplinary team approach process with the following team members: pharmacist, LPC, and dietician.
There will be 3 individualized visits: 1 visit with the counselor (LPC), 1 visit with the Pharmacist, and 1 visit with the Dietician.
In addition, a follow up phone call post visit, that can range from 5 to 30 minutes, will be scheduled from each of the team members during the study. Also, throughout the pilot study participant's blood glucose readings will be monitored weekly via a transmittable wireless patient transmission monitor.</description>
