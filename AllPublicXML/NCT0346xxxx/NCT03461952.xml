      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of nivolumab alone or
      in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic or unresectable tumors harbouring
      mutations in genes, POLE and POLD1. These mutations will be determined by plasma cfDNA.
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab have been given to patients across multiple types of cancer, and
      safe doses and schedules have been determined.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study have been diagnosed with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors
      that have a mutation in POLE and/or POLD1. Nivolumab alone or in conjunction with ipilimumab
      is predicted to be effective against tumors with POLE and/or POLD1 mutations as these genetic
      changes cause increased rates of mutations in the DNA of tumor cells. These high mutation
      rates have been associated with response to immunotherapy agents such as nivolumab and
      ipilimumab.

             solid tumors.

          -  Patients must have received at least 1 standard cancer therapy for their tumor type
             and progressed on their most recent regimen; patients may be treatment naïve if they
             refuse standard treatment or there is no standard treatment for their cancer.

          -  Prior adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy with curative intent is considered a prior therapy
             if disease recurrence occurs within at least 6 months.

          -  Patients may not have received prior immunotherapy

          -  Patients must consent to blood collection for testing after registration by a central
             reference laboratory.

             mutation can qualify for eligibility and randomization, however, plasma will be
             submitted for central cfDNA testing. In the event of discordance between tissue and
             central laboratory testing, the patient will continue in study but will not be
             included in the primary analysis. These patients will however be included in the
             secondary analysis.

             with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen may be eligible
             after consultation with the CCTG.

          -  Patients with primary CNS tumors are not eligible.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases or leptomeningeal metastases are not eligible.
