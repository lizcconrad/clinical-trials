      Purpose of the study will investigate the effects of two different training programs on
      hepatic steatosis and physical fitness parameters. This trial is designed in a randomized
      controlled study plan and aerobic training (40 minutes) wil be combined with Whole Body
      Vibration Training (WBVT for 15 minutes) which is made up of a shorter time application. WBVT
      to be applied instead of the resistance exercises.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>FibroScan</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>İn the Fibroscan measurement session, the patient lying supine, the tip of the transducer is placed on the skin between the ribs over the right lobe of the liver. At least 10 validated measurements with a ratio of interquartile range (IQR) and median LSM of less than or equal to 30 percent are required for an interpretation of significant fibrosis or cirrhosis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Profile of liver enzymes</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Serum liver enzymes ALT, AST, GGT, ALP will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated by dividing weight (kg) by height (m2).
The BMI Categories will be done as follows:
Underweight = &lt;18.5 Normal weight = 18.5-24.9 Overweight = 25-29.9 Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) will be done.The goal of testing is to evaluate the physiologic response of the heart, lungs and muscles to an increase in physical stress. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) with cycle ergometer.
The following values will be calculated personally. Peak oxygen consumption Peak heart rate Metabolic equivalent Aerobic threshold Anaerobic threshold Heart rate reserve</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Body Fat Percentage</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Body Fat Percentage will be calculated skinfold measures using Jackson-Pollock measurement system. The Jackson-Pollack method for evaluating body fat percentage requires three skinfold measurements. For men, measurement sites are the chest, abdomen and thigh; for women, they consist of the thigh, triceps and suprailiac crest, or just above the top of the hip bone. Body Fat Percentage Formula will be use as follows:
The formula for men is: 1.10938 - (0.0008267 x the sum of the chest, abdomen and thigh measurements in millimeters) + (0.0000016 x the square of the sum of the chest, abdomen and thigh measurements in millimeters) - (0.0002574 x age) = body density
The formula for women, also known as the Jackson-Pollock-Ward formula, is: 1.0994921 - (0.0009929 x the sum of the triceps, thigh and suprailiac measurements) + (0.0000023 x the square of the sum of the triceps, thigh and suprailiac measurements) - (0.0001392 x age) = body density</description>
