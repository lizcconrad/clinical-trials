  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab in the treatment
      of Thyroid Eye Disease (TED) in participants who participated in the lead-in study
      HZNP-TEP-301 (NCT03298867) and who were either proptosis non-responders at Week 24 of
      HZNP-TEP-301 or were proptosis responders at Week 24 but meet the criteria for re-treatment
      due to relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301.

      This is a multi-center, open-label extension study of HZNP-TEP-301 (NCT03298867) examining
      the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab in the treatment of TED in adult participants.
      Participants who complete the 24-week double-masked Treatment Period in Study HZNP-TEP-301
      and are proptosis non-responders or were proptosis responders at Week 24 but meet the
      criteria for re-treatment due to relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 will be
      eligible for enrollment.

      All participants who choose to participate will receive up to 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10
      mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an
      open-label fashion, with the number of infusions determined by the Investigator's clinical
      judgment (but not to exceed 8 infusions). The Baseline (Day 1) Visit of this extension study
      will occur within 14 days after the final visit of Study HZNP-TEP-301 (Week 24 for proptosis
      non-responders and up to Week 72 for participants who relapse). During the open-label
      Treatment Period, study drug infusions are scheduled for Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9,
      12, 15, 18, and 21. When the Investigator considers treatment to be complete, participants
      will have an EOT Visit 3 weeks after the final infusion and undergo the scheduled EOT
      assessments.

      Participants who relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP-TEP-301 and choose to enter this
      extension study will not participate in the Follow-Up Period of this study and will be
      discharged from the study following completion of the EOT assessments.

    <description>Teprotumumab is a fully human anti-IGF-1R mAb. Teprotumumab will be provided in single-dose 20 mL glass vials as a freeze-dried powder. Each vial of teprotumumab must be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. Reconstituted teprotumumab solution must be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution prior to administration. Teprotumumab will be administered in 100 mL or 250 mL infusion bags (100 mL infusion bags for doses up to 1800 mg and 250 mL infusion bags for doses &gt; 1800 mg).</description>
