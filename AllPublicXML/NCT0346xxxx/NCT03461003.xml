  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The single patient (n-of-1) randomized trial is an underused approach to resolving
      therapeutic uncertainty by using a patient's own data to inform an individualized treatment
      plan. The proposed research is designed to assess whether the n-of-1 trial approach improves
      blood pressure control. This trial will advance learning about not only the treatment of
      pediatric hypertension but also the use of a neglected type of randomized trial to optimize
      the care of each patient.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric hypertension, a growing problem, often requires prescription of antihypertensive
      medication. Pediatric hypertension specialists lack an evidentiary base on which to establish
      definitive clinical practice guidelines for first-line therapy. Significant practice
      variation is an unsurprising consequence. Routine choice of the same first-line therapy for
      most patients with hypertension, absent testing other options, may delay correction of blood
      pressure for months or years. Failure to incorporate patient preferences in medical
      decision-making may also contribute to decreased patient satisfaction and adherence.

      Large parallel-group, comparative effectiveness trials are likely not on the horizon for this
      population. Moreover, heterogeneity of treatment effects would minimize the generalizability
      of such a trial to all patients.

      This is a parallel-group, randomized clinical trial to test whether the n-of-1 trial approach
      is superior to usual care in normalizing blood pressure while minimizing exposure to
      compliance-reducing side effects.

    <description>In the NICHE method, antihypertensive therapy will be chosen using an n-of-trial to identify the preferred therapy. Preferred therapy is defined a priori as that which produces the greatest reduction in ambulatory BP without intolerable side effects. Tested drugs will include amlodipine or losartan, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide.</description>

    <description>Based on underlying comorbidities at enrollment, patients will be assigned to either an unrestricted protocol (amlodipine versus lisinopril) or a restricted protocol (losartan versus lisinopril). Two drugs are tested in randomized order. Failure to achieve BP control at maximum doses of the first two drugs will result in augmentation with a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide). BP control is assessed with 24 hour ambulatory monitoring at the end of each 2 week treatment period. Side effect tolerability is assessed with a questionnaire.</description>
