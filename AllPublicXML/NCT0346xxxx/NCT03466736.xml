  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that individuals with low short-term
      practice effects (STPE) on cognitive testing are more likely to be identified as &quot;positive&quot;
      on amyloid imaging than individuals with high STPE. STPE may also inform us about other
      AD-related biomarkers, including hippocampal volumes, functional connectivity, and APOE
      status. By realizing the aims of this pragmatic study, we hope to be able to offer more
      economical and efficient screening of potential participants for clinical trials, which would
      reduce participant burden and financial costs.
