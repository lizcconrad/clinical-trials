  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Certain studies reported that cigarette by-products may make the cornea more rigid,
      suggesting that it could lead to &quot;natural&quot; CXL of collagen fibers, hence a protective effect
      for KC. Others have reported that cigarette smoking causes no significant changes in the
      corneal biomechanics. The aim of this study was to assess a possible link between keratoconus
      (KC) occurrence and patients' smoking habits.

      a telephone Survey was performed among 80 KC patients who were treated from March 2014 until
      September 2017 by accelerated crosslinking (A-CXL) within the ophthalmology department. From
      the 80 people we phoned, 62 answered. Our questions were regarding family history, allergic
      history, and smoking habits. Family history was considered positive if a first-degree or
      second-degree relative had been diagnosed with KC. Allergies toward any kind of external
      factors were marked as positive. Patients' smoking habits were recorded and classified into
      regular, occasional, ex-smoker and non-smoker. The results were confronted to those of the
      general population by indirect standardization over age and sex according to the &quot;Baromètre
      Santé 2010&quot; INPES survey (French Nation Institute for Prevention and Health Education).
