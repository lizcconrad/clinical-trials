  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to identify a safe dose of metformin, in combination with
      oligomeric procyanidin complex (OPC) for pharmacologic reduction of AGE levels in patients
      with prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AGEs (advanced glycation endpoints) are a type of metabolite, or substance, found in the
      food. The AGE content in food is determined by the types of food you eat and also how you
      prepare your food. The researchers helping conduct this study have found a potential link
      between AGE levels and cancer. The purpose of this study is to identify safe pharmaceutical
      agents that can reduce the AGE levels in subjects with advanced cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Confirmation of adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is documented by one of the
             following: pathology report or clinic note with documented history of prostate cancer.

          2. Subjects must be receiving ADT with a GnRH agonist or antagonist, with or without an
             anti-androgen, with a current testosterone level documented to be &lt;50ng/dL at
             enrollment. Subjects whose ADT is interrupted may enroll or continue on study as long
             as the testosterone is documented to remain &lt;50ng/dL for the entire duration of study
             participation. Subjects who have undergone orchiectomy are also eligible.

          3. Subjects must have adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function at baseline, as
             follows:

               -  Hematology parameters: ANC &gt;1000/mcL, platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL, Hgb &gt;8.0gm/dL

               -  Renal Function: eGFR of ≥ 45mls/min using Cockkroft and Gault formula (see
                  appendix C).

             history of acidosis of any type; habitual intake of 3 or more alcoholic beverages per
             day).

          4. Prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for metastatic prostate cancer; prior treatment with

             thistle; pine bark, green tea, saw palmetto; resveratrol; flavonoids; catechins;
             ellagic acid), large quantities of red grapes, white button mushrooms, red wine
