  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present Pocock clinical trial study was conducted In the city of Mashhad in Iran between
      2015 and 2016. The study inclusion criteria were men with low fertility of sperm motility&lt;25%
      and total motility &lt;50% (asthenozoospermia), no history of endocrine diseases, no diabetes
      men, no hormonal problems in their wives, and a healthy salpingography in their wives. The
      study subjects were voluntarily assigned to royal gel and IUI groups. In royal gel group, 5
      grams of royal gel was used after menstruation and every other night before and after
      intercourse. IUI group received 75 units of FSH from the second day of the cycle. Then
      vaginal ultrasound was performed from the sixth day of menstrual cycle to determine the right
      size of follicle. 10000 units of HCG was administered when follicle diameter reached 16mm,
      and the study subject was prepared for IUI 32-36 hours later. Each subject alternately
      swapped groups following fertility failure.

      After selection of subjects and obtaining their informed consents, the quality of royal gel
      was examined.

      The quality of royal gel is determined by the amount of polyphenol it contains. Polyphenol in
      royal gel was assessed in the following stages: first, the sample was diluted with ethanol
      50% to 1:10 ratio, and then, 100µl of this preparation was poured into a test tube, and 750µl
      of 1:10 diluted solution of FCR (Folin Ciocalteau Reagent) was added and left at room
      temperature for five minutes. Then, 750µl of sodium carbonate 6% solution was added to each
      tube, and after keeping these tubes in the dark for one hour, absorption was measured at
      780nm wavelength. Negative control consisted of all reaction compounds, except the sample,
      for which, ethanol 50% was used instead. The sample concentration was determined using the
      gallic acid standard. By definition, the desirable quality of polyphenol in natural royal gel
      ranges from 0.15mg (minimum) to 0.75mg (maximum) in every 100 grams, and this was determined
      0.5 mg for the sample used in the present study, indicating a good quality (15).
