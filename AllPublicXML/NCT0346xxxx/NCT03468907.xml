  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the most common mode of perpetuating chronic hepatitis
      B virus (HBV) infection in endemic countries. Many studies have demonstrated antepartum
      anti-viral therapy (AVT) is a advisable option to reduce mother-to-child transmission and the
      risk of vaccination breakthrough in infants who received passive-active immunoprophylaxis.
      However, several controversies over antiviral treatment have not been resolved, that is,
      optimal duration, effect of postpartum therapy, and risk of postpartum alanine
      aminotransferase (ALT) flare after withdrawal. Will the risk of postpartum hepatitis flares
      increase after short-term AVT in late pregnancy for maternal HBV infection is discontinued?
      Is there any correlation between postpartum hepatitis flares and withdrawal time? Will the
      proportion of postpartum flares be reduced if extending the duration of AVT after delivery?
      There is an urgent need in this area. This study mainly investigates the safety of antiviral
      therapy in preventing HBV mother-to-child transmission in pregnant women after
      discontinuation.

      This is a prospective, open-label, interventional trial, in which patients are to be
      recruited during their visit to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics or the Department
      of Infectious Diseases of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University in
      Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China, between March 2018 and December 2020. Pregnant women
      fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be offered participation in the study.
      All pregnant women who opt for AVT need to sign a consent form and start on oral telbivudine
      (LDT) 600 mg or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg (as per patients' wishes) daily
      between gestational weeks 24 and 28. Serum levels of HBV DNA, HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg, HBeAb,
      liver function tests, haematology and renal biochemistry are measured at baseline(i.e. at
      screening), every 4 weeks after treatment begins, at the time of delivery, and at 1, 2, 3, 7,
      12 month postpartum. AVT is discontinued to the patients with ALT &lt; 2 times ULN, while the
      other patients with abnormal serum ALT level (â‰¥ 2 times ULN) continued to take antiviral
      agents and cease AVT at postpartum 6 weeks. Mothers can choose to breastfeed infants one week
      after the medicine withdrawal. All infants are vaccinated with genetically engineered HBV
      vaccine 20 ug according to a standard vaccination regimen (i.e. within 12h of birth, at week
      4 and at week 24) and 200 IU doses of hepatitis B immunoglobulin immediately (within 2h)
      after birth and at day 15. The infant's HBV serologic status and HBV DNA are tested at birth
      (before immunization) and again at 7 months. The investigators discuss the postpartum liver
      function after withdrawal and evaluate the impact of extending the postpartum duration of AVT
      administered for the prevention of perinatal transmission.
