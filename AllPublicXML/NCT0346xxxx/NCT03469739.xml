      This study uses data from 29,990 women from 12 different countries collected by the WHO
      multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence to capture the effect of
      different types, frequency and timing of IPV on self-reported health, symptoms and suicidal
      behaviours.

    <textblock>
      Intimate partner violence (IPV) has detrimental effects on physical and mental health, risks
      to children and is associated with wider societal and healthcare costs. Previous analysis of
      the WHO multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence found significant
      associations between physical and sexual IPV and self-reported ill-health, symptomatology and
      suicidal behaviours.

      Real experience of IPV can comprise different combinations of emotional, physical and sexual
      abuse, and different timings and frequencies of these. A more nuanced testing of exposure to
      these different combinations of IPV and associations with health is needed.

      multi-country study on women's health and domestic violence to capture the effect of
      different combination types, frequency and timing of IPV on self-reported health, symptoms
      and suicidal behaviours.
