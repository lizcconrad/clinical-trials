  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effects of atezolizumab with low dose
      radiation on people with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma, In this study, the
      patient will get either atezolizumab with low dose radiation or, atezolizumab alone. To be
      better, the atezolizumab and low dose radiation should increase life by 1 year or more
      compared to the usual approach.
