      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG), Also known as longitudinal or vertical gastrectomy.

      LSG was initially considered a first-stage operation in high-risk patients before
      bilio-pancreatic diversion or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. However, LSG was subsequently
      found to be effective as a single procedure for treatment of morbid obesity.LSG functions
      mainly as a restrictive procedure in which about 75 % of the stomach is removed leaving a
      narrow gastric tube or sleeve. So, it limits the amount of food that can be eaten at one time
      via inducing early satiety after eating a small amount of food due to early distension of the
      fashioned gastric sleeve giving a sense of satiety, consequently losing excess body weight by
      time.Sleeve gastrectomy may also cause a decrease in appetite by reducing the amount of
      Ghrelin (hunger hormone) produced by the stomach.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients,males and females with age (20-50 years old) with morbid obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2
      or &gt; 35 kg/m2 associated with co-morbidity) randomly admitted to Assiut University
      Hospital-General Surgery Department.

      Pre-operative: Assessment of; BMI (Body Mass Index), Fasting Blood Glucose level (FBG),
      Associated Co-morbidities (as hypertensions &amp; sleep apnea).

      Operative (During Operation):

      All patients undergo LSG by single team work with intra-operative oesophageal bougie 36
      french with use of laparoscopic gastro-intestinal anastomosis(GIA) stapler.

      Post-operative:

      Patients are discharged from the hospital after they can start oral diet.

      Post-operative evaluation of:

        1. Complications:

             1. Early complications: during the first 2 weeks after surgery,which include
                hemorrhage (intra-luminal or extra-luminal), staple line leak, vomiting and
                infection (surgical site infection or intra- abdominal abscess formation)

             2. Late complications: from 2 weeks to 6 months post-operative, which include
                stricture of the gastric sleeve, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and
                nutritional deficiencies.

        2. Excess weight loss (EWL) by using BMI Follow up of patients at fifteen days, one month,
           two months, three months and six months after surgery.

        3. Assessment of Blood Glucose level during visits.

        4. Measurement of blood pressure during visits (if there is associated hypertension).
