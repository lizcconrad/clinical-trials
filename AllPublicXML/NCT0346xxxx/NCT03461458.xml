      This study is a prospective, phase I dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and
      feasibility of intradiscally injected AD-MSCs in the treatment of painful degenerative disc
      disease. The investigators propose a blended open enrollment protocol of four cohorts, each
      comprised of 3 subjects, to allow for interim analysis following the completion of each
      cohort to review safety data prior to commencing treatment of the next cohort. A total of 12
      subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be screened at outpatient clinic visit appointments
      and interested qualified subjects will be consented and offered participation in this trial.
      Once consent has been obtained baseline values will be established and subjects will begin
      treatment and follow-up for the next 24 months. Baseline data will include physical
      examination of the axial skeleton and sacroiliac region, neurologic examination, clinical
      assessment of low back pain and function using validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures
      (PROMs), radiographs, peripheral blood analysis, and MRI imaging.

      Abdominal fat will be harvested through a small incision and processed by the Mayo Clinic
      IMPACT laboratory using current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) and previously
      established standard operating procedures (SOPs) to produce clinical grade, autologous,
      culture-expanded AD-MSCs for subsequent intradiscal injection. All injections will be
      performed using fluoroscopic guidance and all patients will be clinically evaluated
      immediately after procedure and at week 2 and 4 post-treatment to assess for acute adverse
      events (AEs). Following completion of their respective treatment cycle, each subject will be
      followed for study endpoints using a predetermined protocol, including clinical evaluation,
      radiography, MRI, and peripheral blood analysis. A final visit for evaluation and imaging
      will be conducted at the end of the study.

                  pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to
                  confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug
                  will not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy
                  test. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at a central clinical laboratory,
                  whereas urine pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using a
                  kit.

                  duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer.
                  Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any serious adverse
                  events (SAEs) associated with pregnancy will be recorded. The requirement for

          3. Patients must demonstrate radiographic evidence of mild to moderate degenerative disc
             disease as defined by radiographic evidence of modified Pfirrmann scores of 3, 4, 5 or

             radiographic evidence of change from normal disc morphology of the index disc
             identified by modified Pfirrmann score and Modic Type I or II changes.

             • Change from normal disc morphology of the index disc will be determined based on
             radiographic evaluation. Radiographs must show all of the following as determined by
             participating fellowship trained radiologists at Mayo Clinic:

               -  A modified Pfirrmann score of 3, 4, 5 or 6 on MRI at the index disc

          4. Leg pain, if present, is of nonradicular origin, i.e., not due to stimulation of nerve
             roots or dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve by compressive forces.

          5. Leg pain, if present, does not extend below the knee and is no greater than 50% of low
             back pain as measured on a visual analog scale. If bilateral leg pain is present, the
             worst leg pain is no greater than 50% of low back pain.

          6. Full understanding of the requirements of the study and willingness to comply with the
             treatment plan, including laboratory tests, diagnostic imaging, and follow-up visits
             and assessments.

             first 24 months post-treatment. If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, the
             subject will remain in the study and only the requirement for radiation (x-ray or MRI)
             will be removed.
