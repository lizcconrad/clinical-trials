    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy of prophylaxis with oral vancomycin for preventing
      recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) in patients who have experienced at least one
      CDI episode in the last 90 days and are receiving antibiotics for a non CDI condition.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either placebo or oral vancomycin in addition to
      their prescribed antibiotic therapy.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients who have a CDI experience recurrent or relapsing symptoms. The investigators
      are studying whether vancomycin in low doses will help prevent further CDI episodes and how
      this therapy impacts patients' gastrointestinal microbiome and composition.

      Patients with a history of past CDI who are receiving antibiotics for a non-CDI condition
      will be invited to participate. Approximately half of the participants will receive a
      low-dose capsule of vancomycin and half will receive a placebo. Participants will continue
      taking the vancomycin/placebo for 5 days after their prescribed antibiotics end.
