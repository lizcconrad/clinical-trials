    <textblock>
      Existing IV iron complexes differ in relation to the compounds capability to induce
      unintended hypophosphatemia to a degree defined as medical significant.

      This trial is designed evaluate the effect of IV iron isomaltoside compared to IV ferric
      carboxymaltose on phosphate in subjects with IDA due to inflammatory bowel disease .
