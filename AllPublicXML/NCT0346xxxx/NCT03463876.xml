    <textblock>
      SHR-1210 is a humanized monoclonal antibody against Programmed death 1(PD-1). Apatinib is a
      new kind of selective Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2(VEGFR-2) tyrosine kinase
      inhibitor (TKI).

      Patients with advanced HCC who failed or intolerable to sorafenib will received apatinib
      250mg orally every day and SHR-1210 200mg (3mg/kg for underweight patients) iv every 2 weeks.
      The efficacy and safety will be observed.
