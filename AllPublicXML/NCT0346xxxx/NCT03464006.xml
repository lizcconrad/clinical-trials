  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to examine whether an online patient tool to monitor factors affecting
      patients peripheral artery disease can lead to improvements in patients' disease and slow its
      progression.

      The objective of this project is to implement a program involving a new online
      patient-centred approach to assist in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) self-management in
      home and work environments, in collaboration with patient circles of care (patients,
      care-givers, physicians, and allied healthcare professionals). This program involves online
      modules tailored to the needs of specific patients and diseases, oriented to education,
      training, monitoring, and continuing support for lifestyle changes (smoking cessation,
      exercise, healthy diets, weight loss, etc.) and psycho-social needs such as social isolation
      and loneliness. The investigators have tested an online desk-top version for over 30
      out-patients with PAD at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The investigators propose to test
      its ability for improved outcomes and healthcare quality of life through a multi-centre
      randomized controlled trial for PAD and a frequently co-occurring chronic illness, high blood
      pressure.

    <description>Patients in the online support module group will receive a tablet which has the developed peripheral arterial disease platform installed on it. The platform helps the patient to monitor factors related to their peripheral arterial disease such as exercise, smoking, and diet and helps them to track and modify these behaviours.</description>
