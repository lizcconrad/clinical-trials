    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to establish the methodology of bronchial dilation test by
      salbutamol MDI with Spacer in wheezy infants with asthma and to evaluate the effects of atopy
      on the exacerbation of wheeze in wheezy infants.

      After screening,each participant undergo baseline pulmonary function test(Jaeger Master
      Screen Baby Body, Germany)and post-bronchodilator measurements that performed 10min after
      200ug of salbutamol administered using a metered-dose inhaler and a spacer.

      The participants undergo baseline lung function test and bronchial dilation tests on the
      second and third visits with one-month interval,and whenever there is an exacerbation.
