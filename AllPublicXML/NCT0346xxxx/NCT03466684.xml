  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High volume fluid therapy in open abdomen (OA) trauma patients contributes to excessive
      visceral edema, delayed fascial closure, and prolonged parenteral nutrition. Thus, we
      investigated whether bioelectrical impedance analysis-directed resuscitation reduced
      postoperative fluid overload, and improved outcomes in OA trauma patients.

    <description>BIA-directed fluid resuscitation The protocol for patients assigned to BIA-directed resuscitation was as follows. A 500-ml bolus of crystalloid was applied every 30 min to maintain central venous pressure (CVP) of 8 to 10 mmHg. If mean arterial pressure (MAP) was below 65 mmHg, vasopressors were provided to maintain a mean arterial pressure of &gt;65 mmHg. If HL &gt; 73.3 %, fluid infusion was restricted, and a furosemide drip and CRRT were initiated with an ultrafiltration rate that gave a negative fluid balance to maintain the central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, and HL. Patients were usually beside the bed or taken back to the operating room within 2 days for attempted primary closure. If the abdomen could not be closed after several attempts, then the abdomen was closed with biologics or skin grafting with a planned ventral hernia repair at a later date.</description>

    <description>Traditional fluid resuscitation Briefly, a 500-ml bolus of crystalloid was given every 30 min to achieve a CVP of 8-12 mm Hg. Vasopressors, vasodilators, and dobutamine were given to maintain appropriate MAP with central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2). Red cells were transfused to promote ScvO2 when &lt;70%.</description>

        All trauma patients requiring damage control laparotomy with nonclosure of the abdominal
        fascia were admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU), identified and
        prospectively followed during the study period.
