      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of exemestane in combination with
      pemetrexed disodium and carboplatin in treating post-menopausal women with stage IV non-small
      cell lung cancer. Exemestane may stop the growth of tumor calls by blocking some of the
      enzymes need for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as pemetrexed disodium and
      carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving exemestane together with pemetrexed disodium
      and carboplatin may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of exemestane when given with
      pemetrexed (pemetrexed disodium) and carboplatin in post-menopausal women with stage IV
      non-squamous, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective tumor response rate (defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1) in patients treated with pemetrexed, carboplatin and exemestane.

      II. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of pemetrexed, carboplatin and exemestane.

      III. Evaluate quality of life in patients treated with pemetrexed, carboplatin and
      exemestane.

      IV. Analyze tumor tissue biomarkers for potential correlation with response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of exemestane.

      Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and pemetrexed disodium
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 3
      months thereafter.

    <description>For categorical markers Fisher's exact test will be used. The log rank test will be used to examine association between categorical markers and time to disease progression. For quantitative markers one-way ANOVA will be used. Cox-proportional hazards regression models will be used to correlate quantitative markers with time to disease progression. Pearson correlations will be used between pairs of quantitative markers. If there is significant non-normality the Kendall correlation coefficients will be used. Mixed effects models will be used to quantify markers at multiple time points.</description>
