    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled
      pilot study is to study feasibility and collect preliminary clinical data related to the
      safety and clinical benefits of daily use of non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation with the
      GammaCore device for the prevention of chronic migraine, and to support the development and
      approval of a larger pivotal study.

          -  Has an abnormal baseline ECG (e.g. second and third degree heart block, atrial
             fibrillation, atrial flutter, recent history of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular
             fibrillation, or clinically significant premature ventricular contraction)

          -  Has had a previous bilateral, right, or left cervical vagotomy.

          -  Has uncontrolled high blood pressure.

          -  Is currently implanted with an electrical and/or neurostimulator device, including but
             not limited to cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, vagal neurostimulator, deep brain
             stimulator, spinal stimulator, bone growth stimulator, or cochlear implant.

          -  Has a history of carotid endarterectomy or vascular neck surgery on the right side.

          -  Has been implanted with metal cervical spine hardware or has a metallic implant near
             the GammaCore stimulation site.

          -  Has a recent or repeated history of syncope.

          -  Has a recent or repeated history of seizure.

          -  Has a known history or suspicion of substance abuse or addiction.
