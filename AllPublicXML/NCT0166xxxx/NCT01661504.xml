    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this proposed study is to develop the state of knowledge in the area of
      gender-based violence and reproductive health by conducting a randomized controlled trial to
      improve the health care provider's capacity to screen for intimate partner violence and to
      mitigate associated risk among women health clinic patrons of reproductive age (ages18-44)
      with recent experiences of physical or sexual partner violence in Mexico City and its
      surrounding area.

      The specific research objectives are as follows:

        1. To increase mid-level health care providers' capacity to identify Intimate Partner
           Violence (IPV) and assist women with risk mitigation

        2. Utilizing a randomized controlled trial, to assess the impact of an enhanced health care
           worker screening and counselling program on (a) past year severe IPV (sexual or
           physical), including severe IPV; (b) reproductive coercion (c) use of community-based
           resources and safety planning; and (d) quality of life; versus minimum standard of care

        3. To qualitatively examine which programmatic components may serve as mechanisms for
           observed changes stated in the second objective

        4. To synthesize study findings and a) create recommendations for clinic-based intervention
           programs to address IPV in low and middle income countries and b) disseminate
           information as reports, presentation, and peer-reviewed publications

    <description>Participants will be followed up at 3 months and at 15 months post-baseline to assess intimate partner violence victimization as measured by an adapted Conflict Tactics Scale - 2. This will allow for a 12 month follow-up from the booster counseling session in the intervention group which occurs at 3 months post-baseline.</description>
