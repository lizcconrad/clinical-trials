  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic chemotherapy with cytotoxic drug is of limited effectiveness in advanced pancreatic
      cancer patients. Gemcitabine has been used as the first-line drug for advance pancreatic
      cancer for over two decades and combinations of gemcitabine with different chemotherapeutic
      drugs have been investigated to improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer. However, no
      substantial improvement in patient survival has been achieved. Locoregional chemotherapy via
      intra-arterial perfusion or chemoemoblization takes advantage of the increasing local drug
      concentrations and reducing systemic toxicities. In this study, the investigators hypothesis
      that artery infusion chemotherapy had a better antitumor effect than systemic chemotherapy.
      The investigators will analyze and evaluate the effect and safety of an implanted
      percutaneous left subclavian artery port-catheter drug delivery system for regional
      chemotherapy of inoperable pancreatic carcinoma.

    <description>The patients in experimental group were monitored by X-ray imaging. A 0.038 super-sliding guide wire was inserted after successful puncture, and when site of the pancreatic carcinoma was reconfirmed by conventional angiography, a 5F cobra catheter was used to place the port-catheter drug delivery system in the celiac artery (pancreatic head) or the hepatic artery (pancreatic body and tail). Finally, the port-catheter was embedded under the left upper chest.</description>
