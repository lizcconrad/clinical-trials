      This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational, multicenter study in which urethral
      length is measured in women with surgically-correctable stress urinary incontinence who
      undergo a suburethral sling operative procedure. Data will be collected from preoperative
      urogynecological testing and medical histories. The urethral length will be measured
      intraoperatively using scaled catheters. Outcome data, including the development of
      postoperative complications, will be collected at several time intervals.

    <description>Patients are classified as 'cured' if the postoperative cough test is negative, the 1-hour pad test is negative (less than 2 g) and the degree of subjective suffering improves to over 90% (VAS score of 0 or 1). All other patients are classified as therapeutic 'failures', even though they may experience marked improvement in one of the parameters compared with their preoperative status.</description>
