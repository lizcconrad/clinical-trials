  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery to correct scoliosis (spinal fusion)generates a severe pain intensity rending pain
      management a complex task. Several studies have found out that pharmacological interventions
      alone were not enough to provide optimal pain management for these patients. The
      investigators developed a DVD on guided imagery, customized for teenagers, to help them cope
      better with their pain. The investigators believe that this type of intervention combined
      with their usual analgesic medication will help them to control their pain and foster
      rehabilitation.

    <description>Pain was measured before the patients left the hospital on their 7th postoperative day (T-1, time of discharge from hospital). It was measured again at two week post-discharge (T-2) and also at one month post-discharge (T-3) on their visit to the orthopedic clinic. Our primary outcome was at T-2.</description>

    <description>Anxiety was measured as baseline data on the pre-operative visit (24 hrs before surgery). It was also measured at two weeks post-discharge and at one month on the day of the visit to the orthopedic clinic.</description>

    <description>Coping strategies of adolescents regarding their pain management were also measured pre-operatively (24 hrs before surgery), at two weeks and one month post-surgery.</description>
