    <textblock>
      This is an open, monocentric, pilot study to determine the metabolic activity
      (glucose-uptake) in vivo during monotherapy with pazopanib in comparison to combination
      therapy with pazopanib plus paclitaxel and to investigate the transcriptional profile of
      cutaneous melanoma metastasis before and during the therapy (pazopanib vs. pazopanib plus
      paclitaxel) in subjects with unresectable Stage III or Stage IV melanoma who have not
      received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.

      Primary Objective:

      Evaluation of metabolic activity in vivo

      Secondary Objective:

      Determination of changes in gene expression profiling Evaluation of the antitumor activity of
      the combination in terms of progression free survival (PFS). Changes in S100 and LDH during
      therapy at the same time points as FDG-PET/CT (a combined serum measurement of S100 and LDH)
