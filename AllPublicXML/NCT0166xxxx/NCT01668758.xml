      Background:

      - The amount of blood flowing in brain areas goes up when those areas are being used for
      activities, such as movement or seeing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a
      common way of measuring blood flow in the brain. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can also
      be used to study blood flow in the brain. However, NIRS has not been used as often as fMRI.
      Researchers want to compare fMRI and NIRS to see whether they give similar results. These
      studies will be used to look at people who have had a traumatic brain injury.

      Objectives:

      - To test how well NIRS measure changes in blood flow in the brain after a traumatic brain
      injury.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have had a traumatic brain injury.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Researchers may
           ask to see brain images during from previous MRI scans.

        -  Participants will have a NIRS scan of the brain. They will be asked to do certain tasks
           while inside the scanner. These tasks will involve responding to images that appear on a
           screen.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      The goal of this study is to be able to assess frontal lobe function in a rapid, objective,
      and standardized way, without the need for expertise in cognitive test administration. Such
      methods would be particularly helpful in mild traumatic brain injury, where objective
      measures are needed, and would greatly expand the capacity to make such assessments in
      standard clinical practice.

      Our goal is to recruit 100 subjects total in two groups of age, gender, and education matched
      subjects, as follows: TBI (n = 50) and non-TBI (n = 50).

      The subject will be asked to perform 2 computer-based cognitive tests while the fNIRS device
      is in place. The fNIRS sensor pads will record changes in blood oxy/deoxy hemoglobin
      concentrations in the underlying cortex. Data will be stored for post processing analysis.

      The main outcome measures will be: 1) a correlation of the fNIRS results between the TBI and
      non-TBI groups; 2) a correlation of the fNIRS results with the severity of the TBI within the
      TBI group. Finally, we plan to compare individual measurement from TBI patients with the
      healthy group.
