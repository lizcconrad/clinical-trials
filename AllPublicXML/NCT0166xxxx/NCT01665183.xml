    <textblock>
      Certain cancers require the amino acid arginine. Arginine deiminase (ADI) is an enzyme from
      microbes that degrades arginine. ADI has been formulated with polyethylene glycol, and has
      been used to treat patients that have cancers that require arginine. In this study, ADI will
      be combined with the well known chemotherapy cisplatin, and the safety and potential efficacy
      of this combination will be explored in patients with cancers that require arginine.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed diagnosis of advanced solid tumor (dose escalation component)
             or metastatic melanoma (uveal or cutaneous) (doses escalation and MTD expansion
             components) or platinum-resistant (tumor progression within a year after the
             completion of platinum-based therapy) ovarian carcinoma (high grade serous,
             endometrial or poorly differentiated endometrioid) or HCC that has failed treatment
             with sorafenib or did not tolerate sorafenib or refused sorafenib, or HCC with
             coexistent BCT that has or has not been treated with chemotherapy, or BCT that has or
             has not been treated with chemotherapy. For HCC and HCC with coexistent BCT, cirrhotic
             status of Child-Pugh grade A-B7 must be present. Child-Pugh status should be
             determined based on clinical findings and laboratory data during the screening period
             (Appendix C). Subjects on anti-coagulants are to receive 1 point for their INR status,
             as they are presumed to have a &lt;1.7 baseline PT/INR.

          2. Ovarian cancer, or HCC, or HCC with coexistent BCT, or BCT only tissue either from an
             archived specimen or from a new biopsy of sufficient amount and quality should be
             available for IHC determination of ASS status to be performed retrospectively for the
             ovarian cancer, or HCC, or HCC with coexistent BCT, or BCT only cohorts. Subjects with
             no tissue available would require a biopsy.

          3. Unresectable disease or patient refused surgery.

          4. Progressive disease if treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery or
             immunotherapy. If prior radiation was given, the measurable disease should be outside
             the radiation port. Unequivocal progression of HCC/BTC lesions previously treated with
             catheter-based therapy including transarterial chemoembolization or radioembolization
             is allowed.

          5. Measurable disease as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria (Appendix A).

          6. Age ≥ 18 years.

          7. ECOG performance status of 0 - 1.

          8. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, chemoembolization,
             radioembolization or radiation therapy within the last 4 weeks.

          9. Fully recovered from any prior surgery and no major surgery within 4 weeks of
             initiating treatment, except for gamma knife which can take place within 2 weeks.
             Surgery for placement of vascular access devices is acceptable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Serious infection requiring treatment with systemically administered antibiotics at
             the time of study entrance, or an infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy
             within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment. For the HCC, HCC/BTC and BTC
             subgroups hepatitis C infection and hepatitis B infection if controlled with antiviral
             therapy are allowable.

          2. Pregnancy or lactation.

          3. Expected non-compliance.

          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III
             or IV), cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness, social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          5. Subjects who have had any anticancer treatment prior to entering the study and have
             not recovered to baseline (except alopecia) or ≤ Grade 1 AEs, or deemed irreversible
             from the effects of prior cancer therapy. AEs &gt; Grade 1 that are not considered a
             safety risk by the Sponsor and investigator may be allowed upon agreement with both.

          6. Subjects with history of another primary cancer, including co-existent second
             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b)
             curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor with no
             known active disease present in the opinion of the investigator will not affect
             patient outcome in the setting of current cancer diagnosis.

          7. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.

          8. History of seizure disorder not related to underlying cancer.

          9. Known HIV positivity (testing not required).
