  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heroin addiction has emerged as a serious problem with tremendous impacts on the addicts and
      the society. Since the introduction of opioids substitutive treatment in 2006, more than
      30,000 heroin addicts had received treatment, and nearly 12,000 continued on treatment
      currently. However, an unknown proportion of patients hidden in community remained
      un-treatment. To motivate the community heroin addicts is thus a challenging task.

      It is suggested that decision making deficit is core feature which determine outcomes and
      treatment motivations in patients with addiction disorders. Recently, the state-of-the-art
      development of epigenetics uncover that environmental modification, via altering level of DNA
      methylation and gene expression will influence on neurocognitive functioning.

      Via respondent-driven sampling, this study aims to recruit a representative sample targeting
      at the hard-to-reach community heroin addicts. The goal of this study is to identify the
      clinical feature as well as decision making-related neurocognitive deficit in these patients.
      Moreover, the investigators will explore the interplay of clinical features, DNA methylation
      and gene expressions on opioids receptor genes. The findings will help to clarify the
      clinical characteristics of community heroin addicts, to uncover the links between DNA
      methylation and clinical features of heroin addiction and to develop modifiable treatment
      targets in the future.
