      This open-label, single arm, multicenter long-term extension study of WA19926 will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with moderate to
      severe rheumatoid arthritis who have completed the 104-week WA19926 core study. Eligible
      patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 104
      weeks.
