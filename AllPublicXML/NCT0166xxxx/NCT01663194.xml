      Although the pre-procedural neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (N/L) has been associated with
      adverse outcomes among patients with coronary artery disease, its role during the acute phase
      of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has not been fully investigated. This
      study sought to investigate the association of the pre-procedural N/L ratio within-hospital
      and long-term outcomes among STEMI patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI).

    <textblock>
      Inflammation plays a role in the initiation and progression of the atherosclerotic process.
      Due to a growing recognition of its role, recent studies have focused on inflammatory markers
      and their association with outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial
      infarction (STEMI). Recently, our single center study demonstrated that preprocedural
      neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio is an independent predictor of impaired coronary flow after
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and of in-hospital major advanced cardiac
      events (MACE) in patients with STEMI.Several previous studies also evaluated the role of N/L
      ratio in long-term outcomes among patients with STEMI; however, they evaluated the
      association between long-term mortality and in-hospital N/L ratio, they were single-center
      studies and they evaluated a relatively small study population.

      In the present multicenter experience, the investigators aimed to investigate the association
      of the preprocedural N/L ratio with the in-hospital and long-term outcomes in patients with
      STEMI undergoing primary PCI.

    <description>All primary PCI procedures were performed using the standard femoral approach with a 7-French guiding catheter for each patients. After administration of 5,000 IU of intravenous heparin (70 U/Kg) and a 300 mg loading dose of clopidogrel, direct stenting was performed whenever possible, and in the remaining cases, balloon pre-dilatation was performed. The operator determined the choice of stents (bare metal or drug-eluting stent).</description>
