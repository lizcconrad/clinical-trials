  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new way of imaging called the Cerenkov luminescence
      or effect that is used with a standard clinical PET/CT and/or investigation scans can be done
      in order to capture tumor sizes. The investigators believe endoscopies and surgical
      procedures could benefit from this type of imaging in the future. The Cerenkov imaging could
      be used as a guide for surgical resections.

      The purpose of this study is to use the Cerenkov light from FDG, Iodine-131 tracer sand/or
      other investigational tracers to image tumors and its sizes in the head, neck, breast,
      axillary and pelvic regions with a highly sensitive camera. The investigators will be trying
      to see if we can get another picture of the tumor using the Cerenkov light as part of the
      standard clinical scan or therapy.

    <description>This study seeks to optically image the Cerenkov emissions from the PET tracer 18F-FDG and the radiotherapeutic 131I in a cohort of patients with primary tumor sites and from pathologic lymph nodes after routine 18F-FDG PET 31I radiotherapy and/or investigational study scans. We will include a subset of patients with normal lymph nodes during screening. This subset of patients will be imaged as a negative control for this study.</description>

    <description>We will image (i) patients who are receiving a PET/CT scan for tumors in the head / neck region and (ii) patients with thyroid cancer after 131I radioablation. Two scans will be completed per patient, one of the primary tumors, as well as a 'background' scan of the contralateral side or, if tumor is there as well, of the forearm. The device to be used is an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA) connected to a laptop PC. The camera will use a Quartz high-UV transmission 50 mm 0.8f lens. The Imaging device will be placed approximately 5 cm from the area of the patient to be imaged.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Participant is scheduled for standard clinical and/or investigational PET/CT scan or
             131I therapy within the Nuclear Medicine Service at Main Hospital.

          -  Patients must have had pathologic lymph node metastases in the neck, axillary or
             inguinal area (do not need to be biopsy proven) from either leukemias, lymphomas: ,
             Head and Neck cancers (e.g. tonsillar, nasopharynx, tongue carcinoma, breast cancer or
             melanoma;or lymphoma or tonsillar or squamous cell carcinoma with metastases in the
             neck region for PET/CT imaging, or thyroid cancer for thyroid ablation therapy. Any
             other more infrequent cancer metastasizing with nodal metastasis in the neck, axilla
             and inguinal regions to cervical lymph nodes is eligible as well as the primary goal
             is to image pathological (i.e. hypermetabolic) lymph nodes.

          -  Patients with hypermetabolic activity and uptake in the neck,axilla, breast and
             inguinal region on scan, defined visually as significant lesion suspicious for
             malignancy by a nuclear medicine physician or trainee. (We will include a subset of
             patients with normal lymph nodes during screening. This subset of patients will be
             imaged as a negative control for this study.)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients imaged for Cerenkov luminescence are going to be required to be in a darkened
             enclosure for at least 10 minutes and sit still during image acquisition, potentially
             covered by a dark cloth in case that the ambient light level remains too high for the
             ultra-sensitive camera. Any conditions that would prevent this will exclude the
             patients.

          -  There are any other past medical, physiological or demographic concerns. This includes
             any patients with skin blemishes that are present at the dermis over the tumor, as
             these are of particular interest for use of this technique.
