  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a disease of complex etiology, multifactorial and still poorly understood.
      This disease, due to its morbidity and mortality, poses a significant public health problem
      in France. Apart from the involvement of bacterial factors and those involving the
      permeability of the epithelial barrier, it is now well recognized that several factors are
      associated with genetic predisposition in some of these patients. Among these factors, the
      Nod2 mutations were first identified. Studies concerning the presence of these mutations and
      the severity of disease results were sometimes conflicting. Very recently, new interesting
      mutations in genes involved in autophagy were found with greater frequency in patients with
      Crohn's disease. These mutations observed in Atg16 and IRGM genes. It has been particularly
      shown on large patient cohorts,the IRGM polymorphism was associated with a progressive
      disease, with histological severity scores. One of the severity criteria of Crohn's disease
      is the early recurrence observed in some patients after surgical resection of the injured
      segment. Predictive factors for such recurrence after surgery are not known or not.

    <measure>Search for IRGM mutations and compare the frequency of these mutations.</measure>
    <description>Patients who receive surgical resection for intestinal MC have, within six months after surgery gastrointestinal endoscopy for judging the endoscopic recurrence and modify treatment if necessary. This quantifies the endoscopic recurrence of i0 to i4 classified according to the Rutgeerts score (45). Patients who have a score ≥ i2 have a severe endoscopic recurrence. We will compare the prevalence of sick with a score ≥ i2 in patient groups with or without mutation in the gene IRGM. The investigators will look for the existence of a mutation in the gene IRGM, Atg16 and IL23R. The mutation in the gene IRGM being the main prognostic factor, mutations in the genes IL23R Atg16 and prognostic factors constituting secondary.</description>

    <description>The investigators will determine if the main phenotypic characteristics of CD (age of onset, time between diagnosis and surgery, use of immunosuppressive and biologic therapies, smoking localization of the disease, etc..) Are associated with increased prevalence of mutations of IGRM, Atg16 and IL23R.</description>
