    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to assist the preparation of a larger multi-center study.
      The main aim is to determine the feasibility of conducting computerized working memory
      training in a group of children with cerebral palsy.

    <time_frame>Changes in training index is measured during 5 weeks of working memory training</time_frame>
    <description>The training index is based on the user's best results from selected exercises in the program. The Start Index is calculated with the results from days 2 and 3, and the Max Index is calculated with the results from the two best days during the training period. The Index Improvement is calculated by subtracting the Start Index from the Max Index.</description>

    <description>The Cogmed Robomemo program is designed as a computer game in which an animated robot gives different tasks to be solved by the child. The tasks have various degrees of difficulty adapted continuously throughout the intervention period to the performance of the individual child. The program is standardized in that each child receives the same set of tasks during the training period. The child will perform the training sessions at home using their own computer for about 35-40 minutes each day.</description>
