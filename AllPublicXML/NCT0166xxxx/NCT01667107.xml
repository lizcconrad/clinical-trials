    <textblock>
      This single site study will examine plasma and alveolar compartment (AC) levels of
      posaconazole in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) lung transplant
      recipients receiving routine post-operative anti-fungal prophylaxis. Invasive fungal
      infection rates will be assessed following transplantation.

    <time_frame>Four hours after the first daily dose on Days 1-12 and every Monday and Thursday on Days 13-43</time_frame>
    <description>Blood samples for measurement of serum posaconazole were collected approximately 4 hours after the first daily dose on Days 1-12 and every Monday and Thursday on Days 13-43. The time to reach 90% of the steady state serum posaconazole concentration was to be estimated from fitting a linear model to the concentration data over time. The data did not permit estimation of the endpoint from the modeling proposed in the protocol.</description>

          <description>Blood samples for measurement of serum posaconazole were collected approximately 4 hours after the first daily dose on Days 1-12 and every Monday and Thursday on Days 13-43. A posaconazole concentration &gt;=0.5 mg/L is the therapeutic level, the concentration thought to lead to antifungal efficacy. The time at which the serum posaconazole concentration reached &gt;=0.5 mg/mL and remained at that level for all subsequent assessments was recorded.</description>
