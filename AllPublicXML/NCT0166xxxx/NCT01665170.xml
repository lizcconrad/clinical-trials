  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center study During Visit 1 study
      information and an informed consent form are handed out. After study inclusion on Visit 2,
      participants are assigned to one of two groups at random and receive the test products
      (either Pascoflair® or placebo tablets). The 3rd visit includes the completion of
      questionnaires regarding wellbeing and the Trier Social Stress Test.

    <measure>VAS Insecurity (During)</measure>
    <time_frame>during stress test = Visite 3</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess effects of P. incarnata on psychological stress measured by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS; Bond and Lader 1974) by comparing scores collected before, during and after stress exposure between the P. incarnata and a placebo group. In this study, psychological stress is defined as stress perception, anxiety and insecurity. These three variables are determined simultaneously in the study before, during and after the stress test. Minimum = 0 mm; Maximum = 100 mm, higher value = represent a worsend outcome.</description>

    <description>The STAI-X1 measures state anxiety (one scale). Answers are given on a four-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very true&quot;. The questionnaire is used as baseline measurement at V2. In addition, it is also employed before and immediately after the stress test at V3 to assess changes in state anxiety. Assess V2, before and after V3</description>

    <measure>POMS Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The POMS assesses the four states depression/anxiety, fatigue, vigor and hostility (4 scales). High vigor scores reflect a positive mood whereas high scores in the other subscales indicate negative mood. Subjects rate their mood state on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 7 = &quot;very strongly&quot;. The questionnaire is completed on V2 and V3.</description>

    <description>The MDBF assesses the three bipolar dimensions good/bad mood, wakefulness/tiredness and calmness/agitation (3 scales). The short form of the MDBF and its parallel version (versions A and B) each consist of 12 items. Subjects rate their mood state on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 = &quot;very true&quot;. To determine mood changes induced by the TSST, the questionnaire is completed shortly before (version A) and immediately after the TSST (version B). Assess before and after V3</description>

    <time_frame>Visite 2 (before treatment), Visite 3 (after treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The LSEQ investigates four aspects of sleep using VAS: getting to sleep, quality of sleep, awakening from sleep and behavior following awakening. The LSEQ is completed on V2 and V3.
V2 = For each female, V2 is scheduled to take place on day 6 (-8) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Upon arrival, subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are admitted to study participation and receive a random number starting from R001. V3 = After 2 days of treatment, the final appointment takes place in the afternoon. For each female, the appointment for V3 will be scheduled to take place on day 9 (-11) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Females will be asked if oral contraceptives were administered on a regular basis and if pregnancy can be excluded. The LSEQ is a VAS scale 0 - 100mm, the value below is Change in percent; higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>The primary objective is to assess effects of P. incarnata on psychological stress measured by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS; Bond and Lader 1974) by comparing scores collected before, during and after stress exposure between the P. incarnata and a placebo group. In this study, psychological stress is defined as stress perception, anxiety and insecurity. These three variables are determined simultaneously in the study before, during and after the stress test. Minimum = 0 mm; Maximum = 100 mm, higher value = represent a worsend outcome.</description>

        <title>State Anxiety (STAI-X1) Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The STAI-X1 measures state anxiety (one scale). Answers are given on a four-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 4 = &quot;very true&quot;. The questionnaire is used as baseline measurement at V2. In addition, it is also employed before and immediately after the stress test at V3 to assess changes in state anxiety. Assess V2, before and after V3</description>

        <title>POMS Questionnaire</title>
        <description>The POMS assesses the four states depression/anxiety, fatigue, vigor and hostility (4 scales). High vigor scores reflect a positive mood whereas high scores in the other subscales indicate negative mood. Subjects rate their mood state on a 7-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 7 = &quot;very strongly&quot;. The questionnaire is completed on V2 and V3.</description>

The short form of the MDBF and its parallel version (versions A and B) each consist of 12 items. Subjects rate their mood state on a 5-point rating scale ranging from 1 = &quot;not at all&quot; to 5 = &quot;very true&quot;. To determine mood changes induced by the TSST, the questionnaire is completed shortly before (version A) and immediately after the TSST (version B). Assess before and after V3</description>

        <title>LSEQ Questionnaire (Getting to Sleep-Falling Asleep Easier Than Usual) - Changes From V2 to V3</title>
        <description>The LSEQ investigates four aspects of sleep using VAS: getting to sleep, quality of sleep, awakening from sleep and behavior following awakening. The LSEQ is completed on V2 and V3.
V2 = For each female, V2 is scheduled to take place on day 6 (-8) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Upon arrival, subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are admitted to study participation and receive a random number starting from R001. V3 = After 2 days of treatment, the final appointment takes place in the afternoon. For each female, the appointment for V3 will be scheduled to take place on day 9 (-11) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Females will be asked if oral contraceptives were administered on a regular basis and if pregnancy can be excluded. The LSEQ is a VAS scale 0 - 100mm, the value below is Change in percent; higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

In this study, psychological stress is defined as stress perception, anxiety and insecurity. These three variables are determined simultaneously in the study before, during and after the stress test. Minimum = 0 mm; Maximum = 100 mm, higher value = represent a worsend outcome.</description>

          <description>The LSEQ investigates four aspects of sleep using VAS: getting to sleep, quality of sleep, awakening from sleep and behavior following awakening. The LSEQ is completed on V2 and V3. V2 = For each female, V2 is scheduled to take place on day 6 (-8) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Upon arrival, subjects meeting all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are admitted to study participation and receive a random number starting from R001. V3 = After 2 days of treatment, the final appointment takes place in the afternoon. For each female, the appointment for V3 will be scheduled to take place on day 9 (-11) after the last contraceptive intake of a menstrual cycle. Females will be asked if oral contraceptives were administered on a regular basis and if pregnancy can be excluded.
The LSEQ is a VAS scale 0 - 100mm, the value below is Change in percent; higher values represent a better outcome.</description>

        <description>Sympathovagal balance is a measure of heart rate variability and gives information about the autonomic state that is regulated by sympathetic and parasympathetic influences. The low frequency component reflects sympathic activity, whereas the high requency domain gives Information about the parasympatic activity.
