      Assessment in early changes in the parameters of optical coherence tomography (OCT spectral
      domain) in patients with subfoveal neovascularization secondary to age-related degeneration
      after treatment with a single intravitreal injection of Lucentis.

      Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) leading cause of blindness over 50 years in developed
      Western countries. Its prevalence increases with age affecting about 8.5 to 27.9% of the
      population over 75 years. Its incidence has increased 30-40% in recent decades, in spite of
      eye diseases such as cataracts and glaucoma, which reach the same population group, have
      shown apparently reduced their records.

      Although approximately 80% of patients with AMD have the neovascular form does not, the
      neovascular form is responsible for almost 90% of severe visual loss resulting from AMD. It
      creates great socioeconomic impact, becoming a public health problem.

      Quantitative analysis of OCT has shown increasing clinical importance with the development of
      anti-VEGF therapy to evaluate the outcome of the treatment of neovascular AMD.

      Relatively few studies in AMD has been proposed to examine the correlation between the
      morphological parameters of the OCT and BCVA in a systematic way.

      It is important to assess the impact that different OCT parameters have on visual acuity as
      early as 7 days after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab in patients with AMD to define
      which of these parameters correlate better with the AV and prognosis. It is also unknown
      which patients' perception of the effectiveness of treatment in early stage. For this
      evaluation, we apply the visual function questionnaire (VFQ - 25) 1 and 7 days after
      treatment.
