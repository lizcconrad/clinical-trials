    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this pre-post trial is to compare data regarding oral feeding, length of
      stay, and growth outcomes of 100 NICU infants to these same outcomes following the
      implementation of a developmentally supportive, infant driven feeding program with the NICU
      staff, specifically the Supporting Oral Feeding in Fragile Infants (SOFFI) infant feeding
      program on a second sample of 100 NICU infants at Children's Memorial Hospital.

      The specific research questions considered in this study are:

        1. What is the impact of implementing the SOFFI on the oral feeding outcomes of medically
           fragile infants in the NICU at discharge and at 3 months post-term?

        2. What is the impact of implementing the SOFFI on the growth outcomes of medically fragile
           infants in the NICU at discharge and at 3 months post-term?

        3. What is the impact of implementing the SOFFI on the length of stay of medically fragile
           infants in the NICU?

        4. What is the impact of implementing the SOFFI on the clarity and consistency of NICU
           staff evaluations and communications related to managing oral feedings with medically
           fragile infants?
