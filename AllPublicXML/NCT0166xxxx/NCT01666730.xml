      This phase II trial studies how well metformin hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium,
      fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin work in treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.
      Metformin hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil,
      and oxaliplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving metformin hydrochloride together with
      combination chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if metformin (metformin hydrochloride) when added to FOLFOX ( leucovorin
      calcium, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin) improves overall survival in patients with metastatic
      pancreatic cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess response rate (RR). II. To assess progression free survival (PFS). III. To
      assess toxicity in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer receiving FOLFOX and metformin.
      IV. To identify tumor/serum correlative markers.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7
      for an introductory period before the addition of FOLFOX. After the introductory period,
      patients will continue metformin twice daily and FOLFOX therapy comprising leucovorin calcium
      intravenously (IV) over 120 minutes, fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours, and
      oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients
      are followed up for periodically.

    <description>The overall response is the number of participants who experience a confirmed complete (CR) or partial response (PR) of the total analysis population. Per the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST): CR = all detectable tumor has disappeared, PR = a &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum, Progressive disease (PD) = a &gt;=20% increase in target lesions, Stable Disease = small changes that do not meet previously given criteria. The true response rate of the combination therapy for this patient population will be estimated based on the number of response using a binomial distribution and its confidence intervals will be estimated using Wilson's method.</description>
