    <textblock>
      Complying with requirements of the approval letter of clinical trial issued by SFDA (Approval
      Letter No.: 2006L01017), Hualan conducted phase III clinical trial of Group ACYW135
      Meningococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the
      experimental vaccine.

      The safety end points were the presence of any systemic, local and adverse reaction.
      Evaluation indicators of immunogenicity were bacteriocin levels of groups A, C, Y and W135
      respectively in the serum after the whole vaccination.
