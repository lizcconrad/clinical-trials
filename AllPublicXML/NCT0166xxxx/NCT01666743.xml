    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in
      elderly subjects with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) receiving antibiotic
      therapy in the hospital.
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study of ceftaroline fosamil in elderly subjects (≥ 65 years of age)
      with CABP. Adjunctive macrolide therapy is to be used at the Investigator's discretion. A
      switch to oral treatment may be allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. The total
      duration of therapy is 5 to 7 days; a minimum of 48 hours of study drug is required.
