      Introduction: Insoles and shoes are frequently prescribed to prevent foot ulcers in patients
      at risk of diabetes. A combination of neuropathy and foot deformities raises the risk from 1%
      to between 4-7% according to the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare, Guidelines
      Diabetes Care 2010. Preventative care, which includes foot care, annual inspection of the
      feet, education and prescription of insoles in combination with well fitting shoes are
      supposed to decrease the risk of ulcers and prevent amputation. Further research is, however,
      needed to evaluate the effectiveness of these commonly prescribed insoles. The aim of this
      study is to compare three different types of insoles with respect to pressure distribution.
      Every 6 months follow-up is assessed until 24 months is reached.

      Patients included in the study were randomized into 3 different groups. Group number 1 and 2
      got custom made insoles out of EVA (Ethyl Vinyl Acetate) with different hardness 35 and 55
      shore respectively. Group nr 3 got prefabricated insole with support of the medial arch and
      in the forefoot. The top layer was covered with a 2 mm cushioned material, 25 shore, made out
      of microcellular urethane. All patients were recommended to wear good walking shoes with a
      semi rigid outer sole and stable heel counter. One and the same technician made the casting
      and fabricated the insoles as well as delivered the devices. Deliverance occured 2-3 weeks
      after the first visit.

      At deliverance base line measurement was assessed.
