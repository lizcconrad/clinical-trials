    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of milatuzumab (IMMU-115) when added to a
      standard regimen to prevent Graft vs. Host Disease (GVHD) in patients with hematologic
      malignancies undergoing stem cell transplant.

    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed by measuring the change from baseline during 7 days of treatment and up to 30 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Safety will be measured by physical examinations and hematology and chemistry blood tests. Cardiac safety will be done using MUGA scans or echocardiograms. These assessments will be done routinely during treatment and up to 30 days after treatment and any change from baseline will be assessed. Long term safety will be assessed every 3 months after that for up to 1 year; any change from baseline will be assessed.</description>

          -  Patients requiring a myeloablative conditioning regimen

             be restricted only to peripheral stem cells.

          -  No suitable donor identified

          -  Prior anaphylactic response or Grade 4 infusion reaction to milatuzumab

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Patients with active hepatitis B infection are not eligible. Patients with a history

             because they often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the
             evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.

          -  Active secondary malignancies with the exception of non-melanomatous skin cancers or
             low risk prostate cancer under observation.
