    <textblock>
      The Washington State Community Expedited Partner Therapy Trial is a stepped-wedge community
      level randomized trial designed to test the hypothesis that a public health program designed
      to increase the use of expedited partner therapy can decrease the prevalence of chlamydial
      infection in young women and the incidence of gonorrhea in Washington state. The study
      intervention will be modeled after and intervention previously evaluated in King County WA
      (Golden MR, Sex Transm Dis 2007;598-603). The intervention has two components: 1) promotion
      of patient delivered partner therapy (PDPT) use by medical providers in accordance with
      Washington state guidelines; and 2) targeted provision of partner services. PDPT use will be
      promoted through education and by making medication packs for PDPT available statewide.
      Medical providers will refer selected persons with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection for
      partner services based on defined criteria associated with failure to ensure partners'
      treatment. The intervention will be instituted in four waves separated by 6-9 months. Each
      wave will include approximately 6 local health jurisdictions. The order in which health
      jurisdictions initiate the intervention will be randomly assigned. The study's primary
      endpoint will be the prevalence of chlamydial infection in women age 15-25 tested through
      clinics participating in the state's Infertility Prevention Project (IPP) and the incidence
      of gonorrhea among women as determined through public health reporting.

    <description>The study will include 23 WA state local health jurisdictions (LHJ). Each LHJ will be a randomized unit and a unit in which we will measure outcomes. (LHJs are governmental administrative units that usually correspond with a county.) Because this is a stepped-wedge randomized trial, the study will have two groups (intervention and control). However, each LHJ will be in both groups depending on the time period.</description>

    <description>The study will provide communities with access to free PDPT for heterosexuals with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection. PDPT will be packaged to meet the requirements of the WA State Board of Pharmacy and will include 1gram of azithromycin, information about STD, condoms, and information about enclosed medication in English and Spanish. PDPT packs for gonorrhea will also include 400mg of cefixime.</description>

    <description>During intervention periods, communities will receive public health partner services (PS) provided by Disease Intervention Specialists (DIS). Diagnosing clinicians will triage their patients to receive PS based on defined criteria associated with not ensuring partners' treatment. PS will include an offer to notify partners for each index case. When DIS notify partners they will offer them the opportunity to obtain free medication at a local pharmacy, at a clinic (as available) or through the mail. DIS will also offer to refer partners for complete evaluations insofar as such care is available in local communities.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        With reference to the above question about sampling, we will measure PDPT use in a
        probability sample of persons with STD. Chlamydial prevalence will be measured in a
        sentinel population. Gonorrhea incidence will be based on public health surveillance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All non-MSM with gonorrhea or chlamydial infection will be eligible for the study
             intervention.
