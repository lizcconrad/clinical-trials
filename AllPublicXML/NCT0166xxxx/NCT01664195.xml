  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this trial is that the test drug (Eritromax ®) pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics parameters are similar to the comparator drug (Eprex ®) in healthy subjects
      following administration of single intravenous dose. The objective of this randomized,
      crossover, clinical trial is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of
      the drug Eritromax® marketed by Blau Farmacêutica, compared to the product Eprex ®, produced
      by Janssen-Cilag, by assessing plasma concentration of the drug and the reticulocyte count
      following a single-dose intravenous administration of 100 IU/kg in healthy subjects.
