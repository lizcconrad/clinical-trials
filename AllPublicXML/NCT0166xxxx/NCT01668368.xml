  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute respiratory failure exhibiting decreased respiratory system compliance
      with hypoxemia or carbon dioxide retention are often difficult to ventilate with current
      guidelines that limit applied plateau pressure Yet, these guidelines do not take into
      consideration chest wall mechanics. The investigators sought to determine whether partition
      of the respiratory system into its components by measuring esophageal pressure and thus
      assessment of pleural pressure, would help in patients with acute respiratory failure to
      identify the factors contributing to low respiratory system compliance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identifying the dominant factor affecting respiratory system compliance by measuring
      transpulmonary pressure may better direct and optimize mechanical ventilation. Thus, instead
      of limiting mechanical ventilation by plateau pressure, PEEP and Inspiratory pressure
      adjustment would be individualized specifically for each patient's lung compliance as
      indicated by transpulmonary pressure.

      The main goal of this approach is to specifically target transpulmonary pressure instead of
      plateau pressure, and therefore achieve the best Lung compliance with the least
      transpulmonary pressure possible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  To be included in the study a prerequisite of high peak Inspiratory pressure (plateau
             pressure of up to 30 cmH2O) had to be present, and at least one of the following four
             inclusion criteria had to be met.

             1 - Low Total Respiratory system compliance (CT), defined as less than 50ml/cmH2O. 2 -
             P/F ratio of less than 300. 3 - Need for a PEEP greater than 10 cmH2O to maintain SaO2
             of &gt; 90%. 4 - PCO2 over 60 mmHg, or PH less than 7.2 that is attributed to respiratory
             acidosis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with any of the following were excluded from the study. Previous lung or
             chest wall surgery, previous esophageal surgery, known Achalasia or any other
             esophageal motility or spasm disorder, presence of chest thoracostomy tube, and any
             significant chest wall abnormality such as kyphoskoliosis.
