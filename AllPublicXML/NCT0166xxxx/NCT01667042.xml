        All consecutive adult patients seen at the Mayo Clinic in Florida with a confirmed
        diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) will be eligible.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients ≥ 18 years old.

          -  Fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for SSc.

          -  For ILD subgroup (n=6):

               -  An upright chest-roentgenogram (chest x-ray) is abnormal and compatible with an
                  interstitial lung disease.

               -  HRCT of the chest confirms the presence of bilateral reticular, ground glass,
                  and/or honeycomb abnormalities that is otherwise unexplained by an alternative
                  process

               -  The HRCT fibrosis score must be ≥ 7.

               -  The total lung capacity (TLC, measured by body plethysmography) and/or the
                  diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is below the predicted
                  normal.

               -  The forced vital capacity (FVC) is reduced below the predicted normal.

               -  The patient is symptomatic (i.e. dyspnea and/or a chronic cough) for more than 8
                  weeks that is otherwise unexplained by an alternative mechanism.

          -  For No ILD subgroup (n=6):

               -  No radiographic evidence of ILD on plain chest x-ray.

               -  The HRCT fibrosis score, when performed) must be &lt; 7

               -  The TLC and FVC are within their predicted normal.

               -  The DLCO is within the predicted normal, except when reduced in isolation by
                  pulmonary hypertension.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active smoking within the 6 months.

          -  Pneumonia or bronchitis in past 4 weeks.

          -  Active acute illness such as uncontrolled heart failure, infection, or asthma.

          -  Use of more than 3 liters per minute (LPM) of oxygen by nasal cannula at rest.

          -  Coordinator, investigator, or clinician concerns on the patient's compliance, safety,
             or in ability to complete study requirements.

          -  Morbid condition not expected to live more than 1 year.

          -  Alternative cause or diagnosis for the patient's ILD besides SSc.

          -  Pregnancy.

          -  Obstructive lung disease with an FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1 second) to FVC
             ratio less than 0.7, nor radiographic evidence of emphysema on CT.

          -  Planned therapeutic procedures involving the esophagus (e.g. dilation, surgery) prior
             to completion of study tests
