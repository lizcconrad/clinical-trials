  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a quality improvement project to review the effectiveness and barriers to
      effectiveness of a new clinical program in the emergency room to provide substance use
      screening followed by brief motivational interviewing and referral to treatment for patients
      who meet criteria for problem substance use. This study will consist of a chart review of the
      results of the screens performed by substance use counselors and correlating them to
      institutional variables such as wait time in the emergency room and length of stay as well as
      to patient variables obtained by chart review such as medical diagnosis and sociodemographic
      variables.
