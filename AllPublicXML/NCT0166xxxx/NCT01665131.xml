  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) are devices that are put into patients at high risk
      of sudden cardiac death. They are used to treat life threatening heart rhythm disorders. They
      have conventionally consisted of a generator sitting under the skin of the chest and leads
      which pass from veins in the collar bone region to the heart. Problems with these devices can
      necessitate extraction, with the commonest reason being infection. If extraction is required
      for infection then re-implantation is usually deferred for approximately one week whilst
      antibiotics are given so that the risk of infection of the new device can be minimised. This
      has considerable implications for healthcare resources. A new ICD has been developed that is
      entirely subcutaneous with no intravenous element. It is already in clinical use and is
      positioned remote from conventional ICD sites. With no intravenous element there is very
      little risk of infection in the blood affecting the new device. It is therefore likely to be
      possible to re-implant these devices immediately after extracting a conventional system. The
      aim of this research is to assess the outcome in patients re-implanted with this device
      immediately after conventional ICD system extraction. This data will be compared compared to
      those who have conventional systems re-implanted after the necessary delay.
