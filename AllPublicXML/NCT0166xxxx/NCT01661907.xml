    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is a common complication in critically ill patients after surgery. Its
      occurrence is associated with worse outcomes of the patients. The pathophysiology of delirium
      remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that delirium was frequently identified
      in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but was rarely noted after minor
      ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). This indicated that stress response produced
      by surgery might have an important role in the pathogenesis of delirium. It has been reported
      that, when compared with general anesthesia and postoperative intravenous analgesia,
      neuraxial anesthesia and analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications and
      mortality in high risk patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is frequently used in
      clinical practice. This anesthesia method provides advantages of both epidural and general
      anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus by neuraxial blockade
      during and after surgery, and allows patients to endure lengthy complicated operations
      without any awareness. The investigators hypothesize that combined epidural-general
      anesthesia and postoperative epidural analgesia can decrease the incidence of postoperative
      delirium and, thus, improve the prognosis of critically ill elderly patients undergoing major
      surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of combined epidural-general
      anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia and general anesthesia/postoperative intravenous
      analgesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing major
      surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium is a transient mental syndrome of acute onset characterized by global impairment of
      cognitive functions, reduced level of consciousness, abnormalities of attention, increased or
      decreased psychomotor activity, and disordered sleep-wake cycle. Postoperative delirium is a
      common complication in critically ill patients after surgery. Dyer et al reviewed 80 primary
      studies and found that the mean incidence of postoperative delirium is about 36.8% (range
      0%-73.5%) after surgery. It occurred in up to 80% of patients in the ICU. Our recent studies
      found that the incidence of postoperative delirium occurring in patients at the SICU was
      51.0% after cardiac surgery and 44.5% after non-cardiac surgery.

      The occurrence of postoperative delirium is associated with worse outcomes of the patients.
      Studies showed that delirious patients had prolonged ICU stay, increased incidence of
      complications, prolonged hospitalization, high mortality rate, and increased health care
      costs. Delirium is also associated with increased risk of long-term cognitive decline and
      poor quality of life. A recent follow-up study (mean follow-up time 27.9 Â± 3.1 months) by our
      research group found that, after adjusting factors such as age, occurrence of postoperative
      complications, and stage of malignant tumors, etc, the occurrence of postoperative delirium
      still remained an independent predictor of long-term mortality in patients.

      The pathophysiology of delirium remains poorly understood. A universal phenomenon is that
      delirium was frequently identified in elderly patients after major complicated surgery, but
      was rarely noted after minor ambulatory surgery (such as cataract surgery). Studies also
      found that postoperative pain was an independent risk factor of delirium, and effective pain
      relief may help to reduce the incidence of delirium. Our recent studies of patients
      undergoing cardiac or non-cardiac surgeries both showed that high serum cortisol level was an
      independent predictor of postoperative delirium. In addition, inflammatory response may also
      contribute to the pathogenesis of delirium. Trauma, pain, cortisol secretion and inflammation
      are all important components of surgical stress response. The above results indicated that
      stress response produced by surgery might have an important role in the pathogenesis of
      delirium.

      Previous studies demonstrated that, when compared with general anesthesia, neuraxial
      anesthesia attenuated the hypersecretion of cortisol, and decreased the intensity of
      inflammatory response more effectively after surgery. And epidural analgesia provided better
      postoperative pain relief than intravenous analgesia. It was also reported that, when
      compared with general anesthesia and intravenous analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia and
      analgesia reduced the occurrence of postoperative complications and mortality in high risk
      patients. Combined epidural-general anesthesia is frequently used in clinical practice, and
      is performed in about 1/4 of patients undergoing surgery in the applicant's hospital.
      Theoretically, this anesthesia method provides advantages of both epidural and general
      anesthesia, i.e. it blocks the afferent pathway of nociceptive stimulus by neuraxial blockade
      during and after surgery, and allow patients to endure lengthy complicated operations without
      any awareness. However, there is no evidence whether combined epidural-general
      anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia can decrease the incidence of postoperative
      delirium and, thus, improve the outcomes of elderly patients undergoing major surgery.

      The objective of the study is to compare the effects of combined epidural-general
      anesthesia/postoperative epidural analgesia and general anesthesia/postoperative intravenous
      analgesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing major
      surgery.

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (experimental group) will receive combined epidural-general anesthesia (combined Epi-GA) and patient controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA).
An epidural catheter will be placed before anesthesia induction. General anesthesia will be induced and maintained in the same manner as in the control group, with the addition of a continuous infusion or intermittent boluses of 0.5%-0.75% ropivacaine given through the epidural catheter for analgesia maintenance. Patient controlled epidural analgesia will be used for postoperative analgesia (0.12% ropivacaine and 0.5 Î¼g/mL sufentanil in 250 mL normal saline, programmed to deliver a 2-mL bolus with a lockout interval of 20 minutes and a background infusion of 4 mL/hr).</description>

    <description>Patients assigned to this group (control group) will receive general anesthesia (GA) and patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA).
General anesthesia will be induced with midazolam, sufentanil, propofol and rocuronium. Anesthesia will then be maintained by inhalation of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture (1:1-2) and sevoflurane, and/or continuous intravenous infusing of propofol. Sufentanil and rocuronium will be given when needed. If necessary, other types of opioids and muscle relaxants are also allowed. Patient controlled intravenous analgesia will be used for postoperative analgesia (50 mg morphine in 100 mL normal saline, programmed to deliver a 2-mL bolus with a 6-10 minutes lockout interval and a 1 mL/hr background infusion).</description>
