      Select 600 cases of women with breast cancer of triple negative or Her-2 positive or with
      more than 4 axillary lymph node metastasis. All the patients were accepted the chemotherapy
      of Anthracycline and/or Taxane. Divide them into two groups randomly. Then the experimental
      group will be treated with Xeloda(1000mg/m2,orally,2 times/day) for six cycles (21
      days/cycle,each taking two weeks suspending for one week) as Sequential Adjuvant Therapy. And
      the control group will not receive any adjuvant therapy.Finally the investigators will assess
      the 5-year disease-free survival, 5 years and 10-year overall survival and safety of using
      medications.
