  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiolitis is a common cold weather seasonal respiratory illness affecting infants and
      children. Multiple supportive therapies have been tried in infants with bronchiolitis
      including albuterol, racemic epinephrine, hypertonic saline nebulization, but to date
      supportive therapy with oxygen is the only proven therapy to decrease respiratory distress in
      infants with bronchiolitis, with hypertonic saline showing a borderline statistically
      significant improvement. This prospective, randomized study will compare CSS and PEWS scores
      on infants who receive oxygen by standard flow nasal cannula and to those who receive oxygen
      via Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC). The results will help determine if infants
      with viral bronchiolitis who receive humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy have
      improved Clinical Severity Score (CSS) and Pediatric Early Warning System (PEWS) scores and
      ultimately decreased lengths of admissions when compared to patients treated with nasal
      cannula oxygen therapy with/without bronchodilator therapy.

      Hypothesis Heated Humidified High-flow Nasal Cannula Delivery of Oxygen decreases respiratory
      distress as measured by pediatric CSS and PEWS when compared with routine nasal cannula
      oxygen delivery in infants with bronchiolitis.
