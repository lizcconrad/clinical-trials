    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Breast cancer is becoming more common in Africa. A higher number of cases appear in women
      under age 35 than in the developed world. However, little is known about the factors that may
      contribute to breast cancer in Africa. Researchers want to collect information from female
      patients in teaching hospitals in Accra and Kumasi, Ghana and to compare this information
      with that obtained from healthy women in the general population. These two hospitals treat
      most breast cancers in Ghana. The data will provide information regarding factors that
      predispose to the development of breast cancer among women in Ghana.

      Objectives:

      - To identify and study breast cancer risk factors in women in Ghana.

      Eligibility:

        -  Women between 18 and 74 years of age who are diagnosed with breast cancer.

        -  Participants will come from teaching hospitals in Accra and Kumasi, Ghana. Women without
           breast cancer will be identified from the 2010 Ghanaian Census for comparison purposes

      Design:

        -  Participants will answer questions about their health and lifestyle.

        -  Height, weight, and waist/hip measurements will be collected.

        -  Blood and saliva samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will be given a collection kit to collect a stool sample.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Breast cancer is becoming a more common disease in Africa, with a high proportion of cases
      developing among women under age 50. Despite this, there is scant information on predisposing
      factors in African populations. We are proposing a multidisciplinary case-control study at
      three hospitals in Accra and Kumasi that treat the majority of breast cancers in Ghana. We
      have begun this investigation as a pilot endeavor and are seeking approval for continuation
      into a full-scale effort, which over the two years following the pilot will result in a total
      of approximately 2,000 interviewed cases and 2,000 population controls. Tumor tissue samples
      are being sought from cases in order to classify them into subtypes (including triple
      negative tumors, which predominate among young African women). A detailed questionnaire is
      being administered in hospital and anthropometry measurements are being taken. Additionally,
      subjects are being asked to donate blood, saliva, and stool samples for assessment of genetic
      and other biologic markers. Similar materials are being collected from population controls.
      In addition to providing unique data relevant for improving prevention activities, this study
      will build capacity for additional research activities in Ghana.

        The source of breast cancer cases included the two largest teaching/cancer treatment
        hospitals in the country, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra and Komfo Anoyke Teaching
        Hospital in Kumasi, as well as Peace and Love Hospital, a private hospital in Kumasi that
        specializes in breast cancer care and diagnoses and treats a large number of breast cancer
        patients. Eligibility criteria for study cases included being recommended for a biopsy
        given lesions suspicious of malignancy or presenting at a @@@study hospital for treatment
        of pathologically documented breast cancers diagnosed within the preceding year.Controls
        were selected from women in the catchment area of the hospitals using data from the 2010
        Census, matched on age and geographical area to the the cases.@@@@@@

        -  ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        Eligible for inclusion as cases in this study will be women 18-74 years of age who have
        been residents of defined catchment areas surrounding the two cities for at least one year
        s time and who are either diagnosed at the study hospitals within the past year (KBTH,
        KATH, and PLH) or referred there for clinical care. The catchment area in Accra will
        consist of 10 districts in Greater Accra (Accra Metropolitan, Adenta, Tema, Ashaiman, Ga
        East, Ga West, Ledzokuku-Krowor, Weija (Ga South), Dangbe East, Dangbe West), two in the
        Eastern region (Suhum Kraboa Coaltar, Akwapim South) and one in the Central region (Awutu
        Senya). In Kumasi, the catchment area will consist of 7 districts surrounding KATH and PLH
        (Atwima Kwanwoma, Atwima Nwabiagya, Bosumtwi, Ejisu Juaben, Afigya Kwabre, Kwabre, and
        Kumasi Metropolitan).
