      In the present study the aim was to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and to evaluate
      the effectiveness of an exercise program and vitamin D supplementation in enhancing muscle
      mass and strength in community-dwelling older adults with osteopenia /osteoporosis.

      One hundred and forty-five individuals aged 65 years and above with documented
      osteopenia/osteoporosis were scanned for sarcopenia. The participants were randomly assigned
      to one of four groups: Group 1-PA and vitamin D (n= 38), Group 2-PA(n=36), Group 3-vitamin D
      (n= 36) or Group 4-healthy lifestyle(n =35) for 16 weeks. The PA group received a 60-minute
      3-day/week exercise programme, the vitamin D group received oral cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day
      and the control group was provided with health education using videotaped presentations,
      physician talks on topics concerning bone and muscle health. Body composition was measured
      DEXA. Vitamin D levels were measured and PA was measured using the Baecke Physical Activity
      Questionnaire. Physical performance was assessed using upper limb grip strength, walking
      speed and knee extension strength. All data was collected at baseline and at 4 months.

      Ageing is associated with changes in body composition and due to the ageing of the
      populations and the lessened physical activity (PA), sarcopenia and osteopenia /osteoporosis
      are emerging as major health concerns. Lack of PA is a significant risk factor for
      sarcopenia. Vitamin D plays an important role on bone and muscle development.

      This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of PA and vitamin D supplementation in enhancing muscle mass and strength in
      community-dwelling older adults with osteopenia /osteoporosis.\ One hundred and forty-five
      individuals aged 65 years and above with documented osteopenia/osteoporosis were scanned for
      sarcopenia (defined as a relative skeletal muscle index (appendicular skeletal muscle mass
      divided by height) below 5.45 kg/m2). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four
      groups: Group 1-PA and vitamin D (n= 38), Group 2-PA(n=36), Group 3-vitamin D (n= 36) or
      Group 4-healthy lifestyle(n =35) for 16 weeks. The PA group received a 60-minute 3-day/week
      exercise programme, the vitamin D group received oral cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day and the
      control group was provided with health education using videotaped presentations, physician
      talks on topics concerning bone and muscle health. Body composition was measured by dual
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Vitamin D levels were measured by Liaison immunoassay. PA
      was measured using the Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire. Physical performance was
      assessed using upper limb grip strength, walking speed and knee extension strength. All data
      was collected at baseline and at 4 months.
