    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting research about oral health and saliva to find out more about
      the impact of radiation therapy on the oral health of patients.

      In order to better understand the role of saliva in maintaining oral health in these
      patients, the investigators will be collecting, storing, and analyzing the quality of saliva,
      including the protein content, collected from patients following radiation therapy as well as
      saliva collected from normal healthy adults.

      Radiation-induced xerostomia is the most common long term complication of head and neck
      radiation, is usually permanent and is the most frequent reason for reduced quality of life
      in these patients. The loss of antimicrobial, buffering, cleansing and remineralizing effects
      of saliva markedly increases the risk for dental caries. Extractions of diseased teeth
      located in irradiated bone and dental infection involving the bone can trigger
      osteoradionecrosis (ORN), another serious complication of high dose radiation of the jaws.
      Therefore, current dental treatment guidelines recommend the extraction of diseased teeth and
      any teeth that might require extraction in the future, before radiation therapy. (NCI, 1990;
      Rankin et al, 2003; NIDCR, 2005) As a result, patients with head and neck cancer often have
      many or all teeth extracted, especially those patients who are judged unlikely to comply with
      lifelong, daily topical fluoride, oral hygiene practices and frequent professional dental
      care. (Bruins et al, 1999)

    <description>number of caries in individual subjects will depend on number of teeth and/or surfaces at risk, we will need to report &quot;prevalence&quot; after adjusting for the total surfaces at risk for each patient. In addition, because data in the cross-sectional cohort will be obtained from patients at different follow-up times since RT, the relationship between prevalence and time since RT will need to be explored to take into account the time effect.</description>

    <description>Small plastic cups will be placed on the inside of subject cheeks, and held in place with gentle suction. These cups are attached to tubes which will allow the collection of saliva into a test tube. Saliva will also be collected from the glands underneath the tongue using a small gentle suction device, similar to the one used by a dentist. Saliva production will be stimulated by dabbing a mild citric acid solution that tastes like lemon onto the tongue using a Q-Tip. After this test, subjects will also be asked to chew wax to simulate saliva, and the saliva that accumulates in their mouth will be collected by spitting into a test tube.</description>
