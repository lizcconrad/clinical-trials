  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The thermal stimulation have been proven effective in upper extremity of stroke patients.
      Therefore, this study explored the efficacy of thermal stimulation in lower extremity of
      stroke patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are two groups of stroke patients (onset &gt; 3 months) in this study. The independent
      factor is temperature of the alternated heat and cold applying.
