    <measure>Incremental Recovery Following a Single Intravenous Dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP or Previous FIX Product</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Incremental recovery (IU/dL/IU/kg) is defined as the FIX activity (IU/dL) obtained 30 minutes following infusion, per dose of (IU/kg) infusion. FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method. Recovery values were baseline-corrected for pre-infusion plasma FIX activity. Incremental recovery was measured following a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP on Day 1. Analysis of previous FIX product was conducted at the beginning of the study in a subset of subjects who had no historical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of their previous FIX product. For the PK assessment, the previous FIX product was administered by IV infusion after approximately 4 days following the last FIX treatment, prior to any dosing of rIX-FP. The formal PK population consisted of subjects who received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP for PK assessment and for whom a sufficient number of analyzable PK samples had been obtained to permit the evaluation of the PK profile of rIX-FP.</description>

        <title>Incremental Recovery Following a Single Intravenous Dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP or Previous FIX Product</title>
        <description>Incremental recovery (IU/dL/IU/kg) is defined as the FIX activity (IU/dL) obtained 30 minutes following infusion, per dose of (IU/kg) infusion. FIX activity was measured at a central laboratory using validated one-stage clotting method. Recovery values were baseline-corrected for pre-infusion plasma FIX activity. Incremental recovery was measured following a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rIX-FP on Day 1. Analysis of previous FIX product was conducted at the beginning of the study in a subset of subjects who had no historical pharmacokinetic (PK) data of their previous FIX product. For the PK assessment, the previous FIX product was administered by IV infusion after approximately 4 days following the last FIX treatment, prior to any dosing of rIX-FP. The formal PK population consisted of subjects who received at least 1 dose of rIX-FP for PK assessment and for whom a sufficient number of analyzable PK samples had been obtained to permit the evaluation of the PK profile of rIX-FP.</description>
