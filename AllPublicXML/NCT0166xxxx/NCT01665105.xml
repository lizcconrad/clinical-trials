    <textblock>
      The purpose of this present study was to investigate the effect of electroacupuncture at both
      Zusanli and at both Yanglingquan acupoints on autonomic nerve modulating cardiovascular
      activity, and skin blood flow and skin temperature. The investigators use pulse rate
      variability to investigate autonomic nerve modulates cardiovascular function, and using
      distant skin blood flow and skin temperature recordings to investigate the relationship
      between the same names meridian of hand and foot.

      A total of 24 adult healthy volunteer were studied, they received the three sessions of sham
      electroacupuncture, electroacupuncture at Zusanli and electroacupuncture at Yanglingquan,
      respectively. Each session was divided into three periods of before electroacupuncture,
      electroacupuncture, and post electroacupuncture. Each period was 20 min in duration. The
      ahead 15 min of the period was the skin blood flow and skin temperature recordings at Hoku's
      and Zhongzhu's region of right hand; the final 5 min of the period was pulse rate variability
      recordings of left hand. The data was storage and analysis in a personal computer.
