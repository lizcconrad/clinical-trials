  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) can detect early
      stage pre-cancerous or cancerous changes in the pancreas in patients at high-risk for the
      development of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic refers to the use of an instrument called an
      endoscope - a thin, flexible tube with a tiny video camera and light on the end. Ultrasound
      refers to an imaging technique that uses sound waves to produce pictures. EUS in this
      research study is a method of combining endoscopy and ultrasound imaging to obtain high
      quality images of the pancreas.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be eligible if they have 2 or more relatives with pancreatic cancer and
             have a first degree relationship with at least one of the relatives with pancreatic
             cancer

               -  If only 2 family members are affected then both must have had pancreatic cancer
                  and a first-degree relationship with individual screened

               -  If there are more than 2 affected individuals on the same side of the family at
                  least one of the individuals must have a first-degree relationship with the
                  member being screened

               -  Patients at least 40 years old or 10 years younger than the youngest affected
                  individual

          -  Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) patients age&gt;30

          -  Hereditary pancreatitis patients

          -  Patients with Familial Atypical Multiple Mole Melanoma Syndrome (FAMMM)

          -  Patients with BRCA2 mutation and at least one first or second degree relative with
             documented pancreatic cancer

          -  Willingness to undergo (EUS) with possible Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA)

          -  Willingness to undergo surgical evaluation for abnormal EUS/FNA finding

          -  Willingness to undergo radiographic evaluation if screening findings are abnormal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Medical contraindications to undergoing endoscopy or obstruction of the GI tract that
             precludes passage of the endoscope

          -  Personal history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma

          -  Previous partial or complete resection of the pancreas for adenocarcinoma

          -  Prior partial or total gastrectomy with Billroth II or Roux-en-Y anastamosis

          -  Previous computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance
             cholangiopancreatography (MRI/MRCP) or EUS of the abdomen in the past 3 years

          -  Coexisting cancer in other organs or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human
             immunodeficiency virus (AIDS/HIV)

          -  Life expectancy less than 5 years
