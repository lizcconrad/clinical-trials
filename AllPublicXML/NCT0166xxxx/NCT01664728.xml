      The purpose of this study is to provide access to abiraterone acetate for patients who have
      completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study COU-AA-001 and
      continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment.

      This is an open-label (identity of study drug will be known) extended access study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of continued administration of abiraterone acetate in
      patients who have completed 12 cycles of abiraterone acetate treatment in Clinical Study
      COU-AA-001 and continue to receive clinical benefit from this treatment. Patients will
      continue with the same dose regimen administered at the end of Study COU-AA-001 and will
      receive a low-dose glucocorticoid daily. Patients will be followed every 3 months for disease
      progression and survival for up to 3 years following study entry. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study up to 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
