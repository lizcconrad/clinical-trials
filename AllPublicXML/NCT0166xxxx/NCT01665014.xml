      The purpose of this study is to evaluate if the use total marrow irradiation (TMI) as a sole
      preparation for the first autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT)
      followed by high-dose melphalan used prior to second autoHSCT is safe and effective in
      patients with multiple myeloma (MM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AutoHSCT is a standard treatment of patients with MM. According to soem clinical evidence
      double autoHSCT provides survival advantage compared to a single procedure. Most frequently
      used conditioning regimen consists pf high doses of melphalan (HD-MEL). In some studies it
      was used in combination with total body irradiation (TBI), which, however was associated with
      significant toxicity. In our center the standard procedure includes TBI as a single treatment
      at 1st autoHSCT and HD-Mel at 2nd autoHSCT.

      As in MM malignant plasma cells are localized almost exclusively in bone marrow there is
      rationale to limit irradiation to bones. For this purpose in the current study we substitute
      TBI with TMI. Additional boosts are provided for active sites of disease based on PET/CT
      imaging. Our intention is to minimize toxicity while maintaining the treatment efficacy.
