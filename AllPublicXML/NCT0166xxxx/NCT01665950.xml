      Primary Aim: To estimate the antidepressant efficacy of simvastatin versus placebo as an
      adjunct to lithium, valproate, and/or other atypical antipsychotic therapy among individuals
      with bipolar I disorder in a nonpsychotic major depressive episode.

      Hypothesis: Simvastatin will be superior to placebo in improvement of depressive symptoms
      assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).

    <description>The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: n=30 subjects are randomized 1:1 to simvastatin versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the simvastatin treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive simvastatin in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed. Dosage for simvastatin or matched placebo 20mg daily for 8 weeks.</description>

Simvastatin: The study uses the Sequential Parallel Comparison design (SPCD), with two 4-week phases: Subjects are randomized 1:1 to simvastatin versus placebo add-on for 4 weeks, with the nonresponders re-randomized 1:1 for a further 4 weeks. The SPCD will allow us to pool data from both phases to estimate the simvastatin treatment effect. Subjects who respond in phase 1, and all subjects who receive simvastatin in phase 1, continue blinded treatment in phase 2 to preserve the blind, but only phase 1 results are analyzed.
