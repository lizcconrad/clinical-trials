  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing allogeneic myeloablative (MA) HCT with
      a T cell depleted graft, the infusion of naturally occurring regulatory T cells with
      conventional T cells (T cell addback) in pre-defined doses and ratios will reduce the
      incidence of acute graft vs host disease while augmenting the graft vs leukemia effect and
      improving immune reconstitution.

    <description>For the Phase I arm of the study the addition of planned numbers and ratios of Treg compared to Tcon will occur at defined time points after hematopoietic cell infusion. Each cohort will have 3 patients per group. The initial doses and ratios utilized will be 1 x 10^6/kg of T reg cells to 3x10^6/kg of Tcon cells at a 1:3 ratio. In order to progress to the next dose level, there must be no evidence of grade 3 or 4 acute GVHD.</description>
