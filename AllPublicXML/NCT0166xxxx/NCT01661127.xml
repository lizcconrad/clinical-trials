  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is associated with increases in markers of inflammation in the skin and blood and
      increasingly is thought to be a systemic inflammatory disease and risk factor for incident
      diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, stroke, and premature cardiovascular death.
      Furthermore, it is important for clinicians to be aware that psoriasis can have a substantial
      emotional impact on an individual, which is not necessarily related to the extent of skin
      disease.

      FDG-PET/CT represents an innovative approach to studying systemic inflammation in a manner
      that is sensitive, quantifiable, and anatomically localizable. Also, recent study show that
      chronic disease such as end stage renal disease with depressive symptoms have decreased
      cerebral glucose metabolism in several brain areas in F-18-FDG PET/CT. So this protocol was
      designed to evaluate usefulness of PET/CT to detect systemic inflammation and abnormality of
      cerebral glucose metabolism and association with metabolic syndrome/major depressive symptoms
      in patients with psoriasis.
