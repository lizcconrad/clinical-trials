  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, two similar medications are available for injection into the eye to treat a
      variety of eye diseases. These medications are called ranibizumab (Lucentis) and bevacizumab
      (Avastin). They both have a similar mechanism of action and work equally well, however only
      ranibizumab was designed for use in the eye. It is significantly more expensive per injection
      than bevacizumab (by a factor of roughly 40x).

      In published studies trends have been noted towards an increased rate of systemic side
      effects such as heart attacks and strokes. This is presumably due to absorption of the
      drug(s) from the eye into the bloodstream, however this has never been shown before. The
      purpose of the investigators study was to compare the bloodstream levels of bevacizumab and
      ranibizumab at various time points after injection into the eye. This required the creation
      of a sophisticated assay to measure blood levels of the drugs.

    <description>The serum concentrations of anti-VEGF antibody (bevacizumab or ranibizumab) will be measured pre-injection as well as at various time points after injection (1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month). These time points are selected based on previously completed animal studies. The Cmax will be compared between bevacizumab and ranibizumab.</description>
