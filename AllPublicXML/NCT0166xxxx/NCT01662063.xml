    <measure>Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS28) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 was calculated using the Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Tender Joint Count (TJC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the participant according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score. For the DAS28 formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-millimeter (mm) scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 multiplied by [×] square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × log natural [ln] ESR) + (0.014 × VAS). Scores may range from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84</time_frame>
    <description>The CDAI was calculated using the SJC, TJC, and Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the patient and by the physician according to separate VAS scores. For the CDAI formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The CDAI was calculated as the sum of the component scores, that is, SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician). Scores may range from 0 to 76, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI was calculated using the SJC, TJC, Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the patient and by the physician according to separate VAS scores, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level. For the SDAI formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The SDAI was calculated as the sum of the component scores, that is, SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP. Because the formula includes hsCRP, scores may theoretically range from 0 to infinity, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL), scores would be expected to fall within less than or equal to (≤) 77 points.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84</time_frame>
    <description>Remission was defined as DAS28 &lt;2.6, SDAI ≤3.3, or meeting all Boolean criteria (28-count SJC and TJC ≤1, VAS ≤10 mm, and hsCRP ≤1 mg/dL). For DAS28 and SDAI formulas, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 × square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × ln ESR) + (0.014 × VAS), with potential scores from 0 to 10. The SDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP, with potential scores from 0 to infinity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. For these instruments, higher scores indicate increased disease activity. The number of participants who met criteria for remission was reported at each visit.</description>

          <description>Compliance was assessed using drug dispensing logs, diary cards kept by the participant, and return records, as reviewed by the Investigator at regular visits. Total compliance up to the end of treatment was defined as the percentage of participants who correctly administered all scheduled doses of SC TCZ. Correct administration was defined as proper injection technique, injection of the correct amount (162 mg), device not left at room temperature for greater than (&gt;) 8 hours, and absence of other medication errors.</description>

        <title>Disease Activity Score Based on 28 Joints (DAS28) Score</title>
        <description>The DAS28 was calculated using the Swollen Joint Count (SJC), Tender Joint Count (TJC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the participant according to Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score. For the DAS28 formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-millimeter (mm) scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 multiplied by [×] square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × log natural [ln] ESR) + (0.014 × VAS). Scores may range from 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity.</description>

        <title>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score</title>
        <description>The CDAI was calculated using the SJC, TJC, and Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the patient and by the physician according to separate VAS scores. For the CDAI formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score.

        <title>Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Score</title>
        <description>The SDAI was calculated using the SJC, TJC, Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the patient and by the physician according to separate VAS scores, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level. For the SDAI formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The SDAI was calculated as the sum of the component scores, that is, SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP. Because the formula includes hsCRP, scores may theoretically range from 0 to infinity, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL), scores would be expected to fall within less than or equal to (≤) 77 points.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in SDAI Score</title>
        <description>The SDAI was calculated using the SJC, TJC, Global Assessment of Disease Activity by the patient and by the physician according to separate VAS scores, and hsCRP level. For the SDAI formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The SDAI was calculated as the sum of the component scores, that is, SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP. Because the formula includes hsCRP, scores may theoretically range from 0 to infinity, where higher scores indicate increased disease activity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. The change from Baseline to each visit was calculated, where positive changes represent an increase or worsening in disease activity.</description>

          <description>The Global Assessment of Pain was performed using a 100-mm horizontal VAS. Scores may range from 0 mm (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 100 mm (&quot;unbearable pain&quot;), with higher scores representing an increase in pain. The change from Baseline to each visit was calculated, where positive changes represent an increase or worsening in pain.</description>

        <description>The Stanford HAQ-DI was calculated as the average of 20 questions, each scored from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). The questionnaire included 8 component sets: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities. Overall scores may range from 0 to 3, with higher scores representing increased disability. The percentage of participants achieving a score &lt;0.5 was calculated at each visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Low Disease Activity According to DAS28, SDAI, and CDAI Criteria</title>
        <description>Low disease activity was defined as DAS28 ≤3.2, SDAI ≤11, or CDAI ≤10. For each formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 × square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × ln ESR) + (0.014 × VAS), with potential scores from 0 to 10. The SDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP, with potential scores from 0 to infinity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. The CDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician), with potential scores from 0 to 76. For all instruments, higher scores indicate increased disease activity. The number of participants who met criteria for low disease activity was reported at each visit.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Low Disease Activity According to DAS28, SDAI, and CDAI Criteria</title>
        <description>Low disease activity was defined as DAS28 ≤3.2, SDAI ≤11, or CDAI ≤10. For each formula, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 × square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × ln ESR) + (0.014 × VAS), with potential scores from 0 to 10. The SDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP, with potential scores from 0 to infinity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. The CDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician), with potential scores from 0 to 76. For all instruments, higher scores indicate increased disease activity. The percentage of participants who met criteria for low disease activity was calculated at each visit.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Remission According to DAS28, SDAI, and Boolean Criteria</title>
        <description>Remission was defined as DAS28 &lt;2.6, SDAI ≤3.3, or meeting all Boolean criteria (28-count SJC and TJC ≤1, VAS ≤10 mm, and hsCRP ≤1 mg/dL). For DAS28 and SDAI formulas, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 × square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × ln ESR) + (0.014 × VAS), with potential scores from 0 to 10. The SDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP, with potential scores from 0 to infinity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. For these instruments, higher scores indicate increased disease activity. The number of participants who met criteria for remission was reported at each visit.</description>

        <description>Remission was defined as DAS28 &lt;2.6, SDAI ≤3.3, or meeting all Boolean criteria (28-count SJC and TJC ≤1, VAS ≤10 mm, and hsCRP ≤1 mg/dL). For DAS28 and SDAI formulas, the SJC and TJC values were based upon 28 joints, and VAS was transformed from a 100-mm scale to a 10-point score. The DAS28 was calculated as (0.56 × square root of TJC) + (0.28 × square root of SJC) + (0.7 × ln ESR) + (0.014 × VAS), with potential scores from 0 to 10. The SDAI was calculated as SJC + TJC + VAS (participant) + VAS (physician) + hsCRP, with potential scores from 0 to infinity. However, based upon normal hsCRP level within 1 mg/dL, scores would be expected to fall within ≤77 points. For these instruments, higher scores indicate increased disease activity. The percentage of participants who met criteria for remission was calculated at each visit.</description>
