  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Tennis elbow&quot; is the most common cause of lateral elbow pain, generally caused by either
      work or sports related repetitive strain. In this condition, a tendon along the outside of
      the elbow becomes inflamed leading to pain, especially with flexing and extending the elbow.

      Many treatments have been attempted, including physiotherapy and steroids, with little
      success. One treatment which has been very effective is the injection of the patients own
      blood (taken from their other non-affected arm) into their abnormal tendon. The blood
      recruits the patients own healing factors and heals the damaged tendon. As platelets are
      thought to be largely responsible, injection of concentrated platelets, extracted from the
      patient's blood (platelet rich plasma) is a newer, but expensive, technique.

      At this point, it is unclear whether whole blood, concentrated platelets, or simply passing a
      ultrasound-guided needle through the abnormal tendon as a means to stimulate tissue healing
      (tendon fenestration) is the better treatment.

      The objective of this trial is to compare platelet rich plasma, whole blood, dry needle
      tendon fenestration, and sham injection (with physical therapy) to identify the best and most
      cost-effective therapy for this debilitating condition.

    <description>The subcutaneous soft tissues of the lateral elbow will be infiltrated with 1% lidocaine for local anesthetic.
A 22-gauge needle will then be placed into the tendon followed by 15-25 gentle strokes of dry needling in which the needle pierces the tendon at multiple sites.
For the PRP preparation, the Arthrex ACP system will be used. This is a closed, double syringe system which uses 16 mL of whole blood drawn from the patient's contralateral arm, using a 19G butterfly needle. The blood is centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 minutes and extracts 4-7 ml of PRP. No anticoagulant will be used.
Fenestration of the tendon will continue as 3mL of PRP is injected into the common extensor tendon.
The remaining PRP will be sent for analysis of platelet, WBC, and RBC concentrations.</description>
