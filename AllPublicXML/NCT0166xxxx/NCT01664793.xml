  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase childhood influenza vaccination rates using the FDA
      licensed influenza vaccines according to national guidelines in a randomized cluster trial in
      which primary care offices are randomized to intervention or control with the control group
      receiving the intervention in the second year.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a stratified, randomized cluster trial of 20 diverse primary
      care practices to compare influenza vaccination rates in intervention and control sites.
      Intervention sites will use a package of newly developed and evidence-based techniques that
      will be tailored to their practice structure and culture, called the 4 Pillars Immunization
      Toolkit, in addition to receiving donated vaccine for early season vaccination. Control
      practices will not receive such assistance but will receive the intervention in the second
      year.

    <description>Two staff members from each site were surveyed as to usefulness/effectiveness of a list of strategies recommended in the toolkit to increase vaccination rates. Values (range = 1-100 with 1 being not at all effective and 100 being highly effective) were averaged and used as an effectiveness score for each strategy. The average value for each site was combined with all sites and averaged for each strategy. (actual range = 20.6-90.7).</description>

          <description>Two staff members from each site were surveyed as to usefulness/effectiveness of a list of strategies recommended in the toolkit to increase vaccination rates. Values (range = 1-100 with 1 being not at all effective and 100 being highly effective) were averaged and used as an effectiveness score for each strategy. The average value for each site was combined with all sites and averaged for each strategy. (actual range = 20.6-90.7).</description>
