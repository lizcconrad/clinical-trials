  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine is considered one of the standard drugs for advanced pancreatic cancer and is
      approved by the FDA to treat it. Cabozantinib is a new drug that has demonstrated
      effectiveness against pancreatic cancer in laboratory experiments, especially when given with
      gemcitabine. Initial studies with cabozantinib in pancreatic cancer have shown some activity
      against the disease. The purpose of this study is to determine the safest and highest dose of
      cabozantinib that can be given together with standard doses of gemcitabine in patients with
      pancreatic cancer. This study will determine the safety and tolerability of this two drug
      combination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical work at the University of Michigan has demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met with
      cabozantinib prevented the development of metastatic disease in an intra-cardiac injection
      model in NOD/SCID mice. Additionally, the combination of cabozantinib and gemcitabine
      demonstrated improved tumor control compared to either agent alone in a relevant orthotopic
      implantation mouse model.

      Combining gemcitabine with the c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib in advanced pancreatic cancer is
      a novel strategy that takes advantage of an established cytotoxic agent with one that targets
      a pathway known to be important for the growth, dissemination, and resistance of this
      disease.
