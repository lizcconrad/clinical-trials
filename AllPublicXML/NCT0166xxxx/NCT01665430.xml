    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), AEs of Special Interest and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 112 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. An SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. AEs include serious as well as non-serious AEs. AEs of special interest included: Infections including all opportunistic infections and non-serious infections as defined by those treated with IV anti-infectives; Myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome; Gastrointestinal perforations and related events; Malignancies; Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity reactions; Demyelinating disorders; Stroke; Bleeding events; and Hepatic events.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Index 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit (Week 104), at early withdrawal (up to Week 104)</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-ESR was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, in millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment on a 0 to 100 millimeter [mm] visual analog scale [VAS]; higher scores indicating greater affectation due to disease activity). Total DAS28-ESR transformed score range: 0 to approximately 10, higher score=more disease activity. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Drug-Free Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 104 (assessed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit [Week 104], at early withdrawal [up to 104 weeks])</time_frame>
    <description>Drug-free remission was defined as having clinical remission (defined as DAS28-ESR score &lt;2.6) for 2 consecutive assessment visits followed by discontinuation of tocilizumab at the second assessment visit. DAS28-ESR was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joints count, ESR, (mm/hour) and PtGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment on a 0 to 100 mm VAS; higher scores indicating greater affectation due to disease activity). Total DAS28-ESR transformed score range: 0 to approximately 10, higher score=more disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 104 (assessed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit [Week 104], at early withdrawal [up to 104 weeks])</time_frame>
    <description>Clinical remission was defined as having DAS28-ESR score &lt;2.6 at any point during the study. DAS28-ESR was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joints count, ESR, (mm/hour) and PtGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment on a 0 to 100 mm VAS; higher scores indicating greater affectation due to disease activity). Total DAS28-ESR transformed score range: 0 to approximately 10, higher score=more disease activity.</description>

    <measure>Time to Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Flare in Participants Who Had Entered Drug-Free Remission</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 104 (assessed at Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit [Week 104], at early withdrawal [up to 104 weeks])</time_frame>
    <description>Time to RA flare was defined as the period of drug-free remission (having DAS28-ESR score &lt;2.6 for 2 consecutive assessment visits followed by discontinuation of tocilizumab at the second assessment visit) until documented RA flare. RA flare was defined as any worsening of the participant's disease activity that, in the opinion of the Investigator, required treatment intensification beyond supportive therapy which could include restarting the study drug.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity Using Visual Analog Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit (Week 104), at early withdrawal (up to 104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PGA of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal VAS by the physician. The left-hand extreme of the line equaled 0 mm, and was described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equaled 100 mm, and was described as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Participant Assessment of Pain Using VAS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit (Week 104), at early withdrawal (up to 104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of pain was evaluated by a VAS. Participants marked on a 100 mm horizontal VAS the severity of pain that they had experienced because of their RA, ranging from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain). Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, 56, 68, 80, 92, at end of study visit (Week 104), at early withdrawal (up to 104 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant's functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores from all questions and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from study for reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Index 28 Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) Score</title>
        <description>DAS28-ESR was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joints count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, in millimeters per hour [mm/hour]) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment on a 0 to 100 millimeter [mm] visual analog scale [VAS]; higher scores indicating greater affectation due to disease activity). Total DAS28-ESR transformed score range: 0 to approximately 10, higher score=more disease activity. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with “Unspecified” reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Tender Joint Counts (28 Joints)</title>
        <description>The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form, no tenderness = 0, tenderness = 1, for 28 joints and joints were classified as tender/not tender giving a total possible tender joint count of 0 to 28. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with “Unspecified” reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <description>Drug-free remission was defined as having clinical remission (defined as DAS28-ESR score &lt;2.6) for 2 consecutive assessment visits followed by discontinuation of tocilizumab at the second assessment visit. DAS28-ESR was calculated from swollen joint count and tender joint count using 28 joints count, ESR, (mm/hour) and PtGA of disease activity (participant rated arthritis activity assessment on a 0 to 100 mm VAS; higher scores indicating greater affectation due to disease activity). Total DAS28-ESR transformed score range: 0 to approximately 10, higher score=more disease activity.</description>

        <description>The PGA of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal VAS by the physician. The left-hand extreme of the line equaled 0 mm, and was described as “no disease activity” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equaled 100 mm, and was described as “maximum disease activity” (maximum arthritis disease activity). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PtGA of Disease Activity Using VAS</title>
        <description>The PtGA of disease activity was assessed using a 0 to 100 mm horizontal VAS by the participant. The left-hand extreme of the line equaled 0 mm, and was described as “no disease activity” (symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the right-hand extreme equaled 100 mm, and was described as “maximum disease activity” (maximum arthritis disease activity). A negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with “Unspecified” reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Participant Assessment of Pain Using VAS</title>
        <description>Severity of pain was evaluated by a VAS. Participants marked on a 100 mm horizontal VAS the severity of pain that they had experienced because of their RA, ranging from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (unbearable pain). Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from the study for the reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with “Unspecified” reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)</title>
        <description>The HAQ-DI was a participant self-reported questionnaire for assessing the extent of a participant’s functional ability. It consisted of 20 questions in 8 categories (dressing and grooming, rising, eating, walking, reach, grip, hygiene, and carrying out daily activities). Each question had 4 response options, ranging from 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. The HAQ-DI scale was an average of all the scores from all questions and ranged from 0 to 3, where higher scores represented higher disease activity. Participants who completed the study, or discontinued the study as per sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in End of Study Visit which was Week 104. Participants who withdrew from study for reason other than sponsor discretion due to marketing authorization approval, were included in Early Withdrawal Visit. Participants with &quot;Unspecified&quot; reason of discontinuation were excluded for change from baseline analysis.</description>
