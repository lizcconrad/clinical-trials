  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the protocol &quot;Predicting therapeutic outcome of mandibular advancement device treatment in
      obstructive sleep apnea (PROMAD)&quot;, 100 patients with obstructive sleep apnea are included and
      started MAD treatment at 75% of maximal protrusion. All patients underwent polysomnography
      with MAD in situ to evaluate the effect of the MAD on severity of sleep apnea. If the results
      of the polysomnography with MAD are unsuccessful (defined as a reduction in AHI with the MAD
      in situ of less than 50% compared to baseline), the therapy needs to be adjusted. Finding the
      most effective protrusion should be a weighted compromise between efficacy and side-effects
      of MAD therapy.

      In patients with insufficient results on the polysomnography with the MAD at 75% of maximal
      protrusion, the MAD will be further adjusted until 90% of the maximal protrusion measured at
      the follow-up visit after the polysomnography with the MAD. After habituation and adaptation
      period but within 2 months after the first polysomnography with MAD, a new polysomnography
      will be performed to assess the effect of the 90% protruded position.
