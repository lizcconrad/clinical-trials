  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
      airways characterized by fixed airflow obstruction, with important systemic co-morbidities.
      The obstruction is usually progressive and irreversible despite chronic therapy. Cigarette
      smoking is the major cause of this disease. COPD is an important cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress plays a key role in
      the pathogenesis of COPD. In particular, the active metabolites of oxygen such as superoxide
      anion and the hydroxyl radical are unstable molecules that can trigger significant oxidative
      processes at the cellular level. These molecules can alter the extracellular matrix
      remodeling, cell respiration, cell proliferation, cellular repair and the immune response in
      the lung. All these events are key elements in the pathogenesis of COPD.

      Currently available treatments for COPD (i.e. long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled
      corticosteroids) have not demonstrated a significant in vivo antioxidant effect. The thermal
      inhalation treatments are a therapeutic strategy used since many years in an empirical way in
      patients with COPD. Indeed, the evidence of effectiveness of spa treatment in patients with
      COPD are very limited.

      The aim of this in vivo study is to evaluate the modulatory effects of sulfur thermal water
      inhalation on oxidant stress in the airways of stable COPD patients.
