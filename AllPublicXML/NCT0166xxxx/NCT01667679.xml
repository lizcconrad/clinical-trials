    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN delivered nasally (through
      the nose) using the OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN DEVICE can reduce the pain associated with migraine
      headaches in 30 minutes after use.

      The primary objective for this study is to compare the proportion of attacks in which pain
      reduction (defined as a decrease in pain intensity of at least 1 point) is achieved at 30
      minutes following 20 mg OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN treatment with 100 mg Sumatriptan Tablets

    <measure>Mean Sum of Migraine Pain Intensity Differences (SPID)-30</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 minutes post-dose (up to 24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SPID-30 is defined as the sum of the pain intensity differences (measured as area under the curve) from dosing (Baseline) through 30 minutes post-dose for headaches with a Baseline intensity of mild, moderate, or severe. The range of possible scores is -60 to +90. A higher number indicates a greater reduction in pain intensity. Negative values indicate worsening pain. A value of &quot;0&quot; indicates that there was no change in pain intensity from Baseline through 30 minutes. Results are from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method (missing values were replaced by carrying forward the preceding value) was used for this analysis.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and 30 minutes post-dose (up to 24 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>SPID-30 is defined as the sum of the pain intensity differences (measured as area under the curve) from dosing (Baseline) through 30 minutes post-dose for headaches with a Baseline intensity of mild and moderate/severe (rated on a 4-point scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). The range of possible scores for all participants is -60 to +90. For participants with a mild headache at Baseline, the SPID range is -60 to +30. For participants with a moderate/severe headache at Baseline, the SPID range is -30 to +90. A higher number indicates a greater reduction in pain intensity. Negative values indicate worsening pain. A value of &quot;0&quot; indicates that there was no change in pain intensity from Baseline through 30 minutes.

          <description>In Treatment Period 1 (&lt;=12 weeks), participants received a 100 mg sumatriptan tablet taken orally and placebo (lactose) as a nasal powder administered into the nostril on the side of the migraine, followed by another administration into the other nostril. After completing Treatment Period 1, participants entered Treatment Period 2 (&lt;=12 weeks), during which they received 20 mg sumatriptan nasal powder delivered intranasally with a bi-directional device and a placebo tablet taken orally.</description>

        <title>Mean Sum of Migraine Pain Intensity Differences (SPID)-30</title>
        <description>SPID-30 is defined as the sum of the pain intensity differences (measured as area under the curve) from dosing (Baseline) through 30 minutes post-dose for headaches with a Baseline intensity of mild, moderate, or severe. The range of possible scores is -60 to +90. A higher number indicates a greater reduction in pain intensity. Negative values indicate worsening pain. A value of &quot;0&quot; indicates that there was no change in pain intensity from Baseline through 30 minutes. Results are from an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, period, and treatment sequence as fixed effects and participant as a random effect. The Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) imputation method (missing values were replaced by carrying forward the preceding value) was used for this analysis.</description>

        <description>SPID-30 is defined as the sum of the pain intensity differences (measured as area under the curve) from dosing (Baseline) through 30 minutes post-dose for headaches with a Baseline intensity of mild and moderate/severe (rated on a 4-point scale: 0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate, and 3=severe). The range of possible scores for all participants is -60 to +90. For participants with a mild headache at Baseline, the SPID range is -60 to +30. For participants with a moderate/severe headache at Baseline, the SPID range is -30 to +90. A higher number indicates a greater reduction in pain intensity. Negative values indicate worsening pain.

        <description>Participants were required to record their headache severity score in their e-diaries immediately before intake of study medication (Baseline) and at 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-dose. Participants graded their headaches on the following severity scale: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Clinical Disability Score at 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 Minutes Post-dose</title>
        <description>Participants were required to record their clinical disability score in their e-diaries immediately before intake of study medication (Baseline) and at 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-dose. Participants graded their disability on the following scale: 0, no disability, able to function normally; 1, performance of daily activities mildly impaired, can still do everything but with difficulty; 2, performance of daily activities moderately impaired, unable to do some things; 3, performance of daily activities severely impaired, cannot do all or most things, bed rest may be necessary. Mean change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.</description>

        <description>Change from Baseline in hemoglobin was assessed at Visit 3 (the start of Treatment Period 2) and Visit 4 (the end-of-study visit). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is the last non-missing value prior to or on the start date of Treatment Period 1.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP) and Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) at Visit 3 (up to Week 12) and Visit 4 (up to Week 24)</title>
        <description>Change from Baseline in SBP and DBP was assessed at Visit 3 (the start of Treatment Period 2) and Visit 4 (the end-of-study visit). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value. The Baseline value is the last non-missing value prior to or on the start date of Treatment Period 1.</description>

            <description>In Treatment Period 1 (&lt;=12 weeks), participants received 20 milligrams (mg) sumatriptan nasal powder delivered intranasally with a bi-directional device and a placebo (PBO) tablet taken orally. After completing Treatment Period 1 (upon reaching 12 weeks or treating the fifth qualifying migraine headache in the treatment period, whichever came first), participants entered Treatment Period 2 (&lt;=12 weeks), during which they received a 100 mg sumatriptan tablet taken orally and placebo (lactose) as a nasal powder administered into the nostril on the side of the migraine, followed by another administration into the other nostril. Participants were to treat &lt;=5 qualifying migraine headaches during Treatment Period 2.</description>
