  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation has been known to be a pivotal pathogenic mechanism of obesity-related disorders
      such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adipose tissue functions as
      a major endocrine organ by adipokine mediated modulation of a number of signaling cascades in
      target tissues, that has pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activities. Progranulin and
      CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines. Therefore, the investigators tried to clarify
      the clinical meaning of these two adipokines in the subjects with or without metabolic
      syndrome
