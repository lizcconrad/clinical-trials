  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer-related fatigue has been described as a subjective feeling of physical, emotional,
      and/or cognitive tiredness. Fatigue is frequently identified as one of the most troublesome
      symptoms in pediatric cancer patients. Fatigue affects children with cancer throughout the
      trajectory of their disease. Treatment interventions for cancer-related fatigue have been
      largely unsuccessful. Homeopathy involves treatment of patients with diluted natural
      substances aimed at stimulating the body's healing system. In the efficacy trial literature,
      individualized homeopathy shows the most promise over other forms of homeopathic
      intervention. Individualized homeopathic treatment involves a unique yet established method
      of case taking. During the consultation, the homeopath asks a series of broad questions to
      elicit subjective symptoms related to the patient's disease, their medical history, as well
      as particular characteristics (physical or psychological) related to the individual. This
      study will recruit children receiving chemotherapy to undergo homeopathic remedies to treat
      their fatigue. This study hypothesizes that homeopathic treatment will effectively treat
      fatigue.
