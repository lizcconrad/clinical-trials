      This study is investigating the effects of a new hormone treatment for breast cancer called
      Irosustat. Seventy percent of breast cancers in post-menopausal wome rely on oestrogen to
      grow therefore are likely to respond to hormone therapy. Irosustat blocks a different pathway
      of steroid synthesis to Aromatase, reducing in this way oestrogen levels in the body. As less
      oestrogen reaches the breast cancer, it grows more slowly or stops growing altogether.

      IPET will recruit postmenopausal women with early, hormone sensitive, treatment naive breast
      cancer will receive 40mg of Irosustat once daily for 2 weeks. The effects of Irosustat on
      breast cancer will be evaluated by PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography) using a
      radioactive substance called FLT as a tracer. The scans will be performed in a PET-CT scanner
      which combines a PET scan and a CT scan (Computer Tomography) into one scan. This type of
      scan can show how body tissues are working, as well as what they look like. FLT-PET scans
      will be performed before and following treatment with Irosustat. As cancer cells grow faster
      than the normal cells around them, they will take up more of the radioactive substance, and
      so stand out clearly on the scan. If Irosustat is slowing down the cancer growth, the cancer
      will take up less of the tracer.

      Blood samples will be taken at regular intervals to assess what the new drug does to the body
      and the safety and tolerability of Irosustat will be assessed. The study incorporates
      translation aspects/endpoints which are based on the collection of tumour biopsies before and
      after treatment with Irosustat although the later biopsy is not mandatory.

      Objectives

      Primary:

      To assess changes in [18F] fluorothymidine (FLT) uptake using Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) following 2 weeks of Irosustat treatment in patients with early, treatment naïve,
      oestrogen receptor positive (ER +ve) breast cancer

      Secondary:

      To assess the:

        1. Pharmacodynamic profile of Irosustat
