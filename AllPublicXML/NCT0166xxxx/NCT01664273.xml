  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene transfer by electroporation (gene electrotransfer) uses short electric pulses to
      transiently permeabilise the cell membrane enabling passage of plasmid DNA into the cell
      cytosol. It is an efficient non-viral method for gene delivery to various tissues. In this
      phase I dose-escalating study, patients will be treated with intramuscular gene
      electrotransfer of plasmid AMEP. Plasmid AMEP encodes protein AMEP which bind to α5β1 og αvβ3
      integrins. Primary end point of the trial is safety and secondary end points are efficacy,
      pharmacokinetics and evaluation of potential discomfort associated with the treatment
      procedure using VAS (Visual Analogue Scale).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with increasing doses of plasmid AMEP. Up to 12
      patients will be treated.

      Treatment procedure: Local anesthetic is applied to m. quadriceps femoris (thigh muscle) and
      the skin. An incision of the skin is performed followed by dissection until the muscle is
      exposed. The surgical procedure is performed by plastic surgeons.

      Plasmid AMEP is injected intramuscularly and immediately followed by application of electric
      pulses via a needle electrode inserted into the muscle. A combination of one high voltage
      pulse (700V/cm, 100 µs) followed by one low voltage pulse (80 V/cm, 400 ms) will be applied.
      The wound is sutured and a dressing is applied. Treatment procedure is estimated to 30
      minutes.

      All patients are hospitalized for 24 hours after treatment for the purpose of evaluation of
      vital signs, physical examination, AE and SAE recording and pharmacokinetics sampling (blood
      and urine).

      Blood biochemistry including LDH and CK is taken 24 hours post treatment. ECG will be taken
      before and after treatment. Patients score discomfort or pain from treated area using VAS.

    <description>Safety is evaluated by registration of adverse events (Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events) using the CTCAE criteria version 4.0. Patients are seen in the out patient clinic once a week during the first month after treatment (at day 8, day 15, day 22, day 29) and 8 weeks after treatment. If no progression of the disease at 8 weeks, patients are seen at 12 weeks and then every three months until disease progression or death.</description>

    <description>Cohorts of 3 patients will received increasing doses of plasmid AMEP:
50 μg, 100 μg, 250 μg and 500 μg. Starting dose will be the lowest dose.
Injection volume will remain constant at 200 μL.
Once-only treatment and intra-individual dose escalation will therefore not occur.</description>
