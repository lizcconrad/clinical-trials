  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will compare the safety and efficacy
      of tapering methotrexate (MTX) versus maintaining MTX dosage in patients with severe active
      rheumatoid arthritis and an inadequate response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs) initiated on treatment with tocilizumab. Participants will receive tocilizumab 8
      mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks and MTX orally weekly throughout the study. At Week 24,
      participants achieving a good/moderate EULAR response will be randomized receiving the MTX
      Tapering arm or MTX Maintenance arm. Up to Week 56 participants will receive either tapering
      or stable dose MTX in combination with tocilizumab. From Week 56 to Week 72 participants will
      receive tocilizumab monotherapy.

    <description>Response was determined using EULAR criteria based upon (Disease Activity Score In 28 Joints) DAS28 absolute scores at the assessment visit and the DAS28 reduction from the reference visit. Participants with a score lesser than or equal to (&lt;=) 3.2 and reduction of greater than (&gt;) 1.2 points were assessed as having a 'good' response. Participants with a score &gt;3.2 with reduction of &gt;1.2 points, or a score &lt;=5.1 with reduction of &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 points, were assessed as having a 'moderate' response. Participants with a score &gt;5.1 with reduction of &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 points, or any score with reduction &lt;=0.6 points, were assessed as non-responders with response recorded as 'none.'</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score In 28 Joints (DAS28) Score at Week 60</measure>
    <time_frame>Randomization (Week 24), Week 60</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 defined as a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index included swollen (range 0-28) and tender joint counts (TJC) (range 0-28), acute phase response Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and general health status (range 1-100). The index was calculated using the following formula: The DAS28 was calculated as [0.28 x the square root of number of swollen joints] + [0.56 x the square root of number of tender joints] + [0.7 x the natural log of ESR] + [0.014 x patient global assessment of disease activity]. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

    <description>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was an index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index was calculated using the following formula: CDAI: SJC28 + TJC28 + patient global assessment of disease (PGA) 10 centimeter [cm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS] + physician global assessment of disease (PhGA) 10 cm VAS. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.'

    <time_frame>Randomization (Week 24), Week 60, 72</time_frame>
    <description>The HAQ-disability index (DI) evaluates participant-reported quality of life using 8 categories: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and other common activities such as running errands and performing household chores and 20 questions. Each category contains multiple questions, which were answered using a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. The overall index score was an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities. Improvement was defined as a decrease from Week 24 to Week 60 and 72. Reported is the percentage of participants with an improvement in HAQ-DI score.</description>

    <description>The FACIT-fatigue assessment was a 13-item questionnaire with participants scoring each item on a 5-point scale (not at all; a little bit; somewhat; quite a bit and very much). The total score ranges from 0 to 65 and higher scores indicate more fatigue. Improvement was defined as a decrease from Week 24 to Week 60 and 72.

      <pre_assignment_details>The initial open label period of the study consisted of one group of 427 participants. After completion of the initial phase only participants, who achieved a good/moderate disease response, were randomized into the double blind period. 272 participants were randomized into the two arms entering the double-blind period of the study.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score In 28 Joints (DAS28) Score at Week 60</title>
        <description>The DAS28 defined as a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index included swollen (range 0-28) and tender joint counts (TJC) (range 0-28), acute phase response Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and general health status (range 1-100). The index was calculated using the following formula: The DAS28 was calculated as [0.28 x the square root of number of swollen joints] + [0.56 x the square root of number of tender joints] + [0.7 x the natural log of ESR] + [0.014 x patient global assessment of disease activity]. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score In 28 Joints (DAS28) Score at Week 72</title>
        <description>The DAS28 defined as a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The index included swollen (range 0-28) and tender joint counts (TJC) (range 0-28), acute phase response Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), and general health status (range 1-100). The index was calculated using the following formula: The DAS28 was calculated as [0.28 x the square root of number of swollen joints] + [0.56 x the square root of number of tender joints] + [0.7 x the natural log of ESR] + [0.014 x patient global assessment of disease activity]. The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

            <description>After the open-label period ended at Week 24, participants achieving a good/moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) disease response were randomized to the MTX Tapering Group or MTX Maintenance Group. In the MTX Maintenance Group participants continued to be administered the same dose of MTX in a double-blind fashion from Week 25 to Week 56. In addition, participants continued to receive open-label tocilizumab from Week 25 to Week 56. From Week 56 to Week 72 participants received tocilizumab monotherapy.</description>

        <description>Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) was an index for measuring disease activity in RA. The index was calculated using the following formula: CDAI: SJC28 + TJC28 + patient global assessment of disease (PGA) 10 centimeter [cm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS] + physician global assessment of disease (PhGA) 10 cm VAS. VAS assessments involved a 10 cm horizontal scale from 'no disease activity' to 'maximum disease activity.' CDAI scores ranged from 0 to 76, with higher scores indicating increased disease activity.</description>

Each category contains multiple questions, which were answered using a 4-point scale from 0 to 3. The overall index score was an average of the individual item responses and may range from 0 to 3, where higher scores indicate more difficulty in daily living activities. Improvement was defined as a decrease from Week 24 to Week 60 and 72. Reported is the percentage of participants with an improvement in HAQ-DI score.</description>

        <description>The WPAI-SHP questionnaire assesses work productivity and activity impairment. It is a patient-reported assessment regarding hours missed and hours worked at employment and degree to which a specified health problem affected work productivity and regular activities. It consists of 6 questions to assess the impact of a specific health problem on work productivity and on regular daily activities. Assessments were made using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 10 where 0 = minimum impact and 10 = maximum impact.</description>
