  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Professional societies recommend that endoscopists measure their ceacal intubation rate,
      adenoma detection rate as indicators of the screening colonoscopy quality. However, it is
      uncertain how to improve adenoma detection rate and reduce inter-endoscopists' variability in
      the detection of adenomas. The investigators hypothesize that a hands-on-training
      intervention tailored to the results of environmental assessment and audit on colonoscopy
      quality indicators results in higher adenoma detection rate improvement than simple audit and
      feedback. The investigators further hypothesize that by training the leaders of the screening
      centres, the effect of the intervention will be further disseminated among other endoscopists
      from the participating centers, and will thus result in additional increase in individual
      adenoma detection rate.

      The primary aim is to compare the impact on adenoma detection rate of two screening
      colonoscopy improvement programs:

        1. Tailored training intervention.

        2. Audit feedback on colonoscopy quality indicators.

    <description>Screening centre leaders randomized to the training intervention group will be invited to take part in a train-the-leaders course. The Train-the-leaders course will consist of three phases: (i) pre-training assessment, (ii) hands-on-training and (iii) post-training evaluation and feedback. The Train-the-leaders course will be run in polish by the team from the Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute on Oncology, Warsaw, which was trained in delivering such intervention by experts from the United Kingdom.</description>

    <description>Screening centre leaders randomized to the feedback group will receive (by e-mail and conventional mail) feedback on their individual screening colonoscopy quality indicators (adenoma detection rate and ceacal intubation rate) measured for the 2011 edition of the national screening program. The results will be presented in a league table in order to enable comparison with anonymous results of all endoscopists who performed at least 30 colonoscopies within the screening program. In addition, a link to a webpage containing data on individual and overall colonoscopy quality indicators over the last four years of the screening program will be provided.</description>
