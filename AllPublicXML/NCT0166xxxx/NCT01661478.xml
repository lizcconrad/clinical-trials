      The purpose of this quality improvement research project is to briefly survey attitudes among
      healthcare providers toward patients with substance use disorders before and after substance
      abuse counselors are placed in the Emergency Room. SBIRT stands for Screening Brief
      Intervention and Referral to Treatment. The pre-test survey contains 10 questions about
      attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and the post-test survey consists of
      13 questions about attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders and questions
      regarding the SBIRT model itself. Health care providers will be surveyed before the SBIRT
      Counselors begin and again at 6 months, after full SBIRT program with substance counselors on
      site has been in place, as a part of their regular staff education requirements. Part of the
      goal of the SBIRT counselors is to educate providers about treatment and analyze data
      collected by and comments of Emergency Room staff.
