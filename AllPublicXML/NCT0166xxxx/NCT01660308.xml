      Fibroblast froth factors (FGFs) are humoral factors identified by their ability to stimulate
      cell proliferation1. They play different roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
      differentiation and function. Most FGF family members act as paracrine factors. But
      FGF19(FGF19) subfamily members, including FGF19, 21, and 23, work as endocrine factors to
      regulate bile acid, carbohydrate and phosphate metabolism2. Of these, FGF23 plays an
      important role in phosphate and bone metabolism3. FGF23 gene encodes 251 amino acids,
      including a 24-amino acid signal peptide4. The secreted FGF23 is a protein consisted of 227
      amino acids. It works by binding to a Klotho-FGF receptor 1c (FGF1c) complex5. FGF suppresses
      the expression of type 2a and 2c sodium-phosphate cotransporters, which mediate phosphate
      reabsorption in proximal tubules.6 FGF23 decreases 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase
      expression and enhances 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase expression6. Therefore, FGF23
      reduces serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D〔1,25(OH)2D〕, which stimulates intestinal calcium and
      phosphate absorption. FGF23 decreases serum phosphate through the above mechanisms FGF23
      over-expression might result in hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia.

      Tumor induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a paraneoplastic syndrome usually caused by benign
      phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. Symptoms are nonspecific, such as general weakness, fatigue,
      and bone pain. Sometimes fracture may occurs. The responsible tumors are sometimes small and
      difficult to detect. Tumors secrete FGF23. FGF23 reduced phosphate reabsorption in the
      proximal tubules and decrease 1,25(OH)2D levels, which result in hypophosphatemia and then
      osteomalacia.

      The investigators would like to observe the changes of FGF23 in patients who receive
      operation or medical treatment and hope this will benefit future treatment.
