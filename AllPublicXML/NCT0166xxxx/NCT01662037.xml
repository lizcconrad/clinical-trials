      Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is a serous issues in children with functional
      single ventricle during the staged operative period. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate if Bosentan therapy can improve the survival and life quality after staged Fontan
      procedure in the children with high risk of increased PVR.
