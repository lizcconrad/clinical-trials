    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a non-invasive imaging device called
      Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) can help doctors to see the tissue and blood vessels
      that are related to non-melanoma skin cancers. OFDI was designed to see microscopic details
      of your skin without needing to use any invasive techniques such as surgery or biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the United States, with more
      than 750,000 diagnosed patients treated every year. Its prevalence and incidence have
      significantly increased over the past two decades and it has been estimated that 20% of all
      Americans will develop this type of cancer during their lifetime (Neville et al., 2007).
      Biopsy and surgical resection of NMSC can result in tissue mutilation and scaring. Therefore,
      there is a need for new imaging technologies that can be used to non-invasively guide biopsy
      and surgery.

      Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) is a second-generation imaging implementation of
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) developed at the Wellman Center. OFDI provides
      high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in tissue. It uses an interferometric
      depth-sectioning technique and employs a near-infrared light source. Through analysis of
      phase information in the recorded signal. OFDI can detect blood vessels within tissues and
      tumors. Importantly, OFDI-based vascular imaging can be performed without the need for
      exogenous contrast agents, making it relatively easy to deploy in clinical settings.
