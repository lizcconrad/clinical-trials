  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the application of Fibrin Sealant Grifols
      provides a measurable benefit when compared to hemostasis achieved through conventional
      surgical technique (suture) and by standard hemostatic action, such as mechanical pressure
      through manual compression. This study has a Preliminary Part (I) in which all subjects are
      treated with Fibrin Sealant Grifols and a Primary Part (II) in which subjects are randomized
      in a 2:1 ratio to either Fibrin Sealant Grifols or manual compression.

    <measure>Proportion of Subjects Achieving Hemostasis by Four Minutes After Treatment Start</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 4 minutes after treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects achieving hemostasis at the target bleeding site by 4 minutes following the start of treatment without the occurrence of re-bleeding until the completion of surgical closure.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Hemostasis (TTH)</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of treatment until 10 minutes after treatment start</time_frame>
    <description>Time in minutes for achievement of hemostasis at the target bleeding site measured from the start of treatment until 10 minutes after treatment start.
In the Fibrin Sealant Grifols treatment group, the median TTH was calculated based on the estimated survival function S(t), and it is the smallest time at which S(t) is at or below 50%. The 95% CI for the median TTH, on the other hand, was calculated based on the CI for the survival function S(t). The 95% CI for the median TTH was the set of all time points for which the 95% CI of the survival function contains 0.5 (since median is the 50% percentile). Sometimes, the confidence limits for the median cannot be estimated. In our case, the hemostasis was assessed on a discrete scale, and it happened that for all the time points assessed none of the 95% CI of the survival function S(t) contained 0.5. As a result, neither the lower nor the upper limit could be estimated.
All calculations were performed using SAS PROC LIFETEST</description>

        <title>Time to Hemostasis (TTH)</title>
        <description>Time in minutes for achievement of hemostasis at the target bleeding site measured from the start of treatment until 10 minutes after treatment start.
In the Fibrin Sealant Grifols treatment group, the median TTH was calculated based on the estimated survival function S(t), and it is the smallest time at which S(t) is at or below 50%. The 95% CI for the median TTH, on the other hand, was calculated based on the CI for the survival function S(t). The 95% CI for the median TTH was the set of all time points for which the 95% CI of the survival function contains 0.5 (since median is the 50% percentile). Sometimes, the confidence limits for the median cannot be estimated. In our case, the hemostasis was assessed on a discrete scale, and it happened that for all the time points assessed none of the 95% CI of the survival function S(t) contained 0.5. As a result, neither the lower nor the upper limit could be estimated.
All calculations were performed using SAS PROC LIFETEST</description>
