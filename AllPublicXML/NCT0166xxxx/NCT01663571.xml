      Protocol Summary

      Constitutive STAT3 activity is implicated in many malignancies including Cutaneous T Cell
      Lymphoma. It is also essential for Th17 differentiation, a subset of CD4 effector T cell,
      implicated in chronic inflammatory conditions and possibly CTCL. HDAC inhibitors have shown
      activity in CTCL but their exact mechanism of action is not known. It is known that HDAC
      inhibitors regulate STAT3 transcriptional activity and hence can potentially be active in
      CTCL through modulation of the STAT3 pathway. The hypothesis is that Th17 cytokines
      contribute to the initiation of cancer by creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment that
      predisposes cells to neoplastic transformation. To probe this, the investigators will compare
      the differences in cytokine production and gene expression in the skin resident T cells from
      patients with benign dermatoses and CTCL as well as in the blood/circulating lymphocytes of
      healthy donors and Sezary syndrome (SS). The investigators will also investigate whether HDAC
      inhibitors have a direct impact on the number of Th17 cells, the cytokine production by these
      cells and phosphorylated STAT3 protein in CTCL with subsequent treatment cycles.

      The objectives of this study are 1. Observe the epigenetic, transcriptional and phenotypic
      changes that take place in T cell during malignant transformation 2. Understand the mechanism
      of action of HDAC inhibitors in CTCL.

      Methods: Skin biopsy specimens from cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) patients and benign skin
      conditions namely eczema, dermatitis and psoriasis will be obtained through a standard punch
      biopsy procedure from the skin lesion.

      Additionally, 15 ml of peripheral blood from CTCL patients who have Sezary syndrome (SS) and
      from patients with benign skin condition will be collected.

      CTCL patients, who are starting treatment with HDAC Inhibitors namely Vorinostat and
      Romidepsin, will have a total of 3 skin biopsies and/or blood draws. The first procedure
      would be before starting treatment with either of these HDAC inhibitors. Two more skin
      biopsies and/or blood draws will be performed after first and second cycle of treatment.

      Levels of Th17 cytokines, IL-17, IL -22 and pSTAT3 protein will be determined by IHC staining
      in the skin and cytokine levels in the blood will be assayed by sandwich ELISA method.The
      investigators will also assay the mRNA levels of the transcription factors of the different T
      effector cells by qPCR.
