  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In healthy women, early menopause is an event that is associated with the exacerbation of
      several risk factors of cardiovascular and skeletal disease. The occurrence of an early
      menopause may have even greater impact in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM-1). A small
      number of studies has demonstrated that DM-1 patients experience cycle irregularity and
      menopause at a younger age compared to controls. In addition, initial studies have suggested
      that also in regular cycling DM-1 women a decreased ovarian reserve status for age is
      present. The explanation for this early decay in ovarian reserve in DM-1 patients remains
      unknown. Next to auto immunity, vascular factors may be possible contributors to accelerated
      ovarian ageing in DM-1 patients.

      Confirmation of more accelerated ovarian ageing in DM-1 women is urgently needed in view of
      the added risk factors outlined above. Also, the mechanisms behind the advanced ovarian
      ageing, with focus on vascular factors, may shed new light on our understanding of the
      ovarian ageing process per se.

        Part I: Premenopausal women diagnosed with DM-1 older than 18 years and registered at the
        department for Endocrinology of in several Dutch hospitals.

        Reference group: the Scheffer, Van Rooij, De Vet (SRV) cohort of normal fertile Caucasian
        women (n=250), recruited in the period of 1990 till 2000.

        For the substudy concerning EPCs will we recruite a control group of 20 healthy female
        age-matched controls. We will recruite these women within the UMC Utrecht due to logistic
        reasons.

        Part II: Postmenopausal women diagnosed with DM-1 and registered at the department for
        Endocrinology of several Dutch hospitals. Reference group:a selection of women from the
        Prospect-EPIC cohort, who had experienced natural menopause
