    <textblock>
      Problem : Precise and personalized 3D knee kinematic assessment during physical and daily
      life activities is a challenge; therefore, it was never performed on an important number of
      individuals. However, a better understanding of 3D knee kinematics during such activities
      would allow a better understanding of this often injured joint.

      Hypothesis: A new system using personalized 3D bone imaging and a percutaneous bone fixation
      device that can be used under local anesthesiaallows for precise and reproducible assessment
      of 3D knee kinematics during physical and daily life activities.

      Objectives :

        -  To study human knee 3D kinematics during dynamic activities using a novel minimally
           invasive measuring system

        -  Investigate the correlations between standard clinical knee laxity tests and measured 3D
           knee kinematics during dynamic activities

    <description>The investigators will investigate if 3D knee kinematics can be precisely and safely measured under local anesthesia during various motor tasks (walking, squatting, pivoting, jumping): kinematic data will be analyzed in search of signs of artefact movement and kinematic aberrations, which would indicate problems with the measurement system.</description>

    <measure>Correlation of kinematic data with clinical laxity tests</measure>
    <time_frame>On the day of surgery, before knee arthroscopy</time_frame>
    <description>With the kinematic measurement device attached to the bones of the lower limbs, various knee laxity tests will be performed by a physician while the kinematics of the knee are recorded; correlations will be sought between the subjective evaluation of the physician and the kinematic data.</description>
