    <description>Study subjects will undergo a screening-trial of neurostimulation using the Boston Scientific Corporation Precision Spectra neurostimulation system and may proceed to permanent implantation in the event of a successful screening trial.
Treatment will include spinal cord stimulation and may also include peripheral nerve stimulation, based upon the physician's subject-specific treatment plan.</description>
