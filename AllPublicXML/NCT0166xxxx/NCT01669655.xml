      The objectives of this study are (1) to characterize plasma lutein levels in breastfed
      infants in an Asian population where lactating mothers have diets habitually high in lutein
      and (2) investigate how blood lutein levels in breastfed infants vary according to lutein
      content of the mothers' milk in such a population.
