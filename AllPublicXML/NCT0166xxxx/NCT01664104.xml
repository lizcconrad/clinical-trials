    <measure>CRP at the Start of TCZ Treatment by Remission Status Using DAS28-CRP, SDAI, and CDAI at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. DAS28 is calculated as follows: DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, A score of &lt; 2.6 represents clinical remission. SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm) + CRP (in mg/dL). A SDAI score of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission. CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm). A CDAI score of ≤ 2.8 represents clinical remission.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With and Without Morning Stiffness</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 and Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Morning stiffness was defined by the time elapsed between the time of usual awakening (even if not in the morning) and the time the participant was able to resume normal activities without stiffness. The participant assessed morning stiffness based on the following criteria:
Presence of participant's joints stiff when woke up that day, measured as yes (stiffness present) or no (stiffness not present);
Duration of morning stiffness, measured by ticking 1 of the six categories: &lt; 30 minutes, 30 - 60 minutes, 60 - 120 minutes, 120 - 240 minutes, &gt; 240 minutes, and the whole day;
Severity of morning stiffness measured using a ruler on a 100 mm VAS where the responses were on a continuous range from 0 mm = no stiffness to 100 mm = maximum stiffness.
'Not estimable' represented that the participants were not able to quantify it. 'Not done' represented that the assessment was not performed.</description>

    <description>The test for CRP is laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related QoL. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do. Total score is average of all questions, which ranges from 0 to 3, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can range in value from −1 to +1.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related quality of life (QoL). It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do. Total score for HAQ-DI is the average of all questions and ranges from 0 to 3, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

        <description>DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores representing higher disease activity, and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x natural logarithm (ln) (CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = managing very well and 100 mm = managing very poorly (√ = square root). A score of &lt; 2.6 represents clinical remission, a score of greater than or equal to (≥) 2.6 and less than or equal to (≤) 3.2 represents low disease activity, a score of &gt; 3.2 and ≤ 5.1 represents moderate disease activity and a score of &gt; 5.1 represents high (or severe) disease activity. Change from baseline = DAS28 at Month X – DAS28 at baseline. Here X = 3 and 6 for Change at Months 3 and 6, respectively.</description>

SDAI total score ranged from 0-86. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. SDAI scores of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission, ≤ 11.0 represents low disease activity , ≤ 26.0 represents moderate disease activity, and &gt; 26.0 represents high (or severe) disease activity.

        <description>The CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = managing very well and 100 = managing very poorly, and PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no arthritis activity and 100 mm = extremely active arthritis. CDAI total score ranged from 0-76. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. CDAI score of ≤ 2.8 represents clinical remission, score of ≤ 10.0 represents low disease activity, score of ≤ 22.0 represents moderate disease activity, and score of &gt; 22.0 represents high (or severe) disease activity. Change from baseline = CDAI score at Month X – CDAI score at baseline. Here X = 3 and 6 for Change at Months 3 and 6, respectively.</description>

        <description>DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on a 0 to 10 scale and calculated as DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP = serum concentration of c-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, which was measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = managing very well and 100 mm = managing very poorly. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. A score of &lt; 2.6 represents clinical remission, a score of ≥ 2.6 and ≤ 3.2 represents low disease activity, a score of &gt;3.2 and ≤ 5.1 represents moderate disease activity, and a score of &gt; 5.1 represents high (or severe) disease activity.</description>

        <description>SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm) + CRP (in mg/dL), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = managing very well and 100 mm = managing very poorly, PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 = no arthritis activity and 100 = extremely active arthritis, CRP = serum concentration of C-reactive protein. SDAI total score ranged from 0-86. Higher scores represent greater disease activity. SDAI scores of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission, ≤ 11.0 represents low disease activity, ≤ 26.0 represents moderate disease activity, and &gt; 26.0 represents high (or severe) disease activity.</description>

        <description>CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm), where TJC28 = tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28 = swollen joint count on 28 units, PGH = patient's global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = managing very well and 100 mm = managing very poorly, and PhGH = physician global assessment of disease activity, assessed on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm = no arthritis activity and 100 mm = extremely active arthritis. CDAI total score ranged from 0-76. Higher scores indicate greater disease activity. CDAI score of ≤ 2.8 represents clinical remission, score of ≤ 10.0 represents low disease activity, score of ≤ 22.0 represents moderate disease activity, and score of &gt; 22.0 represents high (or severe) disease activity.</description>

        <description>The HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related QoL. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do.Total score for HAQ-DI is the average of all the questions, which ranges from 0 to 3, where higher scores represent higher disease activity.</description>

        <description>Clinical response was assessed according to EULAR criteria that classified the participant according to individual changes in DAS28 score as good, moderate, or no response. DAS28 score is a measurement of RA activity on 0 to 10 scale and calculated as DAS28= 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, where TJC28= tender joint count on 28 units, SJC28= swollen joint count on 28 units, CRP= serum concentration of C-reactive protein (after converting units to mg/dL), PGH= patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 100 mm VAS, where 0 mm= managing very well and 100 mm= managing very poorly. Good responders experienced change (chg) from baseline (BL) of &gt;1.2 with DAS28 score ≤ 3.2, moderate responders experienced chg from BL &gt;1.2 with DAS28 score &gt; 3.2 to ≤ 5.1 or a chg from BL &gt; 0.6 to ≤ 1.2 with DAS28 score of ≤ 5.1.

        <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. Change from baseline = CRP level at Month X – CRP level at baseline. Here X = 3 and 6 for Change at Months 3 and 6, respectively.</description>

        <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. DAS28 is calculated as follows: DAS28 = 0.56 x √TJC28 + 0.28 x √SJC28 + 0.36 x ln(CRP + 1) + 0.014 x PGH + 0.96, A score of &lt; 2.6 represents clinical remission. SDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm) + CRP (in mg/dL). A SDAI score of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission. CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm). A CDAI score of ≤ 2.8 represents clinical remission.</description>

A SDAI score of ≤ 3.3 represents clinical remission. CDAI is a combined index for measuring disease activity in RA and calculated as CDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGH (in cm) + PhGH (in cm). A CDAI score of ≤ 2.8 represents clinical remission.</description>

        <description>Morning stiffness was defined by the time elapsed between the time of usual awakening (even if not in the morning) and the time the participant was able to resume normal activities without stiffness. The participant assessed morning stiffness based on the following criteria:
Presence of participant's joints stiff when woke up that day, measured as yes (stiffness present) or no (stiffness not present);
Duration of morning stiffness, measured by ticking 1 of the six categories: &lt; 30 minutes, 30 - 60 minutes, 60 - 120 minutes, 120 - 240 minutes, &gt; 240 minutes, and the whole day;
Severity of morning stiffness measured using a ruler on a 100 mm VAS where the responses were on a continuous range from 0 mm = no stiffness to 100 mm = maximum stiffness.
'Not estimable' represented that the participants were not able to quantify it. 'Not done' represented that the assessment was not performed.</description>

        <description>The test for CRP is laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related QoL. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 = without any difficulty to 3 = unable to do. Total score is average of all questions, which ranges from 0 to 3, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can range in value from −1 to +1.</description>

        <description>CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. HAQ-DI is a questionnaire that measures functional status (disability) and health-related QoL. It measures the participant's ability to perform everyday tasks. The index consists of 20 questions regarding the function of the upper and lower extremities. These questions are summarized in 8 categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common activities over past week. Each question was evaluated according to the degree of severity on a 4-point scale ranging from 0= without any difficulty to 3= unable to do. Total score is the average of all questions, which ranges from 0 to 3, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can range in value from −1 to +1.</description>

        <title>Correlation Coefficient Between Change From Baseline in CRP (mg/dL) and Change From Baseline in Morning Stiffness According to VAS at Month 6</title>
        <description>The test for CRP is a laboratory measurement for evaluation of an acute phase reactant of inflammation through the use of an ultrasensitive assay. A decrease in the level of CRP indicates reduction in inflammation and therefore improvement. Morning stiffness was defined as the time elapsed between the time of usual awakening (even if not in the morning) and the time the participant was able to resume normal activities without stiffness. The participant reported the duration of morning stiffness in the case report form by ticking 1 of the following categories: no morning stiffness, &lt; 30 minutes, 30 - 60 minutes, 60 - 120 minutes, 120 - 240 minutes, &gt; 240 minutes, and the whole day. The Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients can range in value from −1 to +1.</description>
