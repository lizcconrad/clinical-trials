      This is a phase 3 multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group, comparative study to
      evaluate the efficacy of esomeprazole (D961H) 20 mg twice daily and esomeprazole (D961H) 20
      mg once daily in patients (in the form of esomeprazole magnesium salt) with refractory reflux
      esophagitis after 8 weeks of standard Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy by assessment of
      presence/absence of inflammation (esophagitis) at Week 8 according to the Los Angeles (LA)
      classification

    <baseline>
      <population>It was found that 2 patients in D961H 20 mg QD + Placebo group had no refractory RE after randomisation. Therefore, these two patients were excluded from the full analysis set, which was the primary analysis set of this study and was used for summaries of baseline characteristics and outcome measures.</population>
