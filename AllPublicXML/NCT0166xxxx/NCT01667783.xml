  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss is effective in reducing many complications of obesity, with the majority of
      patients who undergo bariatric surgery having substantial improvements in their
      weight-related illnesses. The investigators propose a pilot study in 45 subjects with mild to
      moderate obesity to compare how losing 10% of initial body weight via one of three common
      weight loss strategies (medical weight loss with a low calorie diet, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
      surgery, and adjustable gastric banding) affects diabetes. While the investigators do not
      expect this pilot study to provide definitive answers, it will provide valuable information
      to design a larger trial which will help guide therapy for people with mild-moderate obesity
      and substantial comorbidities.
