  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low birth weight and anemia remain intractable problems in many developing countries despite
      considerable efforts to address them. Intervening with just prenatal iron-folate (IFA)
      supplements may not be the best approach given the substantial demands for iron by maternal
      and fetal tissues. Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the additional contribution
      of prepregnancy interventions. We propose a double blind randomized controlled trial in rural
      Vietnam to evaluate the efficacy of weekly pre- pregnancy IFA or Multiple Micronutrient (MM)
      supplements on birth outcomes and maternal and infant iron status compared to providing only
      prenatal IFA supplements. This project is a collaborative effort between Emory University,
      USA and Thainguyen University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam. Eligible and willing women
      of reproductive age (WRA) will be assigned randomly to one of the following 3 groups of
      pre-pregnancy weekly supplementation: 1) FA (control) 2) IFA and 3) MM. All women will
      receive daily IFA when pregnant. We will recruit ~ 5000 WRA to obtain a sample of at least
      1650 mother-infant pairs, which, at 90% power, will allow us to detect differences of ~ 60 g
      in birth weight between any two groups. Data on obstetric history, socio-demographic status,
      iron status, anthropometry and dietary intakes will be obtained at baseline. Key outcome
      measures will be 1) offspring's size and gestational age at birth 2) offspring's iron status
      at birth and 3 months of age and 3) maternal iron status at the beginning of pregnancy, 1 and
      3 months post-partum. Intention to treat approach will be used to compare the various
      intervention groups. This study is timely and responds to the WHO Global Expert Consultation
      (2007) which identified the need to evaluate the long term benefits of weekly IFA and MM
      supplementation in WRA. The findings will provide the necessary evidence to policy makers to
      recommend weekly MM or IFA supplements to WRA to improve birth outcomes. The central
      hypothesis is that pre-pregnancy weekly IFA or MM supplementation followed by prenatal IFA
      and MM supplementation respectively, will improve birth outcomes as well as maternal and
      infant iron status compared to current practice of providing only prenatal IFA supplements.
      This hypothesis will be tested by conducting a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled
      trial in Vietnam.

    <description>Infants' weight, length and head circumference will be measured as early as possible within 24 hours after birth using standard procedures. All measurements will be obtained in duplicate by the same data collector. Weight-for-age and length-for-age z scores will be calculated using the 2006 WHO reference data.</description>

This method has been shown to be reliable in previous work and we expect precise estimates since we will be visiting women weekly from baseline during the prepregnancy period and will exclude women who may be have delivered in the past 6 months.</description>

    <description>Infant iron status will be measured in cord blood samples (5 ml) obtained at delivery and at 3 months of age using a capillary blood sample (100 l) that will be obtained from a heel prick.
The hemoglobin concentration will be measured from a drop of blood using the HEMOCUE B- Hb photometer. The blood samples will then be centrifuged and serum samples will be aliquotted into microcuvettes and handled in the same way as described for mothers. Serum ferritin and transferrin receptor concentrations will be assayed using the ELISA method.</description>

    <description>There is no current recommendation for weekly MM supplements for WRA. Therefore, we propose a supplement that contains: The same amounts of iron and folic acid as the weekly, pre-natal IFA supplement; An amount of vitamin D based on the Food and Nutrition Board's Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA); UNICEF/WHO/UNU recommended amounts of remaining nutrients (UNIMMAP recommendations). The supplement is taken weekly during pre-pregnancy.

    <description>It is unethical to have a placebo group as FA is universally recommended for WRA to prevent neural tube defects. Therefore, the control group will receive 2800 μg FA once a week during the pre-pregnancy period. This dosage is safe and meets the minimum recommended intake of 400 μg/d for Women of Reproductive Age (WRA). Recent studies have shown that a weekly dose of 2800 μg FA is as effective as a daily dose of 400 μg in improving folic acid and reducing homocysteine levels among WRA.</description>
