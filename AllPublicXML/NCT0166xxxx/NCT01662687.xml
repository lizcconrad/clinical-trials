    <textblock>
      Multicenter, randomized, open-label, paralled-group, active-controlled study. The study is to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of the Granisetron Transdermal Delivery System (GTDS) compared
      with the intravenous and oral Granisetron in the prevention of CINV associated with
      moderately emetogenic Chemotherapy.

      Patients scheduled to receive the one cycle of a ME chemotherapy regimen administered for 1-4
      days will attend a Screening Visit 2 to 28 days before start of ME chemotherapy. Eligible
      patients will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups at the Randomization Visit (1 to 2
      days prior to ME chemotherapy).

        -  Sancuso patch

        -  Kytril inj.+Kytril tab.

      The patch will be applied 2days (48-24h) prior to first daily dose of the moderately
      emetogenic chemotherapy regimen and remain in place for 6 days. The patient will be assessed
      daily until 4days after first chemotherapy administration. Adverse Events (AEs) will be
      collected until 14 days after the final dose of IP. Non-serious AEs will be followed-up until
      14 days after the final dose of IP. Serious adverse events will be followed-up until they are
      resolved, stable or until the patient is lost to follow-up.
