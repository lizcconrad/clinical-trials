  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the TB
      vaccine administered according to a 0, 1 month schedule. In, addition, blood samples
      collected at different time points after vaccination will be analysed to see when exactly
      genes are activated by the vaccine using an assay called mRNA expression profiling. The
      different methods for mRNA expression profiling using whole blood samples versus Peripheral
      Blood Mononuclear cell(s) (PBMCs), will also be compared.

          -  History of TB disease.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  QuantiFERON® TB Gold positive test result.

          -  History of medically confirmed autoimmune disease.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  History of any reaction of hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.
