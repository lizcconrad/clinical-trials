  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of sequential
      administration of CVP x 6 followed by tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab (formerly
      referred to as tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab). All patients who complete three
      cycles of CVP, regardless of response, will be eligible for treatment with tositumomab and
      iodine I 131 tositumomab. Subjects who have rapidly progressive disease prior to completing
      three cycles of CVP may be removed from study.

      In order to proceed to tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab therapy, patients must have
      completed six cycles of CVP within 20 weeks as described. Patients may proceed to Iodine-131
      Anti-B1 Antibody if they have progressive disease documented at the response evaluation
      following 6 cycles of CVP. In addition, patients must still meet the eligibility inclusion
      exclusion criteria based upon the week 20 assessments, as applicable. Patients must also have
      an average of ≤25% bone marrow involved by NHL to receive treatment with tositumomab and
      iodine I 131 tositumomab. The dosimetric dose of tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab
      must be given within 28 days of the response evaluation following CVP and no later than 56
      days from the first day of the sixth cycle of CVP.

      This is a phase II, open-label, multicenter study of the efficacy and safety sequential
      administration of cycolophosphamide, vacristine, and prednisone (CVP) x6 cycles followed by
      tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab for previously untreated subjects with low-grade
      Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). CVP will be repeated every 21 days for a total of six cycles.
      tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab will begin within 56 days following the first day of
      the sixth cycle of CVP. Subjects will undergo two dosing phase for the tositumomab and iodine
      I 131 tositumomab therapy. In the first phase, &quot;dosimetric dose&quot;, patients will receive an
      infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450mg) over 60 minutes followed by a 30 minute
      infusion (including a 10-minutes flush) of Anti-B1 (35mg) containing 5mCi of Iodine-131.
      Whole body gamma camera scans will be obtained on Day 0; Day 2, 3, or 4 and Day 6 or 7
      following the dosimetric dose. Using the dosimetric data from three time points, a
      patient-specific dose of Iodine-131 will be calculated to deliver the desired total body dose
      of radiotherapy. In the second phase, termed the &quot;therapeutic dose&quot;, patients will receive
      60-minute infusion of unlabeled Anti-B1 Antibody (450 mg) followed by a 30-minute infusion
      (including a 10-minute flush) of 35 mg Anti-B1 Antibody labeled with the subjects -specific
      dose of Iodine-131 calculate to deliver a 75cGy total body radiation dose. Subjects who have
      platelet counts of 100,000-149,999 cells/mm3 will receive 65 cGy; obese patients will be
      dosed base upon 137% of their lean body mass. Subjects will be treated with saturated
      solution potassium iodide (SSKI), Lugol's solution, or potassium iodide tablets starting at
      least 24 hours prior to the first infusion of the tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab
      (i.e., the dosimetric dose) and continuing for 14 days following the least infusion of
      tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab (i.e., the therapeutic dose).

        <title>Time to Progression of Disease or Death, as Assessed by the Investigator</title>
        <description>Time to progression or progression-free survival is defined as the time from the dosimetric dose to the first documented occurrence of disease progression or death. Disease progression is defined as a &gt;=50% increase from the nadir value (lowest laboratory value recorded following administration of the study medication) of the sum of the products of the longest perpendicular diameters of all measurable lesions or the appearance of any new lesion. Individual lesions must be &gt;1.5 cm in diameter by radiographic evaluation or &gt;1 cm in diameter by physical examination.</description>

        <title>Total Body Residence Time (TBRT; Average Amount of Time TST Spends in the Body, Calculated From the Rate of TB Clearance of Radioactivity During the Dosimetric Dose [DD]) of Iodine 131 TST Antibody Following the DD</title>
        <description>To determine TBRT, the percent-injected activity (PIA) is calculated from the background-corrected (BC) total body count (TBC) at D 0; D 2/3/4; and D 7. The time from the DD to the acquisition of whole body count (WBC) is then determined. The PIA remaining at each time point (TP) is then calculated by dividing the BC WBC for that TP by the BC WBC from the first TP (D 0) * 100. To determine RT, a best-fit line from 100% (pre-plotted D 0 value) through 2 plotted points (other TPs) is made. TBRT=the x-axis value at the point where the line intersects the horizontal 37% injected activity line.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With the Indicated Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs Possibly or Probably Related to Study Drug</title>
        <description>AEs were graded using the Common Toxicity Criteria from the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, Division of Cancer Therapy, National Cancer Institute. Grades: 0 = No AE or within normal limits; 1 = Mild AE; 2 = Moderate AE; 3 = Severe and undesirable AE; 4 = Life-threatening or disabling AE; 5 = Death related to AE. The Investigator assessed whether the AE was possibly or probably related to study drug. In addition, all laboratory-derived hematologic toxicities (values outside the normal range) were assumed to be possibly or probably related to study drug.</description>
        <time_frame>Par. were evaluated until death/disease progression or for 2 years in Study BEX104514. Par. who completed 2 years in Study BEX104514 were followed in Study BEX104528 for up to 130 months. Data are included from Study BEX104514 and Study BEX104528.</time_frame>

            <description>Par. received 6 cycles of chemo.: oral Cyclophosphamide (400 mg/m^2/day) for 1-5 days; IV Vincristine (1.4 mg/m^2) on Day 1; oral Prednisone (100 mg/m^2/day) for 1-5 days. Par. received the DD 4-8 weeks after Day 1 of Cycle 6 of chemo. Unlabeled TST (450 mg) was infused IV for 1 hour prior to a 30 minute infusion of 35 mg TST trace labeled with 5 mCi Iodine 131. Par. received 4 DBM TID of KI and 20 DBM TID Lugol's solution or KI tablets (130 mg BM, daily) &gt;=24 hours prior to DD administration.Treatment continued daily for 14 days after the TD: a 1 hour IV infusion of 450 mg TST, followed by an infusion of 35 mg TST radiolabeled with Iodine I 131 to deliver a 75 centiGray total body radiation dose. Par. completing 2 years of the study could enter a 10-year Long-Term Follow-Up study (BEX104528) in which no study medication was given.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Were Negative for Human Anti-murine Antibodies (HAMA) at Baseline (Study Entry) But Positive or Negative at Month 24</title>
        <description>The administration of murine antibodies may form HAMA. A HAMA assay was performed using the ImmunoSTRIP HAMA IgG enzyme-linked immune absorbent assay by a central laboratory (Covance Classic Laboratory Services, Indianapolis, IN). To be &quot;positive,&quot; a participant had to have a positive HAMA assessment during the first 24 months.</description>
