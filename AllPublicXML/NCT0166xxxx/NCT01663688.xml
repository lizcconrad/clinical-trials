    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to collect and evaluate the data from eye scans using
      an investigational three-dimensional eye imaging photography device called the Nidek Optical
      Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000. OCT stands for Optical Coherence Tomography, a technique
      that uses invisible wavelengths of light to make detailed images of the tissues at the back
      of the eye. These images provide information that physicians may use to help diagnose eye
      conditions and/or to monitor changes in the eye during treatment.

      This is a prospective, open-labeled, multi-center clinical study. After qualifying
      examination of a subject, 3D retinal measurement in the proximity of the optic disc and the
      macula are carried out for eligible subjects with normal eyes using an investigational
      three-dimensional eye imaging photography device called the Nidek Optical Coherence
      Tomography (OCT) RS-3000. The primary objective of this clinical study is to develop
      age-specific normal ranges for the thickness of the retina and retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) etc. using the Nidek Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) RS-3000 with normative
      database. The secondary objective is to evaluate any adverse events found during the clinical
      study.
