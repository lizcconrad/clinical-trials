  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Common mental illness, such as anxiety disorders and depression, is the main
      cause for sick leave in Sweden. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) has been shown to be
      effective in alleviating target symptoms of these disorders, but its effect on sick leave
      rates has not been sufficiently addressed. The investigators have developed an intervention
      called return to work (RTW), which is based in cognitive behavioral theory, that has a
      primary aim of helping sick-listed patients with common mental illness return to work. This
      new treatment has not been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.

      Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of CBT and RTW for subclinical
      common mental illness in a randomized controlled trial conducted in primary care.
      Participants will be randomized to diagnosis specific CBT (n=50), RTW (n=50. Main outcomes
      are days of sick leave and clinician severity rating of psychiatric symptoms. This study
      could contribute to new knowledge regarding how to best treat patients on sick leave with
      mild common mental illness.

    <description>As the trial will include several different common subclinical mental disorders, the cognitive behavior therapy used in the study will be based on the protocols with best empirical support. Cognitive behavior therapy entails psychoeducational components, i.e. the patient is learns about the disorder and how to view it from a cognitive behavioral perspective. The most important part of the treatment is systematic behavior changes often targeted at exposure to feared stimuli. This is combined with cognitive interventions targeted at challenging negative automatic thoughts. All treatments will be delivered by licensed psychologists.</description>
