  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are epithelial carcinomas with a high
      frequency of EGF-R expression. EGFR is an important regulator of tumour progression and
      proliferation in several types of cancer. Mechanism of action of Lapatinib in the EGFR and/or
      HER2 expressing oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells is attributed to inhibition
      of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Based on the data from oesophageal SCCs the
      investigators hypothesise that EGFR signalling pathway and its interactions play an important
      role in the SCC pathogenesis and represent a good therapeutic target from these tumours.

      Primary Objectives:

      To evaluate the tumour response macroscopically in patients with primary cutaneous SCC
      lesions and in concomitant SCC in situ (AK).

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate tolerability of a single dose regimen of systemic lapatinib therapy in
           patients with SCC as measured by time to first AE or SAE within the study period.

        -  To investigate the molecular tumour response of squamous cell carcinoma lesions in
           patients under lapatinib treatment using a set of variables.
