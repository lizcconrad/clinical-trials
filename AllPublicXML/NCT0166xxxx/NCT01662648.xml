  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone
      extended-release (ER) in participants with schizophrenia (psychiatric disorder with symptoms
      of emotional instability, detachment from reality, often with delusions and hallucinations,
      and withdrawal into the self) who were previously unsuccessfully treated with other oral
      antipsychotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm (one group of participants), multi-center, 6-month study to explore the
      tolerability, safety and efficacy of flexibly dosed paliperidone ER in participants with
      schizophrenia previously unsuccessfully treated with an oral antipsychotic medication.
      Antipsychotic medications are drugs that are helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a
      capacity to ameliorate thought disorders. Unsuccessfully treated means that, despite the
      participant was treated with an adequate dose of an appropriate oral antipsychotic for an
      adequate period of time, previous treatment is considered unsuccessful due to lack of
      efficacy, lack of tolerability or safety, lack of compliance and/or other reasons. Throughout
      the study the investigators will adjust the dosage of each participant based on the
      individual needs. In general, the recommended paliperidone ER dose will be 6 milligram once
      daily. Participants can be either in- or outpatients and they may take their study drug with
      or without food. Participants who will complete this 6-month study and would like to continue
      will be eligible to be enrolled in an extension phase until paliperidone ER is available.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening. Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Positive Subscale Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Positive Subscale of PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) assesses seven positive-symptoms of schizophrenia. Positive symptoms refer to an excess of or distortion of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Negative Subscale Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The Negative Subscale of PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) assesses seven negative-symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) Score at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI rating scale is a 7-point global assessment that measures the clinician's impression of the severity of illness exhibited by a participant. A rating of 1 indicates to &quot;normal, not at all ill&quot; and a rating of 7 indicates &quot;among the most extremely ill participants&quot;. Higher scores indicate worsening. Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Sleep Quality at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale that rates how well participants sleep. Participants indicated on the scale (from 0 to 100 millimeter) how well they have slept in the previous 7 days (from 0: &quot;very badly&quot; to 100: &quot;very well&quot;). Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Daytime Drowsiness at Week 26</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Daytime Drowsiness was assessed by an 11-point visual analog scale that rates how well participants sleep. Participants indicated on the scale (from 0 to 100 millimeter) how often they have felt drowsy within the previous 7 days (from 0: &quot;not at all&quot; to 100:&quot;all the time&quot;). Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at Week 26</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening. Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PANSS Total Negative Subscale Score at Week 26</title>
        <description>The Negative Subscale of PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) assesses seven negative-symptoms of schizophrenia. Negative symptoms represent a diminution or loss of normal functions. The symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale, ranging from 7 (absent) to 49 (extreme psychopathology). Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline and Week 26</time_frame>
        <population>ITT population for efficacy included all the participants who received paliperidone ER at least once and who had at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment. &quot;N&quot; (number of participants analyzed) signifies the participants evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Personal and Social Performance (PSP) Scale at Week 26</title>
        <description>The PSP scale assesses the degree of dysfunction within 4 domains of behavior: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behavior. The score ranges from 1 to 100, divided into 10 equal intervals to rate the degree of difficulty (1, absent to 6, very severe) in each of the 4 domains. Participants with a score of 71 to 100 have a mild degree of difficulty; from 31 to 70, varying degrees of disability; less or equal to 30, functioning so poorly as to require intensive supervision. Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>

Data for two groups is presented here, based on the reason to switch: lack of efficacy and lack of tolerability, compliance or other who switched from other previous antipsychotic drugs to paliperidone.</description>
          <population>ITT population for efficacy included all the participants who received paliperidone ER at least once and who had at least 1 post baseline efficacy assessment. &quot;N&quot; (number of participants analyzed) signifies the participants evaluable for this measure and 'n' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure at given time points.</population>
