  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain and discomfort after anterior cervical spine surgery is difficult to quantify and quoted
      as moderate in severity, often needing oral opioid analgesics. In addition, these patients
      are more prone for postoperative respiratory complication due to airway edema secondary to
      surgical retraction or wound hematoma. Opioid analgesics provide good pain control but
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and respiratory depression are undesirable in these
      patients who are at risk for postoperative wound hematoma and airway edema The use of
      multimodal analgesia is rapidly becoming the 'standard of care' for preventing pain after
      ambulatory procedures at most surgery centers throughout the world . The purpose of this
      study is to determine whether superficial cervical plexus block will improve the
      postoperative quality of recovery as measured by Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire
      (QoR-40) in patients undergoing elective anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion is increasingly being done as a day surgery or short
      stay surgery. Postoperative pain is the leading cause of unplanned hospital admissions
      following day surgery, a major source of dissatisfaction and often impairs the quality of
      recovery. Opioid analgesics alone are not always effective and may also worsen the
      postoperative nausea and vomiting and in turn the postoperative recovery. This study is
      designed to find out if an injection of freezing on the side of neck around the nerves
      (superficial cervical plexus block) improves the quality of recovery from anesthesia and
      surgery by reducing the pain, analgesic consumption after anterior cervical spine surgery.

      Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure is the global QoR-40 aggregate score at
      24 hours after surgery.

      Secondary Outcome Measures

        -  Postoperative pain scores (first 24 hours)

        -  Total analgesic consumption (first 24 hours)

        -  Time for first opioid administration

        -  Postop Nausea and vomiting (first 24 hours)

        -  Post operative sedation (first 24 hours)
