  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of ths study was to evaluate the glycemic index and glycemic response of food and
      products that produced in Tiwan. The food and product are in includes local produced fruits,
      starchy food and bread made from resistant starch.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low glycemic index (GI) diets have protective and therapeutic potential for diabetic patients
      and general public. With recent recognition of resistant starch (RS), an indigestible
      fraction which has postprandial glucose lowering effects, the addition of resistant starch in
      bread may alter its glycemic effects and thus glycemic index. Therefore, the objectives of
      this study were to investigate the glycemic index, glycemic reponse of Taiwan local food and
      effects of resistant starch in bread formulation.

    <description>White bread was the reference food (GI = 100%) against which all test foods were compared. Subjects arrived at the laboratory at eight to nine o'clock in the morning after 10-12 h overnight fast. Each subject was fed equivalent 50 g available carbohydrate of test foods or reference food in random order. To minimize day to day variation of glucose tolerance, the reference food was tested in triplicate in each subject. All test and reference foods were served with 220 mL of water. An automatic lancet device (Safe-T-Pro Diagnostics GmbH Mannheim, Germany) was used to collect finger capillary blood samples (1.5 mL). Blood samples were taken immediately before the start of the study (0 min) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start of eating.</description>
