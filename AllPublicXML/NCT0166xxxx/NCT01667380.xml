      This observational study will evaluate the use and efficacy of Mircera (methoxy polyethylene
      glycol-epoetin beta) in anemia patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage III-IV not on
      dialysis or CKD stage V on dialysis. Patients will be followed during 12 months of treatment.
