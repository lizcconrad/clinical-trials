  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer patients with metastases (mCRC) at response under expensive chemotherapy
      which may be toxic +/- exhausting are candidates for an effective and more convenient
      maintenance treatment.

      Objectives:

        1. To define the efficacy of maintenance chemotherapy by a low-dose metronomic (LDM)
           regimen, in metastatic CRC patients responding under FOLFIRI + bevacizumab.

        2. To discover predictive factors for response to this LDM regimen.

      Hypothesis:

        1. The re-growth of residual metastases can be slowed by the anti-angiogenic effects of LDM
           chemotherapy.

        2. Serial measurements of angiogenic/ inflammatory factors in the plasma and/or evaluation
           of certain enzymes in the tumor may discover predictive factors of response to LDM
           chemotherapy in metastatic CRC patients.

      At entry to the research protocol the up-till then administered treatment with Intra Venous
      FOLFIRI+BEVACIZUMAB will be stopped.Instead, the research oral treatment will be initiated to
      be taken daily on an ambulatory basis and under once monthly re-evaluation. If and when
      disease progresses the original FOLFIRI+BEVACIZUMAB treatment will be considered for
      re-institution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologic (or cytologic) proof of colorectal carcinoma (CRC).

          2. Age: between 18 and 80.

          3. Sex: both sexes.

          4. Previous treatment for metastatic disease is limited to FOLFIRI+ bevacizumab.

          5. Prior adjuvant chemotherapy, with a fluoropyrimidine and/or Oxaliplatin, is allowed.

          6. Prior radiotherapy, either as adjuvant treatment or palliation of metastatic sites is
