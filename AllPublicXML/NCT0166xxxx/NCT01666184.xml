      Study Design:

      Patients are eligible if (1) enrolled to TCOG 3207(2) received surgery or biopsy for
      pancreatic cancer; (3) willing to sign informed consent.

      The pancreatic tumor, tissue specimen and blood sample before or after treatment will be
      collected from department of pathology, surgery or diagnostic medicine.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We expect to collect tissue samples from 270 pancreatic cancer patients of any stages. Since
      the enrollment criteria are not limited to new patients, we expect to enroll 67 patients a
      year. The patient enrollment will be completed in 4 years. Clinical follow-up will be
      completed in another one year. Data analysis and correlation study may be finished in the end
      of 5th year of this study.

        We expect to collect tissue samples from 270 pancreatic cancer patients of resectable
        pancreatic cancer. Since the enrollment criteria are not limited to new patients, we expect
        to enroll 67 patients a year. The patient enrollment will be completed in 4 years. Clinical
        follow-up will be completed in another one year. Data analysis and correlation study may be
