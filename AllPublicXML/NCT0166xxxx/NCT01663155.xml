      The investigators would like to see if lung cancer screening with chest x-rays,computer aided
      detection (CAD)and a lose dose CT scan can detect lung cancer in early stages when it is more
      responsive to treatment. The investigators would also like to see if early detection will
      reduce the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung cancer compared to no screening in former
      and current smokers with or without a family history of lung cancer who are 40-75 years old.

      The fight against lung cancer is waged on three major fronts: prevention, detection and
      treatment. Our goal is to determine if chest x-rays,computer aided detection (CAD)and a CT
      scan can detect disease earlier when treatment is more effective. If we improve the detection
      of disease, we will see if screening reduces the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung
      cancer relative to no screening in people at high risk to develop lung cancer.
