  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that insulin glulisine is non-inferior to currently proven rapid-acting
      insulin lispro when used in a basal/bolus regimen to treat hyperglycemia in patients with
      gestational diabetes mellitus.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To date, only two rapid-acting insulin analogs have been shown to be safe and effective for
      the treatment of diabetes during pregnancy: insulin aspart and insulin lispro.

      The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of insulin glulisine are unique and insulin
      glulisine may be the best rapid-acting analog for the treatment of post-prandial
      hyperglycemia. We believe that insulin glulisine should be evaluated in women with
      gestational diabetes for its potential efficacy.
