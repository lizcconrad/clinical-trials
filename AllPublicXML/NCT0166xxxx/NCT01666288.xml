    <textblock>
      Anaphylaxis is defined as a serious allergic reaction mediated by IgE that is often difficult
      to diagnose due to the wide heterogeneity of clinical manifestations. The inciting agent is
      often difficult to pinpoint and may include food, environmental allergens in patients
      undergoing allergen immunotherapy, insect stings, and medications. Evidence of allergy by
      demonstration of a positive skin test to the inciting agent, is helpful only if skin testing
      is available. The only diagnostic modality that is useful in the diagnosis of anaphylaxis
      when IgE skin testing is not available and the inciting agent is unknown, is an elevated
      serum tryptase level. However, a diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be made without a tryptase
      level or if the tryptase level is normal. A simple, non-invasive test for patients with
      anaphylaxis is not currently available and would be helpful to diagnose and to guide further
      management options.

      Patients who develop anaphylaxis to environmental allergens or venoms during routine
      outpatient subcutaneous allergen or venom immunotherapy are an ideal population to study as
      we are able to evaluate these specific reactions in a controlled, clinical environment.
      Although anaphylaxis is uncommon, the incidence has been estimated to vary between 0.01 and 4
      percent of all allergy injections. Subcutaneous allergen or venom immunotherapies are a well
      established form of therapy for patients with allergic rhinitis, allergic asthma, or a
      confirmed sensitivity to stinging insects. Serial blood sampling can be performed in this
      group of patients during a reaction and at baseline one week after a reaction, thereby
      allowing each patient to serve as his or her own biological control.

      Metabolomics is the study of metabolic pathways and the unique biochemical molecules which
      result from the regulatory response to physiological stressors, disease processes, drug
      therapy, or allergen or venom immunotherapy. By measuring changes in metabolite
      concentrations, the range of biochemical effects and therapeutic intervention can be
      determined.

      The investigator plans to use metabolic profiling of blood samples collected at the time of
      anaphylaxis and one week after, to see if a simple, non-invasive test for patients with
      anaphylaxis could be developed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males and females age 18-75 who are receiving routine outpatient subcutaneous allergen
             and/or venom immunotherapy and who meet the World Allergy Organization (WAO) criteria
             for anaphylaxis (below):

        Has at least ONE of the following three criteria:

          1. Acute onset of an illness with involvement of the skin, mucosal tissue, or both (eg,
             generalized urticaria, itching or flushing, swollen lips-tongue-uvula)

             AND AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

             A) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF,
             hypoxemia) B) Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms of end-organ dysfunction
             (eg. Hypotonia, collapse, syncope, incontinence)

             OR

          2. Two or more of the following that occur rapidly after exposure to a known allergen for
             that patient

             A) Involvement of the skin-mucosal tissue (eg, generalized urticaria, itch-flush,
             swollen lips-tongue-uvula)

             B) Respiratory compromise (eg, dyspnea, wheeze-bronchospasm, stridor, reduced PEF,
             hypoxemia)

             C) Reduced blood pressure or associated symptoms (eg, hypotonia, collapse,, syncope,
             incontinence)

             D) Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, crampy abdominal pain, vomiting)

             OR

          3. Reduced blood pressure after exposure to known allergen for that patient with systolic
             blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or greater than 30% decrease from that person's
             baseline

             venom immunotherapy.
