  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To test the hypothesis that two 40 gm serving of Oat-based breakfast cereals compared to an
      equicaloric amount of a ready-to-eat Oat-based breakfast cereal will give greater satiety
      over the 4 hour period following breakfast.

    <textblock>
      The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of these three breakfasts and then given a
      Visual analogue scales of hunger and satiety which will be completed at baseline, 30, 60,
      120, 180, and 240 minutes. Subjects will return on 2 other days separated by at least a week
      to repeat the breakfast test.
