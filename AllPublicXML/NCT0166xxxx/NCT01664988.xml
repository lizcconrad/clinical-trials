    <textblock>
      Gestational hypertension is the main cause of maternal and fetal mortality, however, it has
      no definite effective treatment. nowadays, the stress management approaches are use for
      essential hypertension. So, this study aimed is study the effect of progressive muscular
      relaxation and breathing control technique on blood pressure during pregnancy.

      this 3-groups clinical trial has been done in Mashhad Health Centers and Governmental
      hospitals. 60 pregnant women with systolic blood pressure less than 135 mm Hg or diastolic
      blood pressure more than 85 mm Hg who met inclusion criteria were assigned into three groups
      of progressive muscular relaxation, breathing control and control. In tow experiment groups,
      exercises were controlled by one day personally and the rest by CD, BP before and after
      interventions was controlled for 4 weeks. In control group blood pressure was measured before
      and after 15 minutes with no intervention.
