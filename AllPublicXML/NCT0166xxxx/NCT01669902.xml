  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter observational study will evaluate the use of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab)
      in monotherapy in patients with active moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis unable to use
      methotrexate. Eligible patients initiated on RoActemra/Actemra treatment will be followed for
      6 months.

    <measure>Swollen Joint Count (SJC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of swollen joints was determined by examination of 28 joints and identifying when swelling was present. The number of swollen joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit, no swelling = 0, swelling =1; total was calculated by adding all the joints for a maximum score of 28. A reduction in number of swollen joints compared to baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Tender Joint Count (TJC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Number of tender joints was determined by examining 28 joints and identified the joints that were painful under pressure or to passive motion. The number of tender joints was recorded on the joint assessment form at each visit, no tenderness = 0, tenderness = 1; total was calculated by adding all the joints for a maximum score of 28. A reduction in number of tender joints compared to baseline indicates improvement.</description>

    <measure>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and C-Reactive Protein (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [CRP])</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, CRP (milligram per liter [mg/L]) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter [mm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated using the following formula: DAS28-4 (CRP) = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*PtGA + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 10, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) less than or equal to (&lt;= 3.2) implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

DAS28-4 (ESR) = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.70*ln(ESR) + 0.014*PtGA. Total score range: 0-10, higher score=more disease activity.

        <title>Disease Activity Score Based on 28-Joints Count and C-Reactive Protein (4 Variables) (DAS28-4 [CRP])</title>
        <description>DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from the SJC and TJC using the 28 joints count, CRP (milligram per liter [mg/L]) and patient global assessment (PtGA) of disease activity (measured on a 0 to 100 millimeter [mm] Visual Analog Scale [VAS]) where 0=no disease activity and 100=worst disease activity). DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated using the following formula: DAS28-4 (CRP) = 0.56*square root (sqrt) (TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.014*PtGA + 0.96. Total score range: 0 to 10, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) less than or equal to (&lt;= 3.2) implied low disease activity and greater than (&gt;) 3.2 to 5.1 implied moderate to high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) less than (&lt;) 2.6 = clinical remission.</description>

Good responders: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &lt;= 3.2; moderate responders: change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 in the range of &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or change from baseline in the range of &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 in the range of &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1 or change from baseline &gt;1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1 or change from baseline in the range of &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 &lt;=3.2; non-responders: change from baseline &lt;= 0.6 or change from baseline in the range of &gt;0.6 to &lt;=1.2 with DAS28 &gt;5.1 or change from baseline &lt;=0.6 with DAS28 &lt;=3.2 or in the range of &gt;3.2 to &lt;=5.1.</description>

CDAI &lt;= 2.8 indicates clinical remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 = low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 = high (or severe) disease activity.</description>

        <description>HAQ-DI: participant-reported assessment of ability to perform tasks in 8 categories of daily living activities: dress/groom; arise; eat; walk; reach; grip; hygiene; and common activities over past week. Each item scored on 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0=no difficulty; 1=some difficulty; 2=much difficulty; 3=unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered.
