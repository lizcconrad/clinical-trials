  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to check blood and urine levels to further define markers/tests
      in the blood and urine that would be useful in following patients with obstructive sleep
      apnea and then to see if by wearing CPAP every night, these markers can be reduced. This
      research is being done because currently there are no effective blood or urine markers to
      determine how well CPAP is working.

      The goal of this study is to further define biomarkers that would be useful in following
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea and examining their response to compliance to therapy
      with CPAP. To date no correlation between biomarkers of oxidative stress and compliance to
      CPAP has been measured. CPAP is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and
      has been show to reduce blood pressure and decrease oxidative stress.
