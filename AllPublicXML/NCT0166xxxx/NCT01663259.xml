    <textblock>
      Taking into account the excellent prognosis of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal
      cancer with &lt; 10 pack-year smoking, the investigators hypothesize that reducing the intensity
      of therapy for these patients will reduce treatment sequelae, notably long-term dysphagia,
      without affecting their cure rates. The main Aim is to assess whether reducing treatment
      intensity, by replacing concurrent chemotherapy with cetuximab, will indeed achieve improved
      long-term toxicity.

      The primary objectives include the following: to confirm that reducing treatment intensity in
      patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer and &lt; 10 pack-year smoking history by
      replacing concurrent chemotherapy with concurrent cetuximab, does not significantly increase
      the proportion of patients whose tumors recur, compared to our previous experience in similar
      patients receiving chemo-RT and to compare the toxicity in patients receiving cetuximab-RT to
      similar patients treated with 7 weeks of chemotherapy concurrent with RT (&quot;standard therapy&quot;)
      in UMCC 2-21.

    <textblock>
      The investigators have shown in past experience a high success in getting rid of
      oropharyngeal cancer (tonsil or base of tongue cancer) using chemotherapy and radiation
      therapy in patients who have not smoked, or only smoked a minimal amount of cigarettes or
      equivalent. In these patients, the cancer is thought to be caused by a virus (Human Papilloma
      Virus, or HPV). HPV is a virus that infects the epidermis (outermost layer of skin) and
      mucous membranes of humans. In general, patients with HPV-related cancer such as yours have a
      better prognosis compared with patients whose tumors are smoking-related. Taking into account
      the good prognosis, it is possible that reducing the intensity of therapy will not affect the
      high rate of tumor control, while reducing the side-effects of therapy. In this study, the
      investigators plan to reduce the intensity of treatment by replacing the currently used
      chemotherapy drugs with an FDA approved drug, cetuximab, which is a monoclonal antibody to a
      growth factor which helps cancer cells grow. By opposing the effect of the growth factor,
      cetuximab may help radiotherapy kill cancer cells without a lot of effect on the normal
      tissue. It differs from chemotherapy in its more selective activity against tumors compared
      to normal tissue Cetuximab has the chance to preserve the high rate of success in killing the
      tumor but may reduce the side effects and complications of therapy in comparison to
      chemotherapy drugs.

      The investigators would also like to know if taking cetuximab has any effect on certain
      cancer-related molecules in the cancer and the normal cells inside the cheek. They would like
      to test this by taking a small biopsy of the tumor, as well as a swab of the inside of the
      cheek, before and shortly after the start of therapy.

    <description>Before Radiotherapy patients you will receive a single loading dose of cetuximab. Patients will also have two additional biopsies before and after cetuximab to determine how the tumor is affected. A Cetuximab infusion will also be delivered once a week during radiotherapy.Radiation will be started (70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks to the gross tumor, 50-60 Gy to subclinical target volumes) five days a week until the total dose of radiation prescribed by the doctor is reached. Radiation will be delivered concurrent with weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2, delivered on Monday or Tuesday each week. In order to evaluate swallowing problems from radiotherapy, patients will undergo an evaluation of swallowing by videofluoroscopy (VF). Quality of Life questionnaires will be given before therapy and periodically up to 36 months after therapy. In order to assess if the tumor was completely eradicated, CT-PET scan will be performed 3 months after the completion of therapy.</description>
