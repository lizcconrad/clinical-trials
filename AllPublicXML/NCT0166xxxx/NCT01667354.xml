      The primary aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of an intervention to train
      primary care physicians to determine if it leads to decreased parental vaccine hesitancy. The
      investigators will train primary care teams with an initial training followed by telephone
      coaching and follow-up visits, and assess the outcomes of parental vaccine hesitancy
      (primary) and physician self-efficacy (secondary) at baseline and 6 months.

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Parental Hesitancy at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will contact mothers of newborns in study practices and conduct a telephone survey at two time points: baseline and 6 months. Surveys will assess parental hesitancy, parental trust in provider, and other covariates such as perceived social norms, other sources of information about vaccines, and demographic information.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from Baseline in Physician Attitudes at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed via self-administered surveys of providers in all participating clinics at baseline and 6-months. The investigators will measure physician attitudes, perceived norms, intentions to change behavior, practice characteristics, and physician demographics.</description>
