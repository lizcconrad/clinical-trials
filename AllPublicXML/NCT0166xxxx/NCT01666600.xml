  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with glioblastoma at first or second progression who have failed standard treatment
      that must have included radiochemotherapy with temozolomide and who are a candidate for a
      reirradiation can be included into the trial. In the phase I part the minimal tolerated dose
      (MTD)of BIBF 1120 in combination with radiotherapy will be investigated. Subjects in phase II
      will be randomised to receive reirradiation alone or reirradiation + 2 x MTD BIBF1120.
