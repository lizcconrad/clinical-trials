  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to to retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of the MWCC Jump
      Start (Medifast's 5 &amp; 1) Plan on the following indices: weight loss, anthropometric changes,
      and reduction in common markers of coronary heart disease.

      Portion-controlled meal replacements by themselves have been shown to be an effective weight
      control strategy in overweight and obese individuals. The addition of medical supervision has
      been shown to result in greater weight loss than meal replacements alone. MWCC provides this
      added support through individual weekly counseling sessions. Thus, the investigators plan to
      retrospectively evaluate the efficacy of the MWCC Jump Start (Medifast's 5 &amp; 1) Plan on the
      following indices: weight loss, anthropometric changes, and reduction in common markers of
      coronary heart disease.
