  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by chronic inflammation of the liver, interface
      hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and the presence of autoantibodies. Disease presentation
      is varied but typically is based on characteristic aminotransferase elevations, histological
      abnormalities, elevated levels of serum globulins, and the presence of one or more
      autoantibodies. Two types of juvenile AIH have been identified according to seropositivity
      for smooth muscle and /or antinuclear antibody (AIH type 1) or liver kidney microsomal
      antibody (AIH type 2). Standard therapy in clinic consists of a combination of
      corticosteroids and azathioprine, which displays the efficacy in 80% of patients. However, 7%
      of patients deteriorate despite compliance with the standard corticosteroid regiments
      (treatment failure),13% of patients improve but not to a degree that satisfies remission
      criteria (incomplete response), 13% of patients develop serious drug-induced complications,
      and 50%-86% of patients will relapse after drug withdrawal. These serious drawbacks
      counterbalance the benefits of conventional therapy, and they are compelling reasons to
      refine current treatment strategies and pursue alternative therapies. UC-MSC has been the
      application for the treatment of several severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune
      thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.
      In this study, the safety and efficacy of UC-MSC transplantation for AIH patients will be
      evaluated.

      Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an immune-mediated necroinflammatory disease of the liver
      characterized by elevation of IgG, presence of characteristic autoantibodies, and
      histological feature of interface hepatitis. Standard therapy consists of a combination of
      corticosteroids and azathioprine, which is efficacious in 80% of patients. However, current
      treatment strategies are complicated by frequent relapse after drug withdrawal, medication
      intolerance, and refractory disease. Alternative medical therapy may be need for AIH.

      The potential for stem cells to differentiate into hepatocytes cells was recently confirmed.
      In particular, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC) transplantation has been
      applicated in the clinic for treat several human disease such as GVHD, cardiac injury and
      brain injury, and displayed good tolerance and efficiency. Recently, umbilical cord-derived
      MSCs (UC-MSC) has also been used to treat severe autoimmune diseases, such as immune
      thrombocytopenia, systemic lupus erythematosus, and therapy-resistant rheumatoid arthritis.

      The purpose of this study is to learn whether and how UC-MSC can improve the disease
      condition in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This study will also look at how well
      UC-MSC is tolerated and its safety in AIH patients

      Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms:

      Arm A: Participants will receive 12 weeks of UC-MSC treatment plus conventional treatment
      (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine) Arm B: Participants will receive 12 weeks
      of placebo plus conventional treatment. (combination of corticosteroids and azathioprine)
      UC-MSC will be prepared according to standard procedures and is collected in plastic bags
      containing anticoagulant. UC-MSCs are given via i.v. under sonography monitoring. After cell
      therapy, patients are followed up at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96. The evaluation of some
      clinical parameters such as the level of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), γ-globulin, total bilirubin (TB), prothrombin time (PT), albumin
      (ALB), prealbumin (PA) and IgG, are detected at these time points. MELD score, Liver
      histology, treatment side effects, relapse rate and clinical symptoms were also observed
      simultaneously.
