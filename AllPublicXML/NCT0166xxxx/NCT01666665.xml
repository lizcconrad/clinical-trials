  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Massive pediatric burns are associated with a persistent and sustained hypermetabolic
      response characterized by elevated levels of circulating catecholamine's, cortisol, and
      glucagon's, which can cause extreme muscle wasting, immunodeficiency, and delay in wound
      healing. Insulin and metformin have demonstrated anabolic activity with minimal associated
      side effects. However, it is unknown whether the beneficial effects arise from tight
      euglycemic control or direct effect of insulin action. We hypothesize that during acute
      hospitalization, administration of metformin at a dose titrated to maintain blood glucose
      between 80-180 mg/dl will accelerate wound healing and recovery in children with severe
      thermal injury and will have beneficial long-term effects on muscle strength, immune
      function, and wound healing.

      Metformin treated patients will be compared to control patients. Both groups will receive
      insulin therapy for blood glucose &gt;180mg/dl. Insulin will be titrated according to hospital
      sliding scale.

      The use of insulin or metformin will benefit burned children by improving muscle protein
      build-up, speeding wound healing and reversing growth arrest, improving the immune response,
      and positively affecting long-term rehabilitation.

      The results of this study may initiate a change in standard of care as it is found that
      simply the reduction of blood glucose by metformin, improves patient outcomes as metformin
      can be administered without the added complication of hypoglycemia.
