    <textblock>
      Appropriate initial antibiotic treatment based on early diagnosis of etiology will improve
      the outcome of sepsis. The incidence rates of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, which are
      different between countries, will affect the accuracy of etiological diagnoses according to
      the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. Therefore the investigators determined the
      accuracy of the ATS criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to MDR bacteria
      in China.

      All data concerning patient characteristics at ICU admission and during ICU stay were
      prospectively collected.Screening for MDR bacteria (using nasal swabs, tracheal aspirates
      from intubated patients and specimens from the infection location) was performed at ICU
      admission and discharge. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDR bacteria were
      recorded, and the accuracy of the ATS criteria in predicting infection or colonization with
      these bacteria at ICU admission was documented. All of the infected patients were treated by
      the attending physician, and the choice and adjustment of antibiotic were in accordance with
      the recommendations of the ATS guidelines.
