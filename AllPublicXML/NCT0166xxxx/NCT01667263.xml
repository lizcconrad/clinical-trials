      Randomized, open-label, multicentre study to compare the efficacy and safety of ATRA plus
      danazol with danazol monotherapy in patients with corticosteroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a severe bleeding disorder. Approximately 2/3 of patients
      achieve remission from first-line therapies. However, the underlying mechanism of
      corticosteroid-resistant or relapsed ITP is not well understood; thus, treatment remains a
      great challenge. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has an immunomodulatory effect on
      haematopoiesis, making it a possible treatment option.

      A multicentre prospective study was performed in non-splenectomized ITP patients who were
      either resistant to a standard dose of corticosteroids or had relapsed. Patients were
      randomized to ATRA+danazol and danazol monotherapy group. Platelet count, bleeding and other
      symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events are also recorded
      throughout the study, in order to compare the efficacy and safety of ATRA plus danazol with
      danazol monotherapy in patients with corticosteroid-resistant/relapsed ITP.
