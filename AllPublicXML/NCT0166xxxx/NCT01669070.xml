  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate dose proportionality of the FF (50 microgram
      (mcg), 100 mcg or 200 mcg), when administered as a single and repeat dose from the NDPI
      containing FF formulated with lactose. In addition, the aim of this study is to determine the
      absolute bioavailability of the FF single strip product using the high strength product
      administered as a single dose with multiple inhalations and using 250 mcg intravenous (IV)
      FF.

      This is a, part-randomized, open-label, 4 way crossover study (4 periods) in healthy adult
      subjects. During each period, subjects will receive FF in the morning and serial
      pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling (for up to 10 days for the inhaled treatment and up to 3 days
      for the IV treatment) and safety assessments will be performed. Each period will be separated
      by a washout period of at least 7 days and a follow-up telephone call will occur 7 -14 days
      after the last dose of study drug. The total duration of the study will be approximately
      13-14 weeks for each subject.
