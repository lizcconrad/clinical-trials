  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if BIBF 1120 can increase the number of women with
      bevacizumab resistant, persistent, or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer who do not progress
      for at least six months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer patients with platinum-resistant and refractory disease have the lowest
      response rates to relapse chemotherapy: various chemotherapeutic agents, such as paclitaxel,
      liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, docetaxel, platinum, etoposide, ifosfamide, gemcitabine,
      and vinorelbine are available but result in response rates of 7-40%. Unfortunately, relapse
      therapy is not curative and treatment is only palliative. Recently two phase II trials
      demonstrated that anti-angiogenic therapy with bevacizumab alone or in combination with
      chemotherapy in women with recurrent disease had response rates ranging from 16-24% with an
      acceptable toxicity profile. However, resistance can develop to VEGF inhibition. Therefore
      other novel anti-angiogenic agents, such as BIBF 1120, should be evaluated in the treatment
      of ovarian cancer.
