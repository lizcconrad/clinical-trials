    <description>Percentage (number) of patients with COPD exacerbation on study was analysed for the combined study.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD with duration of three days or more, requiring a change in treatment where a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms was defined as at least two of the following:
1) Shortness of breath; 2) Sputum production (volume) ; 3) Occurrence of purulent sputum; 4) Cough; 5) Wheezing; 6) Chest tightness.
Onset of exacerbation was defined by the onset of first recorded symptom.The end of exacerbation was decided by the investigator based on clinical judgment.
A required change in treatment included either prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids; and/or a newly prescribed maintenance respiratory medication (i.e., bronchodilators including theophyllines and PDE4-inhibitors).</description>

    <description>Time to event: Time to recovery (EXACT-PRO) was not analysed, only Kaplan Meier curve was plotted.
Time to recovery was assessed with the EXACT-PRO questionnaire. EXACT-PRO total scores were transformed to smooth scores for determining time to recovery and all other endpoints related to the EXACT questionnaire. The day-2 score was transformed to the mean of the total scores recorded on Day 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, each subsequent day's score was transformed to the mean score using a rolling 3-day average.</description>

        <description>Percentage (number) of patients with COPD exacerbation on study was analysed for the combined study.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD with duration of three days or more, requiring a change in treatment where a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms was defined as at least two of the following:
1) Shortness of breath; 2) Sputum production (volume) ; 3) Occurrence of purulent sputum; 4) Cough; 5) Wheezing; 6) Chest tightness.
Onset of exacerbation was defined by the onset of first recorded symptom.The end of exacerbation was decided by the investigator based on clinical judgment.
A required change in treatment included either prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids; and/or a newly prescribed maintenance respiratory medication (i.e., bronchodilators including theophyllines and PDE4-inhibitors).</description>

        <description>Time to event: Time to recovery (EXACT-PRO) was not analysed, only Kaplan Meier curve was plotted.
Time to recovery was assessed with the EXACT-PRO questionnaire. EXACT-PRO total scores were transformed to smooth scores for determining time to recovery and all other endpoints related to the EXACT questionnaire. The day-2 score was transformed to the mean of the total scores recorded on Day 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, each subsequent day’s score was transformed to the mean score using a rolling 3-day average.</description>
