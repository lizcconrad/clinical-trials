  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study by The Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) is to verify if
      individual therapeutic approach taking into account biological and phenotypic differences as
      well as response at the level of minimal residual disease is associated with improved outcome
      of adults with precursor lymphoid neoplasms

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 1997-2010 the PALG run three prospective studies. In the most recent PLAG 5-2007
      protocol attempts have been made to individualize treatment. In particular, stratification to
      high and standard risk group was based on both conventional clinical criteria and the level
      of MRD after induction and consolidation. Patients with unsatisfactory response were referred
      for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). Interim analysis showed
      significant improvement compared to previous PALG 4-2002 protocol with regard to both overall
      survival and leukemia-free survival. The reasons of failure were relapses and non-relapse
      mortality (NRM) associated with alloHSCT.

      In the current protocol we intend to further adjust the therapy for individual patients
      needs. We assume that this way we will be able to reduce the risk of relapse and NRM and
      improve the cure rate. All patients will receive multiagent induction and consolidation
      chemotherapy. The type and intensity of the therapy, as well as indications for allogeneic
      and autologous HSCT will depend on age, status of MRD, immunophenotype and the presence of
      BCR/ABL fusion gene.

    <description>Patients &lt;55 years Ph-neg.: induction (daunorubicin, prednisone, vincristin, PEG-asparaginase), 2nd induction (if non-remission or MRD&gt;0.1%; FLAM, MiniFLAM or FLAM-CAMP dependent on age and phenotype), consolidation (methotrexate, etoposide, cytarabine, cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase). If MRD &lt;0.01%: autoHSCT + maintenance (mercaptopurine, methotrexate) or multiagent maintenance (additionally daunorubicin, vincristin, prednisone); remaining patients: alloHSCT. Prophylaxis of leptomeningeal involvement: liposomal cytarabine intrathecally.
Patients &gt;55 years, Ph-neg.: as above, reduced doses. AlloHSCT with reduced conditioning.
Patients Ph-pos.: as above, reduced doses in combination with continues imatinib. All intended for alloHSCT.</description>
