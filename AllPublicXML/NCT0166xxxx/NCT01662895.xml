    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with deferoxamine mesylate
      is of sufficient promise to improve outcome before pursuing a larger clinical trial to
      examine its effectiveness as a treatment for brain hemorrhage.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies show that hemoglobin breakdown and subsequent iron accumulation in the brain
      play a role in mediating secondary neuronal injury after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); and
      that treatment with the iron chelator, deferoxamine (DFO), provides neuroprotection in animal
      models of ICH. The investigators recently concluded a phase-I, safety and dose-finding study
      of DFO in patients with ICH; repeated daily intravenous (IV) infusions of DFO in doses up to
      62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day) were well-tolerated and did not
      increase serious adverse events or mortality. The current study builds on these results to
      assess the potential utility of DFO as a therapeutic intervention in ICH.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-armed, phase-II,
      futility clinical study to determine if this maximum tolerated dose of DFO is of sufficient
      promise to improve outcome prior to embarking on a large-scale and costly phase III study to
      assess its efficacy in ICH. The investigators will randomize 324 subjects with ICH equally
      (1:1) to either DFO at 62 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum daily dose of 6000 mg/day), or saline
      placebo, given by continuous IV infusion for 5 consecutive days. Treatment will be initiated
      within 24 hours after ICH symptom onset. Subjects will be stratified based on baseline ICH
      score (0-2 vs. 3-5) and ICH onset-to-treatment time (OTT) window (≤12h vs. &gt;12-24h), so that
      the resulting randomization ratio is 1:1 within each ICH score and OTT window strata.

      The main objectives are:

        1. To assess whether it would be futile to move DFO forward into a Phase III trial based on
           the end point of good outcome (defined as dichotomized modified Rankin Scale score of
           0-2 at 3 months). At the conclusion of the study, the proportion of DFO-treated subjects
           with a good outcome will be compared to the placebo proportion in a futility analysis.
           If the DFO-treated proportion is less than 12% greater than the placebo proportion, then
           it would be futile to move DFO forward to future Phase III testing.

        2. To collect more data on treatment-related adverse events in order to ascertain that
           patients with ICH can tolerate this dose given over an extended 5-day duration of
           infusion without experiencing unreasonable neurological complications, increased
           mortality, or other serious adverse events related to DFO use.

      Secondary and exploratory objectives include:

        1. Determining the overall distribution of scores on mRS at 3 months in DFO-treated
           subjects, and to perform a dichotomized analysis considering the proportion of DFO- and
           placebo-treated subjects with mRS 0-3.

        2. Exploring the differences between early (≤12h) and late (&gt;12-24h) OTT windows in DFO
           treatment effect on functional outcome.

        3. Obtaining data on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Montreal
           Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Stroke Impact Scale-16 (SIS-16)to explore the effects
           of treatment on neurological and cognitive functions.

        4. Examining the effects of DFO on relative peri-hematoma edema (PHE) volume progression
           between baseline and post-treatment CT scans and the residual cavity volume/brain
           atrophy at 90 days, compared to placebo, as potential markers of DFO biological activity
           on brain tissue.

        5. Exploring whether the effect of DFO on outcome is dependent on initial ICH volume, after
           adjusting for other prognostic variables, to determine if specific limits for ICH volume
           should be specified as exclusion/inclusion criteria for future studies.

        6. Assessing the incidence of symptomatic cerebral edema (unexplained increase in NIHSS &gt;4
           points or decrease in GCS &gt;2 points) during hospitalization, up to day 7 or discharge
           whichever is earlier.

        7. Exploring whether progression of PHE can be a radiological/biological marker of activity
           which can be correlated with clinical outcomes and treatment effect of DFO.

      Successful completion of this study will provide a crucial &quot;go/no-go&quot; signal for DFO in ICH.
      Futility will discourage a major phase III trial, whereas non-futility will offer strong
      support for a phase III study to detect clinical efficacy. Results from this study can
      provide valuable information to guide the design and sample size estimation of a potential
      future Phase III trial. ICH is a frequent cause of disability and death. A successful study
      demonstrating the efficacy of DFO would be of considerable public health significance.

      The HI-DEF study also provides an opportunity to &quot;bank&quot; blood samples from the participants
      for future innovative research in ICH. We, therefore, plan to collect additional blood
      samples from the participants in HI-DEF at baseline, before the start of the study drug
      infusion, and after completion of the last infusion to be stored and analyzed in the future.
      The exact questions to be asked and tests to be done in the future are not fully identified
      at this stage. If the efforts to develop deferoxamine as a therapy for ICH are successful,
      future pharmacogenetic studies may help to define other therapeutic targets and responders
      vs. non-responders to deferoxamine therapy. We tentatively plan to investigate the
      relationship between polymorphisms from a panel of genes encoding iron-handling proteins
      (which includes genes involved in both intra- and extra-cellular iron metabolism, such as
      ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, hemopexin, transferrin receptor, ferritin heavy- and light-chain,
      and heme-oxygenase 1 and 2 genes) and peri-hematoma edema; outcome; and response to
      deferoxamine therapy.
