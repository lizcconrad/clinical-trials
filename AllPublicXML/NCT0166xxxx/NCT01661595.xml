  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is funded by the Moody Endowment. In this project, we will investigate the
      potential effect of skeletal muscle nitric oxide (NO) production on skeletal muscle
      anabolism, muscle strength, physical function, and body composition in older individuals.
      Further, we will determine whether augmentation of NO-mediated signaling reduces fatigue and
      fatigability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigators hypothesize that upregulation of skeletal muscle NO-cGMP mediated responses
      through phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition by sildenafil or tadalafil causes an acute
      anabolic response of skeletal muscle protein synthesis. NO is well-known to elicit
      vasodilation through stimulation of cGMP signaling, and NO-mediated changes in muscle
      perfusion may influence both skeletal muscle anabolism and perceptual fatigue. To measure
      skeletal muscle protein synthesis, we will infuse a stable isotope tracer of phenylalanine
      and measure its incorporation into skeletal muscle proteins following a dose of sildenafil,
      tadalafil, or placebo. The Investigators will also determine whether differences exist
      between men and women in response to PDE inhibition. As skeletal muscle NO-cGMP signaling has
      been implicated in fatigue responses, we will assess the acute effect of sildenafil and
      tadalafil on fatigue. Fatigue can be manifested both as a performance deficit at a local
      level (e.g., a reduced ability of skeletal muscle to produce power or force) as well as a
      subjective experience of lacking physical or mental energy. Accordingly, we will use more
      than one means (skeletal muscle performance, fatigue questionnaires, accelerometers) to study
      fatigue. The Investigators hypothesize that sildenafil or tadalafil will acutely reduce
      exercise-associated fatigability and skeletal muscle fatigue development
