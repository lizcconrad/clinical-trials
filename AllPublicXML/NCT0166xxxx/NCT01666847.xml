    <textblock>
      Milking the umbilical cord from the placental end toward the infant has been shown to benefit
      preterm infants when compared to either clamping the umbilical cord immediately or waiting
      delaying the clamping of the cord. Delaying cord clamping for 30-120 seconds has been shown
      to improve heart and lung function, reduces the need for blood transfusion, and reduces the
      risk for brain bleeding seen in some preterm infants. Delaying the clamping of the umbilical
      cord, however in extremely premature infants is not considered safe, since it also delays the
      resuscitation that these infants need immediately after birth. Milking the umbilical cord is
      believed have similar benefits to delaying the clamping of the cord, but can be done much
      faster (seconds rather than minutes). In this study, the cord will milked three times over
      about 10-20 seconds and the infant will be passed to the awaiting newborn medical team for
      routine care. Participants of this study will be randomly assigned to one of two study
      groups: the first group will have the cord milking intervention and the second group will not
      have any intervention other than routine, immediate cord clamping with routine care of mother
      and infant. Data will be collected about the mother prior to delivery and data will also be
      collected about the baby using computerized health records. The data will look at short term
      changes in red blood cell volumes, the need for blood transfusions, and rates of known
      complications of prematurity, including longer term developmental complications at 18-24
      months.

      The hypothesis is that milking the umbilical cord before cutting the cord will lead to a
      higher hemoglobin concentration and decrease the need for blood transfusions in extremely
      preterm neonates compared to the current standard of immediately clamping the umbilical cord.

    <description>The procedure will involve positioning the neonate below the level of the placenta and milking approximately 20cm of umbilical cord three times over 10-20 seconds total from the placental end to the neonate. The cord will then be clamped and the neonate handed to the awaiting medical team for routine care of a premature infant.</description>
