  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a previous study (NL33904.091.10) the investigators challenged 24 volunteers after
      Chloroquine Prophylaxis Sporozoites (CPS) immunization with 45, 30 or 15 infected
      mosquito-bites respectively. The availability of this immunized cohort opens the unique
      opportunity to determine protection to a heterologous challenge for both of the protected and
      unprotected volunteers as the previous challenge infection might have served as immunological
      boost to the unprotected volunteers.

      In the current observational, proof of principle study, the investigators aim to investigate
      the protection on an individual basis of these previously immunized and challenged volunteers
      against a heterologous P. falciparum challenge.
