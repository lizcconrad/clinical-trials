  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders (PBD) are a group of inherited disorders due to defects
      in peroxisome assembly causing complex developmental and metabolic sequelae. In spite of
      advancements in peroxisome biology, the pathophysiology remains unknown, the spectrum of
      phenotypes poorly characterized and the natural history not yet systematically reported. Our
      aims are to further define this population clinically, biochemically and genetically. The
      investigators will prospectively follow patients from Canada, the US and internationally, and
      collect data from medical evaluations, blood, urine and imaging studies that would be
      performed on a clinical care basis. Patients unable to attend clinics can participate in this
      study by mailing in their medical information. The investigators will use this information to
      identify standards of care and improve management.

      Participants have the option to be seen in consultation at the McGill University Health
      Centre in Montreal, Canada, on a yearly basis. This includes a consultation in Genetics,
      Nutrition, Neurology, and Ophthalmology (OCT and FAF exams). All medical records and images
      will be collected, retrospectively and prospectively, until the end of the study, and entered
      anonymously in a database. Molecular testing (through next-generation panel of 75 genes) will
      be offered to participants whose mutations have not been identified yet. Biospecimens will be
      collected to identify new biomarkers. Drug screening will be performed on cultured
      fibroblasts.
