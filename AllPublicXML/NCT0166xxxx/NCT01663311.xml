  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is used to modulate both the auditory neural pathways
      contributing to the perception of phantom sounds, and the regulatory neural network
      responsible for the generation of the individual amount of suffering caused by chronic
      tinnitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. Treatment remains difficult. Most available therapies
      focus on habituation rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus has been shown to be generated
      in the brain, as a result of functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and
      tonotopic maps in the central auditory system. Low-frequency rTMS applied to the
      temporoparietal areas has been investigated for the treatment of hyperexcitability disorders
      such as auditory hallucinations and tinnitus. Pilot data indicate that taking into account
      affective components of the multiple overlapping neural networks responsible for the
      generation of a bothersome subjective tinnitus might enhance the efficacy of Repetitive
      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment in chronic tinnitus. A newly developed
      coil, the so-called double cone coil will be examined with regard to feasibility, safety and
      clinical efficacy in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus in a controlled pilot trial.
