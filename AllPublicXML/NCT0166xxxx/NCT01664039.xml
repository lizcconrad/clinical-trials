  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Intraocular Pressure (IOP) at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in IOP at Week 6 and Month 3</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 6, Month 3</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and measured in mmHg. A more negative change indicates a greater amount of improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Subjects Who Reached Target IOP at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 6, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>IOP (fluid pressure inside the eye) was assessed using Goldmann applanation tonometry and measured in mmHg. Target IOP was defined as ≤ 18 mmHg. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Change From Baseline in Ocular Hyperaemia by Grade at Each Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Week 6, Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Hyperaemia (excess of blood in the white of the eyes (sclera)) was graded by the investigator on a 4-point scale where 0=None/Trace, 1=Mild, 2=Moderate, and 3=Severe. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Change From Baseline in Corneal Staining by Grade at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal staining was assessed after ophthalmic dye was instilled in the eye. The upper eyelid was lifted slightly, and the eye was compared to grading panels. Corneal staining was graded on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects With Change From Baseline in Conjunctiva Staining by Grade at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>Conjunctiva staining was assessed after ophthalmic dye was instilled in the eye. The upper eyelid was lifted slightly, and the eye was compared to grading panels. Conjunctiva staining was graded on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI questionnaire (used to measure vision-related function, ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect vision) was answered by the subject. Each of the 12 items was scored on a 0-4 Likert scale, where 0 is &quot;None of the time&quot; and 4 is &quot;All of the time.&quot; A resultant overall 0-100 score was calculated, with higher scores representing greater disability. A negative number change represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline In Tear Film Break Up Time (TBUT) at Month 3 and Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0), Month 3, Month 6</time_frame>
    <description>TBUT (the time required for dry spots to appear on the corneal surface after blinking) was assessed by the investigator using slit lamp examination . A longer break up time is a sign of a more stable tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>

        <description>Corneal staining was assessed after ophthalmic dye was instilled in the eye. The upper eyelid was lifted slightly, and the eye was compared to grading panels. Corneal staining was graded on a scale from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe). One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Score at Month 3 and Month 6</title>
        <description>The OSDI questionnaire (used to measure vision-related function, ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect vision) was answered by the subject. Each of the 12 items was scored on a 0-4 Likert scale, where 0 is &quot;None of the time&quot; and 4 is &quot;All of the time.&quot; A resultant overall 0-100 score was calculated, with higher scores representing greater disability. A negative number change represents a perceived improvement in ocular health.</description>

        <population>This analysis population includes all randomized subjects who completed the questionnaire at baseline, received at least 1 dose of either study treatment, and had at least 1 post-baseline on-therapy study visit. Here, &quot;n&quot; is the number of subjects with non-missing values at the specific time point for each arm group, respectively.</population>

        <description>TBUT (the time required for dry spots to appear on the corneal surface after blinking) was assessed by the investigator using slit lamp examination . A longer break up time is a sign of a more stable tear film. A positive number change from baseline indicates improvement. One eye was chosen as the study eye, and only data from the study eye were used for the analysis.</description>
