    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood samples to enable validation of genetic testing
      for diseases within a multi-disease carrier screening panel. Samples will be collected from
      adult women or men who have previously tested positive as carriers for various recessive
      conditions. These are healthy adults who carry a mutation that might place them at increased
      risk of having a child with a specific genetic disorder. Study participation will be open to
      adults that were previously tested as part of their routine medical care and where test
      results demonstrated positive carrier status for a specific genetic disease. Samples will be
      tested for the disease mutation for which the subjects provides documentation of prior
      testing.
