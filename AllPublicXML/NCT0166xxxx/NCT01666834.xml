      The characteristics and outcomes of a mixed group of critically ill patients who received
      mechanical ventilation are not known in China.

      A 1 month Cross-section survey will be performed with the aim of describing the
      characteristics and outcomes of conventional mechanical ventilation and treatment of acute
      respiratory distress syndrome in intensive care units in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From August 31th 2012 to September 30th 2012, all patients admit to ICUs were screened,
      mechanical patients and patients with ARDS be enrolled. The demographic characteristics,
      diagnosis, formerly medical history, Ventilator indications, Ventilator data, other
      respiratory treatments, weaning outcome and 28 day mortality, and the treatment of ARDS will
      be recorded.
