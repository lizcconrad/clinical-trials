  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized trial comparing higher levels of dairy intake compared
      to lower levels of dairy intake. Participants will be 20 boys and girls, age 10-13,
      overweight (&gt;85%) who are currently consuming 1 or fewer servings of dairy per day. Each
      participant will be randomized to either higher or lower levels of dairy intake. A baseline
      calorimeter stay will determine 24-hour energy needs. Participants will then receive the diet
      they have been randomized to receive for 6 days and will then have a second calorimeter stay.
      During this 2nd stay, each participant will continue to receive the diet they were randomized
      to receive and will achieve a 300 kcal energy deficit through physical activity. The
      investigators hypothesize that children who receive a 300 kcal energy deficit from the energy
      expenditure of exercise and receive 3 to 4 servings of dairy products will show greater
      increases in fat oxidation compared to children who receive a 300 kcal energy expenditure of
      exercise and receive 1 or fewer servings of dairy products.

      The study objective was to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing enhanced levels of
      dairy consumption to lower levels of dairy consumption during an energy deficit resulting
      from 300 kcal of exercise. Participants were 24 sedentary and overweight boys, 13-15 years of
      age and girls, 12 to 14 years of age, and consuming 1 or fewer servings of dairy and less
      than 600 mg calcium per day at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to either higher
      or lower dairy for 6 days and then crossed over to the opposite treatment subsequent to 2
      weeks of wash out. The investigators provided all meals and snacks for the participants
      during the higher and lower dairy conditions. During the wash out period, participants were
      instructed to consume their normal diet as assessed at baseline which consisted of 1 or fewer
      servings of dairy and less than 600 mg calcium. Participants stayed in the calorimeter at
      baseline, day 7, and day 28 (end of study), after crossover. The calorimeter measured
      substrate oxidation under the condition of a 300 kcal energy deficit due to exercise.
