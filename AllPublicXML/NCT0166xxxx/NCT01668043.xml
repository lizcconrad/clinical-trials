  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase IIa study is to determine whether the antibody (UB-421), targeting
      the HIV-1 receptor on the CD4 molecule of T-lymphocytes and monocytes, is safe and effective
      when multiple doses are administered by intravenous infusion to asymptomatic HIV-1 infected
      adults and to assess pharmacokinetic parameters of the antibody in blood and on cells. The
      neutralizing activity of UB-421 blocks HIV-1 from binding to its receptor on CD4-positive
      cells; thus, UB-421 functions as an immunotherapeutic intervention to prevent HIV-1
      infection.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate safety and tolerability of multiple intravenous infusions of two dose cohorts of UB-421</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations include physical examination, measurement of vital signs, clinical chemistry and hematology tests at each visit (to assess changes from normal range), incidence of adverse event (AE) and serious AE (SAE) of two dose cohorts and are followed for 16 weeks (end of study).
Overall treatment tolerability of UB-421 for each cohort is defined as the percentage of the number of actual infusion doses divided by number of actual infusion doses plus number of missed doses of subject(s) who drops out due to drug-related AE(s); calculation follows specific formula.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate efficacy by measurement of individual maximal viral load reduction and mean maximal viral load reduction of two dose cohorts of UB-421.</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy measurements include virologic responses and determination of the proportion of subjects with viral load &lt;50 copies/mL or &lt;200 copies/mL; viral load reduction &gt;0.5 log10 copies/mL or &gt;1.0 log10 copies/mL; viral rebound over 0.5 log10 increase in viral load from the nadir value during 8-week treatment period, suggesting presence of study drug resistance mutants. HIV-1 viral load is determined at each blood collection during 16-week study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine pharmacokinetic parameters of two dose cohorts of UB-421.</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic analyses are calculated at each visit during 8-week treatment period to determine the serum concentration before and after each infusion of UB-421 and during the 8-week follow-up period to determine the clearance of study drug in circulation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the anti-UB-421 antibody concentration in serum of two dose cohorts of UB-421</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Immunogenicity of the study drug is measured by analytical ELISA test at each visit to determine if the anti-UB-421 antibody concentration is increased above the pre-treatment baseline level.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To determine pharmacokinetic parameters of two dose cohorts of UB-421</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Pharmacokinetic analyses are calculated at each visit during 8-week treatment period to determine the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes binding to the UB-421 study drug before each infusion and during the 8-week follow-up period to determine the duration of study drug bound to the CD4+ cells in circulation</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate safety of multiple intravenous infusions of two dose cohorts of UB-421</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week study period</time_frame>
    <description>Safety evaluations include evaluation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation and expression of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in the presence of study drug before the first and last UB-421 infusions during 8-week treatment period and at the end of follow-up period.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate efficacy by measurement of individual viral load samples for appearance of drug resistance mutants in the two dose cohorts of UB-421</measure>
    <time_frame>16-week period</time_frame>
    <description>Efficacy measurements include virologic responses and determination of the proportion of subjects (if any) with viral load rebound during 8-week treatment period, suggesting emergence of study drug resistance mutants. Samples with viral load rebound will be characterized further to identify virus mutation(s).</description>
