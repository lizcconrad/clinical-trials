    <textblock>
      A study that evaluates the interaction in healthy subjects of the heart drug Digoxin on
      YM178, when the latter is taken on a continuous basis, in order to establish that there is no
      risk to patients who may take this combination of drugs.

    <textblock>
      Subjects receive a single oral dose of digoxin on Day 1. A full pharmacokinetic profile of
      digoxin is obtained for up to 144 hours post-dose. On the morning of Day 7, after the
      scheduled assessments are done, the subjects leave the clinic and return on Day 9.

      From Day 10 up to and including Day 23, subjects receive daily oral doses of YM178 q.d. A
      single dose of digoxin is given in combination with YM178 on Day 18 (8 days after the first
      dose of YM178). On this day, a complete pharmacokinetic profile for digoxin is obtained up to
      144 hours post-dose.

      From Day 16 up to and including Day 19, blood samples for bioanalysis of YM178 are taken
      regularly. In addition, vital signs, safety ECG (Electrocardiogram) measurements, safety
      laboratory assessments, adverse events and concomitant medications are monitored throughout
      the investigational period.

      Subjects return for a Post Study Visit 7-14 days after the last dosing occasion.
