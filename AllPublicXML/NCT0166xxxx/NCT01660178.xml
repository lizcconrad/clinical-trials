      Objective: To describe the profile of newborns undergoing early stimulation in a neonatal
      intensive care unit, characterizing the study population, according to its variables and
      neonatal risk factors, indications for treatment of early stimulation.

      Methods: It was conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional and analytical study carried out in
      the General Hospital Dr. Cesar calls, from July to December 2010. The sample consisted of 116
      medical records of newborns indicated for the treatment of early stimulation, representing
      (9.2%). The study excluded seven infants who had some type of congenital malformation. It was
      used the following variables: weight, sex, gestational age, Apgar score, diagnosis of
      Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Intracranial Hemorrhage and the use of mechanical
      ventilation and CPAP.
