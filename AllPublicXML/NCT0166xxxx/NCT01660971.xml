    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      dasatinib when given together with erlotinib hydrochloride in treating patients with
      pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed by
      surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Dasatinib and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      dasatinib together with erlotinib hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (also phase II recommended dose) of the
      combination of gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride), erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride)
      and dasatinib in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety profile of the combination of gemcitabine, erlotinib and
      dasatinib.

      II. To evaluate the response rate and response duration of advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma
      treated with dasatinib, erlotinib and gemcitabine.

      III. To determine progression-free survival and overall survival for this group of patients.

      IV. To determine the utility of advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess in
      vivo effects of therapy (changes in tumor vascularity, cellularity).

      V. To assess the use of serum markers as predictors of response and outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine hydrochloride and dasatinib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1,
      8, and 15, and dasatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 4
      weeks thereafter.
