    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm the safety and efficacy of high-dose Melphalan HCL
      for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) as a myeloablative conditioning regimen in multiple
      myeloma patients (MM) undergoing autologous transplantation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The sponsor of the current study, Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Ligand), previously CyDex
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CyDex), is developing Melphalan HCL for Injection (Propylene
      Glycol-Free) as an orphan drug product for use as a high dose conditioning treatment prior to
      hematopoietic progenitor (stem) cell transplantation. This new injectable form of melphalan
      HCL incorporates Captisol®, β cyclodextrin sulfobutyl ether sodium salts (also known as
      [SBE]7m-β-CD), into the product. Captisol is present to facilitate the use of an all aqueous
      diluent (normal saline) for reconstitution and administration of the freeze-dried product in
      place of the propylene glycol-ethanol diluent necessary for the currently used melphalan
      intravenous product. Captisol provides for solubilization and improved stability of the all
      aqueous reconstituted and diluted infusion solution.

      This is the second of two studies supporting product registration. This study will be a
      multicenter study of high-dose Melphalan HCL for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) conducted
      in 60 patients who have symptomatic MM and qualify for autologous stem cell transplantation
      (ASCT).

      During the Study Period, patients will receive 100mg/m2 of either Melphalan HCL for Injection
      (Propylene Glycol-Free) on Day -3 and on Day -2 for a total dose of 200mg/m2. Blood samples
      (5 timepoints post infusion) for population pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be withdrawn
      through an indwelling i.v. cannula on the first day of administration of melphalan (Day -3)
      for all patients and then additional blood samples (2 timepoints post infusion) drawn in a
      subset of patients on the second day of melphalan administration (Day -2).

      Following one day of rest after the high dose myeloablative conditioning (Day -1), patients
      will receive an autologous graft (Day 0).

The High-Dose Melphaln HCL for Injection (Propylene Glycol-Free) will be reconstituted to 5 mg/mL (also containing 270 mg/mL of Captisol®). The Melphalan HCL for Injection (Propylene Glycol Free) will be further diluted with normal saline to a concentration of no greater than 0.45 mg/mL and infused over 30 minutes ( + or - 3 minutes)via a central venous catheter.</description>
