    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find the best system for assessing the pain of critically
      ill patient in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

      At first the investigators assess the sedation of the patient with the scale
      sedation-agitation scale (SAS) or the delirium with the confusion assessment method, if the
      patient is too sedated or delirious the investigators consider him unable to use the Visual
      Analogic Scale (VAS).

      The investigators compare two different scales Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and
      Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS) which include no verbal items. Each items has been evaluated in
      three different moments: before, during and after the nurses' care.

      The investigators compare the scales between them. Then, every time the investigators value
      the score of these scales with the self-report of patients with the VAS scale (when it is
      possible) and finally with the physiological parameters (blood pressure, heart rate and
      respiratory rate).

      In the end, the investigators compare two different classes of patient: the surgical and
      medical one. The investigators search for some differences in the perception of the pain
      between these two classes.

      This study has specific aims:

        1. to find the best method to evaluate the pain in critically ill patients;

        2. to compare the perception of pain analysed trough CPOT and BPS;

        3. to compare CPOT and BPS between medical and surgical patients.
