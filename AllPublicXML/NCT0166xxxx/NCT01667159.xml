      This study will examine the effectiveness of an integrated treatment for adolescents who are
      depressed and use alcohol in an intensive outpatient setting in the community.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have consistently shown that alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and mental health disorders
      are related in adolescence. For example, in a community sample, teens who reported a history
      of AUD were almost four times as likely to have a history of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
      than teens with no history of AUD. The scientific community has only recently begun to
      examine how to treat adolescents with both AUD and MDD. Reviews have concluded that
      depression negatively affects treatment for substance abuse. At the same time, substance use
      issues are often not assessed or addressed in outpatient psychotherapy. Thus, we believe that
      protocols are needed to specifically address substance abusing, depressed adolescents. This
      study is designed to determine if an integrated (CBT-I) protocol designed to treat both
      substance use and depression in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with AUD/MDD will produce
      better treatment outcomes compared to standard care (CBT-SC). Both the integrated CBT-I and
      CBT-SC conditions will be delivered by licensed mental health workers at a community mental
      health clinic - Gateway - that uses an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) model to treat
      adolescents with AUD and mental health disorders. Two hundred adolescents (50 per year for 4
      years) will be recruited from Gateway's Dual Diagnosis IOP. If an adolescent screens in by
      reporting both depressed mood and substance abuse, these eligible families will complete a
      thorough baseline assessment and will then be assigned to either CBT-I or CBT-SC. The
      baseline battery will be repeated at the end of treatment, and 6 and 12 months after
      treatment completion to determine how families in the study do over time.
