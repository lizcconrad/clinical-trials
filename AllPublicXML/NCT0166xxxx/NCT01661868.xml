  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about a drug called olaparib in women
      who have either: 1)never received a PARP inhibitor before to treat ovarian cancer (group 1)
      or 2)participants who have received a PARP inhibitor before to treat ovarian cancer, with the
      exception of olaparib (group 2). PARP inhibitors are drugs tht prevent cancer cells from
      repairing their DNA. In this research study, we are looking to see how well the drug olaparib
      works in women who have never received a PARP inhibitor for recurrent ovarian cancer as well
      as those who have received a prior PARP inhibitor and whose cancer has re-grown after
      receiving that PARP inhibitor.

      Olaparib tablets will be taken twice daily, orally, in treatment cycles lasting 4 weeks.

      On days 1, 8, 12 and 22 of the first 2 cycles and day 1 of all other cycles, subjects will
      have a physical exam, be asked questions about their general health, and specific questions
      about any problems they might be having and any medications they are taking.

      Tumor will be assess by either CT or MRI scan every 2 cycles (every 2 months). Tumor biopsies
      will be optional in this study. Only participants that have received a PARP inhibitor in the
      past will be asked to have a biopsy of their tumor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer that has
             recurred following a platinum-based regimen used at initial diagnosis

          -  Measurable disease

          -  Estimated life expectancy greater than 16 weeks

          -  Normal organ and marrow function

          -  Evidence of non-childbearing status for women of childbearing potential

          -  Able to swallow oral medication

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Prior PARP inhibitor use for another cancer such as breast cancer

          -  Receiving any other study agents or any other anti-cancer treatment

          -  Known brain metastases

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to olaparib

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive hear failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  History of a different malignancy unless disease-free for at least 5 years

          -  Currently experiencing seizures or currently being treated with any anti-epileptic for

          -  Presence of gastrointestinal disorders that, in the investigator's opinion, are likely
             to interfere with the absorption of olaparib, or with the patient's ability to take
             regular oral medication
