  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At a previous study the investigators have assessed the safety and efficacy of treatment with
      AAT(Alpha 1 Antitrypsin)in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes subjects aiming at beta cells
      preservation .

      Since treatment with AAT is expected to be a chronic treatment; stopping treatment will
      probably result in eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, other
      investigational drugs aiming at beta cells preservation have shown that patients who were
      initially treated and maintained their initial beta-cell function, required continuation of
      treatment or they lost the beta-cell function.

      Therefore, in this extension study, patients who were previously treated with AAT and
      maintained clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a continuation of treatment,
      since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication.

      The proposed study is aimed to assess the long term effect of AAT in subjects with type 1
      diabetes mellitus: safety and tolerability of treatment, and effect on beta-cell function.

      Subjects who have completed all visits of the 008 study will be offered to participate in the
      extension study.

      The study will be consist off two main arms as following:

      Arm 1: Subjects who maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L will continue
      treatment with AAT for up to 18 treatments according to the dosage group they were allocated
      to in the 008 study.

      Arm 2:

      Subjects who have not maintained peak stimulated C-peptide secretion ≥ 0.2nmol/L and subjects
      with peak stimulated C -peptide secretion ≥ 0.2 nmol/L who are reluctant to receive
      additional study drug.

      Clinical follow up for all subjects in both arms will be for 3 years
