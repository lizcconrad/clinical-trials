      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and reactogenicity of Pandemic Live
      Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (PLAIV) manufactured by GPO, Thailand, and to evaluate humoral
      immune response of the above vaccine after intranasal application by using HAI test, micro
      neutralization assays.

      Part A: 24 volunteers will be enrolled and divided into 2 groups -12 volunteers in each of 2
      groups receiving either 5.0-6.5 log 10 EID50 or 6.6-7.5 log10 EID50 respectively. 9 who will
      received vaccine vaccine strain and 3 who will received placebo.

      Part B: Total 324 participants will randomized into 2 group using 3:1 ratio (300 vaccines:100
      placebos). There are 3 stratified age groups: &gt;12-18 years, &gt;18-49 years and &gt;49 years.
