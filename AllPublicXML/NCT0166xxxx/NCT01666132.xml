  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intramyocardial, NOGA guided injection of bone marrow derived mononuclear cells in patients
      with chronic ischemic heart disease and LVEF &lt; 40%. The primary objective is to determine
      whether the administration of the cells improves recovery of the left ventricular function.
      Secondary objective is the finding of clinical or paraclinical parameters to predict
      potential benefits of the treatment (basing on MRI characteristics such as size,
      transmurality of the myocardial infarction and peri-lesional ischemia).

      In the first part of the study 10 patients are treated without control group. This phase
      serves as feasibility and safety part of the study.

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to the slow recruitment process and the progress of newer cell types we decided to stop the
    trial after the phase 1 (after 10 patients included)
