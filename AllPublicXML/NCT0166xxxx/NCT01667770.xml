  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is to find out which types of dural grafts used during surgery for Chiari
      Malformations are superior. We believe that autologous dural grafts are superior to
      non-autologous grafts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study compares autologous grafts vs. non-autologous grafts. Non-autologous grafts include
      synthetics and grafts from animals. Autologous grafts have a better side-effect profile than
      non-autologous grafts. We believe this improved side-effect profile will result in a
      decreased incidence of reoperation for post-operative infections and post-operative fluid
      collections (pseudomeningoceles and seromas). Study is open to all non-pregnant minor and
      adult subjects. Subjects must have symptomatic Chiari Malformation described as &gt; or equal to
      6mm descent of the cerebellar tonsils below the foramen magnum with accompanying headaches
      and/or neurologic findings (arm pain/weakness, myelopathy, etc.). After the 12-month
      follow-up is completed on the first 100 subjects there will be an interim analysis of the
      results in order to determine whether one of the treatments has a statistically superior
      outcome. If a statistically superior outcome is noted, the trial will stop after being
      reviewed by a data monitoring committee. If no statistically significant difference is seen
      at one year, the study will continue until the 12-month follow-up is completed on the 200th
      patient.
