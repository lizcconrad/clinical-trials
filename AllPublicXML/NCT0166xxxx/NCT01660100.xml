      Objective: This prospective study aims to examine the outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF)
      ablation after permanent pulmonary vein antrum isolation or pulmonary vein antrum isolation
      plus left atrial posterior wall isolation is proven by a repeat procedure. The study will be
      conducted in patients with different types of AF: paroxysmal AF (PAF) and non-PAF (Persistent
      AF and Long Standing Persistent AF).

      Hypothesis: In addition to permanent pulmonary vein antrum isolation, proven isolation of
      left atrial posterior wall is associated with more freedom from atrial arrhythmia at
      long-term follow-up after atrial fibrillation ablation, especially in non-PAF patients.

    <description>Patients who remain free from atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia) off antiarrhythmic drug at the 12th month will be continuously followed-up every 3 months.

    <description>In patients who experience &quot;procedure failure&quot; (defined above), a re-do ablation may be performed. During the re-do procedure, in addition to re-isolation of re-connected pulmonary vein antrum and left atrial posterior wall, all non-pulmonary vein triggers will be eliminated. Then the patients will be followed-up again for atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia) recurrence.</description>

    <description>In this group, only standard PVAI will be performed during the primary procedure. Three months later, a 2nd procedure will be performed in all subjects regardless of the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias. Subjects in whom pulmonary vein antrum remains isolated will enter follow-up; however, patients who have pulmonary vein-left atrium reconnection will undergo an re-isolation. Patients who have pulmonary vein antrum re-isolation are subject to a 3rd procedure 3 months later to check the status of pulmonary vein-left atrium connection. Patients will enter follow-up for long-term outcome only after permanent PVAI is confirmed by a repeat procedure.</description>

    <description>In this group, PVAI will be extended to the entire LAPW to achieve LAPW isolation during the primary ablation. Three months later, a 2nd procedure will be performed in all subjects regardless of the recurrence of atrial arrhythmias. Subjects in whom pulmonary vein antrum and LAPW remain isolated will enter follow-up; however, patients who have pulmonary vein antrum and/or LAPW reconnection will undergo a re-isolation. Patients who have pulmonary vein antrum and/or LAPW re-isolation are subject to a 3rd procedure three month later to check the presence of pulmonary vein antrum and/or LAPW re-connection. Patients will enter follow-up for long-term outcome only after PVAI and LAPW isolation are proven by a repeat procedure.</description>
