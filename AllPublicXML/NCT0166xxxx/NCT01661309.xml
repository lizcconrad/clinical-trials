  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vegetarians are known to be deficient in vitamin B12, due to a lack or absence of dietary
      animal produce, which can elevate homocysteine. There is strong evidence indicating that
      elevated plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a contributor to chronic conditions, such as
      primary cardiovascular disease (CVD). The study hypothesis is: There will be a significant
      decrease in plasma tHcy of vegetarians following the intervention by supplementary vitamin
      B12 (of the methylcobalamin type) and this will lead to a reduction of the risk of CVD.
