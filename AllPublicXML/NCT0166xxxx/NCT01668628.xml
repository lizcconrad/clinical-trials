  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and depression in peritoneal
      dialysis patients compare to hemodialysis patients and assess hydration effect on QOL and
      depression over time.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In dialysis patients, low QOL and depression affects clinical outcomes such as morbidity and
      mortality.

      Therefore at the point of treating dialysis patients, It is important to provide not only
      physical health but also psychosocial health.

      QOL could be decided by physical health (i.e. sign and symptom, laboratory results, death)
      and psychological health (i.e. fatigue, pain, consciousness of health and satisfaction).

      And also generally it is well known that physical and psychological functions in dialysis
      patients are decreased.

      And especially depression is common disease in dialysis patients. It is also well known that
      about from 25 to 50 percent of dialysis patients have depression which could result in low
      QOL moreover hospitalization, complication, and mortality.

      But there is no QOL and depression study with hydration status. Therefore the investigators
      would like to explore it.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate quality of life (QOL) and depression in dialysis
      patients and assess the hydration effect on QOL and depression over time

    <measure>Change of Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 1.3 (KDQOL SF 1.3) Score and Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) Score From Visit 1 Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Visit 1(zero month) and Visit 2 (12 months after Visit 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is assessed via KDQOL SF 1.3 and depression is assessed via BDI at the visit 1 and Visit 2 period.
KDQOL SF 1.3 and BDI are validated questionnaires to assess HRQOL and depression, respectively.
Visit 2 period is followed 12 months after Visit 1 period. The outcome measure is the difference in averaged scores between Visit 1 and Visit 2; It is calculated as (Score at visit 2 - Score at visit 1).
HRQOL is assessed by three components; physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score.
Physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score are averaged scores of subscales.
The range of each score and each subscale are 0 - 100, and higher values indicate better HRQOL status.
The BDI score is a summed score of each component of BDI questionnaire, and the range is 5 to 63. Higher BDI scores are considered to represent more severe depression symptoms.</description>

    <description>Hydration status is checked via BCM(body composition monitor) at Visit 1 and Visit 2 period, as a Overhydration(OH) value.
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is measured via scores of KDQOL SF1.3. Depression was assessed using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. Visit 2 period is followed 12 months after Visit 1 period. HRQOL is assessed by three components; physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score.
Physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score are averaged scores of subscales.
The range of each score and each subscale are 0 - 100, and higher values indicate better HRQOL status.
The BDI score is a summed score of each component of BDI questionnaire, and the range is 5 to 63. Higher BDI scores are considered to represent more severe depression symptoms.
The outcome measure is the averaged scores at Visit 1 between the Normohydration group and Overhydration group.</description>

        <title>Change of Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 1.3 (KDQOL SF 1.3) Score and Beck Depression Inventory(BDI) Score From Visit 1 Period</title>
        <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is assessed via KDQOL SF 1.3 and depression is assessed via BDI at the visit 1 and Visit 2 period.
KDQOL SF 1.3 and BDI are validated questionnaires to assess HRQOL and depression, respectively.
Visit 2 period is followed 12 months after Visit 1 period. The outcome measure is the difference in averaged scores between Visit 1 and Visit 2; It is calculated as (Score at visit 2 - Score at visit 1).
HRQOL is assessed by three components; physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score.
Physical health score, mental health score and kidney disease health score are averaged scores of subscales.
The range of each score and each subscale are 0 - 100, and higher values indicate better HRQOL status.
The BDI score is a summed score of each component of BDI questionnaire, and the range is 5 to 63. Higher BDI scores are considered to represent more severe depression symptoms.</description>
