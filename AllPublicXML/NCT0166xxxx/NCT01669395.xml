  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of an early, coordinated
      rehabilitation intervention for patients with severe heart failure in NYHA class III and IV
      with a ejection fraction of &lt;40% of normal cardiac function measured on frequency of
      readmissions, physical ability and participation in activities of daily living and quality of
      life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 400,000 Danes live today with heart disease. Disease severity is crucial for
      patients quality of life. Patients with severe heart disease often struggle with everyday
      life, characterized by reduced physical capacity, tendency to depression and anxiety to
      perform everyday activities that may provoke symptoms.

      A large proportion of patients who are offered cardiac rehabilitation deselect that offer. Of
      the patients who do participate, more than 50% stop the rehabilitation ahead of time. A large
      group of patients with severe heart failure and classified in NYHA Class III and IV, deselect
      the offer because of lack of energy to participate in cardiac rehabilitation or is when
      specified by a medical assessment discharged from the hospital without the offer of training
      or any other form of rehabilitation.

      The offer of rehabilitation for patients with severe heart failure is lacking as it is today.
      This study assesses the effectiveness of an early home based rehabilitation program that
      complements the general psycho-social support, symptom-oriented and preventive medical
      treatment that these patients always have the option to get.

    <description>Training begins 3-5 days after discharge from hospital, performed by an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist from Gentofte Hospital in the first two weeks. From week three to six the training will be carried out by an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist from the local municipality (Gentofte municipality and Lyngby Taarbæk municipality). Training will take place at home twice a week for 6 weeks, each session lasting 45 minutes. The intervention is individualized and focuses on functional physical and compensatory training to help the patient to manage everyday life at home. A training program will be provided and the patient will be instructed to do the exercises every day</description>
