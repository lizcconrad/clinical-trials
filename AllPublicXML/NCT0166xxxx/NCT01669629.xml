    <textblock>
      This is a one week 2x2 crossover study comparing delefilcon A with etafilcon A, with a
      primary hypothesis of comparing the handling of each lens. Additional secondary markers are
      measured looking at subjective comfort and vision of the lenses.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject must be between 18 and 45 years of age (inclusive) with no presbyopic add.

          -  The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form. This should be recorded on the Case Report
             Form (CRF).

          -  The subject must be willing to wear the study lenses for at least 8 hours per day, 7
             days per week.

          -  The subject must be a current successful soft contact lens wearer in both eyes

          -  The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             this clinical protocol.

          -  The subject's subjective refraction must result in a vertex corrected spherical
             contact lens prescription in the range of -1.00D to -6.00D in each eye.

          -  The subject's refractive astigmatism must be less than or equal to 0.75D in both eyes.

          -  The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 (6/9) or better in each
             eye.

          -  The subject must require a visual correction in both eyes (no monofit or monovision
             allowed).

          -  The subject must have normal eyes with no evidence of abnormality or disease. For the
             purposes of this study a normal eye is defined as one having:

               1. No amblyopia.

               2. No evidence of lid abnormality or infection (including blepharitis/meibomitis).

               3. No conjunctival abnormality or infection.

               4. No clinically significant slit lamp findings (i.e. stromal edema,
                  vascularization, infiltrates or abnormal opacities).

               5. No other active ocular disease.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) corneal edema, corneal vascularization, corneal
             staining, or any other abnormalities of the cornea which would contraindicate contact
             lens wear.

          -  Clinically significant (Grade 3 or 4) tarsal abnormalities or bulbar injection which
             might interfere with contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Pregnancy or lactation.

          -  No extended wear in the last 3 months.

          -  Diabetes.

          -  Infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or an immunosuppressive disease
             (e.g. HIV).

          -  Employee or family member of the staff of the investigational site.
