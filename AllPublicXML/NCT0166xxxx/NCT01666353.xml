  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop methods for quantitative imaging of solid tumors in patients who
      are receiving immunotherapies that have a delayed mechanism of action.

      PET imaging with [18F] 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) is a potent diagnostic tool and
      is able to detect melanomas and other tumors, some of which are undetectable by CT. FDG PET
      is now used commonly in detecting melanoma in humans as melanomas quite consistently have
      high glucose metabolism. PET with FDG can image the response of tumors to therapy, but has
      not been extensively evaluated in melanoma nor in immunotherapy for melanoma. PET has been
      shown to be highly predictive of outcomes of patients following radioimmunotherapy of
      lymphoma, and has shown changes in tumor glycolysis as early as 7 days after immunotherapy
      initiation.

      In order to develop PET/CT as a tool to detect early evidence of response in patients with
      solid tumors receiving immune checkpoint blockade, investigators propose to perform PET/CT
      imaging prior to therapy, again between days 21 and 28, and finally at 4 months
      post-treatment initiation. Each scan will be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.
      Investigators will use the PERCIST criteria to determine peak and maximum standardized uptake
      values corrected for lean body mass (SUL) in tumor, tumor volumes, and tumor total glycolytic
      volumes, and will use CT from PET/CT to measure tumor size by immune RECIST criteria. (See
      section on Outcome Evaluation below.) Investigators will assess whether early changes in
      tumor metabolism seen on FDG PET are predictive of progression free and overall survival
      outcomes. Through these systematic pilot studies, investigators hope to better link FDG PET
      measurements to individual patient responses to immune checkpoint blockade therapy and better
      understand and refine this emerging and often effective therapeutic approach.

    <description>• To compare FDG PET-based qualitative and quantitative tumor response assessment with standard CT immune RECIST criteria in patients receiving immune checkpoint blockade therapy for melanoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients will receive 2 standard of care treatment FDG scans, the first scan at the begining of treatment and the second scan at the end of treatment. The research scan will be done between the first and second scan.</description>
