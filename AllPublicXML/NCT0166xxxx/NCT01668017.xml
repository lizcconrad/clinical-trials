  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part trial. &quot;Solid tumor&quot; in this protocol means solid tumor excluding
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      Part 1: Dose Escalation Phase in subjects with solid tumor (Cohort A) and HCC (Cohort B). The
      dose will be increased from 45 mg twice a day (BID) with 3+3 cohort method up to the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of pimasertib established as single agent in the global
      studies for each arm independently.

      Part 2: The Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) defined in Part 1 will be confirmed in more subjects
      in Cohort A (N=18) and Cohort B (N=6) separately.

      Following the recommendation by the Safety Monitoring Committee, Cohort B was discontinued
      due to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and there will be no further enrollment of subjects to
      this cohort. This decision is based upon review of safety and efficacy information.

    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this the study drug. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug or worsening of pre-existing medical condition, whether or not related to study drug. A serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 30 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pre-treatment state. TEAEs include both Serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs.</description>

        <description>Volume of distribution was defined as the theoretical volume in which the total amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the desired serum concentration of a drug. The summarized data was not available for this arm therefore individual data was presented.</description>

        <population>PK analysis set included all subjects who received at least 1 planned dose of pimasertib and who had at least 1 measurable post-dose concentration. Subjects with important protocol deviations or events, which may impact the quality of the PK data were excluded from the PK analysis set.</population>

        <description>Percentage of subjects with best overall response in each category (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], stable disease [SD], progressive disease [PD]) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1) was reported. CR was defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>

CR was defined as disappearance of all target and all non-target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. PD was defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study) or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. SD was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.</description>
