    <textblock>
      Prior work suggests exposure to low glucose levels (hypoglycemia) is associated with
      increased cardiovascular risk. However, whether there is a causal relationship between
      cardiovascular events and hypoglycemia remains unclear with conflicting data in the
      literature. In this study, we plan to study whether acute exposure of patients to clinically
      relevant (50-60 milligrams/deciliter) levels of hypoglycemia induces or worsens blood vessel
      endothelial dysfunction- a key 1st step in the development of heart attacks and strokes. This
      will be determined in humans both with and with type 2 diabetes.
