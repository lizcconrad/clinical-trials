      This study will evaluate a new tool, based on our currently implemented &quot;Functional
      Assessment Screening Tablets (FAST),&quot; and activate patients to partner with their physicians.
      Completion of this project, FAST-PRI, will provide important information on the effectiveness
      of using HIT patient feedback to inform and activate patients and promote health behavior
      change.

      Aim 1 Hypotheses: Patients who receive self-management support through HIT patient feedback
      (intervention) will be more likely than patients who do not receive such feedback (control)
      to:

        -  Initiate discussions with their provider regarding study-designated PRI;

        -  Have discussions with their providers, regardless of the initiator, regarding
           study-designated PRI; and

        -  Perceive these discussions of study-designated PRI to be useful. Approach: We will
           conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial of HIT patient feedback, clustered at the
           physician level, in an academic group medical practice. Patients and providers will
           complete questionnaires regarding discussions of health behaviors and HRQoL at each
           clinical encounter.

      Aim 2 Hypotheses: HIT patient feedback will result in: 1) increased number of smoking quit
      attempts, 2) increased physical activity, and 3) improved mental HRQoL at six, and twelve
      months.

      Approach: Patient participants will complete questionnaires regarding smoking quit attempts,
      physical activity, and their mental HRQoL at baseline, six and twelve months.

      Aim 3 Hypotheses: For each study-designated PRI, patients who receive HIT patient feedback
      will: 1) receive more treatment recommendations (e.g., nurse educator, pharmacist, social
      worker referrals); 2) act on more treatment recommendations; and 3) exhibit improved
      self-efficacy regarding their ability to make positive lifestyle changes and improve their
      HRQoL; physicians whose patients receive HIT patient feedback will have higher self-efficacy
      regarding their ability to influence their patients to make positive lifestyle changes and
      improve HRQoL. These, in addition to discussions (Aim 1), will mediate the relationship
      between HIT patient feedback and improvements in study-designated PRI.

      Approach: We will survey patients and physicians and abstract referral data from the
      electronic medical record (EMR).

      The proposed project, Functional Assessment Screening Tablets-Patient Reported Information,
      has been developed in response to PAR-08-270: Utilizing Health Information Technology to
      Improve Health Care Quality (R18). Tobacco, physical activity, and poor mental health-related
      quality of life (HRQoL) are major causes of morbidity and mortality that are not being
      adequately addressed in the current systems of care. Healthcare providers play an important
      role in encouraging healthy behaviors and identifying factors that impact patients' HRQoL.
      Clinicians are most effective in this role when they partner with informed, activated, and
      engaged patients. The investigators will evaluate a new tool, based our current &quot;Functional
      Assessment Screening Tablets (FAST),&quot; that is designed to inform and activate patients about
      their own patient reported information (PRI). The FAST currently uses wirelessly-networked
      tablet computers to collect PRI while patients wait to see their primary care provider and
      provides this PRI to providers at the time of the patient's visit. The new health information
      technology (HIT)-based tool, used in the FAST-PRI intervention and referred to as HIT patient
      feedback, provides patients with self-management support through immediate, personalized,
      guideline-based feedback about their health behaviors (tobacco use and physical inactivity)
      and mental HRQoL and encourages them to take a more active role in their health. Completion
      of this cluster-randomized controlled trial, FAST-PRI, will provide important information on
      the effectiveness of using HIT patient feedback to inform and activate patients and promote
      health behavior change. The investigators will accomplish this through the following three
      specific aims:

      Aim 1. Use HIT patient feedback regarding study-designated PRI (i.e., tobacco use, physical
      inactivity, and mental HRQoL) to activate patients.

      Aim 2. Assess the impact of HIT patient feedback on study-designated PRI. Aim 3. Evaluate
      potential mediators of the effectiveness of HIT patient feedback on study-designated PRI.

      The investigators will conduct a 12-month randomized controlled trial of HIT patient
      feedback, clustered at the physician level, in an academic group medical practice. Patients
      and providers will complete questionnaires regarding discussions of health behaviors and
      HRQoL at each clinical encounter. In addition, patient participants will complete
      questionnaires regarding smoking quit attempts, physical activity, and their mental HRQoL, as
      well as self-efficacy and use of interdisciplinary referral at baseline, six and twelve
      months. The investigators will survey physicians regarding self-efficacy at baseline, 12 and
      24 months. Finally, we will abstract referral data from the electronic medical record
      regarding health behaviors, HRQoL, and referrals.

    <description>Patient participants will be contacted and asked to report smoking quit attempts, physical activity using the Modified Activity Questionnaire, physical activity lapses, and HRQoL using the RAND-36.
Smoking quit attempts will be measured using questions modified from the Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey.</description>

    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>After each clinical encounter, a participating patient will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire immediately after the encounter. The questionnaire ascertains if the PRI (i.e., physical activity, tobacco use, or mental HRQoL) were discussed during the doctor-patient encounter, who initiated the discussion, and how useful the patient found the discussion (1: not at all useful to 5: very useful, 0: not discussed).</description>

    <measure>Aim 2 Secondary outcome: percentage of patients being non-smokers, percentage of patients being adequately physically active, and mental HRQoL at twelve months.</measure>
    <time_frame>One year</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of the intervention period, physician level data examining percentage of the panel with improvement of the PRI will be examined. The investigators will electronically abstract data from the FAST and EpicCare EMRs regarding each study-designated PRI, physician study group assignment, referrals, and number of visits over the study period in a de-identified manner. In this way, the investigators will be able to compare the impact of the HIT patient feedback intervention across GIMO.</description>

    <description>After completing the FAST, GIMO patients seeing a participating provider will receive(or not receive)HIT patient feedback, based on their providers' study group assignment. Feedback for each PRI will be personalized based on the medical history, family history, and other PRI reported on the FAST. A discussion of potential treatment options will be presented along with possible general referral resources. The patient will be encouraged to discuss the PRI with his or her physician.
Patients will be provided with a list of resources, customized to their study-designated PRI, that includes ongoing programs available both in the community and GIMO to help them with behavior change and mental HRQoL.</description>
