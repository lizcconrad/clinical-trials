    <textblock>
      This long-term, open-label extension study will evaluate the safety of RoActemra/Actemra
      (tocilizumab) in patients with polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis who
      completed the WA19977 core study. Patients aged 9-18 years with at least JIA ACR30 clinical
      response to RoActemra/Actemra in the core study will be eligible to receive RoActemra/Actemra
      8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks. Anticipated time on study treatment is 104 weeks.

    <description>Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were recorded from the first day of tocilizumab administration until 4 weeks after administration of the last dose of tocilizumab. AEs of special interest were Infections (including all opportunistic infections and non-serious infections as defined by those treated with IV anti-infectives), Myocardial infarction/Acute coronary syndrome, Gastrointestinal perforations and related events, Malignancies, Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity reactions, Demyelinating disorders, Stroke.

    <description>A participant was defined to show inactive disease if all of the following criteria were applied: 1) No joints with active arthritis (no joints with swelling and no joints with lack of motion), 2) No fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to JIA, 3) No active uveitis, 4) ESR and/or CRP within normal range, and 5) Physician's global assessment of disease activity equals (=) 0 millimeters (mm) on a Visual analog scale (VAS).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 12, 24, 28, 32, 36, 48, 60, 72 and Final Follow-Up Visit (up to 82 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's treating physician provided a rating of the participant's arthritis disease activity on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line, score 0 represented 'arthritis inactive' (ie, symptom-free and no arthritis symptoms) and the extreme right end score 100 represented 'arthritis very active'. A higher score indicated more disease activity.</description>

    <description>The participant or parent/guardian, as appropriate, provided a rating of the participant's well-being on a 0 to 100 mm horizontal scale. The extreme left end of the line Score 0 represented 'very well' (ie, symptom-free and no arthritis disease activity) and the extreme right end score 100 represented 'very poor' (ie, maximum arthritis disease activity).

    <description>Joints with active arthritis were defined as joints with swelling or pain and limited of motion. The maximum number of joints with active arthritis was 71.The joint assessment was performed by an independent assessor who was not the treating physician and who was blinded to all other aspects of the participant's efficacy and safety data.</description>

    <description>The CHAQ-DI questionnaire consisted of 30 questions referring to eight domains: dressing/grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and activities. Each domain had at least two component questions and if applicable to the participant there were four possible responses (0 = without any difficulty, 1 = with some difficulty, 2 = with much difficulty, 3 = unable to do). The CHAQ-DI score is the sum of the domain scores divided by the number of domains that have a non-missing score. This overall score ranges from 0 (best) to 3 (worst).</description>

        <description>The six JIA ACR components comprised of: 1) Physician's global assessment of disease activity, 2) Parent/Participant's global assessment of overall well-being, 3) Maximum number of joints with active arthritis, 4) Number of joints with limitation of movement, 5) Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and/or C-reactive Protein (CRP), and 6) Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disease Index (CHAQ-DI).
At an assessment visit, a JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response in comparison to Baseline was defined as: At least three of the six JIA ACR core components improving by at least 30 percent (%), 50%, 70%, or 90% respectively and no more than one of the remaining JIA ACR core components worsening by more than 30%.</description>
