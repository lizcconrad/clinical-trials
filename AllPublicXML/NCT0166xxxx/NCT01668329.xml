  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock is a frequent pathology responsible for over 30000 deaths/year in France. Its
      outcome has not been improved despite the knowledge on inflammatory processes; a reason for
      these lack of results may lay on the lack of data on the precise dynamics of inflammatory and
      anti-inflammatory cascades and their consequences. We intend to achieve accurate monitoring
      of the inflammatory process on a small group of non-immunocompromised patients. Our goal is
      to obtain quality data, repeated over time, by limiting the technical variability.

      The aim is to obtain precise data on the dynamics of cytokines, oxydative stress and hormonal
      response on immunocompetent adults during septic shock.
