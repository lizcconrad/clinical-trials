    <description>For the purpose of facilitating future genetic laboratory investigations of late effects among of survivors of cancer, tumors, or a related illness. Patients in the ALTFU Program are followed for secondary malignant neoplasms and other adverse outcomes (so-called &quot;late effects&quot;) including cardiomyopathy, pulmonary fibrosis, cardiac valvular pathology, osteoporosis, and others. The following data will be ascertained from each study participant: (1) family history information will be ascertained using the Family History Questionnaire (Appendix A); and (2) saliva or blood samples for genetic analysis.</description>

    <description>The purpose of this study is to establish a registry of survivors of cancer, tumors,or a related illness. The registry will include detailed family history and germline DNA. Ultimately, we hope to improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to secondary malignant neoplasms and other late effects among survivors of cancer, tumors, or a related illness.</description>

    <intervention_name>Family History Questionnaire (FHQ)</intervention_name>
    <description>Consented subjects will be given the Family History Questionnaire (FHQ) to complete either in clinic or at home. Subjects who chose to complete the FHQ at home will be given a stamped envelope with a label. For participants who are children and cannot fill out the questionnaire on their own, the clinic RSA will instruct the parent, guardian, or legally authorized representative (LAR) present to fill out the questionnaire, reminding them that the &quot;You&quot; in the questionnaire refers to their child.</description>

    <description>The saliva samples will be collected in Oragene DNA Self-Collection Kits or a similar product. Patients will be instructed to donate about 2ml of saliva into a vial, which contains 2ml of product. Oragene or similar solution.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be offered the option of a blood collection instead of saliva. For adult subjects who opt for blood collection, two tubes of blood (approximately 20cc) will be drawn from the utilizing a sterile technique. For subjects under the age of 18 who opt for blood collection, approximately 3-5cc of blood will be collected utilizing a sterile technique.</description>
