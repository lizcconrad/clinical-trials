  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GSK557296 is being studied in women for the indication of enhanced embryo and or blastocyst
      implantation in women undergoing IVF treatment. This study will be the first dosing
      experience with this compound in women. It is important to characterize the pharmacokinetics
      of GSK557296 in women to determine the most appropriate doses and dosing regimens for future
      clinical studies. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of GSK557296 in women will also enable
      more accurate characterization of any exposure-response relationship in future studies.

      Two previous studies with GSK557296 were conducted in men with oral doses ranging from 10
      milligram (mg) to 200 mg. GSK557296 is being studied in women for the indication of enhanced
      embryo and or blastocyst implantation in women undergoing IVF treatment. This is a bridging
      study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK557296 in women to determine the most
      appropriate doses and dosing regimens for future clinical studies.

      This is a non-randomized, open label, adaptive design study in healthy female volunteers. A
      maximum total of 48 subjects, will participate in different cohorts. Subjects in Cohort 1
      will receive 10 mg single dose followed by repeat dose. A one week break will occur to allow
      for analysis of the PK data, prior to starting the second Cohort. Subjects in Cohort 2 will
      receive 150 mg single dose followed by repeat dose. Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 were adaptive based
      on the requirement of additional doses to be studies after PK data will be analyzed from each
      of the first 2 cohorts.
