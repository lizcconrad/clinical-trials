  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the relative change in thrombus volume as determined by two assessments (Baseline and
      Day 14-21) with magnetic resonance venography (MRV) in subjects with deep-vein thrombosis
      (DVT) treated with either an edoxaban monotherapy regimen or a low molecular weight (LMW)
      heparin/warfarin regimen.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The classical management of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of an initial
      treatment of at least five days of a (LMW) heparin followed by long-term treatment with a
      vitamin K antagonist (VKA), such as warfarin. The eTRIS study will address the clinically
      important question of whether edoxaban monotherapy, without concomitant (LMW) heparin at the
      time of treatment initiation is comparable to or better than standard treatment with (LMW)
      heparin/warfarin therapy in subjects with acute symptomatic DVT as assessed by the relative
      change from baseline in thrombus volume (measured by MRI) at Day 14-21.

      <recruitment_details>From September 2012 through January 2014, a total of 85 patients were enrolled at 26 centers in North America (US and Canada). One subject was not included in either the full analysis set or the safety analysis set because of major protocol violation - he did not take any dose of study drug.</recruitment_details>
