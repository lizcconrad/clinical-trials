    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to understand how nicotine addiction interacts with
      feeding behaviors and brain representation of food reward. The current proposal is part of a
      larger effort to begin a program of research to elucidate similarities and differences in
      perception of, and behavioral and neural response to, food and cigarette aromas as a function
      of 1) smoking status (smokers, ex-smokers who do gain weight, ex-smokers who do not gain
      weight, non-smokers), 2) internal state (hungry, full), and 3) cigarette deprivation (acute,
      chronic). A general hypothesis is that there are overlapping neural mechanisms governing food
      reward and cigarette reward in smokers and that this overlap includes incentive salience
      encoding.

      Weight gain frequently follows smoking cessation. Fear of weight gain is cited as a key
      reason not to quit and actual weight gain is a primary reason for relapse, especially among
      women. Although the causes of weight gain following smoking cessation are complex, increased
      caloric intake is recognized as one of the primary sources. One explanation for increased
      caloric intake is that, there are common neural mechanisms for food and cigarette reward and
      hence food reward can substitute for cigarette reward and vice versa. An alternative
      explanation for weight gain following smoking cessation is that there is an overall decrease
      in brain reward function during nicotine withdrawal, which leads to a decrease in the reward
      value of food and consequent increase in intake to maintain the total amount of reward
      obtained by food. The success of the proposed studies relies upon our ability to deliver
      odorants in the fMRI scanner and to measure neural activation in regions such as the
      amygdala, which are susceptible to inhomogeneity artifacts.

    <description>Subjects will be scanned on a 3T Trio magnet while tasting and smelling various food and non-food substances. Our primary outcome measure will be differential brain responses to taste and smell stimuli as a function of group (smokers vs. nonsmokers).</description>

    <description>Individuals that are right handed, and not claustrophobic were recruited. This same group was used for the smoking-group and refrain from smoking was evaluated by CO2 evaluation. To be classified as smokers, they had to report smoking 3-10 cigarettes daily for at least the last year and have a carbon monoxide reading of CO &gt;10 ppm.</description>
