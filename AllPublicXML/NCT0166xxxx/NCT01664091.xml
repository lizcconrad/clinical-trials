  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being done to carefully evaluate the effect of giving radiation
      therapy after temporary breast reconstruction. The investigators want to see if this type of
      reconstruction combined with radiation will look better (once the final reconstruction has
      been completed) and will reduce the risk that the participant will develop complications that
      sometimes occur with other kinds of reconstruction procedures. The investigators also want to
      know if it is easier to give the radiation with this type of reconstruction than with other
      kinds of reconstruction procedures. The reconstruction procedure involves the temporary use
      of a tissue expander and an acellular dermal matrix (ADM).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  ADMs have been used in combination with a tissue expander and radiotherapy but have not
           been studied formally in terms of their ability to avoid complications sometimes seen
           with other methods of reconstruction and improve the delivery of the radiation. The only
           difference between being on the study and not being on the study is that the research
           team will analyze the records of those who participate to see how easy it was to give
           the radiation, how good the cosmetic outcome of the reconstruction is and what, if any,
           complications occured.

        -  A minimum of 6 weeks between the surgery and the start of radiation therapy is required
           to allow for adequate healing. Often this interval will be longer, as many patients will
           receive chemotherapy in the interim. There is no maximum time from surgery to radiation.

        -  Around the time of radiation planning, the radiation oncologist and plastic surgeon will
           agree upon how much deflation of the tissue expander will be required to permit
           simulation of the radiation therapy.

        -  Radiation therapy to the chest wall (with or without adjacent lymph nodes) will be given
           once daily Monday through Friday over 5-7 weeks.

        -  After the completion of the radiation therapy, the tissue expander will be re-expanded
           and eventually replaced by the permanent implant or flap reconstruction at the
           discretion of the plastic surgeon.

        -  Participants will be expected to return to the Radiation Oncology Clinic for follow-up
           visits 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after the end of the radiation therapy. Evaluation of
           cosmetic results and complications will be done at these visits using a recognized
           scoring system and photographs taken at each time point and scored for specific items
           (necrosis, telangiectasia, etc).

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The success rate of immediate reconstruction with a tissue expander and acellular dermal matrix followed by radiation therapy.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcomes will be measured by the ability to complete RT and placement of the permanent implant and/or flap reconstruction, the absence of significant complications, and an acceptable cosmetic result. Major complications are defined as: infection requiring hospitalization, major revisions, early capsular contracture, or pain requiring implant removal. An acceptable cosmetic result (excellent or good, on a scale of excellent-good-fair-poor) is defined as: a stable reconstruction with good symmetry and contour relative to the contralateral breast. The rate of complications and the cosmetic outcome after RT will be recorded by the radiation oncologist at predetermined times (6, 12, 18 and 24 months) after completion of RT and by the plastic surgeon at follow-up visits using photographs.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the volumes of lung and heart (if left-sided) included in the radiation fields.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Lung volumes will be assessed as a percentage of the ipsilateral lung irradiated and via dose-volume histograms, and heart volumes will be measured in cubic centimeters (cc) and with a dose-volume histogram.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the extent and location of contracture.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Outcome will be measured by means of strict photographic analysis using five views (frontal, right and left lateral, and right and left quarter views) and independent assessment of the results by a plastic surgeon or radiation oncologist who has not treated the patient.The modified Baker classification will be used to score the extent of contracture seen in the photographs.</description>

        Participants will be invited to take part in this clinical trial because they have breast
        cancer that was recently treated with mastectomy and the participant and their doctors have
        decided that additional treatment with radiation therapy is the best course.

        Inclusion Criteria:

             permitted

          -  Patients must agree to return for scheduled follow-up visits with their radiation
             oncologist 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after RT (+/- 1 month)
