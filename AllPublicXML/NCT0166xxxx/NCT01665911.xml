  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be randomized, investigator-blind, observer-blind, laboratory analyst-blind
      and will utilize a 5-way cross-over study design with a primary objective to determine if a
      higher dose of fluoride in milk will provide a greater caries preventive effect. Secondary
      objectives are to determine in a higher concentration of fluoride in milk will provide a
      greater caries preventive effect and if the caries preventive effect of fluoridated milk
      follows a dose-response pattern.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The evidence of milk fluoridation as a public health measure in caries prevention has been
      demonstrated in many clinical studies. While these data are encouraging, the main focus now
      should be on the optimization of milk fluoride programs. This protocol will concentrate on
      the parameters of fluoride dose and concentration utilizing an in situ model, the intra-oral
      caries test or model (ICT). The ICT is an established model which features the use of
      gauze-covered specimens to facilitate plaque growth and to simulate a caries-prone/plaque
      stagnation area. After subject has been consented and enrolled in the study per the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, two to three days following a dental cleaning, two partially
      demineralized specimens will be placed in the buccal flange area of the subject's mandibular
      partial denture. During each of the five, three-week test periods, subjects will drink their
      assigned milk test product once per day for either five (100 ml milk) or ten (200 ml milk)
      timed minutes, wearing their mandibular partial dentures 24 hours a day during the test
      period. Fluoride free toothpaste will be used two to three days before and continuously
      during each treatment period. After each three-week test period, the two partially
      demineralized specimens will be removed from the subject's partial denture and analyzed using
      the surface microhardness test. Mineral content change (as percentage of surface
      microhardness recovery) in these artificially induced incipient enamel lesions will be the
      primary outcome variable. Each subject (n = 28) will serve as his or her own control.

    <measure>% Surface Microhardness (SMH) Recovery Score Per Each of Five Arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Weeks per each of five arms</time_frame>
    <description>surface microhardness recovery is a measure of caries lesion remineralization and is calculated using the following equation:
SMHr=(D1-R)/(D1-B)×100 B = indentation length of sound enamel specimen at baseline D1 = indentation length after first in vitro demineralization R = indentation length after intra-oral exposure (rehardening).</description>

    <measure>% Acid Resistance Score Per Each of Five Arms</measure>
    <time_frame>Three Weeks per each of five arms</time_frame>
    <description>% Acid Resistance is a measure of acid resistance of the remineralized caries lesion which is calculated as (D1-D2)/(D1-B)*100%, where B is the indentation length of sound enamel specimen at baseline, D1 is an indentation length after first in vitro demineralization, D2 is an indentation length after second in vitro demineralization.</description>

             in which written verification is obtained from their physician indicating their PT/INR
             levels (anti-coagulation blood levels) are at an acceptable level to avoid serious
             complications, such as bleeding during dental cleanings, may be accepted into the
             study at the discretion of the Investigator.)

          -  be currently taking or have ever taken a bisphosphonate drug (i.e. Fosamax®, Actonel®,

With a sample size of 28 subjects in a 5-way crossover study, the study will have 80% power to detect a %SMH recovery difference of 8.6%, assuming two-sided tests each conducted at a 5% significance level.</groups_desc>
