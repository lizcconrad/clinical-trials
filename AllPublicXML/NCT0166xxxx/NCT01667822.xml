  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies show that about 1 out of 3 patients in Primary Care suffer primarily from
      mental health disorders, such as anxiety disorders and depression. Cognitive behavior therapy
      (CBT) has been shown to be an effective treatment of these disorders. Despite the strong
      evidence for CBT there is a lack of evidence-based psychological treatment in primary care.
      For various reasons, the progress of research has not affected clinical practice. For
      successful implementation of CBT in primary care cost-effective therapies, access to
      therapists with proper training and supervision, evidence-based manuals and management that
      support the implementation is needed.

      Aim: The aim of this trial is to evaluate a stepped care model with CBT in primary care. All
      patients are first treated with self-help CBT (N = 400). Patients that do not improve after
      treatment (9 weeks) are randomized to individual CBT or continued self-help treatment. Based
      on published studies 2/3 is expected to be improved after self-help and therefore do not
      undergo randomization. 1/3 (n = 133) who didn´t respond to treatment is randomized to
      individual CBT (N = 67) or continued self-help treatment (N = 67).
