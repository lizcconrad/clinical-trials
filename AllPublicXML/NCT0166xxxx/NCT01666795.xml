      The objective of this human study was to evaluate the association between the specificity of
      anti-platelet autoantibodies and response to IVIG treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common autoimmune bleeding disorder, in which platelet
      surface GPIIb/IIIa and GPIb/IX are the two most frequently targeted autoantigens. Our
      previous studies in animal models of ITP demonstrated that intravenous immunoglobulin G
      (IVIG) could protect against anti-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated thrombocytopenia but failed to
      ameliorate ITP induced by most anti-GPIb/IX antibodies. The objective of this human study was
      to evaluate the association between the specificity of anti-platelet autoantibodies and
      response to IVIG treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  (1) the diagnosis of ITP was based on the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia and
             the absence of any obvious initiating and/or underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia
             in accordance with the recently released international consensus guidelines,(2) a
             diagnosis was established during the 4 weeks prior to initiation of IVIG treatment,
             (3) age ≥ 18 years, (4) a platelet count of ≤ 20 × 109/L, and (5) a bleeding score ≥ 9
             at the time of admission according to the clinical scoring system described by Khellaf
             et al. to assess the severity of hemorrhage.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  a history of any ITP-specific treatment administered prior to or concomitantly with
             the IVIG
