    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) of Tanibirumab in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer who are
      refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic option.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Tanibirumab in such patients

        -  To determine a recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Tanibirumab based on above
           assessments

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first-in-human, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalating study of
      Tanibirumab which is a fully human monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor
      receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR). This study will enroll patients with advanced or metastatic cancer
      who are refractory or for whom there are no standard therapeutic options. Tanibirumab will be
      administered intravenously to such patients over 60 minutes on Day 1, 8, and 15 (subject to
      change pending PK and toxicity data). Each treatment cycle will be a minimum of 28 days in
      length. The dose escalation study employing a 3 + 3 design is designed to identify the RP2D
      which will be based on safety, tolerability and PK of the RP2D. This study is expected to
      enroll a total of approximately 18-24 patients.

    <description>The safety and tolerability of Tanibirumab will be assessed using the following measures: frequency and nature of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs); nature, severity, and relatedness of adverse events, graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v4.0; changes in vital signs; and changes in clinical laboratory parameters.</description>

    <description>The following PK parameters will be derived from the serum concentration-time profile of Tanibirumab following administration: serum total exposure (AUC), Cmax, clearance, volume of distribution (central compartment Vc and at steady state Vss), and half-life (t½).</description>

    <description>The following activity outcome measures will be assessed: objective response, defined as a complete or partial response confirmed 4 weeks after initial documentation; duration of objective response; and progression-free survival.
