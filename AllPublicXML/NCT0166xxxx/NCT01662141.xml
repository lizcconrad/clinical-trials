  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of cardiac output (CO) and hemodynamic pressures are vital for proper
      management of severely hemodynamic compromised patients. A new ultrasound dilution method
      (COstatus) for cardiac output measurement has been developed.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The thermodilution technique with a pulmonary artery catheter has been the standard in adult
      patients for cardiac output measurement. However, using pulmonary artery catheter remains a
      major clinical problem in children due to technical and size constraints.

      COstatus measures changes in blood ultrasound velocity in an extracorporeal AV loop caused by
      body-temperature isotonic saline injected into the central vein and calculates cardiac output
      derived from a dilution curve.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children &lt;15 kg admitted to pediatric cardiac surgery for corrective surgery and
             mechanically ventilated were eligible for the study if parents provided informed
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with known significant tricuspid or mitral valve regurgitations or if it is
             detected by the preoperative transesophageal echocardiographic examination.

          -  Children with persistent severe arrhythmias.

          -  Children with remaining intracardiac shunts after surgery, which may adversely affect
             the measurement.
