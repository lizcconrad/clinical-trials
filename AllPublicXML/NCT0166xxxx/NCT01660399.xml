    <textblock>
      This predictive, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial is going to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two regimens of boanmycin plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as a
      second line treatment for chemotherapy for stage IIIb-IV or postoperative recurrent squamous
      cell lung cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, there is no reliable second line treatment except chemotherapy for squamous cell
      carcinoma patients, the current chemotherapy regimen, including docetaxel as a single agent
      which is known as the gold standard, the weekly using of docetaxel and the combination of
      EGFR-TKI has few evidence for high response rates and prolonged survival.On the other hand,
      the adverse reaction of chemotherapy makes the combined chemotherapy cannot improve
      therapeutic effects. Boanmycin with special pharmacological basis, as well as the high
      purity, may not obvious increase in adverse reactions, and probably improve the effect of
      chemotherapy. At the same time, because of its low lung toxicity, especially in the combined
      use of corticosteroids, and in the background of the poor survival of advanced squamous cell
      lung cancer patients, the chemotherapy regimen of boanmycin plus docetaxel needs to be
      investigated.

      This predictive, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial is going to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two regimens of boanmycin plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as a
      second line treatment for chemotherapy for stage IIIb-IV or postoperative recurrent squamous
      cell lung cancer patients.

      According to the test center, gender, disease staging (stage IIIB, IV/recurrence) and
      pathologic types, patients with squamous cell lung cancer were stratified and then randomly
      assigned to one of two groups. In the first group, 75 mg of docetaxel per square meter of
      body-surface area, administered on day 1, followed by 5~6 mg boanmycin of per square meter
      and 5mg dexamethasone on days 3,5,10 and 12, the cycle was repeated every 21days. The second
      group received the reference treatment: docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg per square meter was
      administered on on day 1 of a three-week cycle. The efficacy was evaluated using RESIST
      standard after every 2 cycles of the treatment, the regimen will continue until the disease
      progression or the appearance of not tolerable toxicity.
