  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether or not adding aprepitant(Emend®) to the
      standard therapy will help children who receive chemotherapy to have less nausea and
      vomiting.

      1.1 Primary Aim To determine the efficacy of aprepitant (Emend®) in preventing and reducing
      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when added to standard antiemetic drug
      regimens for children receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The working hypothesis will
      be that standard therapy + aprepitant is superior at preventing CINV than standard therapy +
      placebo.

      1.2 Secondary Aim To evaluate the safety and toxicity of aprepitant (Emend®) in children
      receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy when compared to standard antiemetic therapy +
      placebo.

During the next investigational antiemetic cycle, members of this arm will be crossed-over into the placebo arm, where the aprepitant will be replaced by placebo and the dexamethasone dose will be increased to 0.4 mg/kg (max 20 mg) daily.</description>
