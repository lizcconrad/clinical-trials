  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phases Ⅲ trials is divided into two stages,Ⅲa and Ⅲb.The aim of Ⅲa is to evaluate the
      optimal dosing dose of genetically modified recombinant human IL-11 (mIL-11) in a multicenter
      randomized self-control trial involving 60 cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.The aim of
      Ⅲb is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of genetically modified recombinant human IL-11
      (mIL-11), using rhIL-11 as an active control, in a multicenter randomized trial involving 240
      cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.

    <textblock>
      The investigators recently developed a mutant form of rhIL-11 with improved stability. In in
      vitro experimental systems, mIL-11 was shown to endure chemical and proteolytic stresses more
      effectively, while retaining the biological activity of the original rhIL-11. The improved
      stability of mIL-11 was also demonstrated in the comparative pharmacokinetic study of
      subcutaneously delivered mIL-11 and rhIL-11 in the rodent and primate models. Based on its
      improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features. In Phase II study shows that mIL-11 is
      well tolerated and has thrombopoietic activity equivalent to one third of the clinical dose
      of rhIL-11, indicating the potential of mIL-11 for use in the treatment of CIT. This study is
      a phase III, single-blinded, randomized,multicenter,cross-over study designed to evaluate
      optimal dosing dose and efficacy and safety of mIL-11 on CIT patients receiving suitable
      chemotherapeutic regimen for treating cancer.
