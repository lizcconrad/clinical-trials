    <textblock>
      This is a treatment guideline for a second or greater allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) using a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in patients with non-malignant
      or malignant diseases. This regimen, consisting of busulfan, fludarabine, and low dose total
      body irradiation (TBI), is designed to promote engraftment in patients who failed to achieve
      an acceptable level of donor-derived engraftment following a previous allogeneic HCT.

      There is no research element except the collection of routine clinical data. Patients will
      consent to allow routine clinical data to be collected and maintained in OnCore, the Masonic
      Cancer Center's (MCC) clinical database, and specific transplant related endpoints in the
      University Of Minnesota Blood and Bone Marrow Database as part of the historical database
      maintained by the department.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of any disease for which a second or greater hematopoietic stem cell
             transplant is needed due to insufficient donor chimerism following hematopoietic
             recovery after previous HSCT. Determination of &quot;insufficiency of donor chimerism&quot; will
             be made by the treating transplant physician. Occasionally donor derived engraftment
             may be present, but sustained aplasia or failed recovery of sufficient hematopoiesis
             requires administration of a second graft. This intervention may be used for both
             situations.

          -  Donor Availability: Patients considered for transplantation must have a sufficient
             graft as based on current criteria of the University of Minnesota Blood and Marrow
             Transplantation Program

               -  Transplantation using sufficiently matched related donors (such as matched
                  siblings) or unrelated donors will be considered. Both granulocyte-colony
                  stimulating factor (GCSF) stimulated peripheral blood grafts and bone marrow
                  grafts will be considered, although bone marrow will be the priority.

               -  Cord blood grafts, both related and unrelated, are also eligible. As this
                  protocol will use a reduced intensity regimen, this protocol will use the current
                  recommendations of the University of Minnesota for choosing cord blood grafts. If
                  a single cord blood unit cell dose is insufficient, double cord transplantation
                  should be considered if sufficiently matched cord blood units are available. The
                  priority of choosing cord blood donors is based on the current institutional
                  recommendations.

               -  Exclusion of Metabolic Disorder or other Inherited Disorder Carrier Status from
                  related donor and unrelated cord blood grafts as appropriate for primary disease.

        At the discretion of the treating transplant physician, an allograft from the previous
        donor may be used, if available.

          -  Age, Performance Status, Consent

               -  Age: 0 to 55 years

               -  Consent: voluntary written consent (adult or parental/guardian)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous irradiation that precludes the safe administration of an additional dose of
             200 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI). Radiation Oncology will evaluate all patients
             who have had previous radiation therapy or TBI for approval to receive an additional
             200 cGy of TBI

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding

          -  Active, uncontrolled infection - infection that is stable or improving after 1 week of
             appropriate therapy (4 weeks for presumed or documented fungal infections) will be
             permitted

          -  HIV positive

          -  While it would be advantageous to begin therapy on this second transplant regimen &gt; 6
             months following a prior myeloablative regimen or &gt;2 months after a reduced intensity
             regimen, it is recognized that there are circumstances where this may not be
             practical.
