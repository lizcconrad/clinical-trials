      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if erlotinib can help to control AML.
      The safety of this drug will also be studied.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      You will take erlotinib by mouth 1 time each day.

      If you have severe side effects from the study drug, the study doctor may decide to stop your
      drug dosing until the side effects get better.

      Study Visits:

      Every week for the first 3 months and then every 2-4 weeks after that, blood (about 1
      tablespoon) will be drawn for routine tests and to test your liver and kidney function. After
      6 months, blood will be drawn every 6-8 weeks.

      At the end of Cycle 1 and then every 2-3 months after that, you will have a complete physical
      exam, and you will be asked about any side effects you may have or any drugs you are taking.

      At the end of Cycle 1 and then every 2-3 months after that for 1 year, you will have a bone
      marrow aspirate. After 1 year, you will only have additional bone marrow aspirates performed
      if the study doctor thinks it is necessary.

      If you have no significant side effects during the first 12 months, the number of blood draws
      and bone marrow collections may be lowered to 1 every 1-3 cycles.

      Length-of-Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the study doctor thinks it is in your
      best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse,
      if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      End-of-Treatment Visit:

      You will have an end-of-treatment visit 30 days (+/- 7 days) after your last dose of
      erlotinib.

      At this visit, you will be asked about any symptoms and/or side effects you may have. The
      end-of-treatment visit can be done by phone or during one of your standard of care clinic
      visits at MD Anderson. If this visit is done by phone, the call should last about 15 minutes.

      This is an investigational study. Erlotinib is not FDA approved and commercially available
      for the treatment of AML. In this disease type, it is currently being used for research
      purposes only.

      Up to 29 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with AML who have either been refractory to prior therapy or have relapsed
             after prior therapy. Patients with MDS or CMML who received therapy with a
             hypomethylating agent and progress to AML are eligible if they have received any
             therapy for MDS and failed (i.e., lack or loss of response) regardless of whether they
             have received therapy for AML or not. The WHO classification will be used for AML.

          2. Age &gt;/=18 years

          3. ECOG Performance Status &lt;/=2

          4. Adequate liver (total bilirubin &lt;/=2x ULN, ALT &lt;/=2.5x ULN) and renal (creatinine
             &lt;/=2x ULN) function.

          5. Patients must provide written informed consent.

          6. Patients must have been off chemotherapy for 2 weeks prior to entering this study,
             unless there is evidence of rapidly progressive disease, and must have recovered from
             the clinically significant toxic effects of that therapy to at least grade 1. Use of
             hydroxyurea for patients with rapidly proliferative disease is allowed before the
             start of study therapy and for the first four weeks on therapy.

          7. Patients - both males and females - with reproductive potential (ie, menopausal for
             less than 1 year and not surgically sterilized) must practice effective contraceptive
             measures throughout the study. Women of childbearing potential must provide a negative
             pregnancy test (serum or urine) within 14 days prior to initiation of study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with known allergy or hypersensitivity to erlotinib.

          2. Patients with any other known disease (except carcinoma in-situ) concurrent severe
             and/or uncontrolled medical condition (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes; cardiovascular
             disease including congestive heart failure NYHA Class III or IV, myocardial infarction
             within 6 months, and poorly controlled hypertension; chronic renal failure; or active
             uncontrolled infection) which, in the opinion of the investigator could compromise
             participation in the study.

          3. Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.

          4. Significant gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with absorption of
             erlotinib.

          5. Patients who can receive a stem cell transplant within 4 weeks.
