    <textblock>
      This open-label, multi-center study will evaluate the progression-free survival and safety of
      erlotinib in participants with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with
      activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor
      (EGFR). Participants will receive daily oral doses of erlotinib until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.
