  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the laboratory, Kevetrin activates p53, a tumor suppressor protein that has an important
      role in protecting the body. p53 functions by activating proteins that repair DNA and kill
      cells that have genetic mutations such as in cancers. Research experiments showed that when
      cancer cells were treated with Kevetrin, it activated p53 which induced p21, a protein that
      inhibits cancer cell growth. p53 also induced PUMA (p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis),
      a protein that causes tumor cell death. Because of these activities, slowing cancer cell
      growth and causing cancer cell death, Kevetrin may help to treat tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Kevetrin was found to be effective in pre-clinical studies of human xenograft tumor models
      and was reasonably well-tolerated at therapeutic doses in the non-clinical animal studies.
      Kevetrin was also effective in multi-drug resistant tumor models; therefore, Kevetrin has the
      potential to treat tumors that have become resistant to standard chemotherapy. This trial
      will determine tolerance in humans and, possibly, efficacy with a Phase I, open-label,
      dose-escalation, safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic study of Kevetrin, in adult
      patients with solid tumors.

      The primary objectives are the following:

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Kevetrin.

        -  To determine the dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of Kevetrin.

        -  To establish a safe dose level of Kevetrin that can be used for future studies.

      The secondary objectives are to determine the following:

        -  The pharmacokinetics of Kevetrin in humans.

        -  Observe for evidence of antitumor activity following administration of Kevetrin.

        -  If Kevetrin induces changes in the biomarker p21 in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

        -  If there is a pharmacodynamic relationship between the plasma concentrations of Kevetrin
           and a clinical or cellular effect.

      During each 4 week cycle, each patient will receive three weekly doses of Kevetrin given as a
      1 hour intravenous infusion followed by a 1 week off-treatment period. Following each dose,
      each patient will be monitored. If the patients have acceptable safety and tolerance,
      Kevetrin will be given once weekly for a total of 3 weeks. During each cycle patients will be
      evaluated for safety, tolerance, and Dose-Limiting Toxicity (DLT) that occur during a cycle.

    <measure>Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Kevetrin</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>A dose will be declared the MTD if at least 1 patient out of 6 patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at the highest dose level below the maximally administered dose. Once an MTD has been established, up to 12 additional patients may be enrolled at the MTD dose level for confirmation of safety.
The maximally administered dose is if 1 or more of 6 patients experience a DLT.</description>

    <measure>Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLT) of Kevetrin.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The definition of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is in accord with the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE). Dose limiting toxicity will be defined as:
Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia complicated by fever, or greater than 38.5°C documented infection, or Grade 4 neutropenia of greater than 7 days duration
Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or grade 3 thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage
Any grade greater than 3 non-hematologic toxicity unless there is clear alternative evidence that the adverse event (AE) was not caused by Kevetrin
Grade 3 diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting may be excluded from dose-limiting toxicities provided that the maximum time limit for supportive measures is 48 hours.</description>

    <description>The pharmacokinetics (PK) of Kevetrin will be determined for all patients enrolled in the study on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 2. Blood samples will be obtained before dosing, 30 minutes after starting the infusion, 1 hr, 1 hr 10 min, 1 hr 20 min, 1 hr 30 min, 1 hr 45 min, 2 hr, 2 hr 30 min, 3 hr, 4 hr, 5 hr, 7 hr, and 24 hr after the initiation of the infusion.
The pharmacokinetic profile will be analyzed by standard noncompartmental methods to provide estimated values of the pharmacokinetic parameters and associated variables, such as area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of Kevetrin. Associations between pharmacokinetic variables and drug-related toxicities will be evaluated.</description>
