  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain as a result of nerve injury (neuropathic pain) is a particularly severe form of chronic
      pain. Common examples of neuropathic pain are pain due to diabetes and shingles. There is
      good evidence that an intravenous infusion of lidocaine (local anesthetic) is useful for the
      management of neuropathic pain in the short term - up to six hours.

      This study will examine the role of intravenous lidocaine in the relief of neuropathic pain
      over four weeks following infusion compared to a salt water infusion. If we can show that
      intravenous lidocaine provides sustained benefit for up to one month, this will be a major
      advance in the management of individuals suffering from neuropathic pain.
