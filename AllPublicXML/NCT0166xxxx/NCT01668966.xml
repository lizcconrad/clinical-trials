    <textblock>
      This open-label, single arm, multicenter long-term extension study of WA19926 (NCT01649804)
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of tocilizumab in participants with early moderate to
      severe rheumatoid arthritis who have completed the 104-week WA19926 (NCT01649804) core study.
      Eligible participants will be those who are expected to benefit from the study medicine based
      on the investigator's discretion.
