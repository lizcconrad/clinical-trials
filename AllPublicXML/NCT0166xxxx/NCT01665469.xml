  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of the study is that tomato extracted lycopene will be able to decrease
      postprandial oxidation and inﬂammation in healthy weight men and women when compared to
      Placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Consumption of a high-fat meal results in a postprandial (fed-state) response characterized
      by hypertriglyceridemia. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia increases the oxidation of
      low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and increases blood concentrations of several biomarkers of
      inﬂammation. This postprandial lipemia-induced oxidative stress mediated response to a
      high-fat meal has been suggested as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of
      atherosclerosis along with other chronic disease states of diabetes and obesity. Consumption
      of foods rich in antioxidant compounds provides a defence source to compliment endogenous
      defence systems to protect against oxidative damage during pro-oxidant conditions.
