  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the use of investigational compound 124I-NM404 for
      accurate detection and characterization of a wide variety of solid primary and metastatic
      malignancies anywhere in the body.

      124I-NM404 is a new investigational agent being developed to better identify local tumors and
      cancerous tumors using imaging technologies such as positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
      An investigational drug is a drug that has not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) and is available for research use only. 124I-NM404 is only taken up by
      the cancer cells, not the normal cells. Compared to traditional methods such as CT (computed
      tomography) or MRI (Magnetic resonance imaging), 124I-NM404 may help physicians more
      accurately see and evaluate cancerous tumors. This agent has been safely studied in animals
      and a limited number of human patients with lung cancer. This study is being done to
      determine the best dose to use and to fully evaluate the images that result from using this
      new agent.

        Subjects will be referred to the Phase I oncology research office by their treating
        oncologist. Outside referrals will be managed by Cancer Connect who will ensure that
        potential subjects are first evaluated by a UW medical oncologist in the cancer clinic who
        will then refer them, if appropriate, to the Phase I oncology office.
