  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to verify through clinical measurement that the NUPRO Sensodyne
      Prophylaxis Paste with Novamin provides immediate sensitivity relief as well as extended
      relief up to 28 days.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the prophy paste with Novamin will give patients immediate
      sensitivity relief, as well as sensitivity relief up to 4 weeks (28 days) after measurement.

    <description>Pre-prophy procedure baseline assessment using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity scale (0-3).
Air blast hypersensitivity is measured using the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivty scale (0-3). The scale is scored as follows:
0=Subject does not respond to stimulus; 1= Subject responds to stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from air stimulus; 3=Subject responds to stimulus, considers it painful and requests discontinuation.
The higher the score, the higher the hypersensitivity.

        <description>Pre-prophy procedure baseline assessment using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity scale (0-3).
Air blast hypersensitivity is measured using the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivty scale (0-3). The scale is scored as follows:
0=Subject does not respond to stimulus; 1= Subject responds to stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from air stimulus; 3=Subject responds to stimulus, considers it painful and requests discontinuation.
The higher the score, the higher the hypersensitivity.
Subjects were required to have two sensitive teeth which are not adjacent to each other and preferably in different quadrants. Scores were obtained by taking the average over the scores for the evaluated teeth.</description>

          <title>Baseline Pre-Prophy Assessment (Air Blast Sensitivity)</title>
          <description>Pre-prophy procedure baseline assessment using Schiff Cold Air Sensitivity scale (0-3).
Air blast hypersensitivity is measured using the Schiff Cold Air Sensitivty scale (0-3). The scale is scored as follows:
0=Subject does not respond to stimulus; 1= Subject responds to stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2=Subject responds to stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from air stimulus; 3=Subject responds to stimulus, considers it painful and requests discontinuation.
The higher the score, the higher the hypersensitivity.
Subjects were required to have two sensitive teeth which are not adjacent to each other and preferably in different quadrants. Scores were obtained by taking the average over the scores for the evaluated teeth.</description>
