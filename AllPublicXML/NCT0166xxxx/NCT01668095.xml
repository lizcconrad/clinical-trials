      This research trial studies tumor tissue to identify important proteins and biomarkers from
      patients with rhabdomyosarcoma that has spread to other places in the body and usually cannot
      be cured or controlled with treatment. Studying samples of tumor tissue from patients with
      cancer in the laboratory may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate whether the expression of a subset of proteins (by immunohistochemistry),
      known to be Involved in the paired box (Pax)3, Pax7, and Patched-1 neuromuscular development
      pathways, are dysregulated in advanced and relapsed alveolar and embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas.

      OUTLINE:

      Immunohistochemistry is performed for each candidate target (Pax3, Pax7, and Patched-1) in
      each disease (alveolar, embryonal, and anaplastic rhabdomyosarcoma) for tissue microarray
      analysis.
