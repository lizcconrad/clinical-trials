  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consenting patients scheduled for esophageal resection surgery will be randomized to receive
      standard nutrition counseling (including nutritional supplements as needed) or standard
      nutrition counseling and exercise 4 weeks before surgery and 8 weeks after surgery.

      It is hypothesized that, compared with the group receiving nutrition alone, the addition of
      physical exercise to nutrition starting before surgery and continuing for 8 weeks after
      surgery will have a significantly greater impact on functional walking capacity during the
      prehabilitation period and during the postoperative period, and on the incidence of
      postoperative pulmonary complications.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study in patients undergoing esophageal resection for cancer to
      determine the impact of multimodal prehabilitation on functional exercise capacity and
      postoperative pulmonary complications. Patients who accept to be enrolled in the study will
      be randomized to receive either a standard nutritional intervention (including supplements as
      needed) as per current institution policy or standard nutritional intervention (including
      supplements as needed) combined with a physical exercise program before and after surgery.

      Specific aims

      The aims of this research project are the following:

        1. To determine the extent in which a multimodal prehabilitation regimen optimizes
           functional recovery in patients suffering from esophageal cancer and the incidence of
           postoperative pulmonary complications.

        2. To understand further which measures of immediate surgical recovery are sensitive to
           prehabilitation interventions, and predict change in later outcome measures.

    <measure>6 minute walk test (6MWT)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The 6MWT evaluates the ability of an individual to maintain a moderate level of physical activity over a time period reflective of the activities of daily living. Subjects are instructed to walk back and forth, in a 20 m stretch of hallway, for six minutes, at a pace that would make them tired by the end of the walk; encouragement and feedback are given according to published guidelines.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will follow standard MUHC protocol of nutritional counseling and supplementation as needed in order to maintain caloric and protein requirements in the preoperative period.

    <description>The exercise component will consist of 20 min of general exercise training, 3 days per week, alternating between aerobic and resistance training. The exercise program will be individualized based upon the baseline fitness test (according to the American College of Sport Medicine, ACMS, standard) and will include: a 5 min warm-up, either 25 min of aerobic exercise (starting at 30- 40 of heart rate reserve, HRR), or 25 min of resistance training (5 exercises targeting major muscle groups performed at an intensity of 8-12 repetition maximum), and a 5 min cool-down.</description>
