  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Remote ischaemic conditioning (RIC) is known to reduce infarct size post MI when used in the
      peri/immediate post infarct period. However little is known as to the effect of repeated
      remote conditioning post-MI (Myocardial Infarction) on not only infarct size, but also on
      ventricular remodeling and ultimately cardiac failure. In this phase II first in man trial,
      the investigators intend to carry out daily remote ischaemic conditioning in post MI
      patients. The principal hypothesis is that RIC applied on a daily basis for 4 weeks following
      a heart attack improves the ejection fraction at 4 months as assessed by cardiac magnetic
      resonance imaging.
