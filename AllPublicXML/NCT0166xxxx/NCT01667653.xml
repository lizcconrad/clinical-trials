  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single centre; 21 days phase II
      clinical trial on healthy volunteers. Following baseline visit at the day of randomization,
      treatment with Augmentin 875mg for 7 days will be given. Concurrently and after antibiotic
      treatment subjects will also receive the study treatment, either probiotic or placebo. Daily
      Bowel Habit Diary will be completed by the subjects. The subjects will be asked to collect
      fecal samples for microbiological examination. The primary objective of the study is to
      evaluate the maintenance of intestinal microbiota composition during antibiotic treatment
      with Augmentin 875mg. Secondary objectives will be to evaluate the reduction in side effects
      associated with antibiotic use.
