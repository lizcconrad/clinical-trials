  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the results of conservative and surgical treatment, to
      create an algorithm for the management of the disease, and gain more information about the
      etiology, pathogenesis, and course of the disease. The investigators hypothesise that
      surgical treatment of UPS will be better than conservative management in terms of recurrence
      rate, healing time, patient comfort and satisfaction, and cost effectiveness.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because of its rarity, umbilical pilonidal sinus (UPS) is still poorly understood in terms of
      diagnosis, etiology, and the best treatment options.

      UPS is thought caused by hair penetrating the skin, leading to a foreign-body reaction and
      development of a sinus lined with granulation tissue. Most of the patients complain of pain,
      discharge or bleeding from the umbilicus when symptoms develop. It can be diagnosed with a
      careful examination, in which hairs can be seen deep in the umbilicus and usually protrude
      from a small sinus.

      Regarding the optimal treatment of the disease, a complete consensus has not yet been
      achieved. Some publications are recommended conservative treatment, while surgical treatment
      is recommended in others.

      A more meaningful comparison of the two modalities is that of a randomized controlled trial.
      We, therefore, present our data of prospective randomized controlled clinical trial comparing
      conservative versus surgical treatment of UPS.

      This was a multicenter, prospective balanced randomization, double blind, active-controlled,
      parallel-group, superiority study conducted in Turkey, under the direction of a principal
      investigator (MK). Eligible patients with UPS were randomized for either conservative
      treatment (CT) or surgical treatment (ST), and then the results of both groups were compared.
