  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is an acquired discoloration of the skin characterized by brown colour changes
      commonly on the face.The duration of this double-blind clinical trial will be 12 weeks. The
      control group will receive treatment with topical Hydroquinone (4%), and the other group
      topical miconazole. Miconazol has antimelanotic properties and can be used as treatment for
      melasma patients. The estimated number of subjects to be recruited and randomized for the
      study is at least 30. The purpose of this study is determine if there is a difference in the
      effectiveness of these two agents. Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score will be
      assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Photographs, colorimetry
      and histological assessment will be also evaluated. Occurrence of adverse effects will also
      be recorded.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Melasma is a common acquired hypermelanosis in dark skin populations, usually characterized
      by symmetrical, irregular macules occurring in photo-exposed areas such as face. Treatment
      with depigmenting compounds such as hydroquinone, are still the gold standard in this
      condition. Miconazol has depigmented properties that could be used as part of the treatment
      in melasma patients. This effect is exerted by inhibiting the tyrosinase enzyme. So, the
      primary objective of this study is to compare the depigmenting activity of miconazole against
      hydroquinone.

      Patients who are included in the study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the
      treatments, which should use for 12 weeks. The medications should be applied in the affected
      regions twice a day.

      The evaluation of clinical improvement will be done in a blinded modality by means of the
      MASI score, the Global Physician Assessment, as well as colorimetry and histological melanin
      content. Evaluations will be held on visits at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Skin biopsy will be taken
      at onset and at 12 weeks.

      At the end of the study, data will be compared concerning the former parameters. All side
      effects will be recorded and analysed.

    <description>The total score would range from 0-24, involving the forehead (30%), right malar (30%), left malar (30%) and chin (10%), and using area of involvement (0=absent, 1=&lt;10%, 2=10%-29%, 3=30%-49%, 4=50%-69%, 5=70%-89% and 6=90%-100%) and darkness (0=absent, 1=slight, 2=mild, 3=marked and 4=severe). Computation would be as follows: 0.3 A(f) D(f) + 0.3 A(lm) D(lm) + 0.3 A(rm) D(rm) + 0.1 A(c) D(c).</description>
