  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the use of nebulized hypertonic saline (aerosolized salt water) as a
      preventive treatment for post-traumatic acute lung injury (ALI). Both animal and human
      research indicate that aerosolized salt water might help reduce harmful inflammation with
      minimal risks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite over 40 years of investigation, acute lung injury (ALI) remains a leading cause of
      morbidity in critically ill patients, and a disease for which there is no effective
      pharmacologic therapy. Our group and others have focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of
      intravenous hypertonic saline (HTS) acting on the injured endothelium with promising results
      experimentally, but failed to confirm the benefit clinically. Recent work, however, has shown
      that inhaled or nebulized HTS targeted at the epithelium is safe and effective in treating
      cystic fibrosis, COPD, and neonatal bronchiolitis. Recognizing the central role of the
      pulmonary epithelium in ALI, nebulization has the advantage of achieving high concentrations
      of the therapy without producing systemic side effects. Thus, we hypothesize that nebulized
      hypertonic saline will attenuate acute lung injury following trauma.

    <time_frame>baseline and every 6 hours for 36 hours</time_frame>
    <description>For intubated patients - A decrease greater than 20% in PaO2/FiO2 (P/F) ratios will trigger DSMB review. For not intubated patients - a) the need to increase FiO2 by 10% (approximate 4 liter/minute increase) to maintain a peripheral oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 90% during nebulizer treatment; b) evidence of respiratory distress (as documented in the chart by the patient's attending) during nebulizer treatment; and c) respiratory insufficiency requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation at any point will trigger DSMB review.</description>

For every 5 patients, if the rate of lung dysfunction for this patient population is less than 50% the expected rate based on our clinical trauma database over the past 5 years, a DSMB review will be triggered.</description>

    <description>Ventilator free days will be tracked with 28 days as a reference. If the number of VFDs for this patient population is greater than one standard deviation of the predicted value for every 5 patients based on our clinical trauma database over the past 5 years, a DSMB review will be triggered.</description>
