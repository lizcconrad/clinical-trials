      The purpose of this study is to determine whether All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are
      effective in the treatment of refractory idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (RITP).

      Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP), an acquired immune disease is characterized by
      impaired generation of autoantibody-specific platelet. At least 30% adult patients turn into
      refractory ITP. The pathogenesis of ITP remains to be elucidated. Now ,CD4+ helper cells have
      been classified as belong to T-helper 1(TH1), T-helper 2(TH2), T-helper17and Regulory T
      cell(Tregs). All-trans retinoic acid(ATRA) mainly applied in skin disease and acute
      promyelocytic leukemia. Recently, ATRA is also a immunomodulator which can induce
      differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis of cells, and immunomudulatory. In the
      international, the investigators first treat RITP with ATRA. To investigate the therapeutic
      effects of ATRA on RITP, and using new index in the cells, cytokines and molecular biology of
      three in-depth study of its mechanism.
