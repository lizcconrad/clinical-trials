      Phase Ib/IIa clinical trial of a new medicinal product of the somatic cell therapy class
      (eASCs). This study is designed as a multicenter, single blind, fixed dose escalation, with
      three treatment groups, controlled with placebo (randomization 3:1) whose target population
      are patients with rheumatoid arthritis refractory to at least two biologic.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traditionally, RA has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
      glucocorticoids and non-biologics-DMARDs. Only non-biologics-DMARDs and, at a lesser extent,
      glucocorticoids have shown to be able to prevent or interrupt the inflammatory and
      destructive disease processes.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are nonhematopoietic stromal cells that are able to
      differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as bone, cartilage, muscle, ligament, tendon, and
      adipose. MSCs can be easily isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue and rapidly expanded
      in culture. MSCs have also been shown to have immuno-suppressive and healing capacities,
      improve angiogenesis and prevent fibrosis. These properties could be used for novel
      therapeutic applications in various disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis
      (OA), genetic bone and cartilage disorders and bone metastasis. MSCs can potently modulate
      immune responses, showing antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory capacities.

      This study is a multicenter phase Ib/IIa, escalating dose, single blind clinical trial to
      assess the safety of the intravenous administration of expanded allogeneic adipose-derived
      mesenchymal stem cells (eASCs) to refractory rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety, feasibility and tolerance, and
      to identify, if possible, the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the dose for future clinical
      trials on efficacy of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs for patients suffering
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA) under treatment with at least one non-biologic-Disease modifying
      antirheumatoid drug (DMARD) who have previously failed to treatment with at least two
      biologics. The secondary objective is to obtain information on the clinical and functional
      effects of the intravenous infusion of allogeneic eASCs in patients with RA and to explore
      pharmacodynamics parameters.

      53 patients (i.e. patients having received at least one dose of study treatment) in three
      different cohorts are planned to be included in this clinical trial. Expansion will start
      after acute toxicity assessment of the first three patients of each cohort.

      Dose and intervals for the trial consist of the following active groups: a) first cohort: 1
      million cells/kg administered at days 1, 8 and 15; b) second cohort: 2 million cells / kg
      administered at days 1, 8 and 15; c) third cohort: 4 million cells / kg administered at days
      1, 8 and 15.

             complete response duration of &gt;10 years. In the case of lymphoma or breast cancer
             patients will be allowed to participate in the trial with a complete response duration
             of &gt;20 years.

          8. Other autoimmune diseases, previous or current inflammatory joint disease other than
             rheumatoid arthritis, currently active or previous recurrent bacterial, viral, fungal,

             mycobacterial disease, clinically significant abnormalities on chest radiograph,
             hepatitis B and C, and recurrent herpes zoster.

          9. Chronic or ongoing active infectious disease requiring systemic treatment such as, but
             not limited to, chronic renal infection, chronic chest infection with bronchiectasis,
             Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (TB) and active hepatitis B and C.

             For the screening of latent TB, the results of the tests performed in the last year
             according to the usual practice of the center or local guidelines will be accepted, as
             long as the investigator rules out a situation of high contact risk in the months
             after the last screening in accordance with the medical history of the patient.

             If the patient has a recent chest X-ray (performed in the month prior to enrollment in
             the study) and there is no clinical evidence or history suggestive of recent contact,
             it will not be necessary to repeat the test.

         10. Subjects with signs of latent TB can be included if they have started treatment
             according to local guidelines at least one month prior to starting investigational
             therapy.

             infarction within six months from screening, congestive heart failure of worse than
             grade II of the New York criteria.

         12. Significant concurrent, uncontrolled medical condition including, but not limited to,

             HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies as follows:

               -  Subjects positive for HBsAg are excluded.

               -  Subjects negative for HBsAg but positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBs
                  antibodies were eligible to participate.

               -  Subjects negative for HBsAg and anti-HBc antibody but positive for anti-HBs
                  antibody are eligible to participate.

               -  Subjects negative for HBsAg and anti-HBs antibody but positive for anti-HBc
                  antibody required clarification of their status by testing for HB DNA which if
                  positive excludes the subject from participation.

                    -  Patients with documented vaccination against hepatitis B (primary and

         22. Subjects known or suspected of not being able to comply with a study protocol (e.g.
             due to alcoholism, drug dependency or psychological disorder).

         23. MRI is unfeasible, (e.g. due to the presence of pacemakers, hip replacements or severe
             claustrophobia).

         24. Subjects with impossibility of having a radiological exploration.
