  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial assessing the impact of a simple evidence-based
      protocol for the treatment severe sepsis with hypotension in Zambia. This is a follow-up
      study to the Simplified Severe Sepsis Protocol (SSSP) study. The intervention protocol
      consists of a scheduled fluid regimen, early blood culture and antibiotics, and dopamine and
      blood transfusion when necessary. It is hypothesized that the protocol will significantly
      decrease in-hospital mortality in patients with severe sepsis and hypotension.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, evidence-based protocols of bundled therapies have improved survival of
      severe sepsis in developed countries. In sub-Saharan Africa, simple therapies such as IV
      fluids and early antibiotics are frequently under-utilized. Studies of fluid interventions in
      the region, however, have demonstrated conflicting results. Outcomes in septic patients may
      be further affected by delays in the diagnosis of tuberculosis-associated severe sepsis.

      The aims of this study are (1) To assess the impact on survival of a simple evidence-based
      protocol for severe sepsis with hypotensionor septic shock, (2) To evaluate the cost of
      implementation for a simplified severe sepsis protocol, (3) To develop a clinical diagnostic
      score for identifying tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis, and (4) To
      assess the performance of the Xpert TB/RIF rapid PCR system and urine lipoarabinomannan assay
      for diagnosing tuberculosis in HIV positive patients with severe sepsis.
