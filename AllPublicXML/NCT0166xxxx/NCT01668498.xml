  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      80 - 90 % of the patients treated with anti-EGFR antibodies (panitumumab or cetuximab)
      experience skin toxicity, mostly acne like skin rash.

      A standardized treatment of skin rash is neither established as standard arm for clinical
      trials nor as guideline for the treatment of skin toxicity in clinical practice. While an
      improvement of QoL has been demonstrated for panitumumab and cetuximab in comparison to best
      supportive care the data basis for patient related outcomes regarding skin toxicity deriving
      from randomized trials is still small.

      Recent surveys among German oncologist revealed that physicians are reluctant to use oral
      antibiotics as preemptive treatment . Only 19 out of 110 oncologists stated that they are
      thinking about using preemptive treatment in patients with acne-like skin rash.

      Thus, in the present trial two main questions will be addressed:

      (i) Can preemptive treatment with oral doxycycline be replaced by a sequential skin treatment
      strategy (i.e. local treatment with erythromycin followed by doxycycline in case of
      inefficacy = development of acne) without compromising treatment efficacy of skin toxicity
      treatment? (ii) Comparison of general and skin related QoL between both treatment arms.
