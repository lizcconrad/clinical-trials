      -  Ninety patients suffering from active rheumatoid arthritis despite continued treatment
           with methotrexate will be evaluated for improvement of disease activity when taking
           GLPG0634 (4 different doses will be evaluated) or matching placebo for 4 weeks.

        -  During the course of the study, patients will also be examined for any side effects that
           may occur, and the amount of GLPG0634 present in the blood as well as the effects of
           GLPG0634 on disease- and mechanism of action-related parameters in the blood will be
           determined.
