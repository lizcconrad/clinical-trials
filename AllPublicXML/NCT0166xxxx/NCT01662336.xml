  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of the study was to describe the real-life adherence, effectiveness and
      safety of the Kaletra Adherence Support Assistance (KASA) Program in human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-positive patients who were receiving treatment with lopinavir / ritonavir (LPV/r;
      Kaletra®) in Canada.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Kaletra Adherence Support Assistance (KASA) Program is a customized support network that
      has been offered to patients treated with lopinavir / ritonavir (LPV/r; Kaletra®). KASA
      offers individual counseling with an HIV experienced nurse who assists patients with various
      aspects of their therapy including life-style changes, emotional stress, and adverse events.
      Patients enrolled in KASA may also have access to various healthcare professionals
      (dietician, social worker, psychologist, etc.) or may be offered other types of support
      (transportation, exercise, etc.), which may help improve their quality of life as well as
      adherence or compliance while taking LPV/r.

      This was a 12-month, multi-center, Canadian Post Marketing Observational Study utilizing a
      prospective single cohort design. All treatments including participation in the KASA program
      were according to the decision of the treating physician and the patients and were not
      affected in any way by their decision to participate in the study. Follow-up was for 12
      months at an interval of every six months.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Adherent to Treatment at Month 6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence was assessed by the Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). The ASES is a 12 item tool that measures the patient's confidence to undertake treatment related activities and behaviors including medication regimen, diet and exercise. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). A summative score ranging from 0 to 120 was calculated, with higher scores indicating higher treatment self-efficacy. A participant was considered to have maintained adherence if the change in the ASES summative score at month 6 relative to Baseline was greater than or equal to zero. Participants who discontinued from the study or were lost to follow-up were considered non-adherent.</description>

          <title>Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES) Scores</title>
          <description>The ASES is a 12 item tool that measures patient’s confidence to undertake treatment related activities and behaviors including medication regimen, diet and exercise. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). A summative score ranges from 0 to 120, with higher scores indicating higher treatment self-efficacy. The 12 items converge to two subscales measuring adherence integration and adherence perseverance. The adherence integration subscale score ranges from 0 to 90 and the adherence perseverance subscale score ranges from 0 to 30.</description>

          <description>Quality of life (QoL) was measured by the QoL 601-2 survey, the Health Status Assessment (HSA), a brief, comprehensive measure of health-related QoL used extensively in patients with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The survey includes 21 items assessing 8 domains of health-related QoL including physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, energy / fatigue, mental health, and general health perception. Each domain score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Adherent to Treatment at Month 6</title>
        <description>Adherence was assessed by the Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). The ASES is a 12 item tool that measures the patient’s confidence to undertake treatment related activities and behaviors including medication regimen, diet and exercise. Each question is answered on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). A summative score ranging from 0 to 120 was calculated, with higher scores indicating higher treatment self-efficacy. A participant was considered to have maintained adherence if the change in the ASES summative score at month 6 relative to Baseline was greater than or equal to zero. Participants who discontinued from the study or were lost to follow-up were considered non-adherent.</description>

          <description>Adherence was assessed by the Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). The ASES is a 12-item tool that measures the patient’s confidence to undertake treatment-related activities and behaviors including medication regimen, diet and exercise. Each question was answered on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). The 12 items converge to two subscales measuring adherence integration and adherence perseverance. The adherence perseverance subscale score ranges from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating higher treatment self-efficacy.</description>

        <description>Adherence was assessed by the Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (ASES). The ASES is a 12 item tool that measures the patient’s confidence to undertake treatment related activities and behaviors including medication regimen, diet and exercise. Each question was answered on a scale from 0 (cannot do at all) to 10 (certain can do). A summative score ranging from 0 to 120 was calculated, with higher scores indicating higher treatment self-efficacy. A participant was considered to have maintained adherence if the change in the ASES summative score at month 12 was greater than or equal to zero. Participants who discontinued from the study or were lost to follow-up were considered non-adherent.</description>

This survey is a brief, comprehensive measure of health-related QoL used extensively in patients with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The instrument includes 21 items assessing 8 domains of health-related quality of life including physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, energy / fatigue, mental health, and general health perception. Each domain score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health-related Quality of Life Social Functioning Domain Score</title>
        <description>Participant quality of life (QoL) was measured by the QoL 601-2 survey, the Health Status Assessment (HSA). This survey is a brief, comprehensive measure of health-related QoL used extensively in patients with human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). The instrument includes 21 items assessing 8 domains of health-related quality of life including physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, cognitive functioning, pain, energy / fatigue, mental health, and general health perception. Each domain score ranges from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating higher quality of life.</description>

The scores for each question ranged from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction.</description>
