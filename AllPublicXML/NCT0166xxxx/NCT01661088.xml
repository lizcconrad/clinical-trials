      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of the FOLFIRINOX regimen (a combination
      of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy) to provide maximal systemic
      disease control and FDR-gemcitabine chemotherapy with concurrent IMRT (Radiation therapy) to
      address local disease, will achieve a significant improvement R0 resection (Radiation
      oncology repeat surgeries) rate in borderline resectable (surgical) pancreatic cancer and
      enhance disease free and overall survival in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine has been the cornerstone of systemic therapy for pancreas cancer over this past
      decade. Recently, a combination of 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)
      was reported to have significant efficacy in advanced pancreatic cancer. Preclinical data
      suggests synergy between irinotecan and 5FU as well as between oxaliplatin and 5FU. Results
      of a phase II trial in advanced disease were reported in 2005 demonstrating a 26% confirmed
      response rate and median overall survival of 10.2 months. A follow-up phase III trial
      comparing FOLFIRINOX with gemcitabine for patients &lt;75 years of age with advanced pancreatic
      cancer was presented at ASCO 2010 revealing improvement in PFS (6.4 vs 3.3 months, p=&lt;.0001)
      and improved disease control rate (CR+PR+SD) (70.2% vs 50.9%, p=.0003). The most notable
      result was an impressive improvement in median overall survival with FOLFIRINOX compared to
      gemcitabine (11.1vs 6.8 months, p-value = &lt;.0001, HR=.57). The main toxicity was grade 3/4
      neutropenia (45.7% vs 18.7%, p=.0001) and increased risk of febrile neutropenia (5.4% vs
      0.6%, p=.009)31.

Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 intravenously over 120 minutes on day 1. Irinotecan 180mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes on day 1. NOTE: patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 (TA)7 promoter allele will be treated at an initial lower dose 140mg/m2 (please see Section 6.3.a) Leucovorin 400mg/m2 intravenously over 90 minutes on day 1. 5FU 400mg/m2 as bolus intravenous injection following leucovorin on day 1. 5FU 2,400mg/m2 infused intravenously as a continuous infusion over 46 hours following the bolus 5FU, beginning on day 1.</description>
