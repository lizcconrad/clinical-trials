      The purpose of this study is to investigate the possibility of an association between
      Localized Provoked Vulvodynia (LPV) that is both severe and primary and polymorphic
      markers/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around the genes encoding heparanase
      (HSPE-1), Vanilloid Receptor VR1 (TRPV1), and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).

      The short-term goal proposed for the current study was to investigate the possibility of an
      association between Localized Provoked Vulvodynia (LPV) that is both severe and primary and
      polymorphic markers/single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in and around the genes encoding
      heparanase (HSPE-1), Vanilloid Receptor VR1 (TRPV1), and Nerve Growth Factor (NGF).

      Eight polymorphic SNPs in the three different genes suspected to be involved in LPV has been
      examined as follow:

        1. HSPE gene: Four polymorphic SNPs: rs4693608, rs11099592, rs6856901 and rs4364254 that
           were found to be informative in the Ashkenazi Jewish population

        2. TRPV1 gene: Two polymorphic SNPs: rs222747 and rs8065080.

        3. NGF gene: A novel T to C SNP in the promoter region at position -198 (rs11102930) and
           rs6330 which was found to be associated with anxiety-related personality traits and has
           been suggested to may affect intracellular processing and secretion of NGF.
