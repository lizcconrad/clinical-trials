  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of parental peri-natal environmental
      risk factors and genetic factors on the development of Congenital Heart Disease (CHD). Our
      hypothesis is that the distributions of some environmental and genetic risk factors
      significantly differ between neonates with and without CHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital heart defect (CHD) is one of birth defects in the structure of the heart and/or
      great vessels. Many types of heart defects exist, most of which either obstruct blood flow in
      the heart or vessels near it, or cause blood to flow through the heart in an abnormal
      pattern. Heart defects are the leading cause of birth defect-related infant deaths. So far
      people recognize that the causes of CHD are the conjunct effect of environment and genetic
      factors, both of which remain unclear. The current stud aims at investigating all the
      possible perinatal parental environmental risk factors and underlying genetic factors to CHD,
      including DNA variation and methylations. A hospital-based 1:1 matched case control study is
      conducted. Subjects were recruited through neonatal screening program, which includes a
      clinical symptom screening followed by a cardiac ultrasound diagnosis for those with at least
      one clinical indicator. The blood sample of participant will be collected and the parents of
      subjects will be interviewed to completed a questionnaire including general information and
      possible risk factors to CHD.
