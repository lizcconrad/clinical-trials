    <textblock>
      The investigators will compare the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in adults and children
      with inflammatory bowel disease by timing of vaccine in relation to maintenance infliximab
      dosing. The primary objective is to compare the proportion of IBD patients on maintenance
      infliximab who mount serologic protection to each component of the influenza vaccination
      between patients vaccinated on day of infliximab infusion (Day 0 to 4) and patients
      vaccinated at the mid-point between infliximab infusions (Day 21 to 28). Serologic protection
      will be defined by a hemagglutination-inhibition titer ≥ 1:40. The secondary objective is to
      compare the proportion of IBD patients who mount an immunogenic response (≥ 4-fold increase
      from pre to post-vaccination titer) to each component of the influenza vaccination between
      patients vaccinated on day of infliximab infusion and those vaccinated at the mid-point.
