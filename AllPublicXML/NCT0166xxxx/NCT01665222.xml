    <textblock>
      The study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability of morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide
      from 2 tablet products and determine if the 2 products were bioequivalent to each other.

      This was a single center, single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-period
      crossover bioequivalence study designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and bioequivalence
      of morphine sulfate formulations under fasted conditions. Normal healthy males and females at
      least 18 years of age were screened for enrollment into the trial.

      Potential subjects who met the eligibility criteria randomly received either oral Morphine
      Sulfate 60 mg Extended-release tablets or oral MS Contin® 60 mg Controlled-release tablets on
      Day 1 in Period 1, then, following the washout period, they were dosed on Day 8 in Period 2
      with the other treatment. There was a 7-day washout period between dosing. The study drug
      treatments were administered after almost a 12-hour fast. Fasting continued until slightly
      over 4 hours post-dose for both treatment groups. All enrolled subjects were administered
      single oral doses of 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride 10 hours predose, 1 hour predose, and
      12 hours post-dose of the study drug treatment on Day -1 and Day 1 in Period 1 and on Day 7
      and Day 8 in Period 2.

      Potential subjects (ie, alternates) were administered single oral doses of 50 mg of
      naltrexone hydrochloride 10 hours predose and 1 hour predose of the study drug treatment on
      Day -1 and Day 1 in Period 1. Subjects visited the clinic at AAIPharma at Screening (within
      28 days prior to dosing) to assess eligibility and returned to the clinic on Day -1 for the
      Period 1 confinement period that lasted through Day 2. To complete Period 1, subjects were to
      return on Day 3 for the collection of pharmacokinetic blood samples. Period 1 dosing was
      followed by the 7-day washout period. Subjects returned to the clinic for the Period 2
      confinement period on Day 7, which continued through Day 9. To complete Period 2, subjects
      were to return on Day 10 in that period for the collection of pharmacokinetic and safety
      blood samples.

      Pharmacokinetic and safety assessments were performed during the conduct of the trial. Blood
      samples for the evaluation of morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide plasma concentrations were
      obtained while subjects were at the clinic and after discharge, as appropriate.
      Pharmacokinetic samples were collected over a 48-hour period of time following administration
      of the study drug treatment.

      Medical care of the subjects was assured by the presence of a physician for at least 4 hours
      post-dose, and the physician remained on-call to treat adverse events (AEs). Professional
      medical personnel were on-site during the entire study confinement period. Adverse event
      information elicited during Confinement at the clinic or during telephone contacts was
      reviewed and documented.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        For inclusion into the trial, subjects were required to fulfill all of the following
        criteria:

          1. Healthy subjects at least 18 years of age.

          2. Willingness to provide written informed consent after being informed of the nature of
             the study.

          3. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 and a weight of at least 110 pounds.

          4. Good health as determined by a lack of clinically significant abnormalities in health
             assessments performed at Screening, as judged by the physician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Any of the following was regarding as a criterion for excluding subjects from the trial:

          1. Hypersensitivity to morphine sulfate (MS Contin®), naltrexone (ReVia®), or related
             compounds.

          2. Conditions that affected the absorption, metabolism, or passage of drugs out of the
             body (eg, sprue, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, colitis, liver, kidney, or thyroid
             conditions).

          3. Recent history (within 1 year) of mental illness, drug addiction, drug abuse, or
             alcoholism.

             (IUD), vaginal spermicidal or hormonal suppository, surgical sterilization of
             themselves or their partner(s), or abstinence. Females using contraceptive
             medications/devices must have used them consistently for at least 3 months prior to
             receiving study drug.

             beginning 48 hours before each study drug administration through the last
             pharmacokinetic (PK) sample of each treatment period.

             Such restricted items included coffee, tea, iced tea, Coke®, Pepsi®, Mountain Dew®,
             chocolate, brownies, etc.
