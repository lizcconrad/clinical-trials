  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two sub-trials. Both are included in this singe registration since they
      have parallel inclusion of participants and have been approved by the Swedish ethics board
      together in one application.

      Trial 1 includes patients with both insomnia and major or minor depression. Participants are
      randomized to either a combined therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia and depression, or
      to Internet-CBT for depression with an addition of a placebo intervention for insomnia. The
      primary purpose is to evaluate changes in insomnia and depression severity for the
      combination treatment compared to the depression treatment, after treatment and at 6 and 36
      months follow up. A secondary purpose is to evaluate cognitive functioning before and after
      treatment, as well as cost effectiveness. Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County through
      mass media and the Internet psychiatry clinic's regular patient recruitment.

      Trial 2 includes patients with insomnia who do not meet criteria for major or minor
      depression. All participants start therapist guided Internet-CBT for insomnia. After 4 weeks
      patients that are judged to be at risk of treatment failure are randomized to either
      continued treatment or treatment with added support intended to enhance outcome. The primary
      purpose is to evaluate change in insomnia severity for participants who get added support,
      compared to continued treatment with regular support level. A secondary purpose is to
      evaluate cognitive functioning before and after treatment, as well as cost effectiveness.
      Recruitment is done in the Stockholm County through mass media and the Internet psychiatry
      clinic's regular patient recruitment.

      NOTE:

      The first participants in trial 1 will be regarded as pilots, due to problems with the
      experimental treatment: technical issues as well as problems with the design of treatment
      modules. These problems were corrected when discovered. 12 participants in the experimental
      arm were affected by these errors. The pilot participants will not be included in the main
      analyses of data. This was decided upon on 31st of October 2014.

    <measure>Change (from baseline) in Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS-S</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 6 and 36 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as secondary outcome measure in Trial 2. The use of two primary outcomes in trial 1 is motivated since participants have both diagnoses and the purpose is to look at effects on both insomnia and depression.
The MADRS-S is a 9-item self-rated measure of change in depression severity. It also screens for suicidality.

    <time_frame>Directly post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>An actigraph is placed on the participant's arm for one week. They measure participants' activity in the form of movements. It will be used for acquiring sleep data and calculate sleep latency, total sleep time, sleep efficacy, number of nighttime awakenings and daytime activity.</description>
