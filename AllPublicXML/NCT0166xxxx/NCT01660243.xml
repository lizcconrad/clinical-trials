  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to investigate the efficacy of MT-9938 compared with placebo
      after 2 weeks, to continue to evaluate efficacy for an additional 6 weeks, and to explore the
      effect of a reduction in itching intensity on health-related Quality of Life(QoL) domains,
      especially those which recent research suggests have a positive correlation with overall
      survival for this patient group. The study will consist of the following phases: Screening (1
      to 2 weeks), Run in (1 week), double-blind Treatment (8 weeks), Washout (1 week) culminating
      in a Follow-up Visit (1 week after the last dose).
