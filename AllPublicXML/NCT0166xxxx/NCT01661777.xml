      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of treatment of refractory Eustachian
      tube dysfunction with standard treatment for endolymphatic hydrops. Eustachian tube
      dysfunction is a common diagnosis made in otolaryngology related to abnormal pressure
      equalization of the middle ear space related to a swollen, inflamed, or occluded Eustachian
      tube. The symptoms of this include perceived hearing loss, a feeling of fullness in the
      affected ear/ears, ear pain, ear popping, and occasionally imbalance. These symptoms overlap
      with a more rare and difficult to diagnose condition known as endolymphatic hydrops, or an
      overproduction to fluid in the inner ear. The treatment for these two conditions are distinct
      and traditionally, patients are treated for Eustachian tube dysfunction first as it is much
      more common and there are several treatments, namely nasal steroids, antihistamines, and
      pressure equalization tubes. For patients who do not improve with these treatments, they are
      often treated with diuretics and a low salt diet to treat for supposed endolymphatic hydrops.
      There has never been a study to investigate the utility of these treatments in patients with
      refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction. There is also reason to believe that chronic ETD with
      effusion can lead to both inner and middle ear dysfunction. Thus, this study aims to
      determine the benefit of standard endolymphatic hydrops treatment on patient with refractory
      Eustachian tube dysfunction symptoms in a prospective fashion.

      Hypothesis:

      Patients with refractory Eustachian tube dysfunction (patients with no or minimal symptom
      improvement despite nasal steroid and antihistamine treatment followed by myringotomy tube
      placement) have an element of endolymphatic hydrops and these patient's symptoms will improve
      with a low sodium diet and diuretic.

    <textblock>
      Eustachian tube dysfunction is one of the most common problems encountered in general
      otolaryngology clinical practice. Symptoms of ear pressure, decreased hearing, ear pain, ear
      popping, and frequent ear infections are often blamed on the inability of the Eustachian tube
      to equalize air pressure across the ear drum. If the Eustachian tube is occluded, the middle
      ear space becomes a closed chamber in which normal gas exchange cannot occur. Treatment of
      Eustachian dysfunction has traditionally focused on a two tier system. First, patients are
      most often placed on a nasal steroid and an antihistamine. This medication regimen leads to
      decreased nasal inflammation, mucosal swelling, and treats nasal allergy. In many patients,
      this treatment improves symptoms completely or reduces them to a tolerable level. If the
      patient's symptoms are not improved, the next step in management is to create a surgical
      tract to the middle ear via a myringotomy (a hole across the ear drum) and placing a pressure
      equalization tube across the tympanic membrane. This bypasses any anatomical obstruction in
      the Eustachian tube and allows the middle ear pressure to equalize with the atmospheric
      pressure across the tympanic membrane. Unfortunately, despite this, there are patients with
      refractory symptoms, often ear pressure and subjectively decreased hearing. These symptoms
      are also frequently associated with inner ear disease, specifically endolymphatic hydrops.
      Endolymphatic hydrops is felt to be related to over production of endolymphatic fluid, the
      fluid within the inner ear. Thus, we propose that patient's will refractory Eustachian tube
      dysfunction are experiencing an inner ear phenomenon, and that they would benefit from
      treatment similar to how endolymphatic hydrops (or over production of endolymphatic fluid) is
      managed. The mainstays of management of endolymphatic hydrops are a low sodium diet and
      diuretic treatment (hydrochlorothiazide/triamterene). Both of these treatments aim to reduce
      endolymph production.
