  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation is an important phase of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. The
      harvest of a larger number of viable eggs per cycle compensate eventual laboratory
      difficulties and allow for the selection of embryos with higher implantation potential. In
      the current protocols, based on the most prevailing theory of ovarian follicular development,
      stimulation drugs are usually started on the second or third day after the beginning of
      menses. The follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is believed to be the only favorable
      moment for follicular development.

      In the early 2000's a new model of human ovarian follicular development (follicular waves)
      has been proposed based on frequent transvaginal ultrasound observations between two
      ovulations. It has been shown that ovarian antral follicles develop in synchronous groups,
      two to three times in a cycle. In fact the follicular wave phenomenon has been initially
      described in the 80's on domestic animals, like the mare and the cow. Moreover, studies in
      these animals have shown that synchronizing the start of the ovarian stimulation drugs with
      the beginning of a follicular wave yields better results for assisted reproductive
      treatments. Consequently in ovarian stimulation protocols for animal assisted reproduction it
      is important to control the initiation of a follicular wave.

      Current protocols of ovarian stimulation for IVF in women do not consider the start of a
      follicular wave to begin drug administration. Therefore the purpose of this study is to
      evaluate two methods to control the emergence of a follicular wave (ovulation induction and
      dominant follicle aspiration) and to investigate the effects of synchronizing ovarian
      stimulation for IVF with follicular wave emergence in women compared to one of the current
      stimulation protocols (flexible GnRH protocol).

    <description>Patients will be stimulated according to the conventional flexible GnRH antagonist protocol for IVF. Alfa follitropin (150IU a day) will be started on the third day of the menstrual cycle. Treatment monitoring will be done with transvaginal ultrasound scans and serum determinations of estradiol and progesterone 5 days after the start of gonadotropins and every each day thereafter. Once the leading follicle reaches 13 mm in mean diameter 0,25mg of cetrorelix acetate will be administered daily. Once at least two follicles reach 18mm or more in mean diameter 250 micrograms of choriogonadotropin alfa will be administered and 36 hours latter patients will undergo follicle aspiration for IVF. Embryos will be cryopreserved (vitrification) on the third or fifth day of development. Two months after women will undergo uterine preparation for embryo transfer.</description>

    <description>Patients will be monitored with daily transvaginal ultrasound scans from the tenth day of the menstrual cycle on. When the dominant follicle reaches a mean diameter of 16mm or more, patients will receive 250 micrograms of choriogonadotropin alfa subcutaneously. Daily transvaginal ultrasound scans will be done starting two days after the administration of the medication until a cohort of ovarian follicles between 4-6 mm is seen (follicular wave emergence). From this point on patients will undergo the same stimulation protocol as Controls, i.e., flexible GnRH antagonist protocol.</description>

    <description>Patients will be monitored with daily transvaginal ultrasound scans from the tenth day of the menstrual cycle on. When the dominant follicle reaches a mean diameter of 16mm or more, patients will then undergo aspiration of the dominant and all follicles greater than 10mm in mean diameter. aspiration will be transvaginal ultrasound guided and under sedation, as for oocyte retrieval. Oocytes eventually obtained at this first aspiration will not be used for IVF. Daily transvaginal ultrasound scans will be done starting the day after the follicular aspiration until a cohort of follicles between 4-6 mm is seen (follicular wave emergence). From this point on patients will undergo the same stimulation protocol as Controls, i.e., flexible GnRH antagonist protocol.</description>
