QT or QTcF &gt;480 msec and &lt;=500 msec at any postdose time point and not present at baseline QT or QTcF &gt;500 msec at any postdose time point and not present at baseline. QT/QTcF Increase from baseline &gt;60 msec for at least 1 postdose measurement. Increase from baseline in QT or QTcF &gt;30 msec for at least 1 postdose measurement, but &lt;=60 msec for all postdose measurements.</description>

        <description>The geometric mean of the maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax) is presented below; serial blood samples for determination of study drug were collected predose (0 hours (h), 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 42 h, 48 h, 54 h,and 60 h postdose, relative to dosing on Day 1 in each cross over period and these data are summarized in the Pharmacokinetic (PK) parameter of Cmax presented here. Plasma samples were analyzed for dapagliflozin by High Performance Liquid chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) using a validated method; nominal range of 0.200 to 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Dapagliflozin Cmax was derived from plasma concentration versus time data using a non-compartmental method, using a validated PK analysis program ™. Actual sampling times were used for PK calculations. Cmax was reported in ng/mL.</description>

        <description>AUC(INF) is area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity. Serial blood samples for determination of study drug were collected predose (0 hours (h), 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 42 h, 48 h, 54 h and 60 h postdose, relative to dosing on Day 1 in each cross over period. Plasma samples were analyzed for dapagliflozin by HPLC-MS/MS using a validated method; nominal range of 0.200 to 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Actual sampling times were used for PK calculations.

Plasma samples were analyzed for saxagliptin by Liquid chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a validated method (quantitation range of 0.100 ng/mL to 50.0 ng/mL). Cmax for Saxagliptin was derived from plasma concentration versus time data using a validated PK analysis program ™ and was measured in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL).</description>

        <description>Serial blood samples for determination of study drug were collected predose (0 h), 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, 24 h, 30 h, 36 h, 42 h, 48 h, 54 h and 60 h postdose, relative to dosing on Day 1 in each cross over period. Plasma samples were analyzed for saxagliptin and 5-OH by LC-MS/MS using a validated method. Tmax was derived from the plasma concentration versus time profile for study drug and was measured in hours (h). Saxagliptin was the drug, 5-OH saxagliptin was the metabolite, and Saxagliptin total Active Moiety was molar summations of saxagliptin exposure parameter with one-half the molar exposure parameters for 5-OH Saxagliptin.</description>
