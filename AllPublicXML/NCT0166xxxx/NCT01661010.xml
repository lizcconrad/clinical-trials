      Purpose/Lay Summary: Background:

      - Chromosomes are the structures inside of each cell that carry our genetic material (genes).
      Certain differences in the sex chromosomes are known to cause various diseases, such as
      infertility, Turner syndrome, or Klinefelter syndrome. However, it is not fully understood
      why these differences are seen and what clinical findings may be caused with different sex
      chromosome variants. This study is seeking to learn more about the genetic and clinical
      characteristics of disorders related to the X and Y chromosomes.

      Objectives:

      - To study related medical conditions in people with sex chromosome variants.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients with known sex chromosome differences may be eligible to participate.

        -  Healthy volunteers age 18 - 55

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  This study will last about 5 days. Participants will have a variety of endocrine and
           other tests. They will provide blood, urine, and semen samples for these tests.

        -  Imaging studies of the heart and abdomen will be performed. These tests may include
           ultrasounds and magnetic resonance imaging.

        -  Participants will also have their vision and hearing checked.

        -  Healthy volunteers with have a single day visit for a medical history, physical exam,
           and blood and skin samples.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

        -  Compensation is offered.

      Infertility is a disease that affects approximately 10% of couples world-wide. Causes of
      infertility are varied and include age-related decline in fecundity, other causes of
      ovulatory dysfunction, tubal and pelvic pathology, male causes, idiopathic, and
      multifactorial. The underlying genetic causes of infertility are incompletely understood. The
      purpose of this study is to increase our understanding of the genetic and clinical
      manifestations of infertility related to Ychromosome differences through detailed physical,
      radiologic, and laboratory studies. We will concentrate on a group of patients (both male and
      female) with known Y-chromosome variations and infertility previously identified by our
      collaborator, Dr. David Page s lab. Patients recruited and consenting to this study will be
      evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. Patients previously identified through outside research or diagnostic labs as
                  having sex-chromosome variants causing deletion/duplication of sex-linked genes
                  or entire sex chromosomes, male and female.

               2. In the event that a patient with a sex-chromosome variant self-refers to the
                  protocol, medical records will be reviewed by a committee to include Dr. David
                  Page, Dr. Maximilian Muenke, and others to decide whether the patient is
                  appropriate for enrollment in the protocol.

               3. Willing family members of subjects enrolled may be enrolled as control subjects.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Anyone unwilling to provide informed consent or assent.

          2. We reserve the right to exclude patients with medical conditions that would place a
             potential participant at high risk of complications if managed at the NIH clinical
             center (ex. dialysis dependency, unstable cardiac conditions, unstable severe
             depression/suicidality).

          3. We reserve the right to exclude cases that are clearly not related to Ychromosome
             variants, infertility or our direct research interests (e.g. infertility with clearly
             non-genetic etiology). This almost never happens, and we would attempt to make
             referrals to a more appropriate investigator.

        It is our intention to try to remove as many economic, cultural, geographic, racial, and
        gender barriers as we reasonably can to promote a diverse participation of infertility
        cases for research purposes.
