  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced nausea is a common side effect for children undergoing chemotherapy.
      Furthermore, chemotherapy-induced vomiting is a major factor limiting quality of life during
      treatment reported by paediatric cancer survivors. Complete prevention of both nausea and
      vomiting is the goal of anti-vomiting and nausea medications. It is important to understand
      whether or not certain chemotherapeutic treatments are more or less likely to cause these
      symptoms. Acute leukemia is the most common cancer diagnosed in children. Intrathecal
      methotrexate is an important part of chemotherapy for the prevention and treatment of central
      nervous system leukemia over the 2.5 to 3.5 years of the treatment program for leukemia. The
      likelihood that intrathecal methotrexate administered as monotherapy will cause nausea and
      vomiting has not yet been described in children. Knowledge of the likelihood that intrathecal
      methotrexate will cause nausea and vomiting will therefore be important to optimize treatment
      for these side-effects of chemotherapy. The primary aim of this prospective study is to
      evaluate the potential of intrathecal methotrexate to cause nausea and vomiting in paediatric
      cancer patients.

    <description>Children diagnosed with acute leukemia, undergoing chemotherapy.

        Receiving intrathecal methotrexate in the context of maintenance therapy for acute
        lymphoblastic leukemia and as dosed by age per protocol. Patients will also receive their
        protocol driven maintenance chemotherapy which includes oral 6 mercaptopurine and may
        include IV vincristine and an oral steroid pulse (prednisone or dexamethasone). Oral
        methotrexate is typically held the weeks that patients receive intrathecal methotrexate
        during maintenance therapy.
