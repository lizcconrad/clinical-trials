  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 levels
      of recommended exercise in initially overweight and obese sedentary men and women on the
      prevention of weight regain. Participants will complete a 3 mo. weight loss intervention of
      decreased energy intake (EI) and increased energy expenditure (100 minutes of physical
      activity per week). Participants achieving clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 5% of
      initial weight), will be randomly assigned to 12 mos. of exercise at levels of energy
      expenditure of exercise (EEEx) recommended by Health and Human Services (HHS), American
      College of Sports Medicine(ACSM), Institute of Medicine (IOM): 150, 225, or 300 minutes per
      week. Major outcome assessments will occur prior to weight loss (-3 mos.), at completion of
      weight loss (0 mos.), at the midpoint (6 mos.), and completion of weight maintenance (12
      mos.).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized trial in 287 overweight and obese, sedentary adults
      (at least 50% women). Participants achieving clinically significant weight loss (â‰¥5%)
      following a 3 mo. reduced energy diet and a program of PA (100 min/wk) will be randomly
      assigned to either maintain exercise at 150 min/wk. or increase exercise to 225 min/wk or 300
      min/wk. while consuming a weight gain prevention diet over a 12 mo. period. Exercise will be
      verified (combination of on-site and HR monitor) and EEEx will be measured at 5 mo. intervals
      beginning at mo. 5. In-person behaviorally based clinic meetings will be conducted weekly
      during the 3 mo. weight loss period (-3 to 0 mos.) and during the first 3 mos. of the weight
      regain prevention period. During the final 9 mos. of weight regain prevention, clinics will
      be held bi-monthly using group conference calls. We have not proposed to randomize
      participants to a true control group (i.e. no exercise or diet) following the 3 mo. weight
      loss program as published data indicates significant weight regain in individuals receiving
      no follow-up treatment after weight loss.

    <description>To compare the effectiveness of 3 exercise recommendations on the prevention of weight regain over 12 mos. subsequent to clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 5%). We expect participants will regain weight in a dose-response manner, i.e. greatest, intermediate and least weight regain for the 150, 225, and 300 minute. groups, respectively.</description>
