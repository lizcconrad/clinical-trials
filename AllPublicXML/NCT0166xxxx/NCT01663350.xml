      This is a prospective, multi‐center observational study designed to compare the test results
      of the Verinata Health Prenatal Aneuploidy Test to results of conventional prenatal screening
      for fetal chromosome abnormalities in 'all-risk' pregnancies.

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is the false positive rate of fetal aneuploidy detection for chromosome 21, 18, and 13 by the Verinata Health Prenatal Aneuploidy Test and screen positive rate for fetal trisomy (T21) and trisomy (T18) by conventional prenatal screening methods. Birth outcomes, or karyotype if available, will be used as the reference standard.</description>
