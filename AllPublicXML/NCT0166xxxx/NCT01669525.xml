  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to determine if measurement of maternal serum biomarkers and
      evaluation of the placenta by ultrasound can improve prediction of adverse pregnancy
      outcomes.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The placenta is known to play a vital role in maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Placental
      dysfunction is believed to be a driving factor in a variety of adverse obstetric outcomes,
      including fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. Advances in 3D ultrasound have allowed
      for measurement of placental volumes during pregnancy. It may be that quantitative assessment
      of early placental growth can help identify pregnancies at risk for adverse outcome.
      Furthermore, various novel serum analytes have been proposed as predictors of adverse
      outcome. The investigators seek to prospectively measure placental volume and diameter at
      11-14 weeks and 18-24 weeks to determine if placental growth can predict adverse outcome. In
      addition, the investigators seek to investigate the relationship between placental growth and
      serum levels of various biomarkers to see if improved detection of adverse outcome can be
      achieved.
