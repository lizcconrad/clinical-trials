  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive symptoms are the core feature of Alzheimer's disease. Besides these problems,
      behavioural and psychological symptoms (BPSD), and an impairment of activities of daily
      living (IADL) are frequently encountered and usually show an impact on autonomy maintenance,
      prognostic and care during the prodromal and early stages of the disease.

      Such symptoms are noticeable before the diagnosis of dementia and their occurrences as well
      as their intensity increase with the evolution of the disease.

      Apathy, initially defined as a reduction of motivated behaviours, is the most frequently
      observed BPSD. Apathy is clinically defined by a significant reduction or complete loss of
      interest, initiative capacity and emotional blunting. Accordingly, apathy is characterized by
      diminished goal-directed cognitions and behaviours.

      Behavioural and psychological assessment relies essentially on neuropsychiatric scales. These
      are used to gather precise data regarding patient's clinical state from interviews with the
      patient, the career or from clinical impressions during the consultation. From their apparent
      simplicity they have made their way into daily clinical practices, yet neuropsychiatric
      scales are reportedly biased by the assessors' subjectivity.

      However, some tools whose allow simple, fast and objectively valid assessments are not widely
      used.

      Hence, the use of ICT such as actigraphy (wearable device assessing locomotion activities),
      automatized audio-video recognition and signal analysis from events, may be of interest in
      addition to current assessment methods.

      The aim of this study is to implement an objective assessment of goal directed activities and
      autonomy in an experimental design including predefined actions. The setting includes video
      cameras, microphones, actigraphic and Galvanic Skin Response sensors for recording and
      computer-based recognition of events using audio-video data, locomotion data and sinusal
      variability respectively as well as extracting biomarkers for supporting detection of
      dementia at early stages and supporting ongoing tracking of the dementia disease state. The
      following population will be included: patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (n=50),
      patients with Alzheimer's disease (n=50) and control participants (n=50).

      This work will provide further objective information for clinical practitioner in order to
      detect behavioral disturbances such as apathy.
