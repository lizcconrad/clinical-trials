  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ChAd63 METRAP and MVA METRAP are investigational vaccines for malaria which have been studied
      in clinical trials for 4 years, and 10 years, respectively. These vaccines are inactivated
      viruses which have been modified so that they cannot reproduce in humans. Genetic information
      has been added to make them express proteins of the malaria parasite so that they stimulate
      an immune response against malaria. This trial examines whether a compound called Matrix M™
      can be used in efforts to improve on how well the vaccines work at preventing malaria.

      Matrix M™ is a vaccine adjuvant, a compound used to improve the immune responses to vaccines.
      In this trial, Matrix M™ will be combined with each of the vaccines. The objectives are to
      assess the safety of the vaccines when combined with Matrix M™, and to determine what effect
      Matrix M™ has on the immune responses to the vaccines.

      We will assess the safety of the vaccines (ChAd63 METRAP combined with Matrix M™; and MVA
      METRAP combined with Matrix M™) by administering them to healthy volunteers and monitoring
      them for 6 months in total. Eight volunteers will receive the vaccines with the low dose of
      Matrix M™, eight will receive the vaccines with the standard dose of Matrix M™, and six
      volunteers will receive the vaccines alone as a comparison group. We will also look at what
      effect Matrix M™ has on the immune responses to the vaccines, as measured from blood tests.
      Volunteers will have study visits to the Clinical Centre for Vaccinology and Tropical
      Medicine on the Churchill Hospital site, Oxford, where they will have vaccinations, have
      blood taken to monitor safety and measure immune responses to vaccination, and be monitored
      for symptoms/side effects from vaccination.
