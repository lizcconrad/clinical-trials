    <textblock>
      The study is designed to afford a first time in humans (FTiH) safety and immunogenicity
      assessment of three Tetravalent Dengue Virus-Purified Inactivated Vaccine(TDENV-PIV) vaccine
      candidates, each formulated with a different adjuvant: either aluminum hydroxide, AS01E or
      AS03B (adjuvants used in Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK) Biologicals' hepatitis B candidate vaccine,
      malaria candidate vaccine and pandemic flu vaccine, respectively). Each vaccine candidate
      will contain 1 µg of purified virus antigen per each of the four DENV types. Additionally,
      the study will evaluate an alum adjuvanted TDENV-PIV vaccine candidate containing 4 µg of
      purified virus antigen per each of the four DENV types. The control group will receive a
      saline placebo. All experimental vaccinations will be administered according to a 2-dose
      schedule, 28 days apart.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol (e.g., completion of the diary cards, return for follow-up visits, etc.)

          -  A male or female between 18 and 39 years of age (inclusive) at the time of consent

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential (non-childbearing potential is defined
             as having either a current tubal ligation at least three months prior to enrollment,
             hysterectomy, ovariectomy, or is post-menopause). See Definition of Terms for adequate
             contraception.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the subject
             has:

               -  Practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  A negative urine pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  Agreed to continue adequate contraception until two months after completion of

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 180 days prior to the first
             vaccine/placebo dose (for corticosteroids, this will mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day or
             equivalent; inhaled and topical steroids are allowed)

          -  Planned administration or administration of a vaccine/product not foreseen by the
             study protocol during the period starting 30 days prior to the first dose of
             vaccine/placebo until after the visit at Day 56 (if influenza activity warrants
             vaccination of healthy young adults, influenza vaccination will be encouraged and will
             not lead to study exclusion)

          -  Planned administration of any flavivirus vaccine for the entire study duration

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on

          -  History of any neurological disorders or seizures

          -  Acute disease and/or fever (≥37.5°C/99.5°F oral body temperature) at the time of
             enrollment (a subject with a minor illness, i.e., mild diarrhea, mild upper
             respiratory infection, etc., without fever, may be enrolled at the discretion of the
             investigator)

          -  Acute or chronic, clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal
             functional abnormality,as determined by physical examination or laboratory screening
             tests

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period starting

             end for the participant

          -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject
             from participating in the study.

          -  Subject seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus
             antibodies (anti-HCV), or human immunodeficiency virus antibodies (anti-HIV)

          -  Safety laboratory test results that are outside the acceptable values at screening.
             The following values are not acceptable:

               -  &gt;110% upper limit of normal (ULN) for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate
                  aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, serum urea nitrogen
                  (SUN) and bilirubin (total and direct)

               -  &lt;100% lower limit of normal (LLN) or &gt; 120% ULN for hemoglobin, hematocrit and
                  platelet count

               -  &lt;75% LLN or &gt;110% ULN for total white blood cell count (WBC) Note that all
                  screening laboratory results must be either within normal limits (WNL) or no more
                  than Grade l not clinically significant (NCS)

        (LLN=lower limit of normal; ULN= upper limit of normal, WNL= within normal limits, NCS= not
