    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies high-dose stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in treating
      patients with low-, intermediate-, or high-risk localized prostate cancer. SBRT may be able
      to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment related gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity for
      patients who undergo SBRT for localized prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Follow quality of life after SBRT using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)
      and American Urological Association (AUA) scores.

      II. Assess biochemical control after high-dose SBRT.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 5 fractions of prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy over 10-12 days
      with at least 40 hours between each fraction in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1.5, 4, 8, and 12 months,
      every 6 months for 4 years, and then annually thereafter.

             Network (NCCN) guidelines; any patient whom is defined as high-risk must undergo
             screening with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
             abdomen and pelvis as well as bone scan prior to enrollment for staging purposes; low
             and intermediate risk patients do not require imaging for staging unless they have a

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease prior to radiation

             or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements

          -  Patients whom are planned to receive pelvic nodal radiation are excluded

          -  Weight &gt; 350 lbs

          -  Contraindications to placement of fiducials required for high-precision image guidance
             (e.g. bleeding disorders which may cause excessive bleeding with placement,
             requirement for coumadin, international normalized ratio [INR] &gt; 2.0)

          -  Patients unable to maintain a full bladder during treatment

          -  Previous prostatectomy
