  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective interventional study to assess laboratory testing which will identify
      the microbial cause of pneumonia. This, in turn, will allow targeted antimicrobial agent
      selection for patients with community acquired-pneumonia (CAP).

      Hypothesis: 1) To determine if Targeted strategy is non-inferior to Empiric therapy with
      respect to outcome endpoints. 2) To assess the use of innovative POC tests allows targeted
      narrow-spectrum antimicrobial therapy. 3) To determine if Targeted strategy is superior to
      Empiric therapy in patients with viral pneumonia
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted at five academic medical university sites with 7 hospitals.
      Empiric therapy is defined as selection of antibiotic therapy based on the 2007 ATS-IDSA
      guidelines in which broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended, and microbial cause is
      uncertain

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        ‚óè Adult patients greater than age 17 years who are initially evaluated in the ED with
        symptoms of CAP. This includes those who will be treated as outpatients and those admitted
        to the hospital (both ward and ICU).

        The definition of CAP is as follows:

          -  Presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. (Initial reading may be
             performed by the ED physician - but has to be confirmed by board certified radiologist
             for inclusion in the study).

          -  At least 2 of the following: new onset of cough, productive sputum, shortness of
             breath, chest pain, fever &gt; 380C, abnormal chest auscultation, WBC &gt; 12,000 cells/mL.

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Read, signed, and dated informed consent document

          -  Available for follow-up for the planned duration of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with underlying immunosuppressive illness (HIV, neutropenia, asplenia,
             transplant recipient, cystic fibrosis, receipt of immunosuppressive medications
             including corticosteroids, (equivalent of prednisone &gt; 10 mg) cancer chemotherapy, or
             anti-tumor necrosis factor agents.

          -  Patients residing in long-term care facilities
