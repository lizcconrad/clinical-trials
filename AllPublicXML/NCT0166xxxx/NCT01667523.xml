  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An altered permeability has been proposed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of
      several gastrointestinal disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel
      disease. Nutrients derived from food are able to influence the permeability of the intestine
      and can therefore also affect gastrointestinal symptoms. In this study, the investigators
      will investigate the effects of capsaicine and cinnamaldehyde, which can be found in hot
      peppers and cinnamon, respectively, on gastrointestinal physiology.

      Objective:

      To obtain more information about the effects of capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde on the
      intestine, these substances will be infused directly in the duodenum. Hereafter, the
      permeability of the intestine, gallbladder motility and the effects on satiety will be
      assessed.

      Hypothesis:

      Duodenal capsaicin and cinnamaldehyde infusion induces changes in the intestinal epithelial
      barrier function by selectively acting on TRPV1 and TRPA1 receptors and releasing serotonin
      from enterochromaffin cells as determined by the multi sugar permeability test

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Based on medical history and previous examination, no gastrointestinal complaints can
             be defined.

          2. Age between 18 and 65 years. This study will include healthy adult subjects. Subjects
             over 65 years have an increased risk for comorbidities, therefore, subjects over 65
             years will not be included. Furthermore, age has an influence on the homeostasis of
             the intestinal mucosa [21], which can potentially influence outcome parameters of the
             study.

          3. BMI between 20 and 30 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History of severe cardiovascular, respiratory, urogenital, gastrointestinal/ hepatic,
             hematological/immunologic, HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, throat),
             dermatological/connective tissue, musculoskeletal, metabolic/nutritional, endocrine,
             neurological/psychiatric diseases, allergy, major surgery and/or laboratory
             assessments which might limit participation in or completion of the study protocol.
             The severity of the disease (major interference with the execution of the experiment
             or potential influence on the study outcomes) will be decided by the principal
             investigator.

          2. Use of medication, including vitamin supplementation, except oral contraceptives,
             within 14 days prior to testing

          3. Administration of investigational drugs or participation in any scientific
             intervention study which may interfere with this study (to be decided by the principle
             investigator), in the 180 days prior to the study

          4. Major abdominal surgery interfering with gastrointestinal function (uncomplicated
             appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy allowed, and other surgery upon
             judgement of the principle investigator)

          5. Dieting (medically prescribed, vegetarian, diabetic, macrobiological, biological
             dynamic), pregnancy, lactation

          6. Excessive alcohol consumption (&gt;20 alcoholic consumptions per week)

          7. Smoking

          8. Blood donation within 3 months before the study period

          9. Self-admitted HIV-positive state
