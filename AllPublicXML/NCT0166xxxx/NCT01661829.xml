    <textblock>
      In patients who underwent sphincter preserving surgery with toal mesorectal excision and
      diverting stoma after neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy for rectal cancer, the inestigators
      would evaluate the effect of a biofeedback therpy before stoma closure on their anorectal
      function after stoma closure.
