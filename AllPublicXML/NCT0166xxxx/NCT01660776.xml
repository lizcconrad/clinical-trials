  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) represent 25 to 30% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas in
      western countries. DLBCLs are aggressive cancer but potentially curable with multi-agent
      chemotherapy. Whereas R-CHOP regimen has led to a marked improvement in survival, this
      disease remains a biologically heterogeneous entity. New therapeutic strategies are required
      including identification of patients' subgroups with different prognostic.

      This project is based on BMS_LyTrans and Goelams 075 clinical trial. A study of whole blood
      transcriptome in 75 DLBCL patients and in 87 controls showed that PD-L1 (CD274) gene was
      overexpressed in DLBCL patients. Preliminary results demonstrated that PD-L1 is detected in
      plasma of DLBCL patients with a significantly higher concentration than in controls. This
      protein was selected as a potential biomarker because of its established role in anti-tumoral
      immunity. Interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 is known to inhibit activation of
      immune responses by inducing T-lymphocytes anergy and/or apoptosis. Moreover, a direct
      involvement of PD-L1 in the protection of cancer cells from lysis by activated T lymphocytes
      has been demonstrated. PD-L1 expression has been described in several solid tumours,
      including ovary cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell
      lung carcinoma and in hematological malignancies such as T-NHL, MM and Hodgkin's lymphoma.
      Furthermore the expression of PD-L1 by tumour cells is associated with poor prognosis. The
      blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach in aggressive cancers.
      These first results incite to identify the cells releasing soluble PD-L1 and to investigate
      its role in the anti-tumoral immunity in DLBCL patients.

      The aim of this study is to identify cells producing soluble PD-L1 in DLBCL patients at
      diagnosis in comparison to others tumours known to express PD-L1 (metastatic breast cancer,
      Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer).

           expression of PD-L1 in the tumor, **) the expression of PD-L1 and other molecules in the
           bronchoalveolar liquid (whenever available from routine) in non-small cell lung cancer
