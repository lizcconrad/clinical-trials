      A large body of data shows that fatigue impairs human performance. Additionally, many studies
      have provided evidence that fatigue can worsen mood, as indicated by increased scores on
      measures of depression, anxiety, confusion, and anger. In this context, we examined
      attentional and emotional changes in physicians after they completed an overwhelming
      outpatient clinic in a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital in South Korea.
