    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The purpose of the trial
      is to investigate the effect of insulin degludec (IDeg) in combination with liraglutide
      (Lira) and metformin (at least 1500 mg daily or maximum tolerated dose) in subjects with type
      2 diabetes qualifying for treatment intensification.

    <time_frame>Weeks 0 - 26</time_frame>
    <description>Number of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes from week 0 to 26 weeks of randomised treatment. A hypoglycaemic episode was defined as treatment emergent if the onset of the episode occurred after the first administration of investigational medicinal product and no later than 7 days after the last day on trial product. Confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes consisted of severe hypoglycaemia or minor hypoglycaemic episodes.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 0 - 26</time_frame>
    <description>Number of treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) from week 0 to week 26 of the randomised treatment. A TEAE was defined as an event that had onset date on or after the first day of exposure to randomised treatment and no later than 7 days after the last day of randomised treatment.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Health-related Quality of Life Using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36®v2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0, week 26</time_frame>
    <description>Change in subject's quality of life was evaluated using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36®v2). Evaluations were performed at baseline and at the last treatment visit (week 26). SF-36 was assessed on a scale range of 0.65 to 80.73 for physical health and -8.81 to 81.65 for mental health respectively, where higher scores indicated a better quality of life. 0-100 scores from the SF-36 were converted to a norm-based score using a T-score transformation in order to obtain a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 1998 U.S. general population.</description>

          <description>Liraglutide treatment was initiated on 0.6 mg daily for one week and increased further after the second week in the run-in period. In the randomized period, Insulin degludec (IDeg, 100 U/mL, in a 3 mL prefilled pen PDS290) treatment was recommended to be initiated and administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily (OD) with 10 units. After that it was titrated once weekly. If one or more of the pre-breakfast plasma glucose values were below a certain range, the subjects were to reduce the insulin dose. Subjects continued on metformin (1500/day) treatment at the stable, pre-trial dose and maintained dosing frequency levels throughout the trial period.</description>

            <description>Liraglutide treatment was initiated on 0.6 mg daily for one week and increased further after the second week in the run-in period. In the randomized period, Insulin degludec (IDeg, 100 U/mL, in a 3 mL prefilled pen PDS290) treatment was recommended to be initiated and administered subcutaneously (under the skin) once daily (OD) with 10 units. After that it was titrated once weekly. If one or more of the pre-breakfast plasma glucose values were below a certain range, the subjects were to reduce the insulin dose. Subjects continued on metformin (1500/day) treatment at the stable, pre-trial dose and maintained dosing frequency levels throughout the trial period.</description>

        <description>Change in subject’s quality of life was evaluated using the Short-Form 36 Health Survey version 2 (SF-36®v2). Evaluations were performed at baseline and at the last treatment visit (week 26). SF-36 was assessed on a scale range of 0.65 to 80.73 for physical health and -8.81 to 81.65 for mental health respectively, where higher scores indicated a better quality of life. 0-100 scores from the SF-36 were converted to a norm-based score using a T-score transformation in order to obtain a direct interpretation in relation to the distribution of the scores in the 1998 U.S. general population.</description>
