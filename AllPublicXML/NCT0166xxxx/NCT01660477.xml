  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two part study is to assess the effect of multiple doses of isavuconazole
      on the pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir and the effect of multiple
      doses of lopinavir/ritonavir on the pharmacokinetics of isavuconazole.

      Part 1 of the study includes 12 subjects randomized to receive either isavuconazole alone or
      isavuconazole in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir. The purpose of Part 1 is to evaluate
      safety and tolerability and to establish the effect of multiple doses of lopinavir/ritonavir
      on isavuconazole.

      Part 2, if initiated, includes 54 subjects randomized to receive isavuconazole alone,
      lopinavir/ritonavir alone, or isavuconazole in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir.
