    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of
      retigabine/ezogabine as an adjunctive treatment in subjects with either partial onset
      seizures (12 to &lt; 18 years old) or Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (12 to &lt;30 years old) who have
      participated in a previous (&quot;parent&quot;) study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is among the most common serious neurologic disorders in childhood. Medicines with
      novel actions of mechanisms of action are needed to try to address the unmet clinical need
      for seizure control in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of retigabine/ezogabine as an adjunctive
      treatment in subjects with either partial onset seizures (12 to &lt; 18 years old) or
      Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (12 to &lt;30 years old) who have participated in a previous (&quot;parent&quot;)
      study.

    <description>The CBCL is a widely used parent report questionnaire identifying behavioural and emotional problems in children. The checklist is comprised of a number of statements about the child's behavior, e.g. acts too young for his/her age. Responses were recorded on a likert scale: 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, 2 = very true or often true. The preschool checklist contained 100 questions and the school-age checklist contained 120 questions. During the study, only the parent/caregiver completed this questionnaire while the participants were within the age range (i.e. &lt;18 years). Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Eligibility Assessment (Visit 1) up to 178 days</time_frame>
    <description>The WRAML2 is a standardized test that measures an individual's memory functioning. It evaluates both visual and verbal, immediate and delayed memory ability along with the acquisition of new learning. The WRAML2 core battery is composed of two verbal, two visual, and two attention concentration subtests, yielding a verbal memory index, a visual memory index and an attention-concentration index. Together, these tests yield the general memory index. The administration time is approximately 40 minutes. During the study, this test was administered if the participant was within the age range (i.e. &gt;9 years). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). The parent study did not measure Baseline cognition, behavior, and learning so changes from Baseline were not available for participants in this study.</description>

Tanner stage I is defined as no pubic hair at all (prepubertal Dominic state); stage II is defined as a small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum (males) or on the labia majora (females); stage III is defined as when the hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally; stage IV is defined as adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs; and stage V is defined as when the: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs. The investigator assessed the participant's sexual development in participants &lt;18 years old based on the Tanner Stages of Puberty.</description>

    <time_frame>Basline, Eligibility Assessment (Visit 1) up to 178 days</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage reduction from Baseline in the seizure frequency was summarized using descriptive statistics. The frequencies and percentages were computed for a reduction in seizure frequency of &gt;50% as well as for a 100% reduction (seizure-free). Increases of &gt;50% in seizure frequency was also summarized. The percentage of seizure-free days wasere also analyzed. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression- Improvement (CGI-I) Assessment at the Indicated Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Eligibility Assessment (Visit 1) up to 178 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale provided an overall clinician-determined summary measure. It had 2 components: the CGI-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale and the CGI- Improvement (CGI-I) scale which rated the change from Baseline. The CGI-I scale scores range from 0 to 7 and are interpreted as 0=not assessed, 1=very much improved, 2=much improved, 3=minimally improved, 4=no change, 5=minimally worse, 6=much worse, 7=very much worse. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

    <measure>Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) Assessment at the Indicated Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Eligibility Assessment (Visit 1) up to 178 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale provided an overall clinician-determined summary measure. It had 2 components: the CGI-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) scale and the CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scale which rated the change from Baseline. The CGI-S was a 7-point scale that required the investigator to rate the severity of the participant's epilepsy relative to the investigator's past experience with other participants with the same diagnosis. The CGI-S scale scores range from 0 to 7 and are interpreted as 0=not assessed, 1=normal, 2=borderline, 3=mild, 4=moderate, 5=marked, 6=severe, 7=extremely severe. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840).

    <time_frame>Baseline, Eligibilty Assessment (Visit 1), EW Visit and FU Visit (up to 178 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The CHQ comprises scales specifically developed for children and adolescents aged five years and older. The CHQ assesses a child's physical, emotional, and social well-being from the perspective of a parent or guardian. The questionnaire was completed by a parent/caregiver and administration time was approximately 30 minutes. The parent/caregiver completed this questionnaire while the participant was within the age range (i.e. &lt;18 years). Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

    <time_frame>Eligibility Assessment (Visit 1) up to 178 days</time_frame>
    <description>AUC is defined as the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve, reflects the actual body exposure to drug after administration of a dose of the drug and is expressed in milligram*hour per Liter (mg*h/L). Blood samples for population PK analysis of retigabine/ezogabine were taken at clinic visits where routine clinical laboratory samples were also taken.

        <title>Change From Baseline in the BUN/Creatinine and the Urine Albumin/Creatinine Ratios at the Indicated Time Points</title>
        <description>Clinical laboratory assessments included hematology, chemistry and urinalysis parameters. Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)/Creatinine and Urine Albumin/Creatinine were measured at Visits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, EW and the FU Visit. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose values. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

Mean corpuscle volume and mean platelet colume parameters were measured at Visits 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, EW and the FU Visit. Change from Baseline was calculated by subtracting the Baseline value from the individual post-dose values. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

        <description>he Leiter International Performance Scale or simply Leiter is an intelligence test for children and adolescents, with norms ranging from 2 to 20 years. For all ages, it yields an intelligence quotient (IQ) and a measure of logical ability. It is comprised of ten subtests, seven of which were relevant to the 12-18 years age group. The administration time was approximately 40 minutes. During the study, only the parent/caregiver completed this questionnaire while the participants were within the age range (i.e. &lt;20 years). Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). The parent study did not measure baseline cognition, behavior, and learning so changes from baseline were not available for participants in this study.</description>

        <description>The WRAML2 is a standardized test that measures an individual’s memory functioning. It evaluates both visual and verbal, immediate and delayed memory ability along with the acquisition of new learning. The WRAML2 core battery is composed of two verbal, two visual, and two attention concentration subtests, yielding a verbal memory index, a visual memory index and an attention-concentration index. Together, these tests yield the general memory index. The administration time is approximately 40 minutes. During the study, this test was administered if the participant was within the age range (i.e. &gt;9 years). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840).

Tanner stage I is defined as no pubic hair at all (prepubertal Dominic state); stage II is defined as a small amount of long, downy hair with slight pigmentation at the base of the penis and scrotum (males) or on the labia majora (females); stage III is defined as when the hair becomes more coarse and curly, and begins to extend laterally; stage IV is defined as adult-like hair quality, extending across pubis but sparing medial thighs; and stage V is defined as when the: hair extends to medial surface of the thighs. The investigator assessed the participant's sexual development in participants &lt;18 years old based on the Tanner Stages of Puberty.</description>

The frequencies and percentages were computed for a reduction in seizure frequency of &gt;50% as well as for a 100% reduction (seizure-free). Increases of &gt;50% in seizure frequency was also summarized. The percentage of seizure-free days wasere also analyzed. Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>

        <description>The CHQ comprises scales specifically developed for children and adolescents aged five years and older. The CHQ assesses a child's physical, emotional, and social well-being from the perspective of a parent or guardian. The questionnaire was completed by a parent/caregiver and administration time was approximately 30 minutes. The parent/caregiver completed this questionnaire while the participant was within the age range (i.e. &lt;18 years). Baseline was the first pre-Retigabine assessment conducted in the parent study GSK113284 (NCT014945840). Because the study was terminated prematurely and the sample size is small, summary statistics were not compiled.</description>
