  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether treatment with a single oral 300 mg dose of
      canagliflozin alters the kinetics (ie, clearance/removal from body) of serum C-peptide (a
      protein released from the pancreas during insulin secretion) in healthy adult volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither the volunteer nor the study doctor/staff will know the
      identity of the assigned treatments) study to assess the effect of single oral (taken by
      mouth) dose of canagliflozin on clearance (removal from the body) of C-peptide in healthy
      adult volunteers. Healthy volunteers will be randomly (by chance) assigned to receive a
      single oral dose of canagliflozin followed by a single oral dose of placebo (inactive
      substance) or a single dose of placebo followed by a single dose of canagliflozin with a
      period of 7-10 days between treatments. Healthy volunteers will also receive intravenous
      (i.v.) infusion (injection in the vein) of somatostatin for 4 hours and a single dose i.v.
      injection of synthetic human C-peptide following administration of canagliflozin or placebo
      during each treatment period. Somatostatin will suppress the normal secretion of C-peptide, a
      protein that is released from the pancreas during insulin secretion, so that the human
      C-peptide administered to volunteers can be accurately measured. The total study duration for
      each volunteer will be approximately 44 days. During the study, blood and urine samples will
      be drawn (collected) for clinical laboratory evaluations.
