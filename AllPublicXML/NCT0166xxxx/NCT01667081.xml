  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-year (except for participants with chronic kidney disease [CKD] or cirrhosis)
      multicenter study to follow participants who received at least one dose of grazoprevir
      (MK-5172) in a previous study to determine whether they remain hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA
      negative over time, and to determine if they have developed antiviral resistance. The study
      will also evaluate long-term adverse events in this population. Participants from MK-5172-052
      (NCT02092350) with CKD or cirrhosis will be followed for five years.

      As of Amendment 03, the study design is revised such that continued enrollment will only be
      for participants who failed prior therapy with a grazoprevir regimen. Participants with CKD
      enrolled from MK-5172-052 (NCT02092350) will continue enrollment regardless of prior
      treatment-response and remain in this study for five years, while participants enrolled from
      all other studies with HCV RNA less than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) will be
      discontinued and end their participation after the next scheduled visit. In addition,
      participants who receive other HCV treatments concurrent with this follow-up study or
      received other HCV treatments prior to this study will be discontinued and their data
      excluded from analysis.

      As of Amendment 04, the protocol has been updated to include enrollment of pediatric
      participants from protocol MK-5172-079 (NCT03379506). Enrollment is limited to participants
      who experienced virologic failure associated with 1 or more treatment-emergent resistant
      associated substitutions (RASs) present at 12 weeks after receiving grazoprevir treatment in
      prior treatment study MK-5172-079 (NCT03379506).

        Adult and pediatric participants previously treated with a grazoprevir-containing regimen
        while enrolled in a Merck study. All participants enrolled having failed therapy from prior
        studies (except MK-5172-052 [NCT02092350]) will be followed for 3 years in the current
        follow-up study, and all participants enrolled from MK-5172-052 (irrespective of prior
        response) will be followed for 5 years in the current follow-up study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Previously participated in a HCV treatment protocol that included grazoprevir in the
             treatment regimen

          -  Must enroll in the present study within three months of the last study visit of their
             previous protocol in which they received a grazoprevir-containing regimen

          -  For Amendment 03: Adult participants must have received a grazoprevir-containing
             regimen in a prior trial and have been identified as having failed therapy in that
             study

          -  For Amendment 04: Pediatric participants must have received at least 1 dose of a
             grazoprevir-containing regimen and experienced virologic failure with 1 or more
             associated treatment-emergent RASs at Follow-up Week 12 in MK-5172-079 (NCT03379506)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has received HCV therapy after completion of the protocol-defined grazoprevir
             treatment trial regimen and before or after entry into this follow-up study

          -  For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy due to re-infection, defined as an HCV RNA sample
             with a different genotype than the baseline genotype in the prior treatment study, or
             an HCV RNA sample determined to be reinfection by phylogenetic analysis with
             comparison to the baseline sequence in the prior treatment study

          -  For Amendment 03: Has failed therapy and received retreatment with HCV therapy, except
             in the case where they were re-treated in a Merck-sponsored protocol
