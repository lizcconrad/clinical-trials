  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Underfeeding in the critically ill patient is a common observable fact throughout intensive
      care units. Patients who develop caloric deficit during their stay in the ICU have been shown
      in previous reports to be associated with increased complications such as increased rate of
      infections, and nosocomial blood stream infections. Yet, other studies have shown that
      patients with moderate caloric deficit may be associated with better outcome than patients
      who receive higher levels of caloric intake.

      Therefore, the aim of our study is to establish the exact amount of calories to be delivered
      by indirect calorimetry individually for each patient. Thereafter, each patient will be
      randomized to the trophic group (hypocaloric feeding), or to the full energy delivery group.
