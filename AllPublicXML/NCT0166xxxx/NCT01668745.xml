  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: All observational studies and a few randomised controlled trials (RCT) suggest
      that early measles vaccine (MV), in particular an early two-dose strategy, has a much better
      effect on overall mortality than later MV. These results suggest that MV has a non-measles
      related beneficial effect on child survival.

      Objective: To evaluate in a multi-center RCT the effect on child survival and other health
      indicators of a two-dose measles vaccination schedule by providing an additional dose of
      Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) MV as soon as possible after 4 months of age as well as the standard
      measles vaccine at 9 months of age. Three trials are planned in Guinea-Bissau, Ghana and
      Burkina Faso. The investigators will test a 40-43% reduction of mortality at each site
      separately and a 32% reduction overall. Based on the results from the RCT, the investigators
      will assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

      Design, Burkina Faso: Newborns are followed through the Health and Demographic Surveillance
      System (HDSS) of the Centre de Recherche en Sante de Nouna. Information on routine and
      campaign vaccinations will be collected regularly through home visits and health centre
      registers. Four weeks after having received the third dose of pentavalent vaccine (Penta3),
      the children will be eligible for enrollment in the trial if they are not severely ill.
      Eligible children will be invited to take part in the trial. Provided parental informed
      consent is given, the children will be randomised to MV at 4 and 9 months of age or only at 9
      months. Cost estimates will be based on consumption of services and average cost per unit.
      The incremental cost effectiveness ratio will be calculated.

      Sample size, follow-up and analyses: To detect a 43% reduction in overall mortality at each
      site the investigators intend to enroll at least 4050 children in Burkina Faso. The children
      will be followed for survival and hospitalisations to 3 years of age or to the end of the
      study after three years. The investigators will analyse the effects by site and combined; by
      sex and season; possible interactions with other interventions like campaigns with drugs,
      vaccines or micronutrients will be explored.

      Antibody study: 450 children will be enrolled in a subgroup study to examine the effect of
      maternal antibody levels on subsequent antibody responses to MV. The children will be
      followed to 24 months of age and samples collected at 4, 9 and 24 months of age.

    <description>The intervention is about to administer an early standard dose of Edmonston-Zagreb (EZ) measles vaccine in addition to the conventional dose. As such children will be randomised to receive either an early measles vaccine at 4 months after DTP3 or not. Thereafter both groups of children will receive the recommended EZ measles vaccine at 9 months of age according to WHO policy.</description>
