    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase IV trial to assess the efficacy and safety of
      sequential neoadjuvant chemotherapy with 4 cycles of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed by
      4 cycles of docetaxel(Monotaxel®) in patients with breast cancer of ≥5cm in size or
      cytologically confirmed axillary lymph nodes metastasis.

    <description>Pathologic complete response is defined as the disappearance of all invasive cancer in the postsurgical breast and lymph node specimens after completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Only residual intraductal carcinoma in the postsurgical breast specimen after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also considered as the achievement of pathologic complete response.</description>
