    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effects of adding carfilzomib to the combination of
      pomalidomide and dexamethasone in sequential dose escalation cohorts in patients with
      relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. This portion of the study is complete.

      This study will also investigate the effects of adding daratumumab to the combination of
      carfilzomib, pomalidomide and dexamethasone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone in 28 days treatment cycles.
      Study treatment continues for as long a their myeloma does not worsen and they do not have
      unacceptable side effects. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up
      to 2 years.
