  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and safety of
      paliperidone extended release (ER) tablets (between 3 to 12 milligram (mg), once a day) in
      the prevention of relapse in schizophrenia participants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the name of the assigned
      drug), randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by a chance), placebo-controlled,
      and parallel-group study of paliperidone ER tablets. The study will consist of 6 phases: 14
      days of screening phase, 8 weeks of open-label run-in phase (participants will be flexibly
      dosed with paliperidone ER once daily in a dose range of 3 mg to 12 mg), 6 weeks of
      stabilization phase (participants will continue to receive the fixed dose of paliperidone
      ER), double-blind (DB) phase of various length (participants will be randomly assigned in a
      1:1 ratio to receive either paliperidone ER or placebo and this phase will be completed after
      86 relapse events are observed or if the study is positive at the interim analysis), 6 months
      of open-label extension (participants who experience a relapse event or who remain relapse
      free for the entire duration of the double-blind phase and participants who are enrolled at
      the time the study is terminated, will be eligible for this phase. All participants will be
      treated with paliperidone ER and safety and tolerability information will be collected during
      this phase) phase and 6 months of follow-up phase (participants who withdraw during the DB
      phase for any reason other than relapse will be followed for 6 months or until they
      experience a relapse). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>A relapse is defined as any one of the following: 1. involuntary or voluntary psychiatric hospitalization 2. deliberate self-injury or violent behavior; 3. Suicidal or homicidal ideation and clinically significant aggressive behavior; 4. 25 percent (%) increase in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score for 2 consecutive assessments for participants whose score was greater than 40 at randomization, or a 10-point increase for participants who scored less than or equal to (≤) 40 at randomization; 5. increase for 2 consecutive assessments in PANSS items (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, hostility or uncooperativeness) to greater than or equal to (≥) 5 for participants who scored ≤3 at randomization, or to ≥6 for participants with initial score of 4. Independent Data Monitoring Committee performed ongoing safety monitoring during double-blind treatment and conducted the interim analysis after 61 relapse events had taken place.</description>

    <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

Suicidal or homicidal ideation and clinically significant aggressive behavior; 4. 25 percent (%) increase in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score for 2 consecutive assessments for participants whose score was greater than 40 at randomization, or a 10-point increase for participants who scored less than or equal to (≤) 40 at randomization; 5. increase for 2 consecutive assessments in PANSS items (delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness, hostility or uncooperativeness) to greater than or equal to (≥) 5 for participants who scored ≤3 at randomization, or to ≥6 for participants with initial score of 4.

        <description>The PSP is 100-point validated clinician-rated scale that assesses degree of difficulty in 4 areas of functioning: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviors rated on 6-point scale (1=absent to 6=very severe).Total transformed score from 1 to 100 is generated from raw score based on clinical interpretation of scores generated in 4 areas of functioning, with higher transformed score indicating better function. Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Percentage of participants achieving improvement in PSP score by at least one category was reported.</description>

        <title>Open-label Extension (OLE) Phase: Change From OLE Baseline in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score at OLE Endpoint</title>
        <description>The PANSS is a 30-item scale designed to assess various symptoms of schizophrenia including delusions, grandiosity, blunted affect, poor attention, and poor impulse control. The 30 symptoms are rated on a 7-point scale that ranges from 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme psychopathology). The PANSS total score consists of the sum of all 30 PANSS items and ranges from 30 to 210. Higher scores indicate worsening.

Total score is divided into 3 levels: 71-100 (mild difficulty); 31-70 (marked difficulty) and 1-30 (severe difficulty). Percentage of participants achieving improvement in PSP score by at least one category was reported.
