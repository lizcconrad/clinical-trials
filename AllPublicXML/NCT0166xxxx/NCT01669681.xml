    <textblock>
      The severe asthma is a major source of expenses in term of public health, while it concerns
      no more than 5 % of the asthmatics. The expenses is direct (medicines, hospitalizations,
      care) but especially indirect (absenteeisms, etc.). The forward-looking follow-up of cohort
      of more than 500 severe asthmatic patients multicentrique in an already widely established
      cohort (COBRA, at present in Visit 9 (one every 6 months) is an once-in-a-lifetime
      opportunity, coupled with the data of the CPAM, to identify well the evolution in time of a
      real medical economic variable. The possibility of dynamic follow-up of the expenses compared
      to the medical data offers perspectives of evaluation cost-efficiency of the informed
      therapeutic procedures. It is possible to couple in a forward-looking and dynamic way the
      data of health stemming from a cohort with the economic data stemming from the CPAM. This
      variable included in a Cluster's algorithm has to allow to identify the interventions the
      more and the less cost effective. The main objective of this study is to realize a cost
      estimate of care of the severe asthma. The variation of the costs will be also studied. The
      recruited patients are patients already included in the cohort COBRA in the centers of
      Marseille, Montpelier or Nice, classified GINA 4 and agreeing to participate.

      The following direct medical costs will be collected according to the point of view of the
      Social Security on a duration of 2 years:

        -  Hospitalizations (valuation from the GHS + medicines except GHS)Â· Consultations
           (valuation AM)

        -  Complementary(additional) examinations except hospitalization (valuation AM)

        -  Pharmacy (valuation AM)

        -  Transport (valuation AM)The estimate of average costs will be made with a reliable
           interval for 95 %.

      The average cost by patient of the care will be calculated for every year of the follow-up.
      Relationship individual cost-efficiency: by analogy with the studies cost-efficiency
      comparative clauses, the investigators shall calculate a relationship cost-efficiency at the
      individual level as follows: (cost-year2 - cost-year1) / (efficiency-year2 - efficiency-year
      1). Differences in these relationships will be looked for between various groups by tests of
      comparisons of averages.The construction of patients' clusters will be made according to the
      algorithm of the study SARP but also by using techniques statistics of classification non
      supervising to define our own algorithm. Variables used on our algorithm will include the
      relationship cost efficiency individual in addition to the clinical variables. The temporal
      stability of the relationship cost efficiency will be analyzed. The risk factors of a
      modification of this relationship will be looked for.

The relationship cost efficiency can so be calculated for two years for which we shall have the data.
The utility will be measured by means of the validated questionnaire EQ 5D.</description>
