    <textblock>
      BIOFLEX-I EU is the European arm of the BIOFLEX-I IDE study (NCT01319812). Data from
      BIOFLEX-I EU will be pooled with data in the IDE. The objective of this study is to
      separately demonstrate the clinical performance of BIOTRONIK's Astron and Pulsar-18 stents in
      the European arm of the BIOFLEX-I IDE (NCT01319812). The Pulsar-18 stent will be used for the
      treatment of femoro-popliteal lesions, located in the native superficial femoral artery (SFA)
      or proximal popliteal artery (PPA), while the Astron stent will be used for the treatment of
      the common or external iliac artery lesions.

          -  One de novo, restenotic or occluded lesion representing a femoro-popliteal or iliac
             indication OR Two de novo, restenotic or occluded lesions representing one
             femoro-popliteal indication and one iliac indication on contralateral limbs - (i.e.
             one target lesion per limb).

          -  Lesions may be one solid lesion or a series of multiple, smaller lesions to be treated
             as one lesion.

          -  Subjects with bilateral, SFA/PPA disease (i.e. one SFA/PPA lesion per limb) are
             eligible for enrolment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the
             investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral
             SFA/PPA intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure (prior to
             treatment of study lesion); however, the use of an investigational treatment is
             prohibited. If the contralateral SFA/PPA intervention is not performed at the time of
             the index procedure, the intervention must be performed at least 30 days after the
             index procedure. The use of an investigational treatment for the contralateral
             intervention is prohibited.

          -  Subjects with bilateral, iliac disease (i.e. one iliac lesion per limb) are eligible
             for enrollment into the study. The target lesion will be selected at the
             investigator's discretion based on study eligibility criteria. The contralateral iliac
             intervention may be performed at the time of the index procedure; however, the use of
             an investigational treatment is prohibited. If the contralateral iliac intervention is
             not performed at the time of the index procedure, the intervention must be performed
             at least 30 days after the index procedure. The use of an investigational treatment
             for the subsequent contralateral intervention is also prohibited.

          -  Femoro-popliteal lesions must be located at least 1 cm distal to the profunda femoris
             artery and at least 3 cm above the knee joint (radiographic joint space).

          -  Lesions must be treatable with a maximum of two stents.

          -  Angiographic evidence of ≥ 70% stenosis or occlusion (operator visual assessment).

          -  Lesion length ≤ 190 mm (if de novo or restenotic) or ≤ 100 mm (if occluded).

          -  Target vessel reference diameter: 2.5 to 6 mm (SFA/PPA) or 6 to 9 mm (iliac arteries)
             by visual estimate.

          -  Angiographic evidence of patent SFA and PPA (iliac indication) and angiographic
             evidence of at least one distal vessel runoff to the foot (both femoro-popliteal and

          -  For SFA/PPA intervention, a significant stenosis (&gt; 70%) or occlusion of an
             ipsilateral, inflow artery (e.g. aortoiliac, common femoral) must be successfully
             treated with PTA and/or commercially-available stent just prior to treatment of the
             target lesion. Successful treatment is defined as no complications and less than 30%
             residual stenosis following intervention.

          -  Presence of other ipsilateral, arterial lesions distal to the target lesion requiring
             treatment within 30 days of the index procedure (either before or after) or at the
             time of index procedure.

          -  Additional percutaneous interventional procedures (cardiac and/or peripheral) planned
