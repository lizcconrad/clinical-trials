  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the impact of a family-based intervention on the well-being of
      Burmese migrant and displaced children and families living in Tak province, Thailand. The
      methodology used in the impact evaluation study is a randomized waitlist controlled trial.

      The study hypothesizes that participation in a family-based intervention will lead to
      improved parenting practices and child and family outcomes, as follows.

      Primary hypotheses:

        1. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report increased
           knowledge and use of positive parenting skills compared to control;

        2. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report less use
           of physical punishment and other harsh forms of discipline compared to control;

        3. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will
           report higher levels of family functioning and cohesion compared to control.

      Secondary hypotheses:

        1. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will
           report lower levels of externalizing and internalizing child behaviors compared to
           control;

        2. Parents/caregivers and children participating in the family-based intervention will
           report higher levels of child resilience and psychosocial well-being compared to
           control;

        3. Parents/caregivers participating in the family-based intervention will report lower
           levels of alcohol use compared to control.
