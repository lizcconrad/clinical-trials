      This single center, randomized, single dose, open-label, four period cross-over study will
      evaluate the relative bioavailability of RO4917838 and the effect of food following oral
      administration in healthy volunteers. Subjects will receive in randomized order single oral
      doses of RO4917838 film coated tablets, either in the fasted or fed condition, or RO4917838
      hard gelatin capsules or RO4917838 oral suspension, with a washout period of at least 21 days
      between treatments. Anticipated time on study will be up to 23 weeks.
