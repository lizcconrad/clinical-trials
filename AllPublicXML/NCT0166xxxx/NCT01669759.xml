      According to the reports of department of Health, stroke has been the top three ranking in
      leading ten major mortality causes. Although fatigue is a common symptom after stroke, but it
      is easy to neglect due to fatigue is a non-specific symptom. Based on the literature review,
      fatigue symptom is not only common on post-stroke patient and it also has highly correlation
      with mortality, prognosis and efficacy of rehabilitation. In Traditional Chinese Medicine
      recording, Wang Qing-ren suggests that the main etiology of stroke is results from qi
      stagnation and blood stasis, thereafter, the study about qi deficiency and blood stasis
      became to the main stream for stroke until now. Therefore, the purpose of the present study
      was to investigate the correlation between the severity of fatigue, and the severity of qi
      deficiency and blood stasis.
