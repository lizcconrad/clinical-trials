    <textblock>
      The rise in childhood overweightness and concomitant increase in chronic disease risk
      warrants exploration into the effectiveness of interventions targeting the eating and
      activity habits of overweight youth. This research study developed and tested a &quot;Beverage
      Choice and Lifestyle Modification&quot; (BCLM) intervention for 4 to 8 year old children who are
      at-risk for being overweight or are overweight and who consume large amounts of sugar
      sweetened beverages and juice. The overall study objectives were to test the acceptability
      and effectiveness of the BCLM intervention for improving the weight status, energy (kcal)
      intake, beverage selections and beverage preferences of children in targeted age and BMI
      group. The investigators hypothesized that those children randomized to the BCLM group will
      show greater improvements in weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) status, beverage choices,and
      energy intake than those assigned to our Nutrition Education (NE) group.
