  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 that indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive subscale items, 7 negative subscale items, and 16 general psychopathology subscale items from the PANSS panel. PANSS Total Score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome). The primary statistical comparison was performed using the Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) approach.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participants were rated using the CGI-S scale. The study physician were to answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; Response choices included were: 0= not assessed; 1= normal; not at all ill; 2= borderline mentally ill; 3= mildly ill; 4= moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6= severely ill; and 7= among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in PANSS Positive Subscale Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In positive subscale, the 7 positive symptom constructs were: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. PANSS Positive Subscale Score ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in PANSS Negative Subscale Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated- absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated- extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS negative subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 negative symptom constructs were: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and stereotyped thinking. PANSS Negative Subscale Score ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The PSP was a validated clinician scale that measured personal and social functionining in 4 domains: socially useful activities eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviours. Impairement in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval and the study physician's judgement to determine the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented varying degrees of disability (31 to 70) and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>

    <measure>Mean Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I) Score at Endpoint.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of illness for each participants were rated using the CGI-S scale. The study physician were to answer the following question: &quot;Considering your total experience with this particular population, how mentally ill is the patient at this time?&quot; Response choices included were: 0= not assessed; 1= normal; not at all ill; 2= borderline mentally ill; 3= mildly ill; 4= moderately ill; 5= markedly ill; 6= severely ill; and 7= among the most extremely ill participants.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Responder Rate Based on PANSS Total Score.</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Responder rate was defined as ≥30% reduction from Baseline in PANSS Total Score. PANSS Total Score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome).</description>

      <recruitment_details>The trial was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole IM (intramuscular) depot as treatment for an acute episode of schizophrenia in adult participants. The trial was conducted in 55 sites.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>This trial included a 13-Day Screening phase (which includes Washout from previous antipsychotics for 7 days and/or washout from other prohibited medications), a 12-Week acute treatment phase, and a 14 (±2) Day safety follow-up.</pre_assignment_details>

        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 that indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS total score was the sum of the rating scores for 7 positive subscale items, 7 negative subscale items, and 16 general psychopathology subscale items from the PANSS panel. PANSS Total Score ranged from 30 (best possible outcome) to 210 (worst possible outcome). The primary statistical comparison was performed using the Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) approach.</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in PANSS Positive Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales that contained a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity is rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated the absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated extremely severe symptoms. In positive subscale, the 7 positive symptom constructs were: delusions, conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, excitement, grandiosity, suspiciousness/persecution, and hostility. PANSS Positive Subscale Score ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

        <population>Efficacy sample was defined as the intent to treat (ITT) population which included randomized participants who took at least one injection of double-blind (aripiprazole IM depot or placebo) and had at least one Post-Baseline efficacy assessment. Data of only 162 and 167 participants from aripiprazole and placebo groups were available.</population>

            <description>Participants randomized to aripiprazole IM depot received aripiprazole IM depot 400 mg as the initial dose with a single decrease to aripiprazole IM depot 300 mg permitted for tolerability per the study physician. The study treatment was injected into gluteal muscle every 4 weeks (Baseline/Day, Week 4, Week 8) during the 12-Week Acute Treatment Phase (ie, 3 IM depot injections). For 14 days beginning with the first injection, participants received concomitant oral aripiprazole (10 to 20 mg/day based on the study physician's clinical judgment).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in PANSS Negative Subscale Score.</title>
        <description>The PANSS consisted of three subscales: a total of 30 symptom constructs. For each symptom construct, severity was rated on a 7-point scale, with a score of 1 indicated- absence of symptoms and a score of 7 indicated- extremely severe symptoms. The PANSS negative subscale score was the sum of the rating scores for the 7 negative scale items from the PANSS panel. The 7 negative symptom constructs were: blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, poor rapport, passive apathetic withdrawal, difficulty in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation and stereotyped thinking. PANSS Negative Subscale Score ranges from 7 (absence of symptoms) to 49 (extremely severe symptoms).</description>

The study treatment was injected into gluteal muscle every 4 weeks (Baseline/Day, Week 4, Week 8) during the 12-Week Acute Treatment Phase (ie, 3 IM depot injections). For 14 days beginning with the first injection, participants received concomitant oral aripiprazole (10 to 20 mg/day based on the study physician's clinical judgment).</description>

        <title>Mean Change From Baseline to Endpoint in Personal and Social Performance Scale (PSP) Score.</title>
        <description>The PSP was a validated clinician scale that measured personal and social functionining in 4 domains: socially useful activities eg, work and study), personal and social relationships, self-care, disturbing and aggressive behaviours. Impairement in each of these domains was rated as absent, mild, manifest, marked, severe, or very severe. These ratings were then converted to a total score based on a 100-point scale using algorithms to identify the appropriate 10-point interval and the study physician's judgement to determine the total score within the 10-point interval. Participants with a PSP total score of 71 to 100 were considered to have mild functional difficulty. Scores of 31 to 70 represented varying degrees of disability (31 to 70) and ratings of 1 to 30 indicated minimal functioning that required intense support and/or supervision.</description>
