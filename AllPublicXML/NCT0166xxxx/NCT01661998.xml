      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship of A) The distal fusion level B)
      The total length of fusion and the post-operative range of motion in the unfused vertebral
      segments below the fusion in patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.

      The motion behavior in the unfused segments of the spine following instrumentation is poorly
      understood and the implications of hyper or hypo-mobility have not been clearly defined. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship of A) The distal fusion level B) The
      total length of fusion and the post-operative range of motion in the unfused vertebral
      segments below the fusion in patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis to answer the
      following specific clinical questions:

        1. Further elucidate the motion behavior of the distal unfused spinal segments,
           specifically:

             1. Does motion differ at various post-operative time points (2 year post-op patients
                versus 5 or 10 year post-op patients)?

             2. Can predictive factors be identified with post-operative altered motion?

        2. Further elucidate the relationship of the motion in the unfused spinal segments to the
           lowest instrumented vertebrae.

        3. Determine the relationship of the total length of fusion to the motion in the unfused
           spinal segments (i.e. compare unfused motion in the distal unfused segments in Lenke 5/6
           patients fused selectively (ThL/L only) versus nonselectively (TH and ThL/L)).

        4. Determine the relationship between clinical examinations (i.e. reports of pain or
           functional limitations) and patient reported outcomes (Health Related Quality of Life
           Outcome Tools) to motion in the distal unfused segments.
