    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to develop a North American registry for SUDEP cases;
      requesting family members of epilepsy patients who died suddenly of unclear causes (SUDEP) to
      contact the study team. The family members who decide to participate in the study will be
      asked to complete a brief telephone interview about their loved one's epilepsy and seizure
      history and the circumstances of his or her death. If the death has occurred within the past
      24 hours, and the family is willing to consider donating tissue to the study, the subject
      will be transferred to the Autism Tissue Program, and the remainder of the phone interview
      will be conducted at a later time.

      In addition to the phone interview, the family will be asked to provide access to the
      deceased's medical records. Any costs involved in obtaining medical records will be covered
      by the study, and all medical information will remain completely confidential.

      SUDEP stands for sudden unexplained death in epilepsy; a witnessed or unwitnessed,
      non-traumatic and non-drowning death occurring in benign circumstances, in a person with
      epilepsy with or without evidence of a seizure and excluding documented status epileptics
      (seizure duration of 130mins or longer, or seizures without recovery in between), in which a
      postmortem examination does not reveal a cause of death. SUDEP is not a cause of death so
      much as it is a descriptive term for a category of unexplained deaths in people with epilepsy
      or epilepsy-related conditions. Little is known about SUDEP and its mechanisms and risk
      factors.

      One of the main objectives of this study is to investigate the role of various risk factors
      in the development of sudden unexplained death in patients with epilepsy, with a particular
      focus on the role of antiepileptic medications. In addition, we want to elucidate the
      pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to SUDEP.

      If the family is willing to donate tissue, the family's permission is recorded in writing and
      it is filed in the subject's study record. The family can contact Autism Tissue Program (ATP)
      themselves or we will transfer the call to the ATP for them. The ATP has a 24/7 on call duty
      in place to receive new donors. The ATP coordinator will facilitate the donation process by
      coordinating with the family, medical examiner's office or hospital. The coordinator will
      also communicate to the research assistant when the donation is complete. In the case the
      participant does not want to donate tissue, but would like to donate other DNA samples, they
      will be able to do so through the NYU Biorepository. The participant will be consented, by
      research personnel, with the specific DNA collection consent form. Mucosal swaps or blood
      samples will be collected if available, if neither is available, we will collect hair or
      nails.

        The SUDEP group consists of epileptic patients who had a sudden unexplainable death
        excluding trauma, drowning, status epilepticus, or other known cause, but there is often
        evidence of an associated seizure.
