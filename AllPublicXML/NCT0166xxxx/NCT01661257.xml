    <textblock>
      This study investigated the expression of T-cell immunoglobulin- and mucin-domain-containing
      molecule 3 (TIM-3) in the colonic mucosa and/or the peripheral blood of children with Crohn's
      disease during anti TNF-α (infliximab) therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The immunoregulatory effects of TIM-3 on patients with Crohn's disease according to the
      treatment have not yet been investigated.
