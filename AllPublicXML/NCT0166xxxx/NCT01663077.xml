  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-60% of all schizophrenia patients who fail to respond to typical
      antipsychotics may respond to Clozapine. Clozapine has long been considered the &quot;gold
      standard&quot; within the atypical neuroleptic spectrum, backed by years of clinical experience
      and research, but uncertainties remain in some aspects of this drug. One such question is the
      link between dose, blood levels and patient clinical response. The Clozapine therapeutic
      plasma levels range between 250 - 450 ng/mL creating difficulties in using these results in
      routine clinical practice. Approximately 30% - 51% of &quot;treatment-resistant schizophrenia&quot;
      patients do not fully respond to Clozapine, a poorly understood phenomenon. Factors relevant
      to Clozapine-resistance include co-morbidity, drug misuse, poor adherence, inadequate
      duration of treatment and inadequate dose/plasma-levels. Pharmacogenetic factors such as
      different polymorphisms in involved genes may play a role. Pharmacodynamic and genetic data
      appear important in determining the clinical response to Clozapine. Clozapine-treated
      patients possessing different 3A4 polymorphisms, may respond differently as compared to other
      patients having normal 3A4 alleles. Recently, the CYP2D6 has also been involved in this drug
      metabolic pathway. Population pharmacokinetics of clozapine evaluated with the nonparametric
      maximum likelihood method. This pharmacogenetic explanation/hypothesis may explain Clozapine-
      resistance in schizophrenics.

      The high variability in plasma levels requires a large study in order to be able to determine
      correlation between clinical efficacy and plasma levels and genotyping. A preliminary study
      will enable power analysis and adequate determination of sample size.

          -  All clozapine mono-therapy patients (only 300 mg/day) who respond to treatment and

             alcohol or drug abuse, substance dependence (other than nicotine dependence), or
             presenting symptoms likely substance- induced, as judged by a study physician.
