  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several techniques have been advocated to get good contacts in dental composite restorations
      including interdental separation ring. The investigators study focuses on using separation
      ring with circumferential matrix band instead of a sectional band. Moreover, the
      investigators have attempted to study proximal tightness and proximal contours of composite
      restoration as separate variables

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 188 premolar teeth with proximal cavity to be assigned on alternate basis in two
      groups. Intervention group teeth received Automatrix band after cavity preparation followed
      by the separation ring using clamp while the control group received Automatrix band alone.

      All teeth to be restored with P-60 composite restorative material(3M-ESPE Dental, USA).
      Outcome (proximal tightness) is determined by a blinded assessor just after the restoration.

    <description>The prepared teeth received Automatrix band (similar to the control group, product code# 62422513). The Automatrix was burnished against the adjacent tooth gently. Anatomical wedges were applied in the proximal area and then the separation ring (BiTine® round ring by Palodent systems, Dentsply International, DE, USA product # 659040) placed with the help of retainer forceps.</description>

It was secured on the prepared tooth and burnished against the adjacent tooth gently. Anatomical wedges were placed in the inter-proximal area gingival to the cavity preparation.</description>
