    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if two breakfasts of equivalent calories, an oat based breakfast
      cereal or a ready-to-eat cereal, provide the same satiety benefits. The study will also
      determine if the two calorically equivalent oat-based breakfast cereals give different
      caloric intakes at a lunch meal that participants will eat to their satisfaction.

      The Second trial (Period 2): An additional 48 healthy men and women 18 years of age or older
      will be enrolled to investigate the satiety and food intake at lunch after a breakfast
      consisting of one of two randomly assigned oat-based cereals and milk breakfast. Visual
      analogue scales of hunger and satiety will be completed before breakfast and at, 30, 60, 120,
      180, and 240 minutes following consumption. Subjects will be asked to eat Lunch until
      satisfied. The subjects will have the two breakfasts in a balanced and random order and the
      two meal tests will be separated by at least a week.
