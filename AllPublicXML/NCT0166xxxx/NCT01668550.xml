      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the oral Src/Abl
      inhibitor AZD0424, and to find tolerable and effective AZD0424 combination regimens for the
      treatment of advanced solid tumours
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD0424 is a potent orally available, potent (IC50 approximately 4 nM) inhibitor of Src and
      ABL1 kinases with additional activity against Src family kinase (SFK) members including Yes
      and Lck. AZD0424 was selective for SFKs and ABL1 kinase over C-terminal Src kinase (a
      negative regulator of Src) and a range of other kinase targets. The anti-cancer activity of
      AZD0424 is thought to be mediated primarily by anti-migratory and anti-invasive signalling
      and, as such, it is expected that in the late stage cancer setting strong signals of efficacy
      with this compound used as a single agent are unlikely, requiring it to be administered in
      combination with other anti-cancer agents.

      In summary the study will be performed in four main stages:

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose escalation: Phase Ia single agent (AZD0424) dose escalation
           study to determine the MTD.

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose expansion: Phase Ib single agent dose expansion at MTD (up to
           six additional patients may be recruited in order to provide paired tumour biopsies for
           PD analysis).

        -  Combination arm dose escalation: Provided that it is deemed appropriate (after review of
           available clinical data from the monotherapy part of the trial, and available
           preclinical and published data on the combination), a Phase Ia dose escalation arm of
           AZD0424 in combination with the selected agent will proceed to determine the MTD for the
           combination and a recommended Phase II dose.

        -  Combination arm dose expansion: Phase Ib combination arm using the recommended Phase II
           dose for both AZD0424 and the combination agent.

    <description>AZD0424 will be administered as a flat dose orally once a day. One treatment cycle consists of 28 days of continuous drug administration with AZD0424, with the flexibility to introduce treatment breaks if required due to cumulative toxicity.
Combination agents and treatment regimen with AZD0424 will be confirmed and approved at a later date.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven solid tumour, refractory to conventional
             treatment, or for which no conventional therapy exists or is declined by the patient
             or for whom there is the prospect of clinical benefit

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0-2

          -  Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These
             measurements must be performed within one week (Day -7 to Day 1) before the patient

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the DDO
             should not exclude the patient.

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception as
             detailed in the protocol). Men with pregnant or lactating partners should be advised
             to use barrier method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to
             prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

          -  At high medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease including active
             uncontrolled infection.

          -  Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Resting ECG with measurable QTc interval of &gt;480 msec (mean value and manually
             verified) of at least 3 time points within a 24 hour period.

             combination. Participation in an observational, counseling or psychological trial
             would be acceptable.

          -  Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
