      The main objective of this study is to determine the feasibility, efficacy and safety of
      automated closed-loop glucose control in the home setting over a short term period. The data
      and experienced gained from this study will be utilised in planning future home studies.

      This is an open-label, three centre, randomised, crossover design, involving two, 8 day
      (first day in the clinical research facility and seven days at home) study periods during
      which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by
      subjects usual insulin pump therapy in random order. A total of up to 24 adults (aiming for
      18 completed subjects) aged 18 years and older with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be
      recruited through diabetes clinics and other established methods in participating centres.

      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery
      system. During the 24 hour in-patient stay subjects will be encouraged to mimic their usual
      day and will be allowed to walk inside hospital premises. Subjects will be advised to
      discontinue automated closed-loop insulin delivery and follow their usual insulin pump
      therapy for periods of strenuous exercise during the 7 day home study phase.

      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by
      CGM (adjusted for potential over-estimation) during home stay. Secondary outcomes are the
      time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other
      CGM-based metrics, and for the stay at the clinical research facility, time spent in the
      target range, above and below the target range as measured by plasma glucose.
