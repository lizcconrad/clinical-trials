  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an intensive therapy used to improve survivorship
      and cure various oncologic diseases. However, this therapy is associated with high mortality
      rates and numerous negative side-effects. The recovery of the immune system is a special
      concern and plays a key role in the success of this treatment. In healthy populations it is
      known that exercise plays an important role in immune system regulation, but little is known
      about the role of exercise in the hematological and immunological recovery of children
      undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The Primary objective of this Randomized
      Controlled Trial is: study the effect of an exercise program on immune cell recovery in
      patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. The Secondary objective is to
      determine if an exercise intervention might diminish the deterioration of quality of life,
      physical fitness, and the acquisition of a sedentary lifestyle.

      Methods

      Twenty-four participants treated for a malignancy with autologous stem cell transplant (5 to
      18 years) in the Alberta Children's Hospital will be randomly assigned to an exercise or
      control group. The exercise group will participate in a two-phase exercise intervention (in
      and outpatient) from hospitalization until 10 weeks after discharge. The exercise program
      includes strength, flexibility and aerobic exercise. During the inpatient phase this program
      will be performed 5 times/week and will be supervised. The outpatient phase will combine a
      supervised session with two home-based exercise sessions with the use of the Wii device. The
      control group will follow the standard protocol without any specific exercise program. A
      range of outcomes, including quantitative and functional recovery of immune system, cytokine
      levels in serum, NK cells and their subset recovery and function, and gene expression of
      activating and inhibitory NK cell receptors, body composition, nutrition, quality of life,
      fatigue, health-related fitness assessment and physical activity levels will be examined,
      providing the most comprehensive assessment to date.

      Discussion We expect to find an improvement in the immunological recovery, quality of life,
      decreased acquisition of sedentary behavior and less fitness deconditioning.

    <description>Assessment of the impact of the Exercise (EX) intervention on the immune recovery of pediatric autologous SCT patients will be based on four parameters (a) Recovery of different leukocyte cell subset (e.g., T cells, Natural killer cells, B cells, monocytes, neutrophils etc) in peripheral blood by flow cytometry, (b) Expression of activating and inhibitory Killer IRs by Gene expression analysis of 14 KIR genes will be done by RNA based real-time PCR analysis(c) Function of NK cells and their subsets by measuring in-vitro cytokine secretion and degranulation by different NK cell subsets (cytolytic and regulatory NK cells) on incubation with K-562 cell lines and (d) Levels of different pro-inflammatory and regulatory cytokines in serum using a bead-based array on Luminex.</description>

    <description>Will be assessed using the Pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQL) general and cancer module as a self-report, and PedsQL and Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2) as parent proxy report.

    <description>Body composition; musculoskeletal fitness (flexibility, muscular strength and endurance); functional mobility and cardiorespiratory fitness will be performed.
Body composition: weight, height, skinfold measure (biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac).
Flexibility: sit and reach Muscular strength: A hand- held dynamometer will be used to assess grip strength and knee extension.
Muscular endurance: modified push up, partial curl-up and 30 seconds squat test.
Functional mobility: Time up and go test (3 meters) Cardiorespiratory fitness: Treadmill submaximal test. Height and tanner stage will be used to determine duration of each stage (2-3 minutes) and initial velocity of the protocol.</description>

    <description>A triaxial accelerometer (Actical - Phillips respironic) will be put on when the participant gets up from bed each day and worn until the participant is ready to fall asleep. Subjects can go about their normal, daily activities, including rigorous exercise, swimming or bathing. During each assessment subjects will be instructed to wear the activity monitor over their right hip on an elasticized belt for seven consecutive days. Additionally, participants will be asked to record, in a daily log, the time they put on and took off the monitor each day.</description>

    <description>This study will examine the effect of two phases of an EX program on several health related outcomes in pediatric patient undergoing autologous SCT. The first phase of the EX program will be an inpatient intervention and will begin when the child is hospitalized undergoing conditioning therapy and will continue until discharge.
The second phase will be a 10-week outpatient intervention, beginning once the child is discharged. We will utilize a mixed EX program, including supervised (at the University of Calgary) and home-based training incorporating the use of the Nintendo ® Wii device™ (Wii Fit, Wii Dance and Sports™ games).</description>
