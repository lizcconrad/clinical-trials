  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 15-25% of the population of developed countries suffers for metabolic syndrome. It is
      associated with a 2-4 fold increase in cardiovascular morbility and mortality and with a 5- 9
      fold increase in developing type II diabetes. MS prevalence increases after the onset of
      menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is still not clear if menopause itself
      increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women or only in those that develop MS.
      Many MS patients that show slight modification in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters are
      not generally pharmacologically treated since diabetes or alteration in the lipid profile are
      not evidenced. In this respect it is of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to
      prevent and treat MS. Genistein (4,5,7-trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a potentially preventive
      role on the cardiovascular apparatus in post-menopausal women, may be termed as selective ER
      modulator (SERM), since it reveals both ER-alpha full agonist and ER-beta partial agonist
      activity.

      The investigators studied whether genistein may represent an efficacious and safe alternative
      for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical
      study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 150 patients with
      metabolic syndrome. After a 4-week stabilization on a standard fat-reduced diet, participants
      were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6
      months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin
      resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin
      and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety
      assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.

    <description>Fasting glucose and insulin were measured in serum collected after an overnight fast using routine methods. Total cholesterol, High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides were measured by using a routine enzymatic method, and the Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) level was calculated by using the Friedewald formula: [Total cholesterol (mg/dL) - High Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (HDL-C) (mg/dL) - triglycerides (mg/dL)/5].</description>

    <description>Participants were asked about symptoms at clinic visits every 6 months. Standard clinical evaluations and laboratory analyses, including hematologic, renal, and liver function tests, were done every 6 months. Endometrial thickness was evaluated by using ultrasonography at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year. The endometrial thickness was measured in the sagittal plane from 1 basal layer to the other. If the endometrial thickness was 8 mm or greater or if uterine bleeding occurred, hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy were performed. All unfavorable and unintended clinical effects were considered adverse effects and were evaluated for severity, duration, seriousness, and relation to the study drug and outcome.</description>
