  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects one in six couples in the United Kingdom (UK) and has devastating
      physical, social and emotional consequences for affected couples. In vitro fertilisation
      (IVF) treatment is now widely and successfully used to enable infertile couples to conceive.
      However, IVF treatment can result in the potentially life threatening condition, ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Mild forms of OHSS occur in approximately 1 in 3 of all IVF
      cycles, whilst approximately 1 in 10 IVF cycles result in moderate or severe OHSS. OHSS is
      caused by the use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) used in IVF treatment to stimulate
      oocyte (egg) maturation. Kisspeptin is a hormone which stimulates reproductive hormone
      secretion and is responsible for the release of reproductive hormones which result in oocyte
      maturation and ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). The significant advantage of
      kisspeptin over current treatments to stimulate ovulation, is that it would stimulate a more
      physiological increase in reproductive hormones and oocyte maturation during IVF treatment.
      The aims of this project are to investigate whether administration of kisspeptin to women can
      result in oocyte maturation.

      Participants in the study will have a standard Gonadotrophin Releasing Hormone (GnRH)
      antagonist cycle except using kisspeptin to trigger oocyte maturation rather than hCG.
