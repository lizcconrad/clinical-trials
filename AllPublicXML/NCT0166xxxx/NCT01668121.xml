    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the acceptance range with which two
      Symbicort Turbohaler batches could be declared bioequivalent in a bioequivalence setting. The
      secondary objective is to compare pharmacokinetic parameters of the reference product batches
      and Budesonide/formoterol Easyhaler.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Written informed consent (IC) obtained.

          2. Males and females, 18-55 (inclusive) years of age.

          3. Normal weight defined as body mass index (BMI) &gt; 19 and &lt; 30 kg/m2 (BMI=
             weight/height2).

          4. Weight at least 50 kg.

          5. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) at least 80% of the predicted value
             measured at the screening.

          6. Good general health ascertained by detailed medical history, and laboratory and
             physical examinations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Vulnerable subjects (i.e. persons under any administrative or legal supervision).

          2. Evidence of a clinically significant cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, haematological,
             gastrointestinal, pulmonary, metabolic-endocrine, neurological or psychiatric disease
             within previous 2 years; or evidence of active or quiescent pulmonary tuberculosis,
             fungal and viral infections in the airways.

          3. Any condition requiring regular concomitant treatment (including vitamins and herbal
             products) or likely to need any concomitant treatment during the study. As an
             exception, paracetamol and ibuprofen for occasional pain are allowed.

          4. Intake of any medication that could affect the outcome of the study. As an exception,
             contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy are allowed. The use of medicines which
             are strong CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors are restricted for at least 2 weeks prior to
             the first study treatment administration and during the study.

          5. Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or physical finding (including
             electrocardiogram [ECG] and vital signs) that may interfere with the interpretation of
             test results or cause a health risk for the subject if he/she participates in the
             study, as judged by the investigator. More specifically, supine HR &lt; 45 or &gt; 100 bpm
             after 10-min rest or supine systolic BP &gt;140 or &lt; 90 or diastolic BP &gt; 90 or &lt; 60 mmHg
             after a 10-minute rest, or a QTc-Bazett (QTcB interval) &gt; 450 msec at screening
             evaluation.

          6. Known hypersensitivity to the active substances or the excipient (lactose, which
             contains small amounts of milk protein) of the drug.

          7. History of vasovagal collapses.

          8. History of anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions.

          9. History of seizures including febrile seizures.

         10. Pregnant or lactating females.

         11. Females of childbearing potential if they are not using proper contraception
             (mechanical and/or hormonal contraception, intrauterine device [IUD] or surgical
             sterilization). Double method of contraception is needed when using oral or mechanical
             contraception: e.g. condom in conjunct with oral contraception and spermicidal product
             with mechanical contraception (please see section 5.7 for details).

         12. Recent or current (suspected) drug abuse or positive result in the drugs abuse test.

         13. Recent or current alcohol abuse (regular drinking more than 21 units per week for
             males and more than 16 units per week for females [1 unit = 4 cl spirits or
             equivalent]).

         14. Current use of nicotine containing products more than 5 cigarettes (or equivalent)/day
             and/or inability to refrain from the use of nicotine containing products during the
             study (from the screening visit to the end-of-study visit).

         15. Use of caffeine containing beverages more than 600 mg of caffeine/day and/or inability
             to refrain from the use of caffeine containing beverages during the treatment periods
             until 24 h after study treatment administration.

         16. Blood donation or loss of significant amount of blood within 30 days prior to the
             first study treatment administration.

         17. Administration of another investigational drug within 30 days prior to the first study
             treatment administration.

         18. Unsuitable veins for repeated venepuncture or for cannulation.

         19. Inability to learn the correct inhalation technique.

         20. Predictable poor compliance or inability to communicate well with the study centre
             personnel.

         21. Inability to participate in all treatment periods.

         22. The subject is not able to understand and comply with protocol requirements,
             instructions and protocol-stated restrictions.

         23. Positive result in HIV, hepatitis B or C tests.
