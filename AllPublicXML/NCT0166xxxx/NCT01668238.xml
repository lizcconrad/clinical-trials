      The purpose of this stage of study is to establish discriminant among healthy tissue, benign
      and malignant thyroid and breast tumors by fourier transform infrared spectrometry variables.

    <textblock>
      Recently,the methods to the diagnosis of tumors include palpation,X-ray,ultrasound,CT and
      MRI.The doctors could not get conclusion without a existing mass.The FNB is very popular
      nowadays in western countries,but it has been reported that about one-third malignant cases
      have been neglected by FNB,for the tissue isn't enough through the needle.There also have
      been reports about the increased auxilliary lymphnode metastases for breast cancer because of
      FNB.Although the Mammotome has been used widely,it is still traumatic.

      Process of malignant transformation of tissues and cells, first proteins, lipids,
      carbohydrates and nucleic acids constitute the main substance of tissue and cell structure,
      conformation, and the number of occurrence of significant changes in subsequent histological
      changes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is the major molecular bond coupling between
      the atoms vibrational spectra and molecular rotational spectra.

      In this study, consists of three phases:

      Stage one:

      Continuous enrollment requires inpatient surgery 300 cases of thyroid cancer patients and
      breast cancer patients, 200 cases of preoperative determination of tumor on the surface
      infrared spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy of the anterior tumor tissue and lymph node
      surgery, measured in vivo; at the same time into the group of 50 patients healthy people, the
      determination of surface infrared spectroscopy of the thyroid and breast area. Paraffin
      pathological findings as the gold standard, the thyroid and breast cancer patients were
      divided into the benign group and malignant group, relatively healthy and good, the
      distribution of differences of the surface infrared spectrum of malignant group, while
      relatively good in the malignant group IR spectra of the distribution of differences.

      Phase II:

      Were enrolled, infrared spectroscopy and pathological specimens were collected at different
      stages. Paraffin pathological findings as the gold standard, were established two tumor
      surface, the infrared spectra of the fresh in vitro and in vivo for tumor benign or malignant
      diagnosis discrimination system.

      Phase III:

      Into the infrared spectra collected data on behalf of the above-mentioned discrimination
      system to verify its sensitivity, specificity and accuracy; both paraffin pathological
      findings as the gold standard to compare the infrared spectral discrimination systems and
      intraoperative frozen section pathology for the diagnosis of benign and malignant tumors
      correctly rate differences, to explore the clinical value of infrared spectroscopy
      discrimination system.
