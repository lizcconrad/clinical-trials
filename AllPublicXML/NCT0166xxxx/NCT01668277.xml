  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertensive crisis is a life-threatening condition, in which the blood pressure in
      the pulmonary artery, vein, and capillaries. Infusion of hypertonic saline solutions expand
      the circulating volume, thus allowing more blood to flow and reducing pressure in the artery,
      vein, and capillaries. Furthermore, infusion of hypertonic saline has been shown to reduce
      both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances in adults. If the pulmonary vascular
      resistance decreases more or to the same degree as the systemic resistance, infusion of
      hypertonic saline may prove beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crisis. The
      primary objective of this study is to investigate how a clinically relevant dose of
      hypertonic saline affects the systemic and pulmonary circulations in children undergoing
      cardiac catheterization during general anesthesia. This study hypothesizes that an infusion
      of hypertonic saline over 10 minutes will reduce the pulmonary vascular resistance more than
      the systemic vascular resistance.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children who have had a heart transplant and are scheduled for elective endomyocardial
             biopsies during general anaesthesia

          -  Age &gt; 2 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Plasma Na &lt; 130 mmol/l or &gt;150 mmol/l

          -  Refusal of consent

          -  An estimated pulmonary arterial pressure which is greater than or equal to 66% of
             systemic blood pressure

          -  Children with heart failure (right and/or left), i.e clinical suspicion by either a
             cardiologist or an anesthesiologist of inability to tolerate a fluid bolus of 3 ml/kg
             7.2% NaCl corresponding to an expansion of the circulatory volume by approximately 9%
             (see the section on safety), which is the equivalent of infusion approximately 20
             ml/kg 0.9% NaCl over 10 minutes.
