  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that N-acetylcysteine exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating
      neurotransmitters and cell signaling pathways. We hypothesize that oral N-acetylcysteine
      augmentation will help reduce symptoms in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder as well
      as improve cognitive functions. We also expect that the N-acetylcysteine augmentation will
      induce change in structural, functional, and neurochemical aspects of the brain.

      In this study, we plan to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled augmentation
      study with N-acetylcysteine in addition to escitalopram. We will assess the efficacy and
      safety of the N-acetylcysteine augmentation.
