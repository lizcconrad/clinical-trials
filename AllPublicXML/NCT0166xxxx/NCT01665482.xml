      Rationale: It is well established that increased intake of saturated fatty acids (SFA) is
      associated with incidence of cardiovascular heart disease (CHD). This effect is mediated by
      dietary saturated fat's impact on fasting plasma cholesterol levels. Research is needed to
      clarify the association between dietary fatty acids and metabolic risk markers beyond lipid
      profile. World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended reduced intake of SFA with energy
      replacement from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) or carbohydrates (CARB). However, limited
      evidence is available on the effects of dietary fatty acids on insulin sensitivity and
      secretion. The current study is designed to investigate the effects of SFA versus MUFA versus
      CARB on insulinemic response and lipid metabolism in healthy individuals with central
      obesity.

      Study design: A randomized, crossover, single blind design study was carried out. The
      subjects consumed controlled diets for 6 weeks each. They were provided 3 meals per day
      during weekdays in which SFA, MUFA and CARB diet was assigned to them randomly. Protein
      content was standardised at 14% energy. The SFA and MUFA diets each provided 31.5% energy
      intake from fat, with 69% of the total fats replaced by test fats (approximately 49 g/d based
      on a 2000 kcal basic diet). Each individual fatty acid provided approximately 7% of the total
      energy intake. The CARB diet provided approximately 34 g/day experimental fat based on a 2000
      kcal basic diet. The CARB diet replaced 7 % energy of carbohydrate from total fat with the
      exchange from oleic acid (C18:1).

      Hypothesis: Changing energy from dietary fat (SFA and MUFA) to carbohydrate will influence
      insulin sensitivity, endothelial and vascular function, pro-inflammatory markers and lipid
      metabolism differently in individuals with metabolic syndrome. SFA (palm olein) may be
      comparable with MUFA (high oleic sunflower oil) with regards to its effects on insulin
      sensitivity, endothelial and vascular function and inflammation
