  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the last forty years the prevalence of asthma has increased in westernised countries. We
      have hypothesised that this increase may be a consequence of changing diet. Several birth
      cohort studies have now reported an association between reduced maternal vitamin E intake
      during pregnancy and childhood asthma.

      However, it remains to be seen whether increasing maternal vitamin E intake during pregnancy
      reduces the risk of childhood asthma. We are planning a large placebo controlled trial in
      pregnant women, to investigate whether optimisation of dietary vitamin E intake to the
      recommended 15mg/day reduces the likelihood of childhood asthma. We believe that a dietary
      intervention using vitamin E in its natural form of food is more likely to be successful and
      acceptable than a vitamin E supplement. We have previously demonstrated than pregnant women
      can optimise their vitamin E intake using a personalised dietary plan with the help of a
      dietitian however this intervention was complex and could not be translated into everyday
      use. With commercial support we have developed a range of soups containing foods naturally
      rich in vitamin E designed to optimise maternal vitamin E intake to 15mg/day. A range of
      similar tasting and looking placebo soups has also been developed. In this study we will
      pilot a randomised controlled trial of the active and placebo soups to ascertain whether
      pregnant women are willing and able to optimise their vitamin E intake during pregnancy using
      the soups in order to reduce the risk of their child developing asthma. optimising maternal
      vitamin E intake during pregnancy.
