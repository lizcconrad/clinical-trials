  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negligence or contempt of the etiology and pathogenesis of minor ischaemic stroke in the
      early diagnosis and effective treatment leads to more than 40-50% of patient with recurrent
      episodes, and 10% patient died. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment of minor ischaemic stroke
      according to the etiology and pathogenesis is important.

      The 2007 Korean modified TOAST type got some progress, but there exists two major
      disadvantages: imperfect diagnosis and pathogenesis of perforator artery infarction etiology;
      lack of typing according to the pathogenesis of large atherosclerotic infarction and taking
      measures of treatment according to the new types. Recently, domestic professor Gaoshan
      proposes new approach to diagnose and treat minor ischaemic stroke according to the etiology
      and pathogenesis of CISS typing, but the pathogenesis of hypoperfusion infarction with severe
      stenosis of large artery is unclear. Is it low perfusion? Or artery-artery embolization? Or
      both? How to distinguish the pathogenesis of branch artery disease: by atherosclerosis? Or
      hyalinosis? Or both? How to check the validity of clinical types? This study take different
      interventions according to different types and observation of the long term clinical results
      of intervention( mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and rate of cerebral hemorrhage
      and subarachnoid hemorrhage), in order to clarify the new types can indeed solve the current
      problem of minor ischaemic stroke with high mortality, recurrence rate, disability rate and
      rate of cerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
