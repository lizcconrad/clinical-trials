      This is an observational study to assess the experience of current depot medroxyprogesterone
      acetate (DMPA) intramuscular (IM) clients and providers when they try Depo-subQ in Uniject
      and offer recommendations for the introduction of this method.

      A total of 560 participants will be enrolled in the study in the following groups:

      360 participants (120 in Uganda and 240 in Senegal) who are current DMPA IM clients who seek
      re-injection of DMPA from either community health workers (CHWs) or clinic-based providers;
      and are 18-40 years of age; received their most recent DMPA injection no more than 13 weeks
      prior to enrollment in the study [16].

      Up to 100 participants (50 in Uganda and 50 in Senegal) current DMPA IM clients who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria but do not want to receive the injection with Depo-subQ in
      Uniject and are willing to complete a short questionnaire

      80 CHWs (40 in Uganda and 40 in Senegal) and 20 clinic-based providers (from Senegal only)
      who are trained to give Depo-subQ in Uniject as part of this study
