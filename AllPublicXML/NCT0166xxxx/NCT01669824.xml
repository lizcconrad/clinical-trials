    <textblock>
      In this non-interventional one year study, data about overall and particularly
      gastrointestinal tolerability, indications, cardiovascular risk factors and compliance are
      collected by basic questionnaires, which are handed out by pharmacists to patients who
      acquire (in Germany no prescription is needed) Rx (Prescription) or OTC (Over-The-counter)
      Aspirin protect (enteric coated aspirin) 100 mg and are willing to participate in the study.
      After 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up questionnaires are sent out. Aim of the study is to get
      information about safety, usage and compliance under everyday's conditions, because in
      Germany low-dose aspirin is an OTC product with Rx indication.
