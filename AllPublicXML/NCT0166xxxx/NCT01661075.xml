  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot project is to determine whether using inertial sensors placed on
      the waist during routine clinical balance testing (i.e. Balance Error Scoring System) (BESS),
      will be a more immediate, objective, reliable and sensitive way to measure and quantify
      balance deficits in individuals with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The investigators
      are also trying to observe if the sensors can be used to detect balance recovery after a
      mTBI.

      The investigators hypothesis is that collegiate atheltes with mTBI injury will have different
      recovery periods between their cognitive testing(IMPACT) and their balance measures.

      The purpose of this pilot project is to determine whether using inertial sensors (ipod like
      device) placed on the waist during routine clinical balance testing (i.e. Balance Error
      Scoring System (BESS), will be a more immediate, objective, reliable and sensitive way to
      measure and quantify balance deficits in individuals with mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI).
      The investigators are also trying to observe if the sensors can be used to detect balance
      recovery after a mTBI.

      The participants will be recruited through the local university's athletic department.

      The participants will undergo balance tests from the BESS test while wearing a sensor around
      their waist.The BESS consists of different balance tests; such as balancing on one leg and
      tandem standing. The participants will also answer questionnaires about their daily lives and
      cognitive tests. If the participant has had a mTBI they will complete questionnaires about
      symptoms from their injury and may perform an additional IMPACT test which is a computerized
      cognitive tests used by coaches, athletic trainers and managing physicians.

      Along with the clinical balance tests and questionnaires, the project will use a small sensor
      placed on the waist to detect sway during quiet stance. An automatic analysis will occur
      which will provide us with immediate feedback on how stable the participant is during
      testing.
