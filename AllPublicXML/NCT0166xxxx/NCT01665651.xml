  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with serious chronic renal insufficiency usually develop secondary osteoporosis or
      bone loss, especially those with chronic dialysis, and the degree of bone loss is corrected
      with decrease of renal function. In traditional Chinese medicine, kidney function is
      considered to dominate bone development and metabolism. Kidney Yin and Yang replenishment
      will help improve bone development and metabolism.

    <textblock>
      In this study patients with chronic renal insufficiency and secondary osteoporosis or bone
      loss will be evaluated with traditional Chinese medicine standard and allocated into kidney
      Yin deficiency and kidney Yang deficiency groups. In Yin deficiency group, patients will be
      divided into Zuogui granules treatment group and placebo group. In Yang deficiency group,
      patients will be divided into Yuogui granules treatment group and placebo group. All the
      patients will also accept basic treatment.

      After 3-month-treatment, we will detect blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, bone mineral
      density, bone metabolism markers including FGF23, 1,25(OH)2D3, Osteocalcin, PTH, BALP, serum
      and urinal Ca, P. We will also perform miRNA array. The data before treatment and after
      treatment will be compared. The data of treatment groups and placebo groups will also be
      compared.

    <description>Function of Kidney Yin and Yang will be evaluated with Traditional Chinese Medicine methods before and after treatment(Kidney Yin/Yang replenishment) to check whether function of Kidney Yin and Yang are improved.
In Traditional Chinese Medicine, function of Kidney Yin and Yang are evaluated according to some specific symptoms and the severity including soreness of the waist and knee, exhausted, tinnitus, hard of hearing, hair loss, white hair, dizziness, dry mouth, red flush in face, night sweating, hot flashes, insomnia, dreaminess, the status of tongue body and coating and so on.</description>
