    <textblock>
      Study the effectiveness of the treatment detachment of retinal pigment epithelium secondary
      to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy. Efficacy will be assessed by regression of polyp area
      after twelve months, compared to baseline. Treatment under study is a triple therapy with: 1)
      reduced-fluence photodynamic therapy (PDT), 2) intravitreal (IVT) triamcinolone and, 3) IVT
      ranibizumab, for the treatment of detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium (PED)
      secondary to Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV).

After 10 days, patients will be subjected to an injection of Intra-vitreous ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05 ml). After this first injection, Intra-vitreous ranibizumab will be repeated twice, on a monthly basis, for a total of three injections</description>
