  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Trastuzumab prolongs survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor type
      2-positive breast cancer. Sequential left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) assessment
      has been mandated to detect myocardial dysfunction because of the risk of heart failure with
      this treatment. Myocardial deformation imaging is a sensitive means of detecting LV
      dysfunction, but this technique has not been evaluated in patients treated with trastuzumab.
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed by
      myocardial strain and strain rate (SR), are able to identify LV dysfunction earlier than
      conventional echocardiographic measures in patients treated with trastuzumab.

      The investigators will prospectively evaluate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed
      by myocardial strain and strain rate (SR) and identify possibility of early detection of LV
      dysfunction in patients treated with trastuzumab.
