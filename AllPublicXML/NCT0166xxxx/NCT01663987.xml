    <measure>Percentage of Patients With COPD Exacerbation From the Two Twin Trials, Present 205.477 (NCT01663987) and 205.478 (NCT01662986)</measure>
    <time_frame>from first drug administration to the last timepoint with information of clinical adverse outcome available, up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients with COPD exacerbation on study was analysed for the combined study.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD with duration of three days or more, requiring a change in treatment where a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms was defined as at least two of the following: 1) Shortness of breath; 2) Sputum production (volume); 3)Occurrence of purulent sputum; 4) Cough; 5) Wheezing; 6) Chest tightness. Onset of exacerbation was defined by the onset of first recorded symptom.The end of exacerbation was decided by the investigator based on clinical judgment.
A required change in treatment included either prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids; and a newly prescribed maintenance respiratory medication (i.e. bronchodilators including theophyllines and PDE4-inhibitors).
This endpoint was analysed using combined data, as specified in the analysis plan.</description>

    <description>Percentage of patients with 30-day hospital readmission rates outcome events was analysed.
Days to hospital readmission were calculated as:Hospital readmission days = Readmission date - Date of hospital discharge + 1.
The 30-day hospital readmission analysis summarized the frequency of patients with hospital readmission and readmission days &gt;1 and &lt;31 days using the TS.

    <description>Time to event: Time to recovery (EXACT-PRO) was not analysed, only Kaplan meier curve was plotted. EXACT-PRO total scores were transformed to smooth scores for determining time to recovery and all other endpoints related to the EXACT questionnaire. The day-2 score was transformed to the mean of the total scores recorded on Day 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, each subsequent day's score was transformed to the mean score using a rolling 3-day average.

        <description>Percentage of patients with COPD exacerbation on study was analysed for the combined study.
A COPD exacerbation was defined as a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms (increase or new onset) related to the underlying COPD with duration of three days or more, requiring a change in treatment where a complex of lower respiratory events/symptoms was defined as at least two of the following: 1) Shortness of breath; 2) Sputum production (volume); 3)Occurrence of purulent sputum; 4) Cough; 5) Wheezing; 6) Chest tightness. Onset of exacerbation was defined by the onset of first recorded symptom.The end of exacerbation was decided by the investigator based on clinical judgment.
A required change in treatment included either prescription of antibiotics and/or systemic steroids; and a newly prescribed maintenance respiratory medication (i.e. bronchodilators including theophyllines and PDE4-inhibitors).
This endpoint was analysed using combined data, as specified in the analysis plan.</description>
