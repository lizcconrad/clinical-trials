  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess whether LCZ696 when used in combination with amlodipine will provide
      greater BP lowering benefit compared to amlodipine alone in Asian hypertensive patients not
      adequately responsive to amlodipine therapy.

    <measure>Change in Mean 24-hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) Systolic Blood Pressure (maSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in mean 24 hour ambulatory systolic blood pressure (maSBP) from baseline to end of the study (week 8) in the 2 groups was measured. A greater reduction from baseline in the LCZ696 group indicates a positive treatment effect.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in mean 24 hour maDBP from baseline to end of the study was measured. A reduction from baseline indicates a positive treatment effect.</description>

    <measure>Change in Mean Sitting Systolic Blood Pressure (msSBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the patient's msSBP from baseline to end of the study was measured. A reduction from baseline indicates a positive treatment effect.</description>

    <measure>Change in Sitting Pulse Pressure (PP)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the patient's mean sitting PP from baseline to end of the study was measured. Pulse pressure measures the difference in mean sitting systolic blood pressure and mean sitting diastolic blood pressure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure Control (&lt; 140/90 mmHg)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants achieving a systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg was measured. This outcome measure shows how well a given blood pressure treatment can achieve a given blood pressure target or goal. Participants who achieved the target blood pressure were determined based on the mean SBP and DBP measurements taken at the end of the study. If the participants' BP measurement was below the above target, they were considered to have successful blood pressure control.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Successful Response in msSBP (&lt; 140 mmHg or a Reduction ≥ 20 mmHg From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who achieved successful treatment response in the msSBP of &lt; 140mmHg or a reduction ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline after completing study treatment was measured. Participants who achieved either of the above targets were deemed as a having a successful response.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants Achieving Successful Response in msDBP (&lt; 90 mmHg or a Reduction ≥ 10 mmHg From Baseline)</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants who achieved successful treatment response in msDBP of &lt; 90mmHg or a reduction ≥ 10mmHg from baseline after completing study treatment was measured. Participants who achieved either of the above targets were deemed as having a successful response.</description>

        <description>The number of participants achieving a systolic and diastolic blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg was measured. This outcome measure shows how well a given blood pressure treatment can achieve a given blood pressure target or goal. Participants who achieved the target blood pressure were determined based on the mean SBP and DBP measurements taken at the end of the study. If the participants' BP measurement was below the above target, they were considered to have successful blood pressure control.</description>
