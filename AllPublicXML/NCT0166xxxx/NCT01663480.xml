  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of mechanical ventilation is to sufficiently unload the respiratory
      muscles and maintain adequate ventilation in spontaneously breathing patients. When the
      mechanical ventilatory assist is synchronized to the patient's inspiratory effort, both the
      patient and the mechanical ventilator will contribute to the lung-distending pressure,
      necessary to overcome inspiratory load and generate the tidal volume (Vt). Unfortunately,
      conventional modes of mechanical ventilation cannot quantify the impact of the ventilatory
      assist performed by the ventilator and the patient. Inadequate levels of assist are
      associated with adverse effects such as development of fatigue or patient-ventilator
      dissynchrony and diaphragm impairment, and over assist also lead to diaphragm atrophy and
      weaning delay.

      The newly introduced neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) has made it possible to
      measure the neural activity of the respiratory centers (expressed by the diaphragm electrical
      activity, EAdi). EAdi is a validated variable to quantify the neural respiratory drive,
      little is known about its usefulness to evaluate the contribution of the patient's
      inspiratory muscle effort relative to that of the mechanical ventilator, which would be of
      crucial importance to appropriately titrate the level of assist.

      During NAVA, the patient's efficiency to transform neural effort (EAdi) into Vt, expressed as
      neuroventilatory efficiency (NVE), may be a useful predictor for determining the contribution
      of the patient and the ventilator to generate a breath.
