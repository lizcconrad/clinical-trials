    <textblock>
      Eradication of helicobacter pylori is important for treatment of GU but ideal regimen is not
      available.

      HP is resistant to metronidazole and clarithromycin, thus clarithromycin is expensive and it
      is not available in underdevelopment countries.

      There are different articles about replacement clarithromycin with azithromycin as a method
      of eradication of HP that is decreases length of therapy and increases, effectiveness of
      drugs and decreases resistance of drugs.

      The Aim of this study is comparison between two regimens containing clarithromycinand
      azithromycin.

    <description>Azithromycin (Zithromax, Azithrocin ) is an azalide, a subclass of macrolide antibiotics. Azithromycin is one of the world's best-selling antibiotics. It is derived from erythromycin, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen atom incorporated into the lactone ring, thus making the lactone ring 15-membered.</description>

    <description>Clarithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic used to treat pharyngitis, tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pneumonia (especially atypical pneumonias associated with Chlamydophila pneumoniae), skin and skin structure infections. In addition, it is sometimes used to treat legionellosis, Helicobacter pylori, and lyme disease.</description>
