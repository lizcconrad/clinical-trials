    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current trial is to evaluate the bioavailability of a single oral dose of
      naproxen sodium 440 mg and DPH HCL 50 mg under fasting and fed conditions and currently
      marketed single ingredient products containing naproxen sodium (2 x AleveÂ® 220 mg tablets) or
      DPH HCL (2 Allergy Relief x 25 mg tablets) under fasting conditions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Health, ambulatory male and female subjects between 18 to 55 years of age inclusive

             birth control for at least 1 month prior to screening (3 months on oral
             contraceptives), e.g., oral or patch contraceptives, intrauterine device,
             Depo-Provera, or a double barrier and have a negative pregnancy test at Screening and
             Day 0 for each Dosing Period. Female subjects of non childbearing potential must be
             amenorrheic for at least 2 years or had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of hypersensitivity to aspirin (ASA), naproxen sodium, NSAIDs, acetaminophen,
             DPH HCL, and similar pharmacological agents or components of the products

          -  History of hypersensitivity to any of the food products in the standardized breakfast
             or cannot consume all food/beverage items contained in the standardized breakfast

          -  Have taken ASA, ASA-containing products, acetaminophen or any other NSAID (OTC or
             prescription) 7 days prior to dosing or during the Dosing Periods, other than trial
             treatment

          -  Use of any over-the-counter or prescription medications (except acceptable forms of
             birth control) within 10 days prior to dosing or throughout the trial, unless in the
             opinion of the Investigator, the medication will not interfere with the trial
             procedures, data integrity, or compromise the safety of the subject

          -  Recently had (past 30 days) or plan to have surgery, an invasive procedure, tattoos or
             piercings during the trial or 1-2 weeks after treatment

          -  Loss of blood in excess of 500 ml within 56 days of the first dose of trial treatment
             (e.g., donation, plasmapheresis or injury)

          -  History of gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, related to previous NSAID therapy
             or active or history of recurrent peptic ulcer/hemorrhage (two or more distinct
             episodes of proven ulceration or bleeding)

          -  Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic diseases
             or malignancies

          -  Smokers or currently consuming any type of tobacco product(s) including any smoking
