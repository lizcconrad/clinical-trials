    <textblock>
      This is an observational registry study aiming to collect data on efficacy and safety of the
      single chamber Biotronik DX system with enhanced atrial diagnostics. The minimal follow-up
      period is 24 months. All analyses on the data will be done post-hoc; the study does not
      intend to confirm any pre-specified hypotheses.

      Enrollment (E0)

      Timing:

      • The enrollment (date of patient written informed consent) starts after implantation of a
      BIOTRONIK Lumax 540 VR-T DX ICD with Linoxsmart S DX or successor single chamber DX system
