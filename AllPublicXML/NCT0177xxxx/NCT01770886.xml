        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male and female subjects between 18 and 65 years of age (inclusive).

          -  Female subject with negative pregnancy test.

          -  Male subjects willing to use an effective method of contraception, if applicable
             (unless anatomically sterile or where abstaining from sexual intercourse is in line
             with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject) from Day 1 until 3 months
             afterwards.

          -  Subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 18-30 kg/m2. Body Mass Index = Body weight
             (kg) / [Height (m)]2.

          -  Subject with no clinically significant abnormal serum biochemistry, haematology and
             urine examination values or results suggesting an infectious or other systemic
             disorder. The parameters to be measured will include those shown in Appendix 2. The
             Simbec normal ranges are shown in Appendix 3.

          -  Subject with a negative urinary drugs of abuse screen (Appendix 2) (N.B. a positive
             alcohol result may be repeated at the discretion of the Investigator).

          -  Subject with negative HIV and Hepatitis B and C results.

          -  Subject with no clinically significant abnormalities in 12-lead electrocardiogram
             (ECG).

          -  no clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs.

          -  willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.

          -  satisfy a medical examiner about fitness to participate in the study.

          -  provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          -  Smokers are eligible to participate in the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Relevant abnormality in medical history or on examination, including history of
             dementia, or other psychiatric, neurological, immunological, respiratory or
             cardiovascular disorder. Particularly exclude subjects with signs of peripheral
             neuropathy. Abnormal laboratory findings suggesting the presence of a systematic
             disorder.

          -  Participation in a clinical study of an unlicensed drug in the previous 4 months, or a
             marketed drug study within the previous 3 months. (N.B. washout period between trials
             defined as the period of time elapsed between the last dose of the previous study and
             the first dose of the next study).

          -  Known allergies, including allergy to chemicals like and excipients associated with
             UE2343.

          -  Recent or clinically significant history of drug or alcohol abuse.

          -  Blood donation greater than 500 ml in the previous 3 months.

          -  Inability to communicate well with the Investigator (i.e., language problem, poor
             mental development or impaired cerebral function).

          -  Receipt of regular prescribed medication within 7 days of the first study day and / or
             receipt of vitamins, minerals, herbal remedies and nutritional supplements within 7
             days of the first study day. Subjects taking long lasting drugs more than 7 days
             before the study may be excluded at the physician's discretion. Inclusion of subjects
             who have taken over the counter drugs during this period will be reviewed on a
             case-by-case basis in relation to the safety aspects and objectives of this study.
