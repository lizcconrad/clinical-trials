    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the orthodontic retainer on
      transverse maxillary dental and skeletal stability after SARME.

      Methods: Ninety digitized dental casts of 30 adult patients (18 males and 12 females)
      submitted to SARME using the Hyrax expansion appliance were evaluated. Patients were
      distributed into two groups: Group Without Retention (GSC) n = 15; and Group With Retention
      (GCC) n = 15. In the GCC group, a Transpalatal Arch (TPA) was installed for retention soon
      after removal of the expander. The dental casts were scanned using a Vivid 9i 3D laser
      scanner (Konica Minolta, Wayne, NJ). The plaster models were performed preoperatively (T1), 4
      months after the expander was removed (T2), and 10 months after the end of the expansion
      (T3). The distances measured were Inter-Cusps of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cusp PM)
      (Inter-Cusp M), Inter-Cervicals of Premolars and Molars (Inter-Cervical PM) (Inter-Cervical
      M), Inter-WALA edges of Premolars and Molars (PM Inter-BW) (BW Inter-M), palatal height at
      the molar, and palatal area and volume at T1, T2, and T3.

    <description>Surgical technique is performed with subtotal LeFort I osteotomy with separation of the pterygomaxillary fissure.The procedure was performed under general anesthesia using endotracheal intubation. Following the osteotomies, the expander screw was activated to 1.6 mm intraoperatively until a small diastema was observed between the upper central incisors. The incision was sutured along two planes.</description>

    <description>Laser Scanner Vivid 9i was used to digitize the study models. The 3d virtual dental casts is a reliable copy of the original dental casts. On this virtual casts all measurements (linear, area and volume of the palate) was done to evaluate the stability after SARME.</description>
