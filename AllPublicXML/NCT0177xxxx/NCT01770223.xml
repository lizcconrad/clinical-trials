      This study is being done to find out if participants with insulin resistance and hepatitis C
      virus genotype 1 (HCV GT1) infections who failed dual therapy with peginterferon alfa
      (PegIFN) + ribavirin (RBV) will benefit from the addition of boceprevir to PegIFN + RBV
      (triple therapy).

    <description>All participants will start treatment with 4 weeks of PegIFN-2b subcutaneously, 1.5Î¼g/kg per week + RBV capsules orally, at a weight-based dose between 800-1400 mg/day divided into two daily doses (double therapy). Participants without cirrhosis will then continue on the PegIFN-2b and RBV with the addition of boceprevir capsules orally, 800 mg three times per day for 32 weeks (triple therapy), and will transition back to double therapy for the final 12 weeks of treatment (48 total weeks of therapy). Participants with cirrhosis or documented as null responders will receive triple therapy for 44 weeks (48 total weeks of therapy).</description>
