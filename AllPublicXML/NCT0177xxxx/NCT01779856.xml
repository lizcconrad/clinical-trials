      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the proportion of hemodialysis patients
      experiencing clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias over a 6-month period using
      continuous cardiac monitoring with an implanted Medtronic Reveal Insertable Cardiac Monitor
      (ICM) device.

    <time_frame>6 months of dialysis data following Reveal ICM implant</time_frame>
    <description>Events defined as clinically significant for the objective include: episodes of ventricular tachycardia (VT) greater than or equal to 130 beats per minute (BPM), episodes of bradycardia indicated by a recorded heart rate less than or equal to 40 BPM, instances of asystole lasting at least three seconds, or any symptomatic event, indicated by patient use of the Reveal ICM Patient Assistant, where review of the stored ECG shows an arrhythmia considered clinically significant in the judgement of the study site cardiologist.</description>
