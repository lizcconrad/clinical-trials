  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is thought that vaccines trigger innate inflammatory responses to induce antigenspecific
      adaptive immunity (the desired effect), but excessive inflammation may lead to serious
      inflammatory complications or unwanted side effects. Currently there is a lack of reliable
      biomarkers (a measurable biological response that predicts something) able to predict severe
      inflammation and this has resulted in the development of several vaccines being terminated
      and the withdrawal of some licensed vaccines which were associated with inflammatory
      complications.

      This study is part of the BIOVACSAFE project which is a 5year €30M project funded by the
      Innovative Medicine Initiative. The project involves a series of clinical studies using
      licensed vaccines as benchmarks to generate clinical data on inflammation and identify
      biomarkers that can be used to predict acceptable reactogenicity. The target is to identify
      biomarkers that can predict the occurrence of beneficial and detrimental effects in response
      to a vaccine. Such biomarkers could be used in future vaccine development programs to
      optimize selection of vaccine candidates with a profile that will be unlikely to generate
      worrisome safety signals once they are in generalized use.

      This study is one in a series of &quot;training&quot; studies which will each use different licensed
      vaccines that are prototypical representatives of a class of vaccine used in a particular
      target population. Twenty four subjects will be randomised into two groups to receive: A)
      Engerix B vaccine (n = 20), B) Saline placebo (n = 4). Following a screening visit,
      participants will undergo two immunisations at month 0 and month 6. Each immunisation will
      occur during a seven day residential visit which will include immunization and intensive
      monitoring of physiological (e.g. heart rate, oral temperature, blood pressure) metabolic and
      immune (innate and adaptive) parameters. Both residential visits will be followed up by four
      outpatient visits with further monitoring and blood samples.

          1. Healthy male or female subjects aged 18-45 years inclusive.

          2. The subject is, in the opinion of the investigator, healthy on the basis of medical
             history, vital signs, &amp; the results of routine laboratory tests with no active disease
             process that could interfere with the study endpoints.
