  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the proportion of subjects who have sufficient
      improvement in ventricular function after undergoing a standardized Left Ventricular Assist
      Device (LVAD) plus pharmacologic recovery treatment and testing protocol to allow removal of
      the LVAD within 18 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The encouraging results from the LVAD based recovery series suggest that the significant
      hemodynamic unloading provided by the Mechanical Circulatory Support (MCS) in conjunction
      with aggressive pharmacological treatment may induce a profound reverse structural remodeling
      and in turn result in a curative alternative to a specific patient population with severe
      heart failure. The active identification and characterization of the patients with a high
      potential for full cardiac function recovery is of paramount importance. The development of a
      standard and simplified recovery protocol would ultimately lead to a larger bridge to
      recovery patient population. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      proportion of subjects who have sufficient improvement in ventricular function (remission
      from heart failure) after undergoing a standardized LVAD plus pharmacologic recovery
      treatment and testing protocol to allow removal of the LVAD within 18 months. The secondary
      objectives of this study are twofold, first to determine the durability of sustained
      remission from HF following LVAD explantation at 12 months and up to 3 years and second to
      determine the predictors of recovery.

    <description>The HM II pump contains a single moving component, the rotor. The pump is implanted just below the left hemidiaphragm with the inflow attached to the apex of the left ventricle and the outflow graft anastomosed to the ascending aorta. Blood is pumped continuously throughout the cardiac cycle from the left ventricle to the aorta.
The pharmacological treatment intended to enhance reverse remodeling includes 4 drugs initiated immediately after weaning of inotropic support once achieving adequate end-organ recovery and titrated (against symptoms, potassium, and renal function) to the following maximum doses: lisinopril 40 mg daily; carvedilol 25 mg 3 times daily; spironolactone 25 mg daily; digoxin 125g daily, and losartan 150 mg daily.</description>
