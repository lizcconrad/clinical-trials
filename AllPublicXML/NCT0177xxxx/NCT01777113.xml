    <textblock>
      Stroke is a global health-care problem that is common, serious and disabling. In most
      countries, stroke is second or third most common cause of death and one of the main causes of
      acquired adult disability. After stroke, patients remain at continued high risk for recurrent
      stroke as well as for myocardial infarction and cardiac death. After completion of
      conventional physical therapy, there are no empiric recommendations and few resources
      promoting regular exercise during the chronic stroke period.Interventions to improve
      cardiorespiratory fitness are still not part of routine neurorehabilitation programs in many
      rehabilitation centers, and therapy is often dominated by standard rehabilitative therapies
      based on neurodevelopmental principles such as the Bobath concept. These standard therapies
      are an insufficient stimulus to increase fitness levels after stroke.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a major cause of chronic disability worldwide. After stroke, patients remain at
      continued high risk for recurrent stroke as well as for myocardial infarction and cardiac
      death. Comorbid cardiovascular conditions are present in 75% of stroke patients, representing
      the leading cause of death in stroke survivors. Due to the low levels of physical activity,
      stroke survivors are deconditioned, leading to a loss of functional and social independence
      with subsequent declines in quality of life. Interventions to improve cardiorespiratory
      fitness are still not part of routine neurorehabilitation programs in many rehabilitation
      centers, and therapy is often dominated by standard rehabilitative therapies based on
      neurodevelopmental principles such as the Bobath concept. These standard therapies are an
      insufficient stimulus to increase fitness levels after stroke.

      The first aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of a high intensitive physical training
      in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and gait ability in chronic stroke patients. The
      second aim is to compare the effects of high aerobic interval treadmill training and maximal
      strength training in chronic stroke patients.

      Patients will be randomized into three groups. The first group (experimental group) will be
      subjected to 3-month training period (3 sessions/week) of high intensity aerobic training on
      treadmill. The second group (experimental group group) will undergo to a strength training
      with the same duration and frequency of the first group. The third group (control group)will
      be subjected to conventional training with the same duration and frequency of the
      experimental groups. Data will be analysed by means parametric and non-parametric tests.
      Both, within and between groups comparison will be performed.

      As primary outcomes measures will be considered the peak oxygen uptake, walking energy cost,
      6 minutes walking test. As secondary outcomes measures will be considered the 10-meter
      Walking Test,Time Up and Go test, Activities- specific balance confidence scale, SF-36 Health
      Survey Questionnaire, Stroke Impact Scale, Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (OUES),
      arterial-venous oxygen difference; cardiac output and muscle strength.

    <time_frame>Baseline time 0, after 12 weeks of training, after 6 months 6 and 9 months after the end of training</time_frame>
    <description>NEAR INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (NIRS), an 8-channel continuous wave NIRS to monitor LMO2 and blood volume (LMBV) during maximal incremental exercise will be used during the incremental treadmill test. Muscle oxygenation will be determinate by subtracting the absorbencies at 730 and 850 nm, which will give the relative change in the oxy/de-oxy hemoglobin/myoglobin. Furthermore, the sum of absorbencies at these 2 wavelengths will give the change in local blood volume that is attributed to change in total hemoglobin. The NIRS probe will be placed over the vastus lateralis of the both legs, approximately 120 to 140 mm above the knee, along the vertical axis of the thigh. The NIRS signal will be collected at rest and during exercise at a sampling frequency of 3 Hertz, and the data will be averaged over 30 seconds.</description>

    <description>provides an estimation of the efficiency of ventilation with respect to VO2, with greater slopes indicating greater ventilatory efficiency. When VO2 in mL/min is plotted on the y axis and VE in L/min is plotted on the &quot;semilog&quot; transformed x axis, the slope of this linear relationship, &quot;a&quot; represents the rate of increase in VO2 in response to VE and is defined as OUES, whereas &quot;b&quot; is the intercept.</description>

    <measure>Peak of Oxygen Consumption (VO2peak)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline time 0, after 12 weeks of training, after 6 months 6 and 9 months after the end of training</time_frame>
    <description>a Quark gas analysis system will be used to measure the percentage of expire oxygen. The system will be calibrated before each session according to the manufacturer's instructions. Heart rate will be measured using a Polar Heart-rate monitor. The test will be initiated asking the subject to stand at rest for a period of one minute. At the end of this period the test starts and the subject will walk at its self- selected (obtained by 6MWT) at the inclination of 1%. After three minutes the treadmill inclination will be increased by 1% every minute until exhaustion.</description>

    <description>the test will be initiated asking the subjects to sit at rest for a period of two minutes. At the end of this period the test commenced. Subject will walk on the treadmill performing three 4-minute steps. The speed of each step will be determinate by the self-selected speed of the subject (obtained through 6MWT). The steps will be 70% of the self- selected speed, 100% and 130%. Throughout the test, ventilatory parameters and heart rate will be collected breath-by-breath using a Quark gas analysis system. The walking energy cost will be calculated according to the formula (O2cost= [VO2/kg walking - VO2/kg rest]/speed).</description>

    <description>The mode of the training will be uphill treadmill walking in 4x4 minute intervals at 85% and 95% of Heart Rate Peak (HRpeak) precede by 10-minute warm-up period on the treadmill at self-selected speed and inclination. Between the 4-minute intervals, 3-minute active breaks walking at approximately 50% of HRpeak will be applied. The training sessions will be terminated by a 3-minute cool-down period at 50% to 70% HRpeak. To compensate for increased VO2peak, the speed and/or inclination will be gradually adjusted during 3-month intervention to make sure that the target HR will be between 85% and 95% of HRpeak during the high-intensity intervals.</description>

    <description>Five warm-up repetitions will be completed at approximately 50% of 1 repetition maximum before the main session of four sets of four repetitions unilaterally at 85%Y95% of 1 repetition maximum for both leg press and plantarflexion. When subjects will be able to complete a fifth repetition, the weight will be increased by 1.25 to 2.5 kg, dependent on subjective feelings of capability. They will be encouraged to focus of an explosive concentric movement and a controlled eccentric movement such that the time on each phase will be in the ratio 1:2. The subjects will be regularly reminded to focus on breathing during the contraction, preventing the valsalva maneuver and high rises in blood pressure. The session will finish with a minimum 5-min warm down the treadmill device.</description>

    <description>Conventional training consisted of group mobility, balance and stretching exercises. Mobility training included treadmill and cycloergometer training for 10 minutes at self selected speed. Exercises at the parallel bars included weight shift from leg to leg, half-squat, turn in place, leg-trunk flexion, and extension exercises. Finally seated upper- and lower-limb stretching exercises will focus on range of motion, including trunk mobility.</description>
