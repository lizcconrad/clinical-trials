    <measure>Percentage of Participants Satisfied With Treatment of Glabellar Lines Assessed Using the Facial Line Satisfaction Questionnaire (FLSQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 60</time_frame>
    <description>Participants assessed their overall satisfaction with their glabellar (frown) lines using the FLSQ 5-point scale where: -2=Very dissatisfied, -1=Mostly dissatisfied, 0=Neither dissatisfied nor satisfied, 1=Mostly satisfied and 2=Very satisfied.
