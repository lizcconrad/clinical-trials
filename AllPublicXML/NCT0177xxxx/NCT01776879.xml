  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine speech intelligibility of early parkinson's disease (PD) patients,
      early PD patients and first degree relatives. The investigators hypothesis that advanced PD
      patients will present decreased speech intelligibility more than early PD patients. Speech
      intelligibility of first degree relatives will be normal.

      in order to achieve the study's goals objective and subjective research tools will be used.

      Objective tools include measuring phonation time, diadokokinetic movements of the oral
      structures and acoustic analysis .

      Subjective tools include self reported questionnaires.
