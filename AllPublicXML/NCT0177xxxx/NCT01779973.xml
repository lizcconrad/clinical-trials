      The goal of this project is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy
      of using remote compliance monitoring in buprenorphine (Suboxone®) treatment for opiate
      dependence. To that end, 10 opiate dependent subjects will be recruited through the
      University of Pennsylvania's Treatment Research Center, an outpatient substance abuse
      treatment facility. All subjects will receive buprenorphine (Suboxone®) (16 mg/day, adjusted
      as needed according to individual requirements).
