  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of treatment
      intended to reduce pain catastrophizing among patients reporting high pain catastrophizing
      prior to total knee replacement(TKR), total hip replacement(THR), or shoulder surgery in an
      effort to thereby reduce the incidence of persistent post-surgical pain (PPP) and enhance
      physical function at 3-months post-surgery. Preemptive treatment aimed at a known predictor
      of PPP following total knee replacement is highly innovative and have potentially high impact
      for public health. Cognitive therapy is a well-tolerated modality among chronic pain patients
      with few if any side effects. Cognitive therapy (CT) represents an inexpensive method that
      could greatly reduce suffering and costly post-surgical pain management for high risk TKR
      patients.

      Aim 1 is to determine which CT protocol is most effective in reducing Pain Catastrophizing
      Scale (PCS) and Coping Strategies Questionnaire Catastrophizing Subscale (CSQ-CAT) scores in
      high-risk TKR candidates. CT will consist of four-to-eight weekly 1-hr individual cognitive
      therapy sessions prior to surgery.
