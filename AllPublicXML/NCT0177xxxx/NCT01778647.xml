  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple forms of Omega-3 Fatty acids have been used to investigate the role of this food
      supplement in children with ADHD. No clear evidence for their role in this disorder is yet
      available.

      We will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to obtain
      significant results regarding this question.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 30-150 patients or more between the ages of 6 and 15 years old with diagnosis of
      ADHD according to the DSM-IV and on current treatment with stimulants recruited from CAOS-MMC
      and the Developmental Center will be evaluated by a child psychiatrist or a resident under
      supervision of a child psychiatrist to make sure that the diagnosis is correct. Every child
      will have a Conner's rating scale filled out by the parents and teachers on admission to the
      study. The evaluators will also fill out a Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI).

      The patients will be divided in 2 groups. One group of 15 children will be randomized to
      continue taking the usual dose of stimulants plus placebo(corn oil), which will be given to
      the patients by MMC's pharmacy.

      A second group of 15 patients will be randomized to receive the usual dose of stimulant plus
      Lovaza (prescription Omega-3 fatty acids) at a Dose of 1800 mg daily.

      Both groups will be initially treated for a period of 8 weeks. The patients will be
      re-evaluated by the investigators on week 2, 4, 6 and 8 of the study and on each evaluation
      the parents and teachers will fill out a Conner's rating scale.

      The ratings of the Conner's rating scales filled for each patient will be analyzed and
      compared to the initial evaluation after week 8. The evaluators will also do a CGI score for
      every visit.

      Patients that improve will be taken off the stimulants and will continue further treatment
      with the adjunctive therapy for a total of 4 more weeks, during this period of time they will
      be re-evaluated on weeks 9, 10 and 12 and Conner's Scales will also be filled out by the
      parents.

      Patients who do not improve will be switched to the opposite treatment modality and will be
      evaluated on weeks 9, 10 and 12 also having Conner's scales filled out by their parents. If
      any of the patients in this group improve (after the switch) they will be taken off
      stimulants and they will be evaluated on weeks 13, 14 and 16 of the study arm.

      The study will be supported by GSK. This pharmaceutical company will provide the capsules and
      the placebo.
