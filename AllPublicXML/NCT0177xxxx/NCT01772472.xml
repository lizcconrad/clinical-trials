      This 2-arm, randomized, open-label study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab
      emtansine versus trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer
      who have residual tumor present in the breast or axillary lymph nodes following preoperative
      therapy. Eligible patients will be randomized to receive either trastuzumab emtansine 3.6
      mg/kg or trastuzumab 6 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 14 cycles. Radiotherapy and/or
      hormone therapy will be given in addition if indicated.
