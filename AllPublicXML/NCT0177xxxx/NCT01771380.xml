  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the circulation 25-hydroxyvitaminD (25(OH)D) is bound to the vitamin D binding protein
      (DBP) and albumin. According to the free hormone hypothesis, it is, however, the free
      fraction that is biologically active. Polymorphisms in DBP are related to the serum level of
      25(OH)D. As these polymorphisms may also affect the binding affinities for 25(OH)D, the total
      serum 25(OH)D may not necessary reflect the free fraction. To test this hypothesis, we will
      calculate the free fraction of 25(OH)D by correction for DBP and albumin content, and also
      measure free 25(OH)D from equilibrium dialysis and ultra filtration. Furthermore, we will
      relate total serum 25(OH)D as well as the free and biologically active (free- albumin-bound)
      25(OH)D to the well established vitamin D effect marker serum parathyroid hormone as well as
      to the RNA expression in peripheral blood to evaluate the biological importance of the free
      versus the total fraction of 25(OH)D. We will invite 300 subjects from an ongoing vitamin D
      supplementation study to participate in the study which will be one visit only and include
      collection of blood samples.
