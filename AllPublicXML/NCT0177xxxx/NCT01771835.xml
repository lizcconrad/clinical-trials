      Measurement of the circulation in patients with diabetes mellitus and establish a link
      between retinal venous pressure (RVP) and endothelin (ET-1)levels.

      Diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy are the main causes of visual loss. Hyperglycemia as the
      main risk factor of diabetic retinopathy induced damage to retinal capillaries. These in turn
      lead to hypoxia in the tissue and promote the release of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
      factor) , which in turn increases the vascular pathology. Simultaneously, there is an
      increased expression of endothelin (ET-1). Endothelin increases vascular tone and regulates
      the micro-and macro-vascular remodeling.

      In ocular blood flow perfusion pressure plays an important role. While in healthy eyes a
      spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is frequently observed, this is significantly less
      frequent in diseased eyes. An increased venous pressure lowers the ocular perfusion pressure,
      and increases the transmural pressure. A measurement of the retinal venous pressure and the
      hormone ET-1 in the blood will give us a better knowledge of the circulatory changes and
      their relationship to diabetes.
