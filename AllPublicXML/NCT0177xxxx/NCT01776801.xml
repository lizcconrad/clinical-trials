  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to determine during moderate rise of intracranial pressure
      (ICP) in awake patient, the change in autonomic function and its influence on cerebral and
      systemic haemodynamics.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      From preliminary data, we know that changes in ICP influences both systemic and cerebral
      haemodynamics, introducing the concept of intracranial baroreflex We have to i) confirm the
      presence of this intracranial baroreflex, ii) analyze the changes in autonomic function
      during moderate rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) in human, and iii) correlate the changes
      in cerebral and systemic haemodynamics with autonomic function.

    <description>Patients suffering of hydrocephalus (cognitive impairment, gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and enlargement of the ventricles) require for clinical purpose infusion studies i.e. injection of mock cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the sub arachnoid space to artificially increase ICP. We aim at using infusion studies as a indirect tool to assess whether a moderate increase in ICP has any influence on haemodynamics.</description>

    <intervention_name>Infusion</intervention_name>
    <description>Infusion studies are performed in daily clinical routine to measure cerebrospinal fluid resistance outflow. During this test ICP is slowly and securely raised. Investigators plan to analyze what are the consequences of this ICP rise in terms of autonomic system and hemodynamics.</description>
