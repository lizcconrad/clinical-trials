  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tissue expansion methods have been recommended as a means of improving the clinical results
      with perforator flaps but in plastic surgery literature there are few clinical trials
      supporting this opinion. The purposes of this clinical study are to address the ''preexpanded
      perforator flap concept'' by demonstrating a case series of relevant reconstructive
      procedures and to evaluate the perforator vessel changes that happen during the expansion
      periods of various perforator flap donor sites.

    <time_frame>Measured the day before the expander implantation surgery and the day before the flap transfer surgery (second session following tissue expansion)</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement will reveal one of the morphologic changes happen during tissue expansion period (perforator flap preexpansion). This measurement will be done for the last six patients. The diameter of the perforator artery of the preexpanded flap will be compared with both the diameter of the same artery before the expansion process and the diameter of the equivalent perforator artery of the symmetric side (non expanded side)of the body.</description>

    <description>Fourteen patients were treated with fifteen '' preexpanded perforator flap surgery '' interventions. The last six cases were evaluated in terms of perforator artery diameter before and after expansion process. The preexpanded flap donor sites' perforator artery diameters were also compared with their anatomic equivalents located in the symmetric side of the body.</description>
