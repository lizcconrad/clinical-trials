  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Short and long term outcomes of total knee arthroplasty patients surgically exposed with
      patellar eversion are compared to those patients exposed by laterally retracting the patella.
      It was hypothesized that there would be no difference.

      Background:

      Patellar mobilization during total knee arthroplasty (TKA) has been debated, with some
      proponents of minimally invasive TKA suggesting that laterally retracting, rather than
      everting the patella may be beneficial. It was our hypothesis that by using randomized,
      prospective, blinded study methods, there would be no significant difference in clinical
      outcome measures based solely on eversion of the patella during total knee arthroplasty.

      Methods:

      After an a priori power analysis was done, 120 primary total knee replacements indicated for
      degenerative joint disease were included in the study and randomized to one of two patella
      exposure techniques: lateral retraction or eversion. Collaborating investigators and patients
      were blinded to randomization.

    <description>Patients randomized to the eversion group had patellas everted during the flexion portions of the surgery. Patients randomized to the retraction group had patellas everted only for the patellar resurfacing portions of the surgery. Both groups were mobilized with anterior tibial translation. All other aspects of surgery including postoperative care, anticoagulation, pain control, and physical therapy were done as per standard arthroplasty protocols at our institution.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients eligible for study participation included all comers for primary total knee
             arthroplasty indicated for degenerative joint disease. All operations were performed
             by three well-established arthroplasty-fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons using
             surgical techniques based on that of a senior surgeon. All implanted devices were
             cruciate-substituting tricompartmental total knee replacements placed through a medial
             parapatellar approach. All patients were anaesthetized with spinal anesthesia,
             received a peri-operative cocktail injection, and had tourniquet times between 0 and
             120 minutes. Multi-modal post-operative pain management and accelerated physical
             therapy were performed as previously described.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients were excluded from the study if on the operative side they had undergone
             prior total knee replacement, prior knee arthrotomy, prior osteotomy at or about the
             knee, or had preoperative angular deformity greater than 20 degrees.
