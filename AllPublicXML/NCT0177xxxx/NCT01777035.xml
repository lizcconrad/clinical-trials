      To study all ICU patients with an independent baseline functional status , who experience a
      critical illness requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation evaluating long-term
      cognitive and executive function and long term cost effectiveness in survivors who required
      mechanical ventilation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immediate mobilization of mechanically ventilated (MV) ICU patients is not part of usual care
      in the U.S. or internationally. Our previous work supports that early mobilization through
      physical and occupational therapy for ICU patients on the ventilator can help them experience
      less delirium, spend less time in the ICU and hospital, and become more independent when they
      leave. To advance our knowledge in this area, large longitudinal studies are needed to
      understand the long-term physical, cognitive and mental health status of survivors and to
      test how specific ICU therapies may affect these outcomes.
