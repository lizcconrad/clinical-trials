    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a Vero cell-derived trivalent seasonal influenza
      vaccine produced by the modified manufacturing process:

        1. induces immune responses comparable to that produced by the current manufacturing
           process

        2. has an acceptable safety profile compared to a licensed trivalent seasonal influenza
           vaccine

        3. demonstrates consistency of immune response among three different lots.
