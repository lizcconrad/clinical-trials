  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to compare two different methods of closing skin wounds using sutures.
      One of these methods (the set-back technique) was recently described in 2010 and has been
      reported to be technically easier and reduces the chance of spitting sutures (deep sutures
      that are pushed to the surface of the skin as the wound heals). The other method (the
      vertical mattress technique) has been used for many years with good results. However, no
      controlled studies have been performed to clearly demonstrate a difference between the two
      methods. We hope to find differences in the height of the wound edges immediately after
      surgery(5 minutes following the procedure) as well as the appearance of the scar and symptoms
      associated with the scar 3 months after surgery.
