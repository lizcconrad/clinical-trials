  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The difference between active treatment and placebo in a clinical trial of an analgesic
      appears to depend on a variety of factors other than the actual efficacy of the drug itself,
      including various aspects of study design and conduct. One potential such factor is how
      information about the study is presented to research staff and patients. The purpose of this
      study is to examine the impact of different presentations of information on the difference
      between pregabalin and placebo observed in a clinical trial in patients with painful diabetic
      neuropathy.

          -  Is on stable diabetic medication that is not expected to change during the study;

          -  Has a worst pain intensity over the past 24 hours as a 4 or higher on a 0-10 numerical

          -  Participated in another clinical trial within the past month;
