  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease, or AERD, consists of aspirin sensitivity, asthma and
      nasal polyps. It is currently managed by chronic steroid use, multiple endoscopic sinus
      surgeries and/or aspirin desensitization. However, these treatments have potential adverse
      effects.

      A theory has been postulated that decreasing the level of dietary salicylates may help in
      long-term control of disease. A current trial is in the works to evaluate the clinical
      outcomes of decreased salicylate, but measurements of biochemical markers of disease has not
      yet been done. The hypothesis is that decreased dietary salicylates will result in a decrease
      in urinary salicylates and inflammatory markers of disease, cys-leukotrienes, which are
      typically elevated in this disease.
