      This multicenter, prospective, open-label, outpatient study will assess the safety and
      efficacy of HO/03/03 10µg applied topically once daily for up to 24 weeks in up to 100
      subjects with Hard to Heal documented chronic wounds of various etiologies (pressure ulcers,
      diabetic ulcers, post operational wounds surgical incisions ulcers of rheumatoid arthritis
      and trauma wounds) of at least 4 weeks documentation.

      All subjects with a wound size of up to 56.25 cm2 (inclusive) will be administered 1 vial of
      10 ml HO/03/03 10μg per administration. For each increase in wound size of up to 56.25 cm2 an
      additional vial of HO/03/03 10 μg will be added up to a maximal wound size area of 225 cm2
      (will be measured by HealOr central reviewer) utilizing 40µg (4 vials) per administration. 15
      min post treatment wounds will be dressed according to standard of care.
