  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that using Koning Breast CT during the neoadjuvant treatment
      of breast cancer will allow for accurate tumor localization and tumor volume measurement,
      leading to improved surgical and radiation therapy outcomes.

    <description>Tumor volume will be measured with KBCT imaging at the beginning of the therapy (baseline), mid-point of the therapy (about 3 months after the treatment starts) and end of therapy (about 4-6 months after the treatment starts). The volume change from the baseline during the treatment will be recorded.
Adverse Events will be recorded as a measure of safety.</description>

        Twelve female patients at least 18 years of age undergoing neoadjuvant therapy for locally
        advanced breast cancer with either chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will be recruited for
        this study. Inclusion of those patients 18 years or older is important since as it is the
        younger patients who present with breast cancer that often end up receiving neoadjuvant
        treatment.
