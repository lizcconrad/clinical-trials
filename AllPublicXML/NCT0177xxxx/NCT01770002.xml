    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that everting wound edges while suturing surgical sites will
      result in more aesthetic scars. Additionally, we also hypothesize that small to moderate
      wound irregularities present at 3 months will resolve by 6 months after surgery with no
      intervention
