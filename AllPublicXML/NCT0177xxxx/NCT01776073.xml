  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of introducing a patient navigator to
      guide high and moderate risk patients through the pre-waitlisting phases of the kidney
      transplant process. Patients identified as being at high and moderate risk of delay to
      waitlisting will be linked with a patient navigator, who will facilitate their completion of
      pre-waitlisting requirements. We believe that patients who are randomized to a patient
      navigator will be more likely to complete the pre-waitlisting process and will complete the
      process more quickly than high and moderate risk patients who do not receive additional
      assistance from a patient navigator.

      The investigators plan to implement a newly developed risk assessment tool that uses medical
      and demographic indicators to estimate the probability of waitlisting for all patients
      beginning the transplant process at the Emory Transplant Center. Medical secretaries will
      collect information about patients' medical and demographic characteristics during the
      appointment scheduling phone call. This information will be entered into the REDCap risk
      assessment tool, which will be used to calculate the probability of waitlisting. A previously
      defined cut-off will be used to categorize the risk of delay to waitlisting.

      A random subset of patients identified as being at high and moderate risk of delay to
      waitlisting will be connected with a patient navigator, who will be available not only to
      answer questions, but also to manage clinical information prior to, during, and following
      transplantation. The navigator will work to identify potential barriers and to ensure that
      the most up-to-date clinical information has garnered responses at the nurse and physician
      levels.

      The effect of connecting high and moderate risk patients with a patient navigator on time to
      waitlisting and rate of waitlisting will be analyzed to determine whether such a program is
      an effective means of increasing access to transplant for patients who are likely to face
      financial, racial, and demographic barriers.
