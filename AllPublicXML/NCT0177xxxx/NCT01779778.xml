  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the diurnal and nocturnal effects of
      Travoprost with SofZia (Travatan Z) on intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that Travatan Z will significantly lower intraocular pressure
      and increase ocular perfusion pressure during both the diurnal and nocturnal period, during a
      24-hour evaluation, compared to baseline. The investigators further hypothesize that the
      medication effects will persist at 72 hours after discontinuation of the drug.
