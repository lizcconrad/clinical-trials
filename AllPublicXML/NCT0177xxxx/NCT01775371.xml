  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Inadequate pain management is common in the Emergency Department (ED). Optimal
      treatment of pain necessitates titration to effective dose due to the large inter-individual
      variability in opioid requirement. However nurse administered titration is difficult to
      provide in this setting due to high patient to nurse and physician ratios and multiple urgent
      competing patient demands. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) lets ED patients actively
      participate in pain management by allowing self-titration to their desired level of pain
      relief. A tightly controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) funded by NINR recently
      completed by the investigators group provides promising preliminary support for the efficacy
      and safety of PCA for patients with abdominal pain at a single ED with a dedicated research
      nurse and standard loading dose given to all patients. Objective: The overall objective is to
      provide optimal pain management in the ED. Specific aims: 1)To compare the effectiveness and
      safety of PCA and non-PCA opioid analgesia when nurses involved in clinical care deliver the
      intervention to a broad group of ED patients with acute pain at multiple clinical centers.
      The primary hypothesis is that there will be a greater decline in pain over time and similar
      safety in patients randomized to receive PCA compared to patients receiving standard opioid
      analgesia. 2) To describe the feasibility of PCA in terms of patient and provider acceptance,
      resource utilization and cost associated with PCA. Innovation: PCA represents a novel shift
      from the current provider-driven model of ED pain management to one in which the patient is
      an active participant. Few prior studies have evaluated ED PCA and no systematic evaluation
      of time and resources exists. Methodology: An RCT will be performed at 3 clinical centers.
      750 patients with acute pain warranting IV opioid administration will be randomized to
      receive usual opioid analgesia determined by the provider or PCA (loading dose 0.1 mg/kg
      morphine and demand dose of 1 mg morphine available every 6 minutes). Pain intensity will be
      measured by a numerical rating scale recorded every half hour up to 2 hours after initial
      opioid administration. Primary endpoints are rate of change in pain intensity from 30 minutes
      after initial administration of opioid to 2 hours as suggested by the results of the
      preliminary study and incidence of adverse events. PCA will also be compared to non-PCA
      opioid analgesia assessed at the end of the 2 hour study period by patient satisfaction with
      pain management; RN assessment of time efficiency/ease of use and satisfaction with pain
      management; and physician satisfaction with pain management. Resource utilization and cost
      associated with implementation and use of PCA in the ED setting will be assessed by total RN
      time spent on pain management per patient; pharmacy preparation time per patient; material
      cost per patient and RN and MD training time necessary for PCA implementation. Significance:
      If PCA is demonstrated to be effective, safe, and associated with patient and provider
      acceptance and acceptable resource utilization, it has the potential to significantly improve
      ED pain management.
