  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will test the hypothesis that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
      (TENS) may attenuate peripheral vasoconstriction and to improve blood flow redistribution
      during handgrip exercise in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients after Coronary
      Arterial Bypass Graft Surgery (CABG).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty-eight patients will be randomized to a (4 times/day; 30 min/session) for 5-day program
      of TENS (n = 20) or to placebo-TENS (P-TENS, n = 18) applied on cervical region (C7-T4).
      Acute sympathetic stimulation by cold pressor test (CPT), Maximal voluntary contraction
      (MVC), Femoral blood flow (FBF) and femoral vascular conductance (FVC) will be measured as
      primary outcome pre and post-CABG, even as the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), Inspiratory and
      expiratory muscle strength (PImax and PEmax) and β-endorphin as a secondary clinical
      parameters. In addition, amount of opioid analgesic and pain intensity also will be measured
      throughout at first 24 hours after CABG (immediately, 6, 12 and 24 hours).

    <measure>Blood flow redistribution - baseline and 5 days later</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>The ultrasound Doppler system will be equipped with two linear array transducers operating at an imaging frequency of 7- 8 megahertz (MHz). The common femoral artery of the left leg will be insonated distal to the inguinal ligament, 2-3 cm proximal to the bifurcation. Using femoral artery diameter and mean blood velocity (MBF), femoral blood flow (FBF) was calculated as MBF π x (vessel diameter/2)2 x 60. Femoral vascular resistance (FVR) and femoral vascular conductance (FVC) were calculated as (MBP/FBF) and (FBF/MBP * 100 mm Hg), the conductance multiplied by 100 mmHg so that the conductance units will be similar to the units of femoral blood flow (10, 45). The magnitude of reduction FVC (expressed in %) was calculated as vascular conductance during exercise (% change) - conductance at rest (% change) expressed by % of baseline.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Inspiratory and Expiratory Muscle Function</measure>
    <time_frame>5 day</time_frame>
    <description>Inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength testing were performed using a pressure transducer (MVD-500 V.1.1 Micro Hard System, Global Med, Porto Alegre, Brazil). Maximal inspiratory (PImax), and maximal static expiratory pressure (PEmax) were measured as previously described.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>5 day</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analog scale (VAS) for assessing current pain intensity will be used to evaluate pain from 0 to 10, where 0 means no pain and 10 indicates severe pain, being applied on the first and on the 5th day after CABG .</description>

    <measure>Opioid Analgesic Amount</measure>
    <time_frame>5 day</time_frame>
    <description>During the first 24 h (immediately, 6, 12 and 24 h) after CABG, the amount of additional analgesic dose (pethidine hydrochloride (HCl) 20 mg, maximum 1 mg/kg/day) was measured for patients in both groups.</description>

    <measure>β-Endorphin Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>5 day</time_frame>
    <description>Ten milliliters of venous blood will be taken by the phlebotomist. 3 ml of which will be stored in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for analysis of a differential white cell count. Seven ml of blood will be divided between an EDTA tube and a lithium heparin (LH) gel tube. These blood samples will be centrifuged and frozen until assayed. β-endorphin was measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc., USA).</description>

    <description>Eligible patients will be randomized to a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation program (TENS; n = 20) or to placebo-TENS (P-TENS; n = 18). All patients were followed by their own physicians, received routine nursing assistance, and were visited daily by one of the investigators, but P-TENS group will be not exposed to any specific electrical stimulation or motor physical intervention.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with placebo-TENS (P-TENS) condition for 5 days (4 times/day; 30 min/session) applied on cervical region (C7-T4). P-TENS device underwent modifications in its internal programming: the control capacitor of the time constant was changed and the active time between pulses was modified from 330 milliseconds to 33 seconds, in order to prevent an analgesic effect (33).</description>
