      The purpose of this study is to determine how safe a knee injection called Synvisc-One® is in
      patients with a condition called chondromalacia patella and how well in works in treating the
      condition.

      Chondromalacia patella is a common cause of kneecap pain or front knee pain. Often called
      &quot;Runner's Knee,&quot; this condition often affects young, otherwise healthy individuals.

      Chondromalacia is due to irritation of the undersurface of the kneecap. The undersurface of
      the kneecap, or patella, is covered with a layer of smooth cartilage. This cartilage normally
      glides effortlessly across the knee during bending of the joint. In some individuals, the
      cartilage on the undersurface of the knee cap becomes irritated and soft, resulting in pain.
      Potential treatments for this condition include rest, injections (numbing or
      anti-inflammatory medications to reduce swelling and pain), and/or guided strengthening
      exercises which may help reduce pain.

      Other Treatments are being evaluated. This study is about Synvisc-One® an experimental device
      that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of pain in
      osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in patients who have failed to respond to treatments that do
      not involve drugs or surgery and simple pain medication such as acetaminophen. Synvisc-One®
      is a gel-like substance that, when injected into a joint, acts to lubricate and cushion the
      joint. Synvisc-One® is made from hyaluronan, which is a molecule that is found normally in
      joint fluid.

      Synvisc-One® has not been proven to be safe or helpful in patients with chondromalacia
      patella (cartilage irritation or softening of the undersurface of the 'knee cap'). So far,
      this drug/device has been given to over 10,000 people who have knee pain (due to
      osteoarthritis) and has been proven safe and effective in patients with moderate to severe
      pain due to knee joint osteoarthritis.

      pain due to knee joint osteoarthritis.

      If you agree to participate you will either receive the Synvisc-One® injection or a placebo
      injection that contains no active study drug. You will not be able to take any medication for
      your pain other than Acetominophen (like Tylenol) for the duration of this study.

      You are being asked to be in this study, because you have knee pain.

      All of the tests and procedures in this study are being done solely for research purposes.

      Up to 100 people will be in this study at UVA.

      How long will this study take?

      Your participation in this study will require 4 study visits over 6 months. Each visit will
      last about 1 hour.

      What will happen if you are in the study?

      SCREENING (will take approximately 60 minutes to complete):

      Visit 1-2 (Week 1)

      If you agree to participate, you will sign this consent form before any study related
      procedures take place. Before you can start in the study, there will be a screening period.
      You will have tests and procedures during this time to make sure you are eligible and it is
      safe for you to participate. These include the following:

        -  Review of your medical history

        -  Physical exam of your knee

        -  An x-ray of your knee

        -  Completion of 5 brief questionnaires

        -  Thigh muscle strength test: you will contract your thigh muscle as hard as you can when
           an electrical stimulus will be delivered directly to the muscles at the front of your
           thigh. This stimulus will cause your thigh muscles to twitch quickly. This stimulus may
           cause you some minor discomfort. If it causes you an intolerable amount of discomfort,
           you do not have to continue with this portion of data collection. The stimulus in this
           experiment feels similar to the static electricity shock that is sometimes felt when you
           touch a doorknob or something else metal. The intensity of a static electricity shock
           usually ranges from 2000-4000 volts. The maximum voltage that will be delivered in this
           experiment is 125 volts. You will be enrolled only if you have evidence of muscle
           weakness.

      If these tests show you are eligible, you can proceed immediately with study procedures or
      return to the clinic (within 7 days) to begin study treatment.

      STUDY PROCEDURES/ RANDOMIZATION (each visit will last about 60 minutes):

      You will be randomly assigned (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 study treatment groups. You
      have an equal chance of being assigned to any one of the groups. Neither you nor your doctor
      can choose which treatment you are assigned. Neither you nor your doctor will know which
      study treatment you will get until the study is done. But if your doctor needs to know, the
      people doing this study can find out.

      GROUP 1: Synvisc-One® injection: You will receive a single injection to your knee. We may
      numb your skin with a cold spray prior to the injection to the front of your knee joint.

      GROUP 2: Sham Injection: This is similar to a placebo injection. A placebo is defined as a
      harmless substance that looks like the study device, but which should have no effect. We may
      numb your skin with a cold spray prior to the injection to the front of your knee joint. In
      this case, a needle will be placed in your joint as if you were having an injection but,
      nothing will be injected.

      You will not be able to find out which treatment you got until the study is done. If your
      doctor needs to know, the people doing this study can find out. If you are randomized to this
      group, you will be eligible for an injection of Synvisc-One® during your last study visit (at
      6 months) if it is needed depending on the amount of pain you are experiencing. You will sign
      a separate consent form for this portion of the study.

      You will be prescribed a standardized home-based leg strengthening program including simple
      and low-intensity exercises for your thigh muscles. We will review these exercises with you
      so that you understand how to do them correctly. We will also tell you how long and how often
      you should do these exercises and you will be provided an exercise diary that will provide
      exercise descriptions and reminders. You will be asked to return exercise books at each visit

      During this study, you will be asked to fill out some questionnaires. These questionnaires
      ask about:

        -  how you are feeling

        -  your lifestyle habit and functions

        -  daily activities

        -  medicine use

      These questionnaires will take about 15 minutes to complete.

      FOLLOW UP: Visit 3-5; Weeks 4, 12 and 26)

      You will return for follow up testing and evaluation 1 month, 3 months and 6 months following
      your injection.

      During each follow up visit we will collect the following:

        -  Knee joint examination

        -  Completion of 5 brief questionnaires

        -  Thigh muscle strength test

        -  Questions about your medication usage and problems you may be having with your knee.

        -  Return exercise book What are the risks of being in this study?

      Risks and side effects related to the device (Synvisc-one®) include:

      Less Likely (about 2 of every 100 subjects may experience)

        -  Arthralgia (pain in your knee joint)

        -  Arthritis (degeneration of your knee joint cartilage)

        -  Arthropathy (injury to your knee joint)

        -  Pain at the site of your injection

        -  Swelling inside your knee joint

      Risks and side effects related to the procedures (thigh muscle testing and knee joint
      evaluations) in this study include:

      Less Likely

        -  Thigh Muscle discomfort

        -  Thigh muscle soreness

        -  Knee Pain

      Risks of having radiation of the knee:

      This study involves radiation exposure from an X-ray of your knee. As part of everyday
      living, everyone is exposed to a small amount of background radiation that comes from soil,
      rocks, outer space and within the body itself. The radiation dose you will receive in this
      study is about the amount that you receive over 101 days from background radiation. The risk
      from this dose is small. This radiation exposure is not necessary for your medical care but
      is necessary to obtain the research information desired

      Risks for women:

      If you are pregnant now, or get pregnant during the course of your study participation,
      please tell us. Being in this study might hurt your unborn baby, so you will not be able to
      join or stay in the study. Use an effective method of birth control during this time. If you
      have questions about birth control, please ask the study doctor or your primary care
      physician..

      Other unexpected risks:

      You may have side effects that we do not expect or know to watch for now. You may also
      experience possible unknown chronic effects in the future that may occur many years after
      your injection. Call the study leader if you have any symptoms or problems.

      Will you be paid for being in this study? You will be paid $ 100 for finishing this study by
      a check sent to you in the mail. You should get your payment about 4 weeks after finishing
      the study. The income may be reported to the IRS as income.

      You will not be paid at all if you decide not to finish this study. If the study leader says
      you cannot continue after you have been enrolled, you will be paid the full amount for the
      study.

      If you owe money to any Virginia state agency, the state can use the money you earn in this
      study to pay those debts. These state agencies include the UVa Medical Center, VCU Medical
      Center or a college or university. The money may be withheld to pay back debt for such things
      as unpaid medical bills, taxes, fines, child support. Even if this happens, the money you
      earn may be reported to the IRS as taxable income.

      Will being in this study cost you any money? Participation in this study will not cost you
      any money. The study covers the cost of the physician visits, knee x-ray and injections.

      You or your insurance company must pay for any tests or care given beyond what is required in
      this study. In addition, you and your health plan may also have to pay for other drugs or
      treatments that are given to help you control any side effects. You will have to pay for any
      costs not covered by your health plan.
