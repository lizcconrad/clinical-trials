    <textblock>
      Patients with biochemically confirmed SLOS are being treated with cholesterol supplementation
      and antioxidant medication. They are carefully monitored with visits to clinic, laboratory
      testing including cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol levels, vitamin levels, blood counts
      and liver and kidney function. On an annual basis, the patients undergo a series of tests
      under anesthesia, including electroretinogram (ERG), brainstem audiometry (ABR), and
      ophthalmologic exam under anesthesia to follow pigmentary retinopathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a metabolic
      error in the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to cholesterol deficiency and
      accumulation of the cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol.Patients with SLOS display
      complex medical problems including growth failure, intellectual disability, behavioral
      disorders, progressive retinal dystrophy, hearing loss and photosensitivity. Dr Elias was one
      of the original geneticists who discovered the cause of this disorder in 1994, and ever since
      has been treating SLOS patients with cholesterol supplementation. Since 2008, a second
      medication called AquADEKS, a mixture of vitamins and other compounds with antioxidant
      properties was added to the treatment regimen. The purpose of the AquADEKS is to allow
      treatment with antioxidant medications in an effort to prevent retinal degeneration, hearing
      and skin problems associated with SLOS.

      This protocol has been approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and
      supported by the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) since 2001. Since the last
      Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board annual review, the following updated information
      is available about the protocol:

      1. New research has revealed that oxysterols are toxic compounds made from the cholesterol
      precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol. These oxysterol compounds are severely neurotoxic and
      treatment with antioxidants may help lower their levels, resulting in slowing of retinal
      deterioration. Testing of oxysterol levels in patients with SLOS is now ongoing, in
      collaboration with a laboratory at Vanderbilt University (Dr Ned Porter). It is hoped that
      testing of oxysterol levels in blood may help provide more updated info to help guide
      treatment.
