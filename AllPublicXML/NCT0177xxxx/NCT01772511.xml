      The purpose of this study is to assess patients' understanding of clinical trials and to help
      researchers understand which areas of the informed consent need better explanation for future
      cancer clinical trial patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obtaining informed consent as part of a clinical study is a cornerstone of current day
      medical ethics; however, this has not always been the case. The development of the informed
      consent has been necessitated out of abuses committed in the name of medicine.

      Informed consents have become increasing lengthy and complex. It is not unusual for an
      Oncology Clinical Research informed consent to be greater than 20 pages. Investigators will
      utilize the QuIC-A survey to evaluate patient understanding of the basic elements of informed
      consent required by federal regulations. The QuIC-A survey has been condensed from 20
      questions to 14 questions by eliminating the 6 phase specific questions. The remaining 14
      questions are designed irrespective of phase and address the basic elements of informed
      consent.

      Investigators hypothesize that as informed consents have become more lengthy and complicated,
      in part due to required regulatory language and legal clauses inserted to protect the
      institution performing research, patient comprehension of the basic elements of informed
      consent has been hindered.

    <description>Patients will be asked by a member of the research team if they would like to participate in this study evaluating patients' comprehension of the informed consent for the oncology treatment study that they are participating in. Patients will be consented and will be told that, at their next clinical visit, they will be given the questionnaire to complete. They will be given the option to complete the questionnaire on site after being given the document or have the ability to mail the completed questionnaire into the research office once completed. If the questionnaire is not returned within 2-weeks, the participant will be approached again during their normal clinical visit and asked if they still wish to participate in this study.</description>
