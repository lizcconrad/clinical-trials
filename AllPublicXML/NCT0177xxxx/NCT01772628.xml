  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study was to develop a novel intervention method which could reduce
      the spread of Sexually Transmitted Infections (including HIV) and unwanted pregnancies by
      improving parent-child communication using schools as gateways.

      It was done in 22 public day and mixed secondary schools in both Kampala and Wakiso
      districts. The study employed a cluster randomized controlled trial experimental design.
      Eligible schools were purposively selected and stratified into urban, peri-urban and rural.
      The schools were then matched into pairs for potential confounding variables such as religion
      and gender. In total, 11 schools were randomly allocated to the intervention and an equal
      number of schools to the comparison arms of the study.

      A questionnaire was administered to students at baseline and post-intervention. This
      questionnaire was validated in test re-test on approximately 200 S1 students from 2 schools
      that did not participate in the intervention nor the comparison arm. A parents'/guardians'
      questionnaire was also administered both at baseline then at post intervention. This
      questionnaire was also pre-tested among approximately 200 parents of S1 students who
      participated in the test re-test. The results of the pre-test were used to finalize the
      questionnaire. To increase the extent to which questions were understood, the English
      versions of questionnaires were translated into one of the widely spoken local language
      Luganda.

  <detailed_description>

      Various studies and reviews conducted mainly in developed countries have demonstrated that
      parent-child communication complimented by school based comprehensive sex education programs
      aimed at delay in sexual debut and promotion of safer sex practices work. However, there is
      limited information about such studies in developing countries like Uganda.

      The Randomized Controlled Trial targeted 2 populations; students admitted to S1 in 2012 and
      their parents. Specifically the Randomized Controlled Trial aimed to (i) increase proportion
      of students with intentions to delay sexual debut (ii) increase knowledge and influence
      attitudes of adolescents about condoms (iii) increase the frequency of parent-child
      communication (iv) improve the quality of parent-child communication through structured
      homework.

      The Randomized Controlled Trial comprised 3 components: the classroom-based component; the
      parent component and the homework assignment component. Sexual and reproductive health topics
      were integrated in 8 English and 8 Christian Religious education double lessons lasting 90
      minutes. For each lesson there was a corresponding homework that a student was expected to
      complete with their parent/guardian. Teachers were re-trained in pedagogical skills in
      preparation for implementation of the intervention. At the same time, parents were trained in
      communication skills and assisted to improve their parenting skills in 3 one-day workshops.
      The 11 schools randomized to comparison schools will have delayed intervention. A pre- and
      post-intervention survey was conducted for both students using a standardized questionnaire
      to assess changes in parent-child communication as well as knowledge, attitudes and
      intentions to delay sexual debut. A simultaneous pre-and post intervention survey using a
      standardized questionnaire was also conducted among parents of students participating in the
      intervention to assess change in communication with their children and parenting practices.
      For every component, quantitative and qualitative data was collected to evaluate the
      processes of delivering the evaluation.

      Statistical analysis will be carried out using appropriate statistical software. Frequencies
      and means when appropriate will be calculated for each variable and for summary scale at
      baseline and post-intervention measurements. Inter-item correlation coefficients for each
      scale will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha. T-test for mean differences, kappa statistics
      and McNemar test for non-independent samples will be used to assess changes in knowledge,
      attitudes and intentions between baseline and post-intervention. Content analysis will be
      done for homework.

      The results from this intervention will contribute to Millennium Development Goals 2, 4, 6
      and 6, which aims to combat HIV/AIDS and other diseases, maternal and child deaths and by
      focusing on education and involving school teachers, the study will also contribute towards
      the quality aspects universal primary education.

    <description>To determine whether assignment homework were effective in enhancing parent-child communication. Repeated measures analysis of variance will be done to assess the effects of time (baseline vs. post-intervention) and whether school-based intervention had any impact. The analysis will include all adolescents from the intervention schools irrespective of whether or not they completed the homework with their parents. To determine whether both males and females would equally benefit, gender will be included in the analysis as an independent variable. Finally, since student's demographic and baseline characteristics are likely to influence their likelihood of completing homework, post-hoc comparisons will be made controlling for these factors to determine dose-response relationships.</description>

    <description>This component was to facilitate open parent-child interactions and encourage interpersonal learning in a friendly home environment about selected Sexual Reproductive Health issues. Homework assignments were developed on the basis of the topics covered in the learners' component. Students were asked to discuss each assignment with their parents/guardians and recorded answers in 32 paged exercise books provided by the project which were eventually handed over to the researchers at the end of the intervention. Students were given 8 English homework assignments and 7 Christian Religious Education homework assignments.</description>

    <description>Three one day parenting workshops were conducted in each of the 11 schools for parents/guardians during the period in which the lessons were being implemented. First workshop was conducted at the beginning of the intervention, the second in the middle of the intervention and the third at the end of the intervention. Each workshop in a school was facilitated by one selected teacher and one selected parent in the school. In the first workshop a brochure about the intervention was distributed to all the parents/guardians in attendance.</description>
