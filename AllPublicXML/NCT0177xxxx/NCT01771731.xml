  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is to assess whether inhaling vaporized cannabis ameliorates chronic
      pain in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). As these patients will all be on chronic
      opioid analgesics, the investigators will also assess the possible synergistic affect between
      inhaled cannabis and opioids. The investigators will also assess the clinical safety of the
      concomitant use of cannabinoids and these opioids in patients with SCD by monitoring the
      short-term side effects associated with combined therapy. Finally, the investigators will
      evaluate the short-term effects of inhaled cannabis on markers of inflammation and disease
      progression in patients with SCD.

      Hypotheses are as follows:

        1. Inhaled cannabis will significantly reduce chronic pain in patients with SCD.

        2. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter the short-term side effects experienced by
           patients who take opioids for SCD.

        3. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter markers of inflammation and disease
           progression in patients with SCD compared to placebo.

      This is a proof-of-principle investigation of the safety and potential effectiveness of
      inhaled vaporized cannabis when added to a stable analgesic regimen in sickle cell disease
      (SCD) patients with chronic pain. The study will be comprised of two 5-day intervention
      periods in the inpatient setting (the Clinical Research Center at SFGH), with completion of a
      5-day daily pain diary prior to admission to establish an outpatient baseline. Participants
      will be randomly assigned, in double-blind fashion, to treatment with (A) vaporized cannabis
      with an approximately 1:1 ration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol or (B) vaporized
      placebo. Those who receive treatment A during the first admission will receive treatment B in
      the second, and those who receive treatment B during the first admission will receive
      treatment A in the second. The two admissions will be spaced at least 14 days apart.

      On Day 1 of each admission, subjects will provide blood samples for baseline markers of
      inflammation and SCD disease progression. They will undergo assessments of pain, mood, and
      quality of life. At 12 pm on Day 1, they will inhale vaporized study agent (equivalent to 1
      cannabis/placebo cigarette) using the VolcanoÂ® vaporizer; on Days 2-4 they will inhale study
      agent at 8 am, 2 pm, and 8 pm, and they will inhale their final dose on Day 5 at 8 am.
      Subjects will continue their pre-study analgesic regimen while in the study. If additional
      analgesia is required, supplemental therapy will be administered and the dose recorded. Pain
      measurements by visual analogue scale will be obtained every 2 hours while subjects are
      awake. On Day 5 a second set of blood samples for inflammation markers and disease
      progression will be obtained, and subjects will again complete pain, mood, and quality of
      life assessments.

    <description>Subjects will complete a 5-day pain diary prior to admission to the Clinical Research Center (CRC) to establish a baseline of pain. They will then be assigned to inhale either vaporized cannabis of mixed THC/CBD content (4.7% THC/5.1% CBD) or placebo cannabis (0% THC/0% CBD). Participants and personnel will be blinded as to assignment. Pain will be evaluated during the 5-day inpatient exposure. Participants will be asked to participate in two such 5-day sessions separated by at least a 2-week washout so that each will be exposed to the two experimental conditions.</description>
