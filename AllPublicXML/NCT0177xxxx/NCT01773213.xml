  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial including patients with a neurogenic lower
      urinary tract dysfunction undergoing urodynamic investigation at the Spinal Cord Injury
      Center, Balgrist University Hospital, Zürich, we aim to investigate whether the detrusor
      contraction during the ice-water-test is provoked by the ice water or the rapid filling.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ice-water-test (IWT) was first described 1957 by Bors and Blinn and it was thought to
      differentiate between lesions of the upper and lower motoneuron. In cat studies, it was shown
      that the IWT is a C-fiber mediated lower motoneuron segmental reflex and that these
      unmyelinated C fibers are associated with cold receptors. This explains the positive IWT in
      patients with upper motoneuron lesions. In healthy humans, the IWT is positive up to the age
      of 4 years and becomes negative thereafter since the reflex is centrally inhibited. However,
      this reflex might be unmasked by a neurological disease and/or injury.

      Considering that C-fibers are involved in the pathogenesis of detrusor overactivity, the IWT
      seems to be a useful diagnostic tool in daily practice. However, although there are many
      studies published on the IWT, it is unclear whether the detrusor contraction during the IWT
      is provoked by the ice water or whether it might be caused by the rapid filling. Therefore,
      we designed this randomized, double-blind trial.
