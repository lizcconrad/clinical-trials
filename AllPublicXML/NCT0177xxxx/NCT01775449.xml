  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Use lay language. Oxaliplatin is a reference anticancer drug in the treatment of colorectal
      cancer. However, its use is hampered by a specific neurotoxicity, which is characterized by
      acute thermal hypersensitivity, notably to cold temperatures, and by chronic neuropathy
      appearing with the repetition of chemotherapy cycles.

      To this date there is no effective therapy able to prevent and/or to treat these adverse drug
      reactions. So oncologists are sometimes strained to decrease anticancer doses or to stop
      chemotherapy; Previously, a polyamine deficient diet has been able to prevent acute
      oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity in animals.

      So we hypothesizes that a specific nutritional therapy, a polyamine deprived diet, may
      prevent acute oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity in patients.

      This is a prospective, single-center, controlled and interventional study with two parallel
      groups randomized in single-blind.

      After obtaining informed consent, all included patients will be randomized, either:

        -  in the group with a polyamines depleted diet : 2-4 cans per day of Polydol® (oral
           alimentation without polyamines), associated to predefined menus low in polyamines,
           according to the chemotherapy cycle and for 107 days

        -  in the control group with a normal polyamines containing diet: 1 can per day of Polydol®
           associated with predefined menus with normal average in polyamines and for 107 days.

      Randomization will be performed by considering stratification on the tumor presence or not,
      because it is one of the polyamines source (Linsalata and Russo, 2008) and could influence
      the results in the study.

      In addition, patient compliance will be collected in the case report form all along the
      study, and included in the statistical analysis of the study.
