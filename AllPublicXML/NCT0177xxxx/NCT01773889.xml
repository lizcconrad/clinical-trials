  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that adding pegylated IFN (IFN)a-2b to denileukin
      diftitox improves the potential of denileukin diftitox alone to deplete regulatory T cells
      (Tregs) and will thereby boost tumor immunity in patients with advanced-stage epithelial
      ovarian cancers, enhancing treatment efficacy.

      The aims of this study are to:

        -  Assess the efficacy of adding pegylated IFN-α2b to denileukin diftitox to treat selected
           advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancers

        -  Test the immune-modulating effects of adding pegylated IFN-α2b to denileukin diftitox in
           ovarian cancer patients and relate them to clinical efficacy

        -  Identify any toxicity associated with pegylated IFN-α2b plus denileukin diftitox
           treatment in these patients

        -  Identify practical means to dose the immunomodulating agents denileukin diftitox and
           pegylated IFN-α2b based on immunopharmacodynamic metrics

Failure to respond criteria are not based on RECIST criteria, which have unclear application to immune-based clinical trials. Instead, novel lack-of-failure criteria, rather than failure-of-success criteria have been written to avoid stopping therapy prematurely without compromising patient safety, to accommodate the uncertainties of assessing failure in this setting. The criteria as written are based on sound medical, scientific and ethical principles. The trial is further designed to help establish the utility of these novel criteria.</description>

        <description>Per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors Criteria (RECIST v1.0) for target lesions and assessed by MRI: Complete Response (CR), Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR), &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Response = CR + PR.
Failure to respond criteria are not based on RECIST criteria, which have unclear application to immune-based clinical trials. Instead, novel lack-of-failure criteria, rather than failure-of-success criteria have been written to avoid stopping therapy prematurely without compromising patient safety, to accommodate the uncertainties of assessing failure in this setting. The criteria as written are based on sound medical, scientific and ethical principles. The trial is further designed to help establish the utility of these novel criteria.</description>
