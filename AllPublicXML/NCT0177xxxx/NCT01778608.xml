  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is often administered to relieve anxiety and discomfort during uncomfortable
      procedures in elderly patients. Patient control of sedation offers many potential benefits
      for patients and healthcare professionals, including improved safety and patient
      satisfaction. The investigators overall goal is to develop a patient controlled intravenous
      sedation system that is effective but very safe for the patient, and requires minimal
      supervision by a doctor or nurse. To fulfill these criteria, a sedation system should
      incorporate fail-safe safety mechanisms. A key safety-critical component is a method of
      objectively assessing the degree of sedation of the patient, and of preventing him from
      self-administering unsafe doses of the sedative drug. The investigators have designed a new
      sedation system that uses a measure of the speed of response of the patient to a defined
      non-noxious stimulus to determine whether or not it is safe to allow him to self-administer
      further levels of sedation. Before being able to execute a volunteer study in order to
      determine a rational selection of optimal threshold response time, a feasibility test on the
      handset device is required.
