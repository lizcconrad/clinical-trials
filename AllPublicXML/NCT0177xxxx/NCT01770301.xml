  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bevacizumab (called also Avastin ®) is a medicine preventing the creation of new blood
      vessels (a process called &quot;angiogenesis&quot;). This can reduce blood flow of the tumor and then
      decreasing the contribution of nutriments and oxygen to the cancer cells and prevent the
      tumor from growing.

      In various types of cancers, as lung, breast, colorectal and renal cancer, addition of the
      bevacizumab to chemotherapy allowed to improve the disease outcome. The bevacizumab already
      benefits from a marketing authorization (MMA) for these various types of cancers.

      The bevacizumab has also obtained MMA for the treatment of the ovarian cancer in its most
      frequent histological form (ovarian carcinoma). Clinical trials conducted in this indication
      demonstrated the importance to pursue the treatment by bevacizumab after the chemotherapy is
      ended.

      This anti-angiogenic medicine is thought to be of a potential interest in sex cords- stromal
      since this tumors are very well vascularized.

      The ALIENOR study aims to explore the interest and the clinical benefit of associating
      bevacizumab to the paclitaxel in order to treat patients suffering from recurring sex cords-
      stromal tumor treated beforehand by platinum chemotherapy
