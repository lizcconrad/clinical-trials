    <textblock>
      Clinical study of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with advanced refractory solid
      tumors. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting
      toxicity (ies) of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with advanced refractory solid
      tumors.

      An open label multicentre Phase 1 study of oral IGF-1R inhibitor PL225B in subjects with
      advanced refractory solid tumors. This is a dose-finding trial using the modified Accelerated
      Titration Design with 3 new subjects per cohort and 100% dose increments in the accelerated
      phase followed by standard phase with 40% dose increments.Subjects will receive study drug on
      a daily basis for twenty-one (21) days according to the dose and schedule specified for a
      particular cohort of therapy. Toxicity profile of the drug will be assessed during Cycle 1 of
      subject treatment in each cohort for determination of Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) according
      to the schedule given below.
