  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  Transcleral cyclophotocoagulation (TSCPC) has long been used as refractory glaucoma
           management and is very easy to learn and easy to perform.

        -  Recent advances in laser technology; the role of TSCPC is being expanded because it has
           benefits of noninvasive glaucoma procedure.

        -  The titration (pops), the fixed high-energy, and the fixed-low energy (slow-coagulation)
           are three energy delivery techniques.

        -  The present study would report on the outcome (efficacy and safety) of the
           slow-coagulation versus the titration method in treatment of refractory glaucoma with
           dark iris.

        -  The results would provide reliable evidences to supplement clinical judgment when making
           a decision in favor of each treatment method for glaucoma patients.

  <detailed_description>

      -  Several protocols afford delivery of the &quot;optimum&quot; dose of laser energy per session
           necessary to achieve a long-term effective ocular hypotensive response balancing risks
           related to a high energy treatment and risks related to retreatment due to suboptimum
           dose delivery.

        -  There are two main approaches to delivering laser energy, the pops-titration method and
           the fixed energy method that are the fixed-high and low-energy (the Gaasterland's
           slow-coagulation technique).

        -  Of particular interest is which laser energy delivery method (slow-coagulation versus
           pops-titration) affords the optimal dose of photocoagulation necessary to achieve an
           effective long-term intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction while minimizing the risk of
           adverse events related to overtreatment and retreatments especially in refractory
           glaucomatous eyes with dark iris color.
