    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, multiple doses, open-label Phase 1 study of MORAb-004 in subjects with
      solid tumors. Subjects may have any solid tumor without intracranial involvement or
      metastases that has failed standard chemotherapy.

      This study will be conducted in 2 parts: 1) Part 1 will be the dose escalation portion of
      this study to assess the tolerability and the safety profile of MORAb-004. Dose will escalate
      in different cohorts as follows: 2, 4, 8 and 12 mg/kg weekly dosing each as a 4-week cycle
      with no intra-subject escalation. Individual participants may have additional cycles at the
      same dose until disease progression unless the participants meet the discontinuation
      criteria.

      2) Part 2 will comprise cohort expansions to further characterize the safety and tolerability
      of MORAb-004 and to assess preliminary efficacy and the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      relationship of MORAb-004 in gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Three dose
      levels will be expanded based on the safety profile that was obtained in the dose escalation
      portion of this study (Part 1): 4 mg/kg (administered on a weekly basis), 8 mg/kg
      (administered on a weekly basis) and 12 mg/kg (administered every OTHER week).

    <description>MORAb-004 5 mg/mL is administered as an intravenous infusion (IV) in an escalating dose design and will not be escalated or de-escalated in individual participants.
Part 1 (Dose escalation): 4 weekly administrations of 2, 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg in four different cohorts on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-week cycle (28 days).
Part 2 (Cohort expansion): 4 and 8 mg/kg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a 4-week cycle (28 days) and 12 mg/kg biweekly administration on Days 1 and 15 of a 4-week cycle in different cohorts. The dosages in Part 2 can be amended considering the results of Part 1.</description>
