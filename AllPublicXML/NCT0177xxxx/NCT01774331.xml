  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary:

      • Demonstrate the utility of a new electronic data capture (EDC) system (CareExchange™) using
      infusion nurse measured physical, quality of life (QOL), respiratory, and disability
      assessments.

      Secondary:

        -  Change in Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) dose effects measured outcomes.

        -  Change in IVIg dose and timing effects measured outcomes.

        -  Change in patient status is reflected in measured outcomes.

        -  Assess the value to physicians from infusion nurse collected outcomes data.

        -  Identify types of patients by response to IVIg therapy (i.e. natural or poor
           responders).

        -  Change in response rate to IVIg therapy by disease state and demographics.

      This is a prospective, observational evaluation of immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy in consenting
      adult and assenting pediatric subjects who receive infusion services from AxelaCare Health
      Solutions, LLC. Subjects meeting all inclusion criteria who have provided informed
      consent/assent for trial participation will have validated, physician-prescribed, and
      standard-of-care outcome measures recorded during normal home infusion visits. Collected data
      will be de-identified and aggregated into cohorts of like diagnosis for trend analysis.
