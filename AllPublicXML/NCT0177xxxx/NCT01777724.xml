  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will use a randomised controlled trial design to evaluate the effects of a combined
      intervention of Triple P-Positive Parenting Program Discussion Groups and Stress Control in
      comparison to a waitlist condition. The combined intervention will be evaluated with parents
      in Glasgow, United Kingdom, with a 3-8 year old child.

    NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde services.
