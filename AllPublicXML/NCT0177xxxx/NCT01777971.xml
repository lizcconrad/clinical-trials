  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity of the abdomen. It is a
      frequent complication of cirrhosis that is associated with significant morbidity and poor
      quality of life. Large-volume ascites has been associated with impaired pulmonary function.
      In a previous study, the presence and severity of ascites were determined to be significant
      determinants of fatigue.

      In this study, we will determine whether large-volume ascites contributes to fatigue by
      assessing the response to drainage of ascites by means of a procedure called large-volume
      paracentesis. We hypothesize that treatment of ascites with a single large-volume
      paracentesis leads to decreased fatigue and improved quality of life and that this
      improvement is associated with improved sleep pattern.

      20 patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites requiring regular drainage of ascites
      fluid by large-volume paracenteses will be recruited for the study. All patients will undergo
      a complete clinical and physical examination for liver function, including blood tests.
      Hepatic encephalopathy, a change in mental status associated with liver dysfunction, will be
      assessed by obtaining historical data and by means of simple bedside neuropsychological
      examinations.

      Study visits will take place on two consecutive days, with each visit lasting approximately
      2-3 hours. Immediately prior to a large-volume paracentesis, patients will complete
      standardized questionnaires for fatigue severity, quality of life, quality of sleep, and a
      physical assessment of fatigue by means of a 6-minute walk test. Repeat evaluations will be
      performed 1 day after the procedure. Statistical analysis will then be performed to determine
      the effect of the paracentesis on the various clinical assessments.

      The study design is a prospective observational analysis. Subjects who have been deemed
      candidates for a large-volume paracentesis, based on clinical criteria and who meet the
      above-referenced inclusion and exclusion criteria will be recruited to participate in this
      study. Study visits will take place on 2 consecutive days. Each study visit will last
      approximately 2 to 3 hours. The first assessment day will occur immediately prior to an
      electively-scheduled large-volume paracentesis. The second assessment will occur one day
      later.

      Once enrolled, all subjects will undergo a baseline assessment of liver function. Medical
      records will be reviewed to determine etiology of cirrhosis, history of variceal bleeding,
      history of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, history of hospitalization for hepatic
      encephalopathy, and use of and clinical response to treatment with lactulose, neomycin,
      and/or rifaximin. Body mass index and grade of ascites (grade 1, mild ascites; grade 2,
      moderate ascites; grade 3, massive or tense ascites) will be determined based on physical
      examination. History or presence of asterixis will be recorded. Severity of hepatic
      encephalopathy will be graded according to the West-Haven criteria and further assessed by
      neuropsychological testing (discussed in further detail below). Baseline serum laboratory
      analyses will be obtained, including the following: aspartate aminotransferase, alanine
      aminotransferase, total bilirubin, albumin, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, prothrombin time
      and international normalized ratio, and platelet count. Based on these serum studies, the
      Child-Pugh score and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score will be calculated.

      After baseline assessments are obtained, the six-minute walk test and a series of
      questionnaires (discussed in further detail below) to assess fatigue, sleep, and quality of
      life will be performed on study day 1, immediately prior to the paracentesis, and then
      repeated one day after the paracentesis. Note that neither the six-minute walk test nor the
      neuropsychological testing or questionnaires are considered standard of care for patients
      requiring large-volume paracentesis and these will be performed exclusively for research
      purposes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects with cirrhosis (based on clinical, laboratory, radiologic evaluation, and liver
        biopsy, when available) with diuretic-resistant refractory ascites, based on International
        Ascites Club criteria.[2,31] Specific criteria used for inclusion will be subjects with
        ascites that cannot be stabilized despite intensive diuretic therapy (e.g., 400 mg of
        spironolactone with 160 mg of furosemide per day) and dietary sodium restriction (90 mmol
        of sodium per day) with reappearance of grade 2 or 3 ascites within 4 weeks of mobilization
        (defined as decrease of ascites at least to grade 1). All subjects must provide separate
        written consent to undergo a large-volume paracentesis.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will not be eligible for the study if they: (1) have been hospitalized in the
        previous 1 month for gastrointestinal bleeding, infection, or renal failure; (2) are unable
        to independently ambulate or have had unstable angina or myocardial infarction within the
        previous 1 month, as these are contraindications to participating in the 6-minute walk
        test; (3) are unable to participate in neuropsychological tests or questionnaires; (4) are
        receiving interferon therapy; (5) have a history of alcohol abuse within the previous 6
        months; (6) have a diagnosis of a primary neurologic disorder or uncontrolled psychiatric
        disorder; or (7) are receiving psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines and
        anti-epileptic drugs.
