    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm, long-term extension study will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in participants with moderate to severe
      rheumatoid arthritis who have completed the 97-week WA22762 or the 96-week NA25220 core
      study. Participants will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 milligram (mg) subcutaneously weekly
      (for participants entering from WA22762) or every two weeks (for participants entering from
      NA25220) for 96 weeks, with telephone call follow-up visits at Weeks 100 and 104.

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. The index included swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), acute phase response (ESR or high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) and general health status (GH). For this study, ESR was used to calculate DAS28 score. The index was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √[TJC 28]) + (0.28 × √[SJC 28]) + (0.7 × ln[ESR]) + (0.014 × GH). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. Change in DAS28ESR=DAS28-ESR at Week 48 - DAS28-ESR at Baseline.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) at Week 48</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>The SDAI was the numerical sum of five outcome parameter: SJC and TJC, Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGA) and Investigator Global Assessment of Disease Activity (IGA), and level of hsCRP. The index was calculated using the following formula SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGA + IGA + CRP. Change in SDAI = SDAI at Week 48 - SDAI at Baseline. SDAI total score = 0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates clinical remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 = high (or severe) disease activity. Here, n signifies the number of subjects evaluable at the specified time points.</description>

    <measure>Patient Global Visual Analog Score (VAS) at Specified Time Points</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment represents the patient's overall assessment of their current disease activity on a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. The extreme left end of the line should be described as &quot;no disease activity&quot; (symptom free and no arthritis symptoms) and the extreme right end as &quot;maximum disease activity&quot; (maximum arthritis disease activity). Scores ranged from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more disease activity. A negative change score indicated less disease activity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 48, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>This assessment represents the patient's assessment of his/her current level of pain on a 100 mm horizontal VAS. The extreme left end of the line should be described as &quot;no pain&quot; and the extreme right end as &quot;unbearable pain&quot;. Scores ranged from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more pain. A negative change score indicated less pain.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score 28 - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (DAS28-ESR) at Week 48</title>
        <description>The DAS28 is a combined index for measuring disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis. The index included swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), acute phase response (ESR or high sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) and general health status (GH). For this study, ESR was used to calculate DAS28 score. The index was calculated using the following formula: DAS28 = (0.56 × √[TJC 28]) + (0.28 × √[SJC 28]) + (0.7 × ln[ESR]) + (0.014 × GH). The DAS28 scale ranges from 0 to 10, where higher scores represent higher disease activity. Change in DAS28ESR=DAS28-ESR at Week 48 - DAS28-ESR at Baseline.</description>

          <description>The SDAI was the numerical sum of five outcome parameter: SJC and TJC, PGA and IGA, and level of hsCRP. The index was calculated using the following formula SDAI = TJC28 + SJC28 + PGA + IGA + CRP. Change in SDAI = SDAI at Week 96 - SDAI at Baseline. SDAI total score = 0-86. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates clinical remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 = low disease activity, &gt;11 to 26 = moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 = high (or severe) disease activity.</description>
          <population>Per-protocol population included all participants who had at least one dose of study medication and at least one safety evaluation after dose administration. Number of participants analyzed represent number of participants who were evaluable for the outcome measure.</population>

        <description>This assessment represents the patient’s overall assessment of their current disease activity on a 100 millimeter (mm) horizontal VAS. The extreme left end of the line should be described as “no disease activity” (symptom free and no arthritis symptoms) and the extreme right end as “maximum disease activity” (maximum arthritis disease activity). Scores ranged from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating more disease activity. A negative change score indicated less disease activity.</description>
