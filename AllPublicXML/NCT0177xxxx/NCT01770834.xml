  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with moderate to severe active rheumatoid
      arthritis who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more conventional
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Data will be collected from patients initiated on
      RoActemra/Actemra treatment according to the local label at baseline, Weeks 4, 12 and 24, and
      at 3 and 6 months after the last dose of study drug.
