  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The appropriate management of postoperative pain is recognized as an important clinical
      challenge with implications beyond humanitarian issues. Evidence shows that effective
      postoperative analgesia is associated with physiological benefits to the patient, shortened
      length of hospital stay and lower rates of in-hospital complications, such as pneumonia,
      delirium and persistent pain after surgery. However, despite the availability of several
      analgesic drugs and strategies the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain is often
      suboptimal. Remifentanil is a potent short acting opioid commonly used in continuous infusion
      for anesthesia for several surgical procedures. Remifentanil has been extensively advocated
      as a means to provide quick patient awakening in the immediate postoperative period with a
      very low risk of respiratory depression. Yet it does not provide residual analgesia and
      postoperative pain is a major concern. In order to overcome this limitation, practicing
      anesthesiologists frequently give patients a single dose of Sufentanil, a long acting opioid,
      during the induction of anesthesia where Remifentanil will be used in continuous infusion.
      However the effectiveness of this strategy still lacks evidence from controlled clinical
      trials.

      We propose the current randomized clinical trial to assess the analgesic effectiveness of
      Sufentanil administered as a single dose during the induction of anesthesia for the
      management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing open abdominal surgery performed with
      continuous infusion of Remifentanil.
