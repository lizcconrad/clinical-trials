  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The E-MECHANIC Ancillary Study will measure changes in 24-hour energy expenditure and
      spontaneous physical activity in a subset of 60 obese individuals enrolled in the main study.
      We aim to determine if changes in energy metabolism might explain why people don't lose the
      expected amount of weight in an exercise program.

      This is an ancillary study to E-Mechanic, which is an National Institutes of Health study in
      198 individuals with the objective to understand why certain people fail to lose weight in
      exercise programs. In E-Mechanic changes in body weight, body composition, energy intake and
      energy expenditure are measured before and after 3 different exercise programs of 24 weeks in
      duration. The 3 exercise programs being compared are self-directed exercise, low dose
      exercise and high dose exercise. The goal of this ancillary study is to undertake
      comprehensive assessments of energy metabolism in a metabolic chamber in a group of 60 obese
      individuals enrolled in the main study. We will compare differences in the changes in 24h
      energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity between the 3 exercise programs. We will
      also test if changes in energy metabolism might explain why people don't lose the expected
      amount of weight after 24 weeks of exercise.

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Self Directed Exercise</arm_group_label>
    <description>Participants randomized to the self-directed group will receive information on physical activity recommendations and guidelines on nutrition aimed at promoting weight loss. Participants will not be given a specific exercise recommendation in terms of weekly energy expenditure.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Intensity Exercise</arm_group_label>
    <description>Individuals assigned to the low dose exercise group will be required to expend 8 calories per kg of body weight per week in structured aerobic exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. The exercise intensity will be maintained at 65% of VO2peak. The caloric goal of each session will be calculated by dividing the weekly caloric expenditure goal by participant selected exercise frequency (i.e., 3, 4 or 5 times per week). The training program consists of a 3-min warm-up at a progressively increasing intensity until the prescribed training intensity is reached. All exercise sessions are conducted at the PBRC Fitness Center and will be supervised by staff trained on the aspects of the study protocol.</description>

    <description>Individuals assigned to the low dose exercise group will be required to expend 20 calories per kg of body weight per week in structured aerobic exercise on a treadmill or stationary bicycle. The exercise intensity will be maintained at 65% of VO2peak. The caloric goal of each session will be calculated by dividing the weekly caloric expenditure goal by participant selected exercise frequency (i.e., 3, 4 or 5 times per week).
