      This study investigates whether milnacipran reduces radicular pain (&quot;sciatica&quot;) in patients
      with lumbosacral disc disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study evaluates the potential efficacy of milnacipran in reducing lower extremity
      radicular pain associated with lumbar disk disease. Milnacipran will be titrated based on
      efficacy and tolerability aimed at the higher end of the therapeutic range; a recent study of
      a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in patients with osteoarthritis pain suggests
      efficacy may be dose related. Patients are likely to have concomitant nociceptive lower back
      pain, and cotreatment with opioids, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, or nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs at stable doses will be permitted. Patients participating in stable
      regimen of physical therapy or biofeedback will be eligible. Procedural interventions (e.g.
      epidural steroid injection, nerve block, facet radioablation, acupuncture) during the study
      and 3 months prior will be exclusionary. Anticonvulsants, tramadol, and other antidepressant
      drugs will be excluded.

      The study is a ten-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) of
      milnacipran (100-200 mg/day dosed twice a day) for radicular pain associated with lumbosacral
      disk disease.

      Outcome measures and safety assessments will be obtained at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10
      according to the protocol schedule of assessments.

    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale Score Referring to Radicular Pain (VAS-rad)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary outcome is change in pain VAS from baseline through 10 weeks. The effect size was calculated using the VAS scores measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm with 0 being absence of pain or no pain noted and 100 being worst imaginable pain/as bad as can be. The higher the score the greater the over all pain intensity. Mean cumulative total scores were reported.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VAS Related to Nociceptive Pain Component (VAS-Noc)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary outcome is change in pain VAS from baseline through 1o weeks as related to nociceptive pain component. The effect size was calculated using the VAS scores measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm with 0 being absence of pain or no pain noted and 100 being worst imaginable pain/as bad as can be. The higher the score the greater the over all pain intensity. Mean cumulative scores were reported</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>SF-36 (Short Form)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report of quality of life. Subjective measure of perceived quality of life.The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section.
Scoring: Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. Higher scores reflect higher quality of life with 100 high life quality. Total mean cumulative scores were reported
The eight sections are:
vitality physical functioning bodily pain general health perceptions physical role functioning emotional role functioning social role functioning mental health</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self report evaluation of various back pain symptoms. For each of 10 sections participants rate pain on a scale of 0-5 in these categories:
Section 1 - Pain intensity
Section 2 - Personal care
Section 3 - Lifting
Section 4 - Walking
Section 5 - Sitting
Section 6 - Standing
Section 7 - Sleeping
Section 8 - Sex life (if applicable)
Section 9 - Social life
Section 10 - Travelling
The scores are combined form each category into overall score. Scores are converted to percentages as follows:
0% to 20%: minimal disability: The patient can cope with most living activities.
21%-40%: moderate disability: The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing.
41%-60%: severe disability: Pain remains the main problem-activities of daily living are affected.
61%-80%: crippled: Back pain impinges on all aspects of life.
81%-100%: Patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms</description>

    <measure>Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report evaluation of nerve pain symptoms. A low total cumulative score means less pain and higher cumulative score is greater pain.
Total cumulative scores range form 0 to 1000 where in 0 is absence of pain and 1000 highest pain.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report evaluation of depressive symptoms.The secondary outcome measure is change in Beck Depression Inventory. The scale for this inventory is:
0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression. The higher the score the degree of depression.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and 10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Self-report evaluation of anxiety symptoms.Assessment of subjective symptoms of current anxiety and chronic anxiety.
There are 20 items for assessing trait anxiety and 20 for state anxiety. State anxiety items include: &quot;I am tense; I am worried&quot; and &quot;I feel calm; I feel secure.&quot; Trait anxiety items include: &quot;I worry too much over something that really doesn't matter&quot; and &quot;I am content; I am a steady person.&quot; All items are rated on a 4-point scale
Scale
1= almost never 4= almost always
Higher scores indicate greater anxiety. Mean cumulative scores were reported</description>

        <title>Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire</title>
        <description>Self report evaluation of various back pain symptoms. For each of 10 sections participants rate pain on a scale of 0-5 in these categories:
Section 1 – Pain intensity
Section 2 – Personal care
Section 3 – Lifting
Section 4 – Walking
Section 5 – Sitting
Section 6 – Standing
Section 7 – Sleeping
Section 8 – Sex life (if applicable)
Section 9 – Social life
Section 10 – Travelling
The scores are combined form each category into overall score. Scores are converted to percentages as follows:
0% to 20%: minimal disability: The patient can cope with most living activities.
21%-40%: moderate disability: The patient experiences more pain and difficulty with sitting, lifting and standing.
41%-60%: severe disability: Pain remains the main problem-activities of daily living are affected.
61%-80%: crippled: Back pain impinges on all aspects of life.
81%-100%: Patients are either bed-bound or exaggerating their symptoms</description>
