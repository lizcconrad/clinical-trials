    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to investigate if there is altered motor control of head
      and neck in chronic neck pain patients compared with healthy persons. In addition,
      associations between neck pain, motor control, disability and function, and clinical symptoms
      will be studied in patients following physiotherapy treatment in primary health care.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Conjunct motion</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Describes the movement stiffness in active movements of the neck. Conjunct motion is movement in the two associated movement planes to the primary plane. For example,the amount of rotation and lateral flexion during neck flexion and extension. Measured by 3D Liberty device and with degrees as unit of measure.</description>
