  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will investigate in a sham controlled staggered onset design antidepressant
      effects and safety of deep brain stimulation (DBS) to the superolateral branch of the main
      medial forebrain bundle (slMFB).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target point for DBS in major depression disorder is located lateral to the ventral
      tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain at the branching point of the superolateral branch
      (slMFB) from the main medial forebrain bundle (MFB).

      The exact stimulation coordinates are:

      Montreal Neurologic Institute brain 152 coordinates (MNI152 coordinates):

      left: x(lat.)=-5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-8 right: x(lat.)=5, y(ap)=-14, z(vert.)=-9

      Mid-commissural point coordinates (MCP coordinates):

      eft: x(lat.)=-6, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-6 right: x(lat.)=4, y(ap)=-1, z(vert.)=-7

      All coordinates refer to the MNI152 brain.

      Legend:

      slMFB = superolateral branch of medial forebrain bundle lat. = lateral, ap= anteroposterior,
      vert. = vertical.

    <measure>Depression Severity assessed with Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>Change in MADRS after 6 and 12 months as compared to mean baseline score and one month placebo treatment. MADRS is a ten-item diagnostic questionnaire which psychiatrists use to measure the severity of depressive episodes in patients with mood disorders. It is used as an adjunct to the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and more sensitive to the changes in depression than the Hamilton Scale is.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression Severity rated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS24)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), also known as the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) or abbreviated to HAM-D, is a multiple choice questionnaire that clinicians may use to rate the severity of a patient's major depression. The questionnaire rates the severity of symptoms observed in depression such as low mood, insomnia, agitation, anxiety and weight loss. The questionnaire is presently one of the most commonly used scales for rating depression in medical research.
Measures will be taken at same time points as primary outcome measure.</description>

    <measure>Adverse Event Schedule</measure>
    <time_frame>6 and 12 month after DBS stimulation onset</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be recorded during the study using a structured questionnaire. All possible adverse events (AEs) are assessed in severity, duration and actions taken. 12 months after stimulation onset results will be compiled and rated as being due to the surgical procedure, device, or stimulation. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be discussed individually if a modification of study protocol is required.
Additional, there will be a safety and efficacy analysis after 6 implanted patients.</description>
