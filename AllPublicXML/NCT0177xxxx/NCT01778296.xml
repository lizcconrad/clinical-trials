  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The dorsum of the finger is a reliable flap donor site in reconstructive hand surgery because
      of its similar quality to the original. The dorsal digital island flap can be used for
      repairing the defect of adjacent finger, but the limited length of the pedicle precludes its
      use for a more distal defect. The heterodigital neurocutaneous island flap of the dorsal
      branch of the digital nerve can be used as an alternative to resolve this problem.

      At final follow-up, we measured the sensibility of the flaps using the Semmes-Weinstein
      monofilament test and the static 2-point discrimination test. The test points were at the
      center of the radial or ulnar portion of the pulp. The donor site, i.e. radial- or
      ulnar-dorsal aspect of the middle phalanx of the donor digit, was also evaluated. Each area
      was tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). We stopped at 4mm as a limit
      of 2PD and considered this normal.

    <description>Discriminatory sensation of the flap is evaluated with the Static 2-point Discrimination Test. The test determines the minimal distance at which a subject can sense the presence of two needles. The modified American Society for Surgery of the Hand guidelines were used to stratify Discriminator measurements (excellent &lt;6 mm; good 6-10 mm; fair 11-15 mm; poor &gt;15 mm. The test point is at the center of the flap. Each area was tested 3 times with a Discriminator (Ali Med, Dedham, MA). Two out of 3 correct answers were considered proof of perception before proceeding to another lower value. We stop at 4mm as a limit of 2PD and considered this normal. These assessments take place at a single time point at the final follow-up.</description>
