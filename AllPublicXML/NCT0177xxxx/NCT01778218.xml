      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational radiolabeled
      imaging agent technetium-99m-labeled ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose (99mTc-EC-DG).
      Additionally, the study will determine the specific times to best image the heart using a
      SPECT camera with the investigational imaging agent and compare the images to those taken
      while undergoing the standard rest and exercise/regadenoson testing previously performed to
      detect the presence and severity of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD).

      The study will assess the safety and tolerability of technetium-99m-labeled
      ethylenedicysteine-deoxyglucose (99mTc-EC-DG).

      An outcome will be to develop an imaging protocol for a multicenter trial that will measure
      the specific imaging parameters required for determination of sensitivity and specificity of
      99mTc-EC-DG in a cardiovascular single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study
      compared to an exercise/regadenoson 99mTc- Sestamibi (MIBI) study for detection of the
      presence and, when available, severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) as documented by
      coronary angiography when available.

      This study will be a single-center, prospective, open-label study of up to 6 patients with
      positive findings from a MIBI (99mTc-sestamibi) exercise/regadenoson study within 30 days for
      evaluation of CAD. Patients who meet study eligibility criteria will undergo a 99mTc-EC-DG
      rest study and a 99mTc-EC-DG exercise/regadenoson study. When possible, patients enrolled
      will have clinical plans for a coronary angiography study to confirm presence and severity of
      CAD.

      This study will enroll up to 6 patients with a reversible perfusion defect indicative of CAD
      on a MIBI exercise/regadenoson study. These patients will undergo a 99mTc-EC-DG rest study
      and an exercise/regadenoson study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age &gt; 18 years

          2. Reversible perfusion defect indicative of CAD on a MIBI exercise/regadenoson study
             completed within 30 days prior to screening;

          3. When possible, a coronary angiography will be clinically planned; patient and treating
             physician must be agreeable to completing the angiogram after the 99mTc-EC-DG
             exercise/regadenoson study in order for the procedure to be performed.

          4. The patient is able to provide written informed consent to participate in this study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known cardiomyopathy or history of congestive heart failure (CHF) due to left
             ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction &lt; 40%)

          2. A scheduled coronary angiogram that prevents the 99mTc-EC-DG exercise/regadenoson or
             rest study visits from being completed prior to the angiogram

          3. Plans to begin new anti-anginal therapy prior to completing the 99mTc-EC-DG
