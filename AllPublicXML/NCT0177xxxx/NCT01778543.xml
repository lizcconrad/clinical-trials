      Background:

      - Uveal coloboma is a condition where the eye does not form normally. It occurs early in the
      fetus s development during pregnancy. It can lead to different kinds of eye problems,
      including blindness. Several genes have been linked to coloboma, but the cause of most cases
      is hard to find. Researchers want to study the genes of people who have coloboma and genes
      from their close, unaffected relatives (such as parents and siblings).

      Objectives:

      - To study the genes associated with uveal coloboma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 1 years of age who either have uveal coloboma or are an unaffected
      relative (such as a parent or sibling).

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will also have a full
           eye exam.

        -  Participants with uveal coloboma may have other exams, such as imaging studies and
           hearing assessments.

        -  All participants will also provide blood and cheek swab or saliva samples for genetic
           testing.

      Objective:

      The objectives of this study are to 1) define ocular and systemic associations in a cohort of
      well-phenotyped participants with uveal coloboma, 2) define risk factors and microforms of
      coloboma in relatives of affected individuals and 3) establish a repository of DNA and/or
      lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants with uveal coloboma and their relatives for use
      in laboratory investigations.

      Study Population:

      Two hundred and forty (240) individuals of at least one year of age with documented uveal
      coloboma and their relatives will be enrolled.

      Design:

      This is a natural history/genetic repository study. Two hundred and forty (240) participants
      will be enrolled over four years. Participants will undergo a complete age-appropriate
      baseline eye examination and physical examination and provide a blood or buccal cell sample.

      Outcome Measures:

      The tests, data, and samples collected will be analyzed to better understand the genetics of
      uveal coloboma. In particular, ocular and systemic associations will be defined in a cohort
      of well-phenotyped participants with uveal coloboma, as will the risk factors and microforms
      of coloboma in relatives of affected individuals.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        The participant must be one year of age or older.

        The participant must be able to cooperate with an age-appropriate eye examination.

        The participant must be able to provide a blood or saliva sample.

        The participant must be able to understand and sign this protocol s informed consent form
        OR have a legal parent/guardian with the ability to do the same.

        The participant must either:

        be affected by uveal coloboma OR

        be an asymptomatic relative of an affected individual.

        Participants will be considered to be affected by uveal coloboma if they have a clear
        ocular phenotype related to uveal coloboma or if they are deemed affected by other clinical
        evaluations (e.g., the presence of a unique, systemic manifestation cosegregating with
        coloboma, or a rare or unique kidney finding).
