  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary safety objective is to demonstrate that severe device-related complication
      (Serious Adverse Device Effect = SADE) occur within 2 years after prosthesis implantation at
      a rate of less than 2%. Such adverse events include (but are not limited to) revisions due to
      dislocation or glenoid loosening, septic arthritis and scapular fractures requiring surgical
      repair.

    <textblock>
      Reverse shoulder arthroplasty and its principles are still recognized today as the gold
      standard for treatment of degenerative arthropathy of the shoulder associated with an
      irreparable tear of the rotator cuff. The new Arthrex Univers® Revers Shoulder Prosthesis
      shows a large and narrow range of components, whether it is a stem, cup, spacer, inlay or
      glenosphere. Adjustment can be done in very small steps to match anatomic and biomechanic
      needs. The Arthrex Univers Revers Shoulder Prosthesis is the only device up to date that can
      be configured in two different inclination angles without any limitation in component use.

      This multicentre case-series has the goal to evaluate whether patients with rotator cuff tear
      arthropathy benefit from the Univers® Revers shoulder prosthesis in terms of low complication
      risk, as well as high function and quality of life.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Risk of adverse events intra-operatively, and post-operatively up to 2 years follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>As typically one single surgery should be sufficient to treat the patient, all secondary surgical interventions should be revisions due to a complication.
The occurrence and time of revision surgery (implant survival) will be described by Kaplan-Meier curve.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prosthesis survival at 2, 5 and 10 years</measure>
    <time_frame>2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>All Patients with a prosthesis revision will be documented along with the date of revision. At each follow up time point the proportion of patients with prosthesis revision will be estimated. Time to prosthesis revision will be examined by survival methods to account for censored data.</description>

    <measure>Constant (Murley) score (CS)</measure>
    <time_frame>6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Constant (Murley) score is possibly the most commonly used tool for assessment of shoulder function. The physician asks and documents answers to QOL questions (pain and ADL, ability to work, sleep, sports and leisure) and certain clinical parameters (active ROM, abduction strength). The different scales will be summed and normalized to O=worst to 100= best. A German version is available for clinical use. Investigators are obliged to use a spring balance for the force measurements. Only one measurement per patient per assessment will be done.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI)</measure>
    <time_frame>6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a short, self-administered questionnaire that provides an item scoring by a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 (no pain/no difficulty, i.e. best) to 11 (worst pain imaginable/so difficult required help, i.e. worst). Five items assess pain and 8 items disability of the arm (function). The unweighted means of the 5 pain and the 8 function items will be transformed into the scale from 0 (=worst) to 100 (=best) for both scales and are used to determine pain and function scores. The average of these two scores then gives the total SPADI score. A validated German version is available.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH)</measure>
    <time_frame>6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (DASH) is a comprehensive self-administered questionnaire about symptoms and functioning of the entire upper extremity. The DASH enquires about the ability to perform simple and complex activities of daily living (ADL) that are commonly performed with either one or both arms. The total score is derived from the unweighted mean of 30 items, of which at least 27 have to be answered. The QuickDASH is a more efficient version of the DASH outcome measure that appears to retain its measurement properties. It contains eleven items and is similar with regard to scores and properties to the full DASH. A validated full-length German version is available that can be used in the shortened version.</description>

    <measure>EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>6wk, 6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a widely used instrument to measure and value generic health (status). It is based on a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. The instrument is designed for self-completion, and patients also rate their overall health on the day of the interview on a 0-100 visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>6wk, 6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>In order to obtain an overall assessment of the arthroplasty result, patients will be asked to assess their current state of health in general related to the operated shoulder joint at the follow-up compared to the state before the arthroplasty. This so-called 'transition' question has the possible answers 'much worse', 'slightly worse', 'equal', 'slightly better', and 'much better'. Patients also rate their level of satisfaction, with the help of a numeric rating scale (NRS: 0-10), in terms of how the outcome met up to their preoperative expectations of the arthroplasty. Finally, they will be asked whether - with their current knowledge of the outcome - they would again choose the operation if they found themselves in similar circumstances to those which prevailed preoperatively.</description>

    <measure>Radiographic Parameters</measure>
    <time_frame>6mo, 1, 2, 5 and 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>Three radiographs should be taken at each study visit: AP view in internal and external rotation and axial view. The images will be collected digitally and centralized for latter evaluation by an independent reviewer based on the radiographic assessment CRF developed by the Schulthess clinic, including the following parameters:
Scapular notching
Signs of osteolysis at the glenoid and at the stem
Status of tuberculum majus and minus
Glenoid migration
Glenoid component seating
Stem position
Change of relative position of components
Ectopic bone formation
Cortical bone resorption
Prosthesis breakage
Rotation failure
Luxation of the prosthesis
PE Wear of the metaglene
PE Dissociation</description>
