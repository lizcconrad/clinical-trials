  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) is a major complaint among many patients with stroke and causes
      severe complications. There is no specific treatment for these patients. Impaired swallow
      response is caused by a delay in the timing of oropharyngeal reconfiguration with delayed
      airway protection. Swallow response is initiated by sensory afferent fibers in the oropharynx
      and cerebral cortex reaching the central swallowing pattern generator (CPG) in the medulla
      oblongata and brainstem motor nuclei. Hypothesis: Stimulation of pharyngeal sensory afferent
      fibers through TRPV1 receptors and electrical stimuli might enhance the stimulation of the
      CPG and speed the swallow response. Long-term treatment of OD will improve clinical outcome
      of stroke patients. Aim: To assess the effect of TRPV1 agonists (capsaicin) and that of
      sensorial pharyngeal electrical stimulation (intrapharyngeal and transcutaneous) on VFS signs
      and swallow response at 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment in stroke patients with
      established OD. To compare the clinical effect of classical rehabilitation strategies with
      that of these new afferent sensorial neurostimulation strategies in terms of nutritional
      status parameters, incidence of aspiration pneumonia and/or low respiratory tract infection,
      quality of life, and mortality. Methods: Clinical screening of OD with the volume-viscosity
      swallow test and assessment by VFS and quantitative measurements of swallow response.
      Randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of standard rehabilitation with that of
      afferent sensorial neurostimulation strategies.

    <measure>To assess the efficacy and safety of new neuron-stimulation treatments for OD in patients with stroke and to explore their mechanism of action.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The efficacy of each treatment will be assessed by VFS in each patient after the treatment and at the end of the follow-up period, considering Rosenbek scale and measures of oropharyngeal swallow response including oropharyngeal reconfiguration, timing and extent of hyoid motion and bolus propulsion force of the tongue. Clinical outcome also evaluated are episodes of aspiration pneumonia and low respiratory tract infections, nutritional status, complications and clinical symptoms experimented during one year of follow-up and mortality rates and cause of death.
Participating clinicians will be instructed to register and describe all serious adverse events (SAE) occurred during the study and report them on a specific form within 24 hours. The guidelines for SAE reporting to the Ethical Committee and competent authorities will be followed.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive recommendations from their healthcare providers about bolus volume and viscosity adaptation for fluids, dietary and nutritional adjustments (liquids and solids) of bolus volume and viscosity/texture. Before leaving each hospital they will also learn basic rehabilitation strategies for OD including swallow postures, compensatory manoeuvres and oropharyngeal rehabilitation exercises and oral hygiene to follow at home.</description>
