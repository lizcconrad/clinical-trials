  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study has two purposes: first, to locate and identify the &quot;brain activation&quot; (the areas
      of the brain) which respond to pain; and second, to look at how brain activation is
      influenced by a person's genetics (the traits they inherited from their parents). A Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner will be used to gather pictures of the brain (similar to an
      x-ray, but based on different scientific principles) that will be used to determine which
      areas are active. The hypothesis is that the variation in brain activity between people can
      be partially explained by genetic differences. This study consists of an two pain tasks
      applied during a one time visit to the MRI suite. There are no followup visits.

    <measure>Areas of brain activity from a transcutaneous painful stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>At the conclusion of the 1 hour scanning session; Visit one</time_frame>
    <description>A nerve stimulator will be turned on at the level that causes you to report 7/10 pain for 30 seconds, followed by a 30 second period of rest. This will be repeated four times. The areas of brain activity are determined at the end of the 1 hour scanning session by analyzing the brain images. There are no additional followup or long term outcomes.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Areas of brain activity from a 45 minutes Capsaicin cream application</measure>
    <time_frame>At the conclusion of the 1 hour scanning session; Visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>The painful stimulation will now be caused by placing a piece of gauze soaked with capsaicin, the active ingredients in chili peppers, on the subject's right arm. The areas of brain activity are determined at the end of the 1 hour scanning session by analyzing the brain images. There are no additional followup or long term outcomes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain phenotyping</measure>
    <time_frame>After the 45 minute Capsaicin cream application; Visit 1</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will report their pain at least every 3 minutes during the cream application. The subject's pain phenotype will be determined from this response.</description>
