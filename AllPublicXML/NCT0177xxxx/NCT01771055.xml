      The purpose of this study is to find if direct peritoneal resuscitation helps blood flow
      through important organs in a person's body after they have had a traumatic injury with
      massive blood loss. Sometimes after severe injuries requiring operation, surgeons cannot
      close the muscles and skin of a patient's belly, because of swelling. This study will also
      try to find if direct peritoneal resuscitation decreases tissue swelling and allows for
      quicker closure of of a patient's belly.

      Standard methods of controlling bleeding and increasing blood flow to vital organs will be
      used. These methods include giving blood and fluids and surgically repairing the vessels that
      are causing the bleeding which are standard ways physicians treat injuries with massive blood
      loss. A drain (a small plastic tube) will be placed inside the belly.

      Subjects will randomly (like flipping a coin) be placed into a group of patients who either
      get a sugar solution dripped into the belly after surgery or do not get this treatment. The
      drain will be used to drip a high glucose solution into the abdomen in patients be part of
      that group. The fluid will continue to be dripped into the belly until it is possible to
      close the skin and underlying layers.
