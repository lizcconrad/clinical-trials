  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been considerable efforts to control rising health care costs. One of the more
      recent developments is the practice of reprocessing single use medical devices. This practice
      has been shown to provide considerable savings for health care payers. Medical devices have
      been reprocessed in a number of different medical fields including Orthopaedic Surgery. One
      of the devices that has been reprocessed are the Precision Saw Blades from Stryker Inc. These
      saw blades are used during Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) surgery. The reprocessed Precision
      saw blades are Health Canada approved and are available at Capital Health.

      Beyond the benefits to the environment and cost savings, the investigators do not know if the
      reprocessed saw blades work better, work worse or the same as non reprocessed saw blades.
      This study is designed to determine if the reprocessed saw blades used during a TKA work as
      well as a new saw blade.
