    <description>FOOD EFFECT STUDY:
Each subject (a minimum of 12 subjects) will be assigned according to a randomization code to receive a single 50 mg dose of E7820 on Day 1, either after fasting for 10 hours, or immediately after consuming a high fat breakfast. Following a 7-day washout period, the subjects will crossover and a second 50 mg dose of E7820 will be administered on Day 8.</description>

             with no radiographic evidence of brain disease recurrence or B. Have undergone
             stereotactic radio surgery (gamma knife procedure) and are more then 1 month post
             procedure and with no radiographic evidence of brain disease progression and C. Are
             asymptomatic and D. Discontinued corticosteroid treatment at least 30 days prior to
             Cycle 1, Day 1

          5. Adequate liver function as evidenced by bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 times the
             upper limits of normal (ULN) and alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
             and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) less than or equal to 3 x ULN (in the case of
             liver metastases less than or equal to 5 x ULN) In case alkaline phosphatase is
             greater than 3 x ULN (in absence of liver metastases) or greater than 5 x ULN (in
             presence of liver metastases) AND subject also is known to have bone metastases, the
             liver specific alkaline phosphatase must be separated from the total and used to
             assess the liver function instead of the total alkaline phosphatase.

          6. Adequate renal function as evidenced by serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0
             mg/dL (177 micro-mol/L) or calculated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 40

          7. Provide written informed consent.

          8. Are willing and able to comply with all aspects of the protocol.

          9. Adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater
             than or equal to 1.5 x 109/L, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9 g/dL (5.5 mmol/L)
             and platelet count greater than or equal to 100 x 109/L.

         10. Females must not be lactating or pregnant at Screening or Baseline (as documented by a
             negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG] test with a minimum sensitivity
             of 25 IU/L or equivalent units of beta-hCG). A separate baseline assessment is
             required if a negative screening pregnancy test was obtained more than 72 hours before
             the first dose of study drug.

         11. All females will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless they are
             postmenopausal (amenorrheic for at least 12 consecutive months, in the appropriate age
             group, and without other known or suspected cause) or have been sterilized surgically
             (i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, total hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy, all
             with surgery at least 1 month before dosing).

         12. Females of childbearing potential must not have had unprotected sexual intercourse
             within 30 days prior to study entry and must agree to use a highly effective method of
             contraception (e.g., total abstinence, an intrauterine device, a double-barrier method
             [such as condom plus diaphragm with spermicide], a contraceptive implant, an oral
             contraceptive or have a vasectomized partner with confirmed azoospermia) throughout
             the entire study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation. If currently
             abstinent, the subject must agree to use a double-barrier method as described above if
             she becomes sexually active during the study period or for 30 days after study drug
             discontinuation. Females who are using hormonal contraceptives must have been on a
             stable dose of the same hormonal contraceptive product for at least 4 weeks prior to
             dosing and must continue to use the same contraceptive during the study and for 30
             days after study drug discontinuation.

         13. Male subjects must have had a successful vasectomy (confirmed azoospermia) or they and
             their female partners must meet the criteria above (i.e., not of childbearing
             potential or practicing highly effective contraception throughout the study period and
             for 30 days after study drug discontinuation). No sperm donation is allowed during the
             study period and for 30 days after study drug discontinuation.

          4. Subjects who have had radiation to greater than or equal to 30% of their bone marrow.

          5. Subjects who require therapeutic anti-coagulant therapy with warfarin or related
             vitamin K antagonists. Prophylactic doses of heparin or low molecular weight heparin
             or thrombin inhibitors may be used in place of warfarin.

          6. Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50% on echocardiography or MUGA scanning.

          7. Anticancer therapies that have not been completed at least 28 days (42 days in the
