  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Five year survival following a diagnosis of childhood cancer has reached 83%, making long
      term health outcomes among survivors an important concern. The growing population of
      survivors is at an increased risk of physical inactivity and associated adverse health
      outcomes. Regular physical activity is associated with better cardiovascular and
      musculoskeletal health. Despite the known benefits of physical activity, nearly half of all
      childhood cancer survivors do not meet recommended guidelines for physical activity.

      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) want to determine if a
      rewards-based physical activity intervention delivered via an interactive website among young
      adolescent childhood cancer survivors, aged 11 through 14 years, will increase physical
      activity levels and improve cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. The investigators also
      want to learn if this rewards-based intervention is effective. To achieve this goal the
      investigators have designed a three-arm prospective, randomized study with two reward-based
      intervention groups and a control group.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To compare changes in levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity over 24 weeks.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To compare changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength and flexibility over
           24 weeks.

      Participants will be randomized to one of three groups. Participants in the control group
      will receive an activity monitor and educational materials, but will not have access to the
      interactive website. Participants randomized to the two intervention groups will be given
      access to a rewards program delivered via an interactive website, an activity monitor, and
      educational materials. Individual physical activity data can be viewed by study participants
      after uploading information from their monitors to the interactive website. One intervention
      group will receive minimal rewards, while the other group will receive immediate incentives
      as well as the minimal rewards as they move from one level to the other on the website.

      After 24 weeks, changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, flexibility, and
      physical function will be compared between the two intervention groups and the control group.

      <recruitment_details>This protocol enrolled 105 participants at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital from 9/2013 through 4/2014. Of the 105, 5 were determined to be ineligible after baseline screening (4 too active; 1 did not meet IQ criteria), and 2 withdrew prior to randomization but after baseline testing. The remaining 98 were randomized.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>98 participants were randomized 1:1:1 stratified by gender into 3 groups. Randomization was implemented using software based on Zelen's methodology. The principal investigator and study staff were blind to group assignment.</pre_assignment_details>
