    <textblock>
      This study is to see whether the low-dose coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA)
      protocol is as safe and efficacious as conventional-dose protocol in early triage of acute
      chest pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, CCTA is a valuable tool for early triage of low to intermediate risk acute chest
      pain patients in emergency department. However, it has been criticized for causing
      unnecessary radiation exposure in the population where its majority has no coronary lesion. A
      low-dose CCTA protocol comprised with 1) dedicated cardiac imaging protocol (rather than
      triple rule-out protocol), 2) prospective gating and 3) without additional imaging for
      calcium scoring will be used to implement the low-dose imaging. We hypothesized that the
      low-dose CCTA protocol will be as safe and efficacious as conventional dose protocol while
      decreasing the amount of radiation exposure significantly.
