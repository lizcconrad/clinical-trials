  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative seroma formation is one of the most common complications after ventral hernia
      repair with mesh. Although some seromas may not have clinical impact postoperative seroma
      formation often causes pain and discomfort and may even compromise wound healing. Abdominal
      binders (also called trusses, girdle, ostomy belt, longuette or abdominal belt) (AB) are
      commonly used in abdominal and plastic surgery to prevent seroma formation and diminish pain
      and discomfort after operation. The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the
      effect of postoperative abdominal binders after laparoscopic incisional hernia repair on
      postoperative pain, discomfort and quality of life. Secondary, we register seroma formation.
      A randomized, controlled, investigator-blinded study supplemented with blinded statistical
      analysis. We include 60 (2x30) incisional hernia repairs. Patients are randomized either to
      abdominal binder or no abdominal binder (controls). The abdominal binder is worn from
      immediately after the operation and continuously for 7 days and nights. All patients have a
      standardized operation with standardized intra- and postoperative medication regimen.
      Endpoints measurements are clinically detectable seroma formation scored with seroma
      classification system buý S. Morales-Conde, pain scored with self-registrations with VAS, and
      quality of life scored with EQ-5D, recurrence and other complications are also registered.
      Patients are followed until 90 days after the operation.

    <description>The abdominal binder is worn from immediately after the operation and continuously for 7 days and nights. The belts are standard abdominal binders (ostomy belts) from &quot;ETO garments©&quot; with standard height of 22 cm. and five different sizes in width (S, M, L, XL, XXL- depending on waist measure). A fitting will be done for all included patients before the operation by waist measurement according to the recommendation from the company (see below). When applied, the patients are advised to apply the belt in a lying position.</description>
