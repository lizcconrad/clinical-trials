  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this protocol is to determine the prevalence of somatic and germline mutations in
      BAP1 (BRCA associated protein-1) among patients with mesothelioma , choroidal nevus, primary
      uveal melanoma (UM), or metastatic UM seen at our institution.

    <measure>prevalence of somatic BAP1 mutations in disease mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The frequency of somatic mutations will be tabulated by factors of interest such as:
personal and familial risk factors: age, smoking, and asbestos mesothelioma, personal and family history of cancer or of related diseases (mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma)
disease characteristics: histology, stage, location, site of metastasis (if present) (for mesothelioma and metastatic uveal melanoma); COMS criteria, GEP class, number of clinical risk factors (for metastatic uveal melanoma)</description>

    <description>All consenting patients (Consent 1) will participate in an anonymized assessment of the prevalence of germline BAP1 mutations. Available tumor specimens from patients with MPM and metastatic uveal melanoma will be tested for BAP1 mutation. Patients whose tumors harbor BAP1 mutations and/or meet the criteria for germline mutation specified in 2.2.2 will be approached for identified germline BAP1 testing after appropriate pre-test counseling (Consent 2).
Patients who, through identified testing, are found to have germline BAP1 mutations will be asked to invite their relatives to participate in germline testing (Consent 3). First-degree relatives and any relatives with a malignancy will be prioritized. Expanding testing to family members of patients with BAP1 germline mutations is essential to delineate the penetrance and describe the various manifestations of this new cancer predisposition syndrome.</description>
