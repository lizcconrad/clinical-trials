  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of unilateral
      ExAblate thermal ablation of the Vim thalamic nucleus of subjects suffering from
      medication-refractory, idiopathic, tremor-dominant PD, using the ExAblate Transcranial system
      compared to a Sham Vim thalamotomy procedure.

      Data will be collected to establish the basic safety of this type of treatment as the basis
      for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy. The Sham treatment data will
      be used to evaluate placebo effect from treatment.

      Subjects who sign informed consent and pass all eligibility criteria will be randomized to a
      treatment assignment. During treatment, the assigned treatment (ExAblate Transcranial or Sham
      ExAblate Transcranial)will be delivered. Subjects are followed in a blinded fashion for three
      (3) months. After the 3-month assessment, subjects will be unblinded and told their treatment
      assignment. Subjects receiving Sham ExAblate Transcranial treatment who still meet criteria
      will be crossed over and receive an active ExAblate Transcranial treatment. Subjects will be
      followed for up to two (2) years. Follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
      12 months and up to two (2) years includes Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
      scoring, mental and cognitive functional testing and questionnaires.
