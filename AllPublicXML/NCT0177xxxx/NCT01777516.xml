      This is a in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor and
      its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) and their effects on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic
      acid. The study consist of two parts of in-vitro study as follows;

        -  Part 1 : in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor
           and its active metabolite.

        -  Part 2 : in vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor
           and its active metabolite and their effect on the pharmacodynamics of salicylic acid on
           platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of arachidonic acid.

      acid. The study consist of two parts of in-vitro study as follows;

        -  Part 1 : in-vitro study to evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction between ticagrelor
           and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of adenosine
           diphosphate(ADP) will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma and
           randomized paired concentrations of ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX.

           and its active metabolite. Platelet aggregation tests with the agonist of arachidonic
           acid will be assessed on the in-vitro mixtures of blank plasma plus randomized paired
           concentrations of ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX and the invitro mixtures with blank plasma
           and ticagrelor + AR-C124910XX + salicylic acid.
