  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to provide pilot data on the possible gastrointestinal predictors of
      respiratory hyper-responsiveness and how these relate to the clinical sub-types of
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and visceral acid hypersensitivity.

      This study recruited participants into three groups: reflux patients with non-erosive disease
      (NERD) with abnormal levels of acid reflux, NERD patients with normal levels of reflux and
      healthy volunteers. Participants were assessed for cough reflex sensitivity (CRS) to citric
      acid and bronchial-hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine challenge, both before
      (baseline) and after esophageal acid infusion (HCl, 0.15M) or normal saline control
      (8ml/min). The order of CRS and BHR was randomized, as was the order of the acid/saline
      infusions.

    <description>Subjects inhaled increasing concentrations of citric acid, which induces coughing in a dose-dependent, reproducible matter. Following each inhalation, the number of coughs in the subsequent 15 seconds was counted and recorded. The challenge was terminated once the citric acid induced 5 or more coughs and the logarithmic (base 10) concentration provoking 5 coughs was recorded.</description>

    <description>A baseline spirometry was used to assess how well the participant's lungs work by measuring how much air was inhale, how much was exhale and how quickly the participant exhaled. If this was normal, the subject inhaled slowly and deeply the methacholine test solution from a nebulizer and was told to hold their breath for 5 seconds. This was repeated until 5 inhalations were performed in no more than two minutes.</description>
