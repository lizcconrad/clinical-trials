  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Skin and soft tissue infections represent a tremendous burden to the health care community
      with over 11.6 million ambulatory patients presenting annually in 2003 and 14.2 million in
      2005. A Cochrane review of cellulitis found that there is limited data to support any
      specific antibiotic or even a specific length of antibiotic therapy, and that outpatient
      therapy for cellulitis is increasing. Soft tissue ultrasound has been shown to have utility
      in differentiating cellulitis from abscess but its role in patients with cellulitis is not
      well developed. Although speculative, the investigators hypothesize that sonographic features
      of cellulitis are associated with clinical improvement and successful therapy following
      antibiotics for patients with cellulitis.

      The primary objective is to determine if changes in the sonographic features of cellulitis
      are associated with failure of therapy. Patients with cellulitis treated in the ED with
      either intravenous or oral antibiotics will undergo imaging using a standardized ultrasound
      protocol. Patients will be screened and enrolled in the ED at the UMASS Memorial Medical
      Center. The study design is single center prospective observational trial involving adult
      patients with clinical signs of cellulitis requiring antibiotics but not admitted to the
      hospital. Patients will be imaged upon initial presentation to the ED. Patients discharged
      from the ED after the initial visit will return to the ED in 24 to 48 hours for a
      reassessment. Patients kept in the ED under observational status will undergo an identical
      reassessment. Clinical staff blinded to the ultrasound results will characterize patients as
      improving, no change or worsening based on progression of the erythema despite antibiotics or
      change in clinical status. Researchers blinded to the clinical data will review the
      ultrasound images to quantify the extent of the sonographic evidence of cellulitis compared
      to the extent of the erythema by physical exam findings.
