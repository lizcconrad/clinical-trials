  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood, airways and/or
      urine of normal individuals and individuals with lung disease. The normal are used to
      establish a set of normal ranges for various parameters. These provide control information
      when compared to individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding
      of the etiology and pathogenesis of various lung diseases. The underlying hypothesis is that
      the pathologic morphological changes in the airway epithelium must be preceded by changes in
      the gene expression pattern of the airway epithelium and potentially in macrophages.

      This is a protocol to obtain blood, urine and/or airway specimens from normal individuals and
      individuals with lung disorders in order to carry out laboratory studies looking at genetic
      expression, gene transfer, infection, proteins, human genes, and to store specimens for
      future genetic studies. Specimens collected may include blood, urine and airway samples
      (nasal, airway brushing, biopsy and/or washings) from consenting subjects. Subjects will
      include both individuals diagnosed with lung disease and healthy control subjects. The
      purpose of this study is to obtain biologic materials from the blood, airways and/or urine of
      normal individuals and individuals with lung disease. The normal are used to establish a set
      of normal ranges for various parameters. These provide control information when compared to
      individuals with various pulmonary diseases, and will help in understanding of the etiology
      and pathogenesis of various lung diseases. The investigators will use bronchoscopy (inserting
      a scope into the lungs) to obtain airway cells by brushing, biopsy and/or washings in
      individuals with lung disease and in healthy controls. By studying those cells, the
      investigators hope to learn more about the specific causes of lung disease, how lung disease
      manifests and progresses, and how lung disease can be treated.
