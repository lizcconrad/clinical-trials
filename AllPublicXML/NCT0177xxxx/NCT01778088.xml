      The purpose of this study is to determine the recommended dosing of I-131-CLR1404, a
      radiolabeled therapy compound, for treating subjects with glioma.

      Subjects who meet study entry criteria will receive I-131-CLR1404. For each subject, the
      study will be conducted in three phases, dosimetric, therapy, and follow-up. In the
      dosimetric phase, subjects will receive one 5 mCi dose of the study drug and undergo whole
      body imaging on on the day of infusion and on post-infusion days 2, 3, and 7 for assessment
      of biodistribution and tumor uptake of I-131-CLR1404. If normal and expected biodistribution
      are demonstrated, the subject will begin the therapy phase. In the therapy phase, the
      subjects will receive a dose based on body surface area and may receive additional doses if
      they meet dosing criteria. After the last treatment dose, subjects will enter the follow-up
      phase and will be followed monthly.

      All subjects will be prescribed thyroid protection medication to be taken 24 hours prior to
      injection of the dosimetric dose, and continuing for 14 days after the administration of the
      therapy dose.
