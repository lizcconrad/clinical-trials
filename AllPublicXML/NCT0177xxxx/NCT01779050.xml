  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the efficacy of trastuzumab treatment in breast cancer patients
      with stage II-III human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumors and
      HER2-expressing bone marrow disseminated tumor cells. Administering targeted trastuzumab
      therapy to these patients may result in the elimination of HER2 expressing disseminated tumor
      cells and improved disease free survival.

Patients will also receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes for 52 weeks starting such that there is a minimum of 8 weeks of overlap with the standard of care chemotherapy. Trastuzumab may be given weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks while overlapping with standard of care chemotherapy. Trastuzumab will be given every 3 weeks after all standard of care chemotherapy has concluded. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
