    <textblock>
      This two-week study will compare the healing of minor wounds when no bandage is applied
      against four different types of bandages.

      The study investigators will make five small wounds similar to scrapes (about a half-inch
      square) on the back of subjects who qualify to participate in the trial and have given
      informed consent. Four of the wounds will be covered by different bandages and one will be
      left uncovered. Participants will visit the clinic every day for 2 weeks or until all the
      wounds are healed (whichever comes first). At the clinic, the bandages will be removed, the
      doctor will score the wounds, a picture will be taken of the wounds and new bandages will be
      applied.

      It is expected that some pain and itching will be experienced, because they are part of the
      normal wound healing process. Subjects will be asked about adverse events at each visit and
      will have the opportunity to discuss issues or concerns with the investigator or the doctor
      during the course of the trial. It is expected that the wounds will be completely healed
      within 14 days, but if not, the participant will need to return to the clinic for follow-up
      treatment until the wounds are completely healed.

      We will see if the different bandages help with the healing of the wounds during the study.

    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the performance of various bandages on facilitating the healing of
      induced dermabrasion wounds. To qualify for this study, subjects must meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria within the protocol-specified parameters at both the screening
      and baseline visits. Once a subject is qualified, five dermabrasion wounds will be created on
      each subject's back by a licensed physician. Four of the wounds will be covered with four
      different commercially-available bandages and one wound will be left open to the air to serve
      as a no treatment control. Treatments and control will be randomized to application site.
      During this 14-day clinical study, subjects will return to the site for daily evaluations;
      study bandages will also be replaced daily by study personnel. Adverse events will be
      observed and collected by querying each subject at each visit, and during any follow-up
      period.

    <description>Wound epithelialization will be recorded daily for each wound (until healed) by the doctor on a scale of 0-5, where 0= No presence of epithelialization (no sign of healing), a bandage is necessary and 5=Wound is 100% epithelialized (healed), no bandage necessary. The median time to healing will be estimated from the survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method for each test product. Time to healing is defined as the time from wounding to 12:00 pm of the day the wound is 100% epithelialized (receives a score of 5). If the wound is not 100% epithelialized on Day 14 or on the last day of visit, Time to healing will be considered as censored.</description>

    <measure>Forced Rank Score</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The wound evaluator will rank the overall appearance of all five wounds in relation to each other on a daily basis until all five are healed on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1= Worst and 5=Best. The forced Rank was evaluated at each visit. The mean score derived as total score divided by visit number 13 was analyzed using a mixed model.</description>

    <measure>Erythema</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Until healed, erythema (redness) of each wound bed and surrounding skin will be scored daily on a scale of 0-10, where 0=None and 10=Most severe. Erythema was evaluated at each visit. The mean score derived as total score divided by visit number 13 was analyzed here using a mixed model.</description>

    <measure>Edema</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Until healed, edema (swelling) of each wound bed and surrounding skin will be scored daily on a scale of 0-10, where 0=None and 10=Most severe. Mean Edema was evaluated at each visit. The mean score derived as total score divided by visit number 13 was analyzed using a mixed model.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Maceration</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Until healed, maceration (a slight whitening of the skin around the wound compared to the surrounding unbandaged area) will be scored as P=Present or A=Absent. Percentage of maceration was derived as the maceration presence times over study period divided by visit number 13.</description>

    <measure>Subjective Assessment of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>within 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Until healed, pain assessments by the participant will be recorded daily for each wound site as either Present (P) or Absent (A). Percentage of pain was derived as the pain presence times over study period divided by visit number 13.</description>

Yes or No responses will be recorded, along with text entries of the reasons for the response. This outcome measure reports the number of subjects who report that the wound has healed.</description>

        <title>Time to Healing (Days)</title>
        <description>Wound epithelialization will be recorded daily for each wound (until healed) by the doctor on a scale of 0-5, where 0= No presence of epithelialization (no sign of healing), a bandage is necessary and 5=Wound is 100% epithelialized (healed), no bandage necessary. The median time to healing will be estimated from the survival curves using the Kaplan-Meier method for each test product. Time to healing is defined as the time from wounding to 12:00 pm of the day the wound is 100% epithelialized (receives a score of 5). If the wound is not 100% epithelialized on Day 14 or on the last day of visit, Time to healing will be considered as censored.</description>

Erythema was evaluated at each visit. The mean score derived as total score divided by visit number 13 was analyzed here using a mixed model.</description>
