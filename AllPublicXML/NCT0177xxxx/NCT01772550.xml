    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare multidetector computed tomography (CT) image quality
      following peripheral venous high pressure injection of iodinated intravenous contrast media
      between a 20 gauge (GA) fenestrated, intravenous catheter (BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™) and an 18
      GA non-fenestrated, intravenous catheter.

      In the contrast enhanced CT procedure (CECT), a machine (power injector) is used to rapidly
      deliver contrast agent to an individual's circulatory system. The contrast allows for greater
      differentiation of tissues in images of the area of interest, affording a better opportunity
      to visually assess the area and hence make a more accurate diagnosis.

      CECT often requires a high rate of contrast flow (≥ 5 mL/sec) through the IV catheter to
      provide sufficient contrast for an acceptable image. Typically an 18 GA IV catheter is
      required to achieve these high flow rates; however, often the patient does not have a vein
      that will accommodate this large size catheter. The BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter is
      designed to deliver a higher flow rate than a conventional catheter of the same gauge by
      incorporating fenestrations (small openings) near the tip of the catheter that allow fluid to
      exit the catheter in addition to that which normally exits through the main opening at the
      tip of the catheter.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study performed in adult human subjects who have been referred for a
      CECT. The study will occur during a single visit. Once consented and enrolled, subjects whose
      antecubital veins can accommodate an 18 GA IV catheter (as assessed by the Inserter or
      designee of the PI), will be randomized to receive either a conventional 18 GA IV catheter
      (reference, control) or a 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter (test). Subjects whose
      veins are not considered suitable for an 18 GA IV catheter will be placed in a non-randomized
      cohort for placement of a 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter. Subjects will receive one
      (1) catheter for the study.

      The primary objective of this study is to compare multidetector computed tomography (CT)
      image quality following peripheral venous high pressure injection of iodinated intravenous
      contrast media between a 20 GA fenestrated, intravenous catheter (BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™) and
      an 18 GA non-fenestrated, intravenous catheter. The 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter
      will be considered non-inferior to conventional 18 GA IV catheters if the 95% upper bound for
      the difference in percentage of images of acceptable quality between the images acquired
      using the 18 GA IV catheters and the 20 GA BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheters is less than
      15%.

      Study catheters will be inserted by appropriately licensed healthcare professionals
      (Inserters). Prior to enrollment, potential Inserters will be trained and qualified by the
      Sponsor on proper use of the BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheter in both an artificial hand
      model and then in human patients. Inserters will then be expected to use the test product for
      a period of two (2) weeks, in order to gain familiarity with the product. Because BD Nexiva™
      Diffusics™ IV catheters are not currently used in the Johns Hopkins Outpatient Center, the
      Sponsor will provide BD Nexiva™ Diffusics™ IV catheters for use during this training and
      familiarization period.

    <measure>Acceptable Image Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>at the time of image assessment</time_frame>
    <description>Study images were assessed by a US board-certified radiologist to determine whether the image is of acceptable quality. The radiologist was not informed of the study device used for the injection that produced the image under evaluation. Subjective image quality assessment for acceptability was determined by:
The report of the reading radiologist in the section of the report where the radiologist indicates if the image is acceptable or not. The absence of a comment in this section will be interpreted as acceptable, and,
the assessment of an independent single second reader (such as the subinvestigator or research radiologist) blinded to the reading radiologist's report and the infusion catheter type.
In the case of a non-concurrence, the Principal Investigator assessed the image and his or her assessment had final authority.</description>

        <title>Acceptable Image Quality</title>
        <description>Study images were assessed by a US board-certified radiologist to determine whether the image is of acceptable quality. The radiologist was not informed of the study device used for the injection that produced the image under evaluation. Subjective image quality assessment for acceptability was determined by:
The report of the reading radiologist in the section of the report where the radiologist indicates if the image is acceptable or not. The absence of a comment in this section will be interpreted as acceptable, and,
the assessment of an independent single second reader (such as the subinvestigator or research radiologist) blinded to the reading radiologist's report and the infusion catheter type.
In the case of a non-concurrence, the Principal Investigator assessed the image and his or her assessment had final authority.</description>

        <description>Insertion is successful when the catheter can be flushed or infused to demonstrate patency, and there is no inadvertent administration of a solution or medication into the tissue surrounding the IV catheter.
The number of participants with successfully inserted catheters after the first or second insertion attempt is reported.

          <title>Catheter Transfixation</title>
          <description>The number of subjects who experienced catheter transfixation (the IV penetrating the opposite wall of the vein) is reported. This information was collected by a clinically qualified study staff member (e.g., the Principal or sub-Investigator, or Study Coordinator) after the power injection.</description>
          <population>One subject randomized to the 18 GA conventional IV was excluded from the analysis as the required minimum flow rate could not be achieved due to IV placement. Non-randomized group analysis includes 1 subject with media extravasation with first study IV (adverse event). Subject was discontinued and not included in primary outcomes analysis.</population>

        <title>Catheter Integrity Failure</title>
        <description>Catheter integrity failure generally refers to any portion of the device breaking or malfunctioning so that its proper function is no longer assured. In this study, the most relevant catheter integrity failures to be assessed were fluid leakage, tubing rupture, or tubing separation from the hub.
The number of subjects who experienced injections with a catheter integrity failure during injection is reported. The information about the IV catheter was collected by a clinically qualified study staff member (e.g., the Principal or sub-Investigator, or Study Coordinator) after the power injection.</description>
