  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to compare the radiologist confidence level in evaluating patients
      with known breast lesions using a carbon nanotube x-ray based stationary breast tomosynthesis
      imaging device. The comparison will be made against conventional mammography acquired as a
      part of a standard clinical workup. One hundred patients who are to have a clinical surgical
      breast biopsy will be recruited for the study. A reader study will be performed to evaluate
      the ROC characteristics of the system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women at least 18 years old.

          -  Scheduled for breast biopsy of at least one breast lesion.

          -  Lesion detected on mammogram.

          -  Symptomatic by patient self-report, patient self-breast exam or clinical exam.

          -  Able to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Male. (It is uncommon for men to present for imaging and the overwhelming majority of
             findings are non-cancerous and do not lead to biopsy; male breast cancer represents
             &lt;1% of newly diagnosed breast cancer)

          -  Less than 18 years of age.

          -  Patient unable to give consent.

          -  Institutionalized subject (prisoner or nursing home patient).

          -  Any woman who is pregnant or has reason to believe she is pregnant or any woman who is
             lactating
