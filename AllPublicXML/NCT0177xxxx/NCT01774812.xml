  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in treatment of conventional cardiovascular risk factors, patients with
      kidney disease remain at high risk for fatal cardiac events. To date, kidney disease affects
      approximately 2 million Canadians; however, this patient population remains grossly
      understudied due to the complex nature of the disease. The inadequacy of the literature to
      address the cardiovascular-related mortality rates in those with kidney disease reflects the
      urgent need for investigation of novel risk factors.

      One cardiovascular risk factor which has recently been validated is the clinical measurement
      of cardiac autonomic tone (CAT). CAT refers to the amount of activity contributed by the
      stimulatory and inhibitory limbs of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, which work in
      concert with one another to control heart rate. CAT can be quantified computer analysis of
      heart rate over time, captured by a simple Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. Abnormal
      CAT, which occurs when the autonomic system does not control heart rate properly in response
      to physical demands or stress, is associated with risk of adverse cardiovascular events in
      both healthy and high risk populations. It has recently been shown that patients with severe
      kidney disease demonstrate significant CAT abnormalities, thus exaggerated susceptibility to
      cardiac death.

      Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is also common in this patient population due to the fact that the
      kidney plays a crucial role in VD metabolism. Given that VD deficiency is an established
      cardiovascular risk factor on its own, it is possible that kidney disease patients
      experienced compounded risk due to the combination of VD deficiency and abnormal CAT.
      However, no study has ever investigated whether VD deficiency influences CAT in healthy or
      diseased populations. To our knowledge, this will be the first trial to ever examine the
      effect, if any, of different VD supplementation treatments (standard of care vs. combination)
      on CAT in a population burdened with overwhelming risk and incidence of cardiovascular and
      sudden cardiac death risk.
