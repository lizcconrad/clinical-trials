      We will utilize the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group (CINRG) network to
      collect and store tissue and blood from patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with
      specific genetic mutations within the dystrophin gene that could be treated by antisense
      oligonucleotide (AO) drugs.

      The purpose of this tissue bank is to collect blood and skin samples from participants who
      are diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and carry one of nine specific changes
      in the dystrophin gene. The specific dystrophin changes that we are interested in studying
      are those that would work with exon-skipping therapies in patients with DMD, specifically
      deletions of the follow exons: 10-52, 13-50, 29-50, 43-52, 44, 43-50, 45-50, 45-52, 46,
      46-47, 46-48, 46-49, 46-51, 46-53, 46-55, 46-60, 47-50, 47-52, 48-50, 49-50, 50, 52, 52-63,
      48-52, 49-52, 50-52.

      These blood and skin samples will be held in a tissue bank at Carolinas Medical Center for
      future DMD research.

        Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by mutations in
        the dystrophin gene. DMD participants over 4 years of age with known mutations that could
        be targeted by exon skipping therapies will be recruited for this study.
