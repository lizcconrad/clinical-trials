      The purpose of the study is to understand why there are differences between individuals in
      the way they respond to paclitaxel chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While paclitaxel is very effective in killing cancer cells in a proportion of patients, some
      patients don't respond to this treatment. As with any chemotherapy, paclitaxel is associated
      with unpleasant side effects. We are doing this study to try and understand what is happening
      in cancer cells in different individuals after paclitaxel treatment that make them respond
      differently to the same treatment. We hope that this study will enable us to develop a method
      to identify women who are suitable for this form of treatment. We also want to understand why
      some cancer cells don't get killed with paclitaxel. This information will help us to select
      treatment to suit an individual patient, and thus improve the outcome of treatment and avoid
      giving treatment that will not benefit the patient.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female ≥ 18 years of age

          -  Newly diagnosed and histology confirmed primary high grade serous ovarian cancer, high
             grade serous fallopian tube cancer and primary peritoneal carcinoma.

          -  Radiological and laparoscopic confirmation of FIGO stage 3C or 4 ovarian cancer.

          -  Radiological evidence of omental or peritoneal deposits that are accessible for
             radiology-guided biopsy.

          -  At least one lesion on CT scan measuring at least 2 cm in maximum diameter performed
             in the past 31 days. Slightly older scans may be accepted at the discretion of the CI
             providing the results are considered to remain clinically relevant.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-2

          -  Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          -  The patient is willing and able to provide written informed consent and comply with
             the protocol for the duration of the study, and scheduled visits and examinations.

          -  Acceptable haematological and biochemical indices
