      This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150㎍ o.d.) in patients
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are few clinical studies in patients with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis
      because tuberculosis patients are usually excluded from (phase II or III) clinical trials for
      drug registration although they are not prohibited from prescription of COPD drugs.

      This clinical study will assess efficacy and safety of indacaterol (150㎍ o.d.) in patients
      with COPD with destroyed lung by tuberculosis.

    <measure>Trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second Change</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Spirometry was conducted according to internationally accepted standards. Trough FEV1 was defined as the average of the 23 hour 10 minute and 23 hour 45 minute post-dose FEV1 readings. Mixed model used baseline FEV1, FEV1 prior to and 10-15 minutes post inhalation of albuterol, and FEV1 prior to and 1 hour post inhalation of ipratropium as covariate</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) Change After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ-C contains 14 questions divided into two components. Part 1 produces &quot;Symptoms&quot; scores and Part 2 &quot;Activity&quot; and &quot;Impacts&quot; scores. 14 questions which are divided in three domains: &quot;symptom&quot; (question 1-7), &quot;activity&quot; (question 9, 12) and &quot;impact&quot; (question 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14). The total score is 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating greater impairment of health status. Mixed model used baseline SGRQ, FEV1 prior to and 10-15 minutes post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol, FEV1 prior to and 1 hour post inhalation of ipratropium, and inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline as covariates.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) After 8 Weeks of Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9 with a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A 1 unit difference in the TDI focal score is clinically significant. Mixed model used baseline dyspnoea index, FEV1 prior to and 10-15 minutes post inhalation of albuterol, and FEV1 prior to 1 hour post inhalation of ipratropium as covariates.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of COPD Exacerbation</measure>
    <time_frame>8 week</time_frame>
    <description>Number of COPD exacerbation during 8-week treatment. COPD exacerbations are defined as a new onset or worsening of at least one respiratory symptom (i.e. dyspnea, cough, sputum purulence or volume, or wheeze) present for at least 3 consecutive days, documented change or increase in COPD-related treatment due to worsening symptoms or documented COPD-related hospitalizations or emergency room visits.</description>

        <title>St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) Change After 8 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>The SGRQ-C contains 14 questions divided into two components. Part 1 produces “Symptoms” scores and Part 2 “Activity” and “Impacts” scores. 14 questions which are divided in three domains: “symptom” (question 1-7), “activity” (question 9, 12) and “impact” (question 8, 10, 11, 13 and 14). The total score is 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating greater impairment of health status. Mixed model used baseline SGRQ, FEV1 prior to and 10-15 minutes post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol, FEV1 prior to and 1 hour post inhalation of ipratropium, and inhaled corticosteroid use at baseline as covariates.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) After 8 Weeks of Treatment</title>
        <description>TDI focal score is based on three domains: functional impairment, magnitude of task and magnitude of effort. Each domain is scored from -3 (major deterioration) to 3 (major improvement) to give an overall TDI focal score of -9 to 9 with a negative score indicating a deterioration from baseline. A 1 unit difference in the TDI focal score is clinically significant. Mixed model used baseline dyspnoea index, FEV1 prior to and 10-15 minutes post inhalation of albuterol, and FEV1 prior to 1 hour post inhalation of ipratropium as covariates.</description>
