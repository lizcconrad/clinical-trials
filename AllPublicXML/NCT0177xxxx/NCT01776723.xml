  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if treating Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML)
      with a study drug [ruxolitinib] can improve outcomes of patients with CMML. The first step of
      the study is to learn the dose of ruxolitinib that is tolerable (bearable). It has already
      been studied in a number of patients with different bone marrow diseases and is approved for
      the treatment of a disease called Myelofibrosis; however, it is not approved for treatment of
      CMML. It is given orally (by mouth). Most people tolerate it well but the tolerability has
      not been determined in patients with CMML. We will be testing different doses to determine
      how much of the medication people can tolerate (bear) before they develop side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, two-stage, sequential cohort dose escalation study. If dose escalation
      is completed as planned, no more than 53 subjects are expected to enroll onto this study at a
      rate of approximately 3 subjects every month. For the Phase 2 study the Simon's optimal
      two-stage design will be employed to test the null hypothesis that response rate (RR) equals
      to 10% versus the alternative that RR equals to 30%.

      Demographic and clinical variables for the study patients will be summarized using
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range, range, and
      frequency counts and percentages). Safety and efficacy data will be analyzed overall as well
      as separately for each dose cohort when appropriate.

    <time_frame>17 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Phase I - The MTD is defined as the highest dose where less than 33% of participants experience a drug related predefined dose limited toxicity (DLT). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as any grade 4 hematologic toxicity and any grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity except nausea that is controlled by antiemetic therapy based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. Grade 3 metabolic/electrolyte abnormalities that are not clinically significant, and are adequately controlled within 72 hours are not to be considered a DLT.</description>

          -  Must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form

          -  Must have a life expectancy of greater than 3 months at time of screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Platelet count of less than 35,000/uL

          -  Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) of less than 250/uL

          -  Use of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, or experimental agents (agents that are not
             commercially available) for the treatment of CMML within 28 days of the first day of
             study drug treatment

          -  Any serious medical condition or psychiatric illness that will prevent the subject
             from signing the informed consent form or will place the subject at unacceptable risk
             if he/she participates in the study

          -  Concurrent use of Granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
             Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) could be used for the short-term
             management of neutropenic infection. Stable doses of erythropoietin stimulating agents
             that were started &gt;8 weeks from first ruxolitinib dose or corticosteroids that were
             being administered prior to screening are allowed.

          -  Uncontrolled current illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac

             study requirements

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ruxolitinib has not been studied
             in pregnant subjects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with ruxolitinib,
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with ruxolitinib.

          -  Patients who have participated in other interventional (treatment-related) clinical
             trials within 30 days of enrollment are excluded.
