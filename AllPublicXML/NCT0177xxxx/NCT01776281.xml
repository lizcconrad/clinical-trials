  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      - Hypothermia, infections ,and ineffective breastfeeding are some of the commonest causes of
      deaths among premature and low birth weight LBW infants. Even if the infants are born in
      facilities, incidences of cold stress are possible due to insufficient resources, space and
      incompetent practices to manage hypothermia in the immediate postnatal period. Kangaroo
      Mother Care is a well-known intervention to address the issues related to preterm births,
      such as hypothermia, infection and prolong hospitalization.Besides significant outcome of KMC
      interventions for preterm infants, no interventional study has been found in literature in
      Pakistani context. Looking at the potential benefits of KMC in reducing the related
      complications of prematurity, the study aims to identify the effectiveness of KMC among
      preterm and LBW infants born in secondary hospital of Aga khan University hospitals.

      Hypothesis I Ha: KMC is effective in reducing the incidences of hypothermia among preterm and
      LBW infants as compared to the usual care.

      Hypothesis II Ha: There is a difference in breastfeeding behavior and breastfeeding outcome
      among experimental and control group.

      Secondary Hypothesis Hypothesis I Ha: There is an association between KMC and frequency of
      suspected infections during hospitalization.

      Hypothesis II Ha: There is a difference in length of stay among experimental group and
      control group.

      Hypothesis III Ha: There is a relationship between KMC and weight gain of infants till four
      weeks.

      Hypothesis IV Ha: There is difference in rate of hypothermia among experimental group and
      control after discharge from hospital.
