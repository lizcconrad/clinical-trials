  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although DIPG is not curable, re-irradiation with a modest total dose and short treatment
      time provides good palliation of symptoms, improves quality of life, delays disease
      progression and has minimal and manageable toxicity.

      Treatment plan:

      At progression, full radiological and clinical documentation necessary including a
      neurological exam by a neurologist will be done. Progressive patients will be referred to
      radiotherapy.

      Radiation guidelines:

      30.6 Gray (Gy) will be applied in 1.8 to 2Gy fractions in conformal radiation to tumor bed.
      Radiation will be done in standard accelerators and according to standard guidelines used in
      treatment for all brain tumor patients.

    <description>clinical progression: close follow up including biweekly neurological assessments to evaluate for clinical progression. any onset of a new neurological deficit or deterioration of an existing deficit will require follow up within one week. persistent deficit will be considered clinical progression.
progression on imaging: MRI will be done every 3 months. tumor growth of &gt;25% will be considered disease progression</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age:1 year-22 years

          2. Patient/parent consent

          3. Diagnosis of DIPG based on short classic history, clinical signs (long tract signs,
             cranial nerve deficits and ataxia) and classic MRI features (more than 2/3 of the
             tumor is located within the pons and tumor encompasses more than 60% of the pons)

          4. A patient will be eligible for reirradiation if progression is diagnosed following a
             period of at least 4 months of stable disease after first irradiation.

          5. Progression may be either clinical (new neurological deficit or worsening of an old
             deficit in two separate physical examinations) or radiological (tumor growth of &gt;25%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Radiation necrosis post first irradiation

          2. Unstable vital signs

          3. Less than X months since previous irradiation
