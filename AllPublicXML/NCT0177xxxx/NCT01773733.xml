      Secondary objectives:

        -  to study the structure of the population of patients with the diet induced obesity with
           body mass index (BMI) 30 kg/m2 or diet induced obesity with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 associated
           with type 2 diabetes mellitus in respect of comorbidities and concomitant treatment to
           determine the areas for further investigations.

        -  to introduce the elements of control of adverse cardiovascular risks into the routine
           clinical practice: questionnaire concerning enrollment criteria for Reduxine treatment
           initiation, algorithm of Reduxine administration and treatment efficacy and safety
           monitoring (assessment schedule).

        -  to assess the effects of the treatment of overweight and obesity with Reduxine on
           patients' quality of life parameters.

      The Time Frame: the follow up of the study patients will be performed during six month to one
      year. Exception - premature discontinuation from the study.

      The scheduled visits of the patients to the investigational centres are: Week0 (inclusion of
      the patient), Week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36 and Week 48.
