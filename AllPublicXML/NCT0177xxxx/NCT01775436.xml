    <textblock>
      Our goal is to advance palliative care with persons living with AIDS (PLWA) or life-limiting
      co-morbidities to decrease suffering and increase quality of life (QOL). Left without advance
      care planning (ACP) for end-of-life decision, miscommunication and disagreements may result
      in families being charged with neglect or court battles over treatment choices, unmet care or
      delivery of unnecessary or unwanted care, and non-relative caregivers being dismissed (e.g.
      gay partners). We hope to increase families' understandings of their family member's wishes
      for end-of-life care to decrease conflict through the FAmily-CEntered Advance (FACE) Care
      Planning intervention. We will also study communication, quality of life, and spiritual
      struggle. Families will be randomized into either the Control (N=96 families) or the FACE
      Intervention (n=192 dyads). FACE families will meet with a trained/certified researcher for
      two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1: The Respecting Choices
      Interview®; and Session 2: Completion of The Five Wishes©. Control families will also meet
      with a researcher for two 60-minute sessions scheduled one week apart: Session 1:
      Developmental History; and Session 2: Nutrition and Exercise. Questionnaires will be
      administered five times, Baseline and at 3, 6, 12 and 18 month post-intervention, for an
      average of 2 years.

      AIM 1. To determine the efficacy of FACE on congruence in treatment preferences between PLWA
      and their surrogates over time, and the effect of the pattern of congruence development
      trajectory on healthcare utilization (i.e., distal outcomes: number of hospitalizations,
      dialysis, ER visits).

      Hypothesis A: Development of congruence may not be homogeneous and FACE may influence the
      pattern of congruence development.

      Hypothesis B: Different patterns of congruence development may have different effects on
      health care utilization.

      Hypothesis C: Compared to Controls, FACE participants will better maintain congruence over
      time.

      AIM 2. To determine the efficacy of FACE on key components of QOL for PLWA. Hypothesis: FACE
      participants will increase or better maintain psychosocial QOL compared to Controls.

      AIM 3. To minimize health disparities in ACP between Blacks and non Blacks and identify
      factors associated with disparities.

      Hypothesis: Blacks in the FACE intervention will complete advance directives at a rate
      comparable to non Blacks, and at significantly greater rates compared to Controls.

      Our goal is to advance palliative care with persons living with AIDS (PLWA) or life-limiting
      co-morbidities aimed at relieving suffering and maximizing quality of life. One objective is
      to identify variables which influence decision-making with respect to advance care planning
      (ACP) for PLWA, as well as to determine the unique person-centered needs of subgroups of
      PLWA, as these are unknown. The negative consequences of no ACP or poor ACP include: unmet
      care or delivery of unnecessary or unwanted care, conflict erupting in the ICU, or the
      importance of non-relative caregivers being dismissed, for example gay partners. A second
      objective is to identify a &quot;best approach&quot; for standard of care in ACP, a key component of
      palliative care, as an end of life support. This approach may minimize health disparities in
      the likelihood of both identifying a surrogate decision-maker and using advance directives.
      We propose building on our evidence based, theoretical model, FAmily-CEntered (FACE) Advance
      Care Planning intervention, an HIV specific ACP program for Black teens which gained
      acceptance and demonstrated efficacy through increased congruence in treatment preferences
      and universal complete of advance directives with a surrogate decision-maker. Given the
      demonstrated needs and benefits of ACP and the low utilization among adult Black PLWA, we
      propose meeting this need by building on our FACE model with adults living with advanced AIDS
      and/or life-limiting co-morbidities in Washington, District of Columbia (DC) a city with
      endemic HIV and significant health disparities in death rates by race in an
      adequately-powered, randomized, clinical, 2-arm, single-blinded, controlled trial. We will
      test the efficacy of the FACE intervention for increasing congruence in end-of-life treatment
      preferences between PLWA and their surrogate decision-maker, to determine if increased
      congruence can be maintained over time. We will also determine if FACE is acceptable to
      primarily Black inner city adult PLWA. We will recruit from four hospital-based clinics and
      randomize 288 patient/surrogate dyads (N=576 subjects) in a 2:1 ratio to either FACE
      Intervention (N=192 dyads) or Control (N=96 dyads). Participants with HIV dementia,
      suicidality, homicidality or psychosis will be excluded. Two 60-minuted sessions will be
      conducted with a trained/certified facilitator at weekly intervals: FACE Session 1: The
      Respecting Choices Interview (R); Session 2: Completion of The Five Wishes (c). Control will
      also be administered in a dyadic format: Session 1: Developmental History; Session 2:
      Nutrition and Exercise. Standardized self-report measures will be administered at baseline, 3
      month post-intervention 6 month post-intervention, 12 month post-intervention, and 18 month
      post-intervention. Thus, participants will be followed for an average of 2 years. This will
      be the first study to test an ACP model, integrating person-centered (GMM) and
      variable-centered analysis (GEE) to assess study outcomes.

    <measure>Threat Appraisal Scale (TAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 18 month post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Threat Appraisal Scale (TAS)is a questionnaire administered to the adolescent during baseline assessment only. This measure will retrospectively estimate the adolescent's threat appraisal of cancer when adolescent learned of cancer diagnosis. Test-retest reliability for this measure ranges from .68 in younger children to .93 in older children. TAS scores are found to demonstrate a high degree of agreement with children's open-ended descriptions of negative life events, indicating adequate convergent validity of this measure. Theoretically, threat appraisal is related to Lazarus' concept of primary appraisal, particularly to the way in which the event threatens the child's commitments, goals, or values. Higher threat appraisals should lead to negative arousal and coping and to increased psychological symptoms.</description>
