    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized single arm feasibility trial of the
      Wolverine OCT guided atherectomy system.The trial will enroll up to 50 subjects diagnosed
      with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities.The primary disease must be located
      in reference vessel diameters ≥ 2.5 mm which is significant enough to cause moderate to
      severe symptoms and warrant vascular intervention.

         21. Any thrombolytic therapy within 2 weeks of the index procedure.

         22. Any clinical and/or angiographic complication attributed to the use of another device
