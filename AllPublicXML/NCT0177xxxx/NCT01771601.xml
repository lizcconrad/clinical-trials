  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regional tissue oxygenation (cStO2) can be monitored by near infrared spectroscopy. The
      commercial device INVOS 5100 (COVIDIEN, Mansfield, MA, USA) and the prototype OxyPrem vs. 1.2
      (Biomedical Optics Research Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland) will be used simultaneously to
      test for their relative sensitivity for low oxygen levels just after birth on term infants
      born by elective caesarean section. Reproducibility will be examined by replacements of the
      sensors six times the next day when the infant is stable and quiet. The Adult Somasensor
      (INVOS) will be used together with the OxyPrem sensor.
