  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal disruption is the inappropriate alteration of the hormonal system by chemical
      substances that are present in our environment. Some chemical substances are capable of
      replicating, enhancing or reducing the production, release, transport or action of natural
      hormones. Therefore, they are called hormonal or endocrine disrupters. Some 'classic'
      endocrine disrupters such as pesticides and dioxins are considered responsible for
      infertility, cancer and thyroid problems. Recently, a number of additional chemical
      substances were stipulated to have endocrine disrupting capabilities. The industrial
      production of these substances in large quantities has led to an accumulation in our
      environment and thus possible negative consequences on human health.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the rol of these chemical substances in the occurence
      of overweight and obesity.
