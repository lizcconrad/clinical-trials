    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the Cardiox Flow
      Detection System (FDS) in identifying an intracardiac right-to-left shunt (RLS) compared to
      the results of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).

      RLS intracardiac shunts are associated with a number of clinically important syndromes
      including paradoxical thromboembolism (causing stroke or other systemic infarct), migraine
      headaches (particularly with aura), desaturation with obstructive sleep apnea, and
      decompression illness. From a research perspective, the detection of shunts in subjects with
      these types of syndromes is critical in helping to define the role of RLS in these disease
      processes. From a clinical perspective, shunt detection will be increasingly important in an
      era where interventional procedures for repairing cardiac defects are available for subjects
      determined to be at risk.

      The currently accepted reference standard for detection of an intra-cardiac patent foramen
      ovale/atrial septal defect (PFO/ASD) RLS is a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), a
      procedure that is invasive, uncomfortable, and requires conscious sedation.

      Alternative options include transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with injection of agitated
      saline (with and without Valsalva strain), a procedure that is far less sensitive than TEE
      due to the echocardiography imaging limitations seen in many adults.

      Finally, transcranial Doppler (TCD) with injection of agitated saline (with and without
      Valsalva strain) is a newer entrant into this arena that does not require sedation or any
      invasive instrumentation.

      The Cardiox Model 100 FDS utilizes an optical sensor positioned on the surface of the
      subject's skin at the scaphoid fossa of the ear. Next, a predetermined dose of an indicator
      dye, indocyanine green (ICG), is injected at a predetermined rate into a peripheral
      antecubital vein of the subject while the subject performs a breathing maneuver called a
      Valsalva maneuver. The exhalation by the subject into a mouthpiece connected to a pressure
      transducer via a flexible tubing extension, or its equivalent (ie, performing the Valsalva
      maneuver), is an essential step for all existing RLS detection methods. The Valsalva maneuver
      by the subject creates a pressure differential between the right and left sides of the heart.
      This Valsalva maneuver results in blood flow from the right side of the heart to the left
      side of the heart through an ASD, and/or causes a PFO, if present, to open, also allowing
      blood to flow directly from the right side to the left side of the heart without passing
      through the lungs (pulmonary vasculature) for oxygenation.

      The Earpads, including their fluorescence sensor arrays (FSA), are used to measure the
      relative concentration (ie, fluorescence signal level) of ICG dye in the bloodstream as a
      function of time. If a premature inflection or peak occurs in the ICG dye concentration level
      at a time point prior to the rise and fall of the concentration associated with the main
      bolus of indicator, then a RLS is present in the heart. The amplitude of this premature ICG
      dye-dilution curve (referred to as &quot;RLS-indicator dilution curve&quot;) is used to subsequently
      quantify the magnitude of the right-to-left shunt by ratiometrically comparing the amplitude
      of this RLS indicator dilution curve to the amplitude of the main indicator dilution curve
      associated with that portion of the injected ICG dye that follows the normal pathway from the
      right side of the heart, through the lungs, and into the left side of the heart (referred to
      as &quot;normal indicator dilution curve&quot;).
