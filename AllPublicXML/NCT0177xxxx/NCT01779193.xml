      B streptococcal infection and the major cause of death before and after the baby is born. B
      streptococcus infection the way of the newborn, usually infection from the mother in
      childbirth, if the pregnant women during pregnancy early diagnosis B streptococcus infection,
      it can be effective in preventing the risk of neonatal infection. Department of Health in
      China has been since April 15, 2012, the Scholarship holder at all pregnant women in the
      35-37 weeks of pregnancy comprehensive B streptococcus screening. Infection B Streptococcus
      pregnant women in the labor process, the use of prophylactic antibiotics can be effective in
      reducing neonatal B streptococcus infection, but the possibility of the fetus being infected
      for the condition of premature birth or early rupture of membranes are still unable to fully
      hedge. In this study, the 35 to 37 weeks gestation examination confirmed infected B
      Streptococcus pregnant women, oral lactobacillus capsules B streptococcus infection treatment
      efficacy and safety assessment of clinical research. To assess whether oral administration of
      lactic acid bacteria will affect vaginitis incidence.

      Deeply influenced of bacterial vaginosis infection during pregnancy for pregnant women and
      fetus during childbirth, in which Group B Streptococcus agalactiae(GBS) is generally about
      30% of pregnant women will be infected, about 1% vertical and infect the fetus, babies are
      not infected about 50% of the mortality rate in the treatment status, is considered an
      important reason for infection and death before and after the baby is born. Vertically in the
      natural childbirth process and infect the fetus, the delay in treatment on the fetus often
      lead to serious complications, including sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis, a serious will to
      cause death and permanent neurological sequelae, if given to confirm the diagnosis antibiotic
      treatment of pregnant women, the probability of infection of the newborn B streptococcus can
      be reduced by 75%. U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that pregnant women 35 to 37
      weeks gestation or less than 37 weeks preterm contractions or rupture of membranes. B
      streptococcus check preterm doubts should pregnant women in the labor process and the use of
      preventive antibiotics can be effective in reducing neonatal B streptococcus infection, but
      the condition of premature birth or early rupture of membranes can not fully prevent the
      possibility of the fetus being infected is still in pre-production will not make any
      disposal, can cause infection of B The streptococci pregnant women worry, and under great
      pressure. This study for 35 to 37 weeks gestation to check to confirm infection of B
      Streptococcus pregnant women, pregnant women infected with the clinical studies of treatment
      efficacy and safety assessment of B streptococcus before delivery to the oral administration
      of lactic acid bacteria. The trial is expected during the execution in June 2012 to July
      2015, subjects the number is expected to included at least 120 pregnant women choose not to
      subjects according to the conventional injection of prophylactic antibiotics in the labor
      process, choose to take oral lactobacillus oral lactobacillus of pregnant women in accordance
      with the 1:1 double-blind randomized to three groups, one of the following: test group A:
      oral lactobacillus capsules (dose of 2 x 109 cfu / capsule), experimental group B: oral
      without functional lactobacillus capsules and the control group: oral administration does not
      contain the active ingredient (lactic acid bacteria and cranberry) capsules before oral
      administration of lactic acid bacteria and the delivery process, collecting samples of
      vaginal anal secretions, whether positive addition to the screening B streptococcus, and the
      other selective medium coated plate culture for vaginal odor, itching number of the pathogen
      and B Streptococcus quantitative analysis and assessment questionnaire.
