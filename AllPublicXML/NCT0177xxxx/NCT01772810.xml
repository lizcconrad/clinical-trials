    <textblock>
      Phase I, open-label, single-site, safety study of HSSC transplantation for the treatment of
      chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Group A enrolled 4 subjects with a cord injury at T2-T12;
      Group B will enroll 4 subjects with a C5-C7 cord injury. Study period will be 6 months
      post-operative. Post-study, subjects will be followed for an additional 54 months.

                  Medicine and Rehabilitation doctor or other SCI Medicine board certified
                  physician based on a complete ISNC SCI examination

               6. Neurologic level of injury:

                    1. Group A: injury within cord segments T2-T12;

                    2. Group B: injury within cord segments C5-C7
