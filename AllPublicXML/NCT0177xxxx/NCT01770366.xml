  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity affects over one-third of the US population, and is associated with serious medical
      problems like diabetes and heart disease. Weight loss surgery is the most effective treatment
      for obesity, but some weight loss surgery patients lose less weight than others, and some
      patients regain the weight they lost. Researchers have found that support groups help
      post-surgical patients lose more weight, but long-term support programs often aren't
      available or are difficult for patients to get to. Physical activity is also important for
      weight loss surgery patients, but most post-surgical support programs don't focus on helping
      patients exercise. Our pilot study will test an Internet-based weight loss surgery support
      program that patients can use from home, and will include new devices such as wireless weight
      scales and wireless pedometers to help patients track their weight loss and physical activity
      and share their progress with their clinicians over the Internet. If successful, our support
      intervention will help more patients successfully lose weight after surgery, and therefore
      will improve their long-term health.

      For the proposed pilot study, a primary objective will be to determine the usability of and
      satisfaction with a virtual weight loss support program incorporating home-based
      goal-tracking technology (e.g., home weighing, activity monitoring). FitLinxx, Inc. has been
      selected to partner in the proposed research as they offer a weight scale (ActiScaleTM) and
      activity monitor (PebbleTM) that can transmit collected data to a secure patient portal
      website (ActiHealth.com) via state-of-the-art wireless data transmission technology. In
      addition to viewing their device data on this patient portal website, program participants
      will be able to communicate as desired with other weight loss surgery patients though a chat
      room feature on the patient portal website, and will also be invited to participate in
      activity and weight loss challenges on the website (e.g., weekly step count challenges,
      weekly percent excess weight loss challenges). E-mail will be used as a means of virtual
      social exchange between patients and providers, as opposed to the synchronous, face-to-face
      support groups at the hospital. The virtual patient support program and goal-tracking
      technology described above provide a novel, scalable and cost effective model of patient
      support that is associated with minimal patient burden.

      This will be a four-month pilot study of the virtual patient support program described above
      and will enroll a total of 24 pre-surgical patients recruited from the Weight Loss Surgery
      (WLS) program at Baystate Medical Center (BMC) who are scheduled to have weight loss surgery
      within four to six weeks of enrollment. The final target sample size is 18, which reflects a
      goal of six patients of each surgical type (e.g., roux-en-Y gastric bypass [RNY],
      laparoscopic gastric banding [LGB], laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy [LSG]), with three in
      each group randomized to receive the intervention and three randomized to the control group.
      Eligible patients must have a computer with Internet access in their home (to transmit device
      data and view the patient portal website), and must weigh less than 420 pounds at baseline
      (due to the 440-pound limit of our weight scale and to allow for some weight gain between the
      baseline research visit and the date of surgery). The sample size and recruitment period are
      feasible given the approximately 400 patients having weight loss surgery at Baystate every
      year (estimate based on figures from 2006-2010).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Baystate Medical Center Weight Loss Surgery Program patient scheduled to have weight
             loss surgery during the recruitment period

          -  â‰¥18 years old (weight loss surgery patients younger than 18 years of age represent a
             unique population, such that an intervention geared towards adult patients would not
             be appropriate for this younger population)

          -  English-speaking (research staff are English-speaking only, and we do not have funding
             available to hire interpreters or bilingual staff)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Anyone judged not medically fit to participate in the study (e.g., severe medical or
             psychiatric problems), as per the physician's clinical judgment (by direct physician
             query)

          -  Patients planning to relocate from the area within the next six months (i.e., during
             study timeframe)

          -  Patients currently participating in another research study (due to patient burden and
             the potential for reduced protocol adherence associated with participation in multiple
             studies)

          -  Patients weighing over 420 pounds at baseline (due to the weight range on the wireless
             weight scale, and to allow for some weight gain between the baseline research visit
             and the date of surgery)

          -  Patients who do not have a computer with an internet connection in their home (due to
             the web-based nature of this virtual support program and the need to have the USB
             antenna set up in the patient's home to collect weight data)
