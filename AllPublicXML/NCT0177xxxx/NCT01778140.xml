      The investigators hypothesize that a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed with
      &quot;Patient-Specific&quot; reminders yields superior performance than that with
      &quot;Non-patient-specific&quot; reminders in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.

      We hypothesize that a clinical decision support system (CDSS) designed with
      &quot;Patient-specific&quot; reminders yields superior performance than that with
      &quot;Non-patient-specific&quot; reminders in preventing contrast-induced nephropathy.

      A 3-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed by cluster randomization using
      physicians as the unit of allocation. Physicians in 3 university medical centers will be
      randomly assigned into 1) patient-specific arm with Anti
      Contrast-Induced-Nephropathy(Anti-CIN) reminder, 2) non-patient-specific reminder arm, and 3)
      the control arm without any reminders, respectively.

      The patient-specific alert, Anti-CIN system, is designed as a real-time CDSS implementation
      on CPOE for monitoring physician's contrast-enhanced CT and IVP orders. Computerized pop-up
      reminders provide the patient-specific encounters with optimal decision options when patients
      are at a high CIN risk or patients with unknown risk factors are encountered.
      Non-patient-specific reminders always pop up no matter whether the patient is at a high risk
      or not.

    <description>Intervention: Patient-specific computerized reminder. The physicians assigned to this arm will use the patient-specific CDSS on CPOE. The patient-specific reminder is designed as a real-time CDSS implemented on CPOE to monitor physician's contrast-enhanced image study orders. Computerized pop-up reminders provide the patient-specific CIN risk profile and optimal decision options which are generated when patients with high risk or with unknown risk of CIN are encountered.</description>

    <description>Intervention: Non-patient-specific Computerized reminder. The physicians assigned to this arm will use the Non-patient-specific reminders through CPOE.
