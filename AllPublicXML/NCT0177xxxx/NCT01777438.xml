      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is defined as inflammation of the nasal mucosa after exposition to an
      allergen in sensitized patients. AR causes not only nasal symptoms such as sneezing, itchy
      nose, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, but also has a significant impact on quality of life.
      Symptom control and overall satisfaction in patients undergoing subcutaneous immunotherapy
      (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on the long term has not yet been investigated so
      far.

    <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for TNS experienced during the last 4 weeks. Visual analog scales (VAS) have been used to rate the presence of symptoms or impairment of the daily activities. Patients had to answer each question by indicating a position with a vertical line between two endpoints, 0 cm for not bothersome versus 10 cm for extremely bothersome. In this way each question is scored between 0 and 10 points.</description>

    <description>Based on the proposed cut-off value of VAS &lt; 5/10 for total nasal symptoms (TNS), rhinitis was considered as being controlled in 69 IT patients (84%) versus 223 (63%) non-IT patients</description>

    <description>ARIA classification of AR is made by duration and severity of AR symptoms. Here are calculated the number of patients having mild acute rhinitis.
Clinical practice guidelines such as the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) document focus on the quality of life as a principal consideration in assessment and treatment of AR</description>

        <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for TNS experienced during the last 4 weeks. Visual analog scales (VAS) have been used to rate the presence of symptoms or impairment of the daily activities. Patients had to answer each question by indicating a position with a vertical line between two endpoints, 0 cm for not bothersome versus 10 cm for extremely bothersome. In this way each question is scored between 0 and 10 points.</description>
