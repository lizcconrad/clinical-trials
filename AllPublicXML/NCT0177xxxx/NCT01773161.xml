  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy are at an increased risk of having their hips move partially or
      completely out of joint. This can cause pain and restrict movement at the hip, making sitting
      in a wheelchair uncomfortable and make personal care difficult. This condition may be treated
      with surgery. Surgeons use x-rays taken before and after the surgery to determine whether or
      not the surgery has been successful. However, it is also important to know whether the
      surgery has improved life from the child or the caregiver's point of view. The investigators
      will also evaluate if waiting for surgery affects the child. This information will be added
      to results from a physical exam and an evaluation of the child's x-rays for a more complete
      picture of how this surgery impacts the lives of our patients. It is predicted that that the
      health-related quality of life of children with cerebral palsy will improve following
      surgery.

      HRQoL will be measured using the Child Health Index of Life with Disabilities (CPCHILD). Our
      specific hypothesis is that health related quality of life, as measured by the CPCHILD will
      change by at least a mean of 10 points from pre- to post-surgery.
