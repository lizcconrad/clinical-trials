  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ensuring that all children are fully immunized against vaccine-preventable diseases is a
      critical public health issue. Child care programs are critical targets for efforts to
      increase the proportion of infants and young children who are fully immunized. The primary
      objective of this proposal is to rigorously examine current state, local government, and
      child care providers' efforts and barriers to ensuring that all enrolled children are
      up-to-date for required immunizations and to evaluate strategies to improve immunization
      coverage in child care programs.

  <detailed_description>

      Specific Aim 1 will describe Utah state and local government activities to ensure compliance
      of child care programs with state immunization requirements and identify government's
      barriers to ensuring compliance.

      Specific Aim 2 will describe child care program staffs' knowledge, attitudes, and activities
      related to ensuring that all children are up-to-date for required immunizations and identify
      program barriers to ensuring up-to-date status.

      Specific Aim 3 will evaluate at least 3 strategies to ensure that all children enrolled in
      child care programs are up-to-date for required immunizations. Aims 1 and 2 will guide the
      design of these strategies. Specific strategies proposed for Aim 3 are to: 1) design and
      pilot test an intervention to increase child care program use of the Utah State Immunization
      Information System (USIIS), 2) design an online immunization education module and conduct a
      pilot randomized controlled trial to determine whether use of the module changes child care
      providers' knowledge, attitudes, and activities and increases the proportion of children who
      are up-to-date for required immunizations; and 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial
      to determine whether a quality improvement intervention implemented in child care programs
      increases the proportion of children who are up-to-date for required immunizations.
