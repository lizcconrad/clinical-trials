  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The remarkable improvement in survival of children with congenital disease has led to a
      continuously growing number of adults with congenital heart disease in the developed world.
      Many of these patients had had cardiac surgery at early age, the may live for many years with
      pressure overload, volume overload, systolic or diastolic dysfunction, cyanosis or any
      combination of the above. These past and ongoing cardiac insults often result in significant
      cardiac remodeling. A biomarker for fibrosis and remodeling may have enormous clinical and
      prognostic value for these patients.

      Serum biomarkers are now integrated in many fields in medicine. In cardiology, a number of
      biomarkers are used. In the last decade, our group has focused on the natriuretic peptides as
      markers for heart disease in infants and children. This resulted in many studies and more
      than 25 publications in the medical literature. We believe that the newly discovered cardiac
      marker, ST2, will emerge as an important addition to cardiac evaluation in the coming
      years.The aim of this study is to measure ST2 levels in patients with congenital right heart
      disease and correlate ST2 levels to clinical status, imaging and prognosis.
