  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bowel cleansing is important for a completeness of colonoscopy and detection of
      colon polyps. Inadequate bowel preparation leads to longer duration of colonoscopy and
      obscured mucosal visualization resulting in missed lesions.

      Bowel cleansing agents are simply classified into the large volume, iso-osmotic polyethylene
      glycol (PEG) based solutions or the small volume osmotically active agents, such as sodium
      picosulphate with magnesium citrate (SPMC).

      There are rare reports that compare directly conventional polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution
      and sodium picosulphate with magnesium citrate (SPMC) for bowel preparation in korea.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of different
      regimens of SPMC and PEG solution.

      1. Study design: endoscopist-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial

        2. Subjects

             1. Entry criteria: Male or female patients, aged between18 and 75 years undergoing
                elective outpatient colonoscopy were eligible for the study.

             2. Exclusion criteria:

           gastrointestinal obstruction or perforation, toxic megacolon, severe uncontrolled
           inflammatory bowel disease, previous colorectal resection, congestive heart failure,
           recent acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina, uncontrolled arterial
           hypertension, renal insufficiency with glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/minute/1.73
           m2, liver cirrhosis or ascites, pregnancy, lactation, and history of hypersensitivity to
           any bowel cleansing agents.

        3. Sampling design: Consecutive recruitment of consenting patients

        4. Variables Predictor

             1. group 1 (same day PEG) received 4 L of PEG at 6 hours before procedure on the day
                of the colonoscopy

             2. group 2 (split PEG) received 2 L of PEG at 6:00 p.m the evening before colonoscopy
                and 2 L of PEG at 4-6 hours before procedure

             3. group 3 (SPMC 2) received one sachet of SPMC at 6 p.m the evening before
                colonoscopy and another sachet of SPMC at 4-6 hours before procedure;

             4. group 4 (SPMC 3) received one sachet of SPMC at 6 p.m and the other sachet at 9 p.m
                the evening before colonoscopy and another sachet at 4-6 hours before procedure.

        5. Primary Outcome: Quality of bowel preparation (Ottawa scale)

        6. Secondary Outcome: Tolerability, palatability, side effect of the cleansing agents

    <measure>the quality of the bowel preparation using the Ottawa bowel preparation scale (OBPS)</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Immediately following the colonoscopy, the endoscopist who were unaware of the preparation regimen scored the quality of the bowel preparation using the Ottawa bowel preparation scale (OBPS).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Completeness of the bowel preparation</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before the colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Patient compliance was recorded by checking the completeness of the prescribed preparation methods including bowel cleansing agent solution and recommended clear liquid.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the patient's tolerability</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes before the colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were asked with questionnaires about the symptoms associated with the preparation to assess the patients' tolerability before the colonoscopy. Patients were asked whether they experienced any of the following : abdominal fullness, cramping, nausea, vomiting, sleep disturbance, and overall discomfort, and these symptoms were scored on a 5-point scale where 1 = &quot;none&quot;, 2 = &quot;mild&quot;, 3 = &quot;moderate&quot;, 4 = &quot;severe&quot;, and 5 = &quot;very severe&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>the side effects of the sodium picosulphate and magnesium citrate</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour before the colonoscopy</time_frame>
    <description>Biochemical measures detected outrange of serum electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and serum osmolality only for the sodium picosulphate and magnesium citrate.
Biochemical measurement was done done for the patients in the polyethylene glycol groups due to the well established safety date of the polyethylene glycol solutions.</description>
