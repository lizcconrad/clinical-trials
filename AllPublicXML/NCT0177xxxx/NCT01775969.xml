  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatient antibiotics are frequently prescribed from the emergency department, and limited
      health literacy may impact compliance with recommended treatments. The investigators are
      looking to determine if patient preference for multimodality discharge instructions for
      outpatient antibiotic therapy varies by health literacy level, and if modality effected
      patient-reported antibiotic compliance and 72-hour antibiotic pick-up.

      This is a prospective randomized trial that includes consenting patients discharged with
      outpatient antibiotics. Health literacy is assessed using a validated health literacy
      assessment, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS). Patients are randomized to a discharge instruction
      modality: 1) standard of care, typed and verbal medication and case-specific instructions; 2)
      standard of care plus text messaged instructions sent to the patient's cell phone; or 3)
      standard of care plus voicemailed instructions sent to the patient's cell phone. Antibiotic
      pick-up is verified with the patient's pharmacy at 72 hours. Patients are called at 30 days
      to determine antibiotic compliance.
