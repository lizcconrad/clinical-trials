    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the impact of early extubation to nasal
      continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) versus nasal Bilevel positive airway pressure
      (n-BiPAP) on the need for mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube (MVET) to 7 days of
      age or less in preterm infants &lt;34 weeks' gestation requiring intubation and surfactant if
      indicated for respiratory distress syndrome within 60 min of delivery . Second aim is to
      compare different outcomes of post-extubation n-CPAP and n-BiPAP.

    <description>The n-CPAP group will receive at extubation a single level continuous positive airway pressure of 7 cm water for at least 48 hours before weaning is commenced. If the infant is stable for the preceding 48 hours defined by having fewer than three minor apneas and no increase in oxygen requirement, weaning will be permitted.
CPAP will be decreased from 6 cm water by 1 cm water every 24 hours if tolerated based on the above criteria. This will be done until a pressure of 4 cm water is reached.
If a pressure of 4 cm water is successfully tolerated for 48 hours then time off n-CPAP will be allowed. Thereafter, no fixed weaning regime based on number of hours in a day the infant will be allowed to come off CPAP will be prescribed.</description>
