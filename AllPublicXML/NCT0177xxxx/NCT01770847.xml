    <textblock>
      Diurnal variations in the cardiovascular system apparent in healthy individuals, are
      different in chronic kidney disease patients. Therefore, diurnal variations in arterial
      stiffness may also differ in chronic kidney disease patients. This study aims to identify and
      evaluate diurnal variations in arterial stiffness in chronic kidney disease patients and
      compare them to those in age matched healthy controls.

        Potential patients will be identified from renal clinics at the Royal Infirmary and Western
        General Hospital. Suitable participants will initially be identified by a member of the
        direct healthcare team.

        Healthy volunteers will be indentified through the Clinical Research Centre community
        database and poster advertising at the University of Edinburgh.
