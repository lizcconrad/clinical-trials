  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the pressure in the retinal veins increases from chronic lack of
      oxygen and leads to decreased blood flow. On the basis of high altitude mountaineering this
      hypothesis should be verified. At the same time the adaptation capacity of the blood
      circulation should be analyzed, and a relationship to mountain sickness should be found.

      Conduct a field study to describe and quantify the retinal venous pressure (RVP) in healthy
      volunteers under conditions of controlled chronically reduced ambient pressure and oxygen
      partial pressure in the mountains. Obtaining indications regarding the adaptation of the
      retinal vascular system behavior to controlled, long-term hypoxic changes. Comparisons with
      blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation level and the appearance of symptoms of acute
      mountain sickness are made in order to obtain a better understanding of the development of
      high altitude illness.
