  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study explores among couples in which both members are obese how the use of mental
      contrasting along with implementation intentions influence intentions and behavior related to
      weight loss (eating healthy and exercise), actual weight loss, as well as potential reasons
      (i.e., mediators) why these changes may occur (e.g., social support, changes in beliefs about
      weight loss, confidence in being able to eat healthy and diet).

      This study explores among couples in which both members are obese how the use of mental
      contrasting along with implementation intentions influence intentions and behaviors related
      to weight loss (eating healthy and exercise), actual weight loss, as well as potential
      reasons (i.e., mediators) why these changes may occur (e.g., social support, changes in
      beliefs about weight loss, confidence in being able to eat healthy and diet). In mental
      contrasting procedures, people first imagine a desired future (e.g., eating healthy) and then
      reflect on the current negative reality (e.g., I snack too much). This process makes people
      aware of changes needed in the present to obtain future positive outcomes, and thus aids in
      increasing goal commitment and goal pursuit. In implementation intention procedures,
      individuals form &quot;if-then&quot; statements about how they will enact their goals in their everyday
      lives. Implementation intentions are highly effective at helping individuals achieve health
      behavior change. Recent studies suggest that the combined use of mental contrasting and
      implementation intentions produce more behavior change than either technique alone (e.g.,
      diet) In this study, investigators test whether these procedures vary in their effectiveness
      when couple members are instructed to focus on themselves versus the relationship, the latter
      intended to instill a communal coping mindset (i.e., that losing weight is an issue that
      needs to be addressed as a couple enacted through mutually cooperative behaviors).

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Couples randomized to the couple condition will undergo the experimental manipulations and both partners will complete all study measures. Both members of the couple will be given body mass index (BMI) based on measurements taken during the intervention. Both will complete three surveys on paper and do some prompted planning and goal-setting together regarding weight loss through healthier eating and physical activity.</description>

    <description>Couples randomized to the individual condition will be stratified on gender and one partner, chosen at random, will undergo the experimental manipulations and complete all study surveys while the other will not (heretofore called the active partner vs. the passive partner). The active partner will receive BMI feedback based on measurements taken during the intervention appointment, complete three surveys, and verbally state some goals and plans for weight loss to the passive partner. The passive partner will not complete any study materials or participate in the intervention during the session.</description>

    <intervention_name>Mental Contrasting- Individual</intervention_name>
    <description>Investigators will implement the manipulation of mental contrasting/implementation intentions, focusing on the individual. This will entail 3 steps that involve: 1) contrasting of positive future outcomes associated with present conditions that hinder achievement of positive future outcomes (i.e., barriers); 2) strategies to overcome barriers and hence facilitate weight loss; and 3) construction of implementation intentions.</description>
