  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time injection of allogeneic
      mesenchymal bone marrow cells is safe and beneficial in the treatment of photodamage on the
      face.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from a number of sources, including bone
      marrow, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood. The MSCs manufactured for this study are a
      subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult donors.
      These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can differentiate
      into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to contributing directly to
      repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate the body's own cells to
      regenerate.

      Though an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current
      treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for
      addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical
      applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a
      similar effect in skin rejuvenation.

      In the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered
      MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant cutaneous photodamage.

    <description>Subjects in Part 1, Cohorts 1-3 will receive a 1550 nm Fraxel laser (6-8 mJ, Level 2) treatment on the face followed by a single intravenous infusion of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 million mesenchymal cells per kg of body weight, not to exceed 150 million cells. Subjects in Part 2 will receive a 1550 Fraxel laser (6-8 mJ, Level 2) treatment on the face followed by a single intravenous infusion of mesenchymal cells at the Maximum Tolerated Dose, as determined by the safety results of Part 1. The dose in Part 2 is 1.5 million cells per kg, not to exceed a total of 150 million cells.</description>
