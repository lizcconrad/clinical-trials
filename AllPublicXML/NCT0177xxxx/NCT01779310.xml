  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are guidelines on the management of AD in China, the evidence adopted in the guidelines
      are mostly from the trials conducted in other countries due to very limited Chinese data
      available for local systematic review. Therefore, more local evidence on dementia care is
      needed for the development of an evidence-based guideline appropriate for people living in
      China. Meanwhile, the inadequate implementation of the current AD guideline, which results in
      the low diagnostic rate and high diagnostic leakage, may bring about extra barriers for AD
      patients to access dementia care service in different areas nationwide. However, there is no
      data on the clinical pathway about how physicians follow the dementia guideline in the
      routine practice.

      Therefore, research is needed to learn clinical diagnostic process and treatment patterns of
      physicians to people with AD in routine practice and help address the low accurate rate of AD
      clinical diagnosis and low anti-dementia drug prescription in the real world and support
      guideline development.

      Outpatients who are visiting memory clinics and who are judged by physicians with clinically
      significant cognitive impairment will be invited to join the study during the study
      recruiting period (with informed consent signed).

        -  Patients enrolled into the study will be evaluated and diagnosed by participating
           physicians and may or may not be prescribed with therapy (pharmaceutical and/or
           non-pharmaceutical) based on physicians' medical judgment.

        -  For patients with routine clinical follow-up visits, their medical charts will be
           reviewed for documentation. The procedures of making diagnosis and developing treatment
           scheme will be retrieved and documented in clinical report form (CRF). Additional
           procedures ordered by the participating physician at current visits will also be
           documented in CRF.

      All participants will be followed twice after baseline visit to re-evaluate and confirm the
      initial diagnosis (where applicable), and to record compliance to treatment scheme, including
      the process of medication titration.

      This study does not recommend nor restrict any specific treatments.
