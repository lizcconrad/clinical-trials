  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to describe the trajectory of early survivorship in
      individuals with colon cancer who undergo both surgical and medical management of colon
      cancer. The primary question is whether or not there is an interaction between type of
      surgery and changes in quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands
      of illness following curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prospective design with three cohorts of participants will describe the changes in
      quality of life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy and demands of illness following
      curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (Aims 1-4). An analysis of the interaction
      between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic
      resection, robotic resection) by mean values of quality of life, sexual function, peripheral
      neuropathy, and demands of illness will examine the central thesis question (Aim 5).

      Specific Aims

        1. Describe the demographic and disease characteristics of the sample.

        2. Examine the relationships among quality of life, sexual functioning, peripheral
           neuropathy, and demands of illness for the sample-as-a-whole and by type of surgical
           resection (open, laparoscopic, robotic).

        3. Examine within-subject changes in the mean values of scores for quality of life, sexual
           functioning, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness across four measurement
           occasions.

        4. Examine between-group differences in mean values of scores for quality of life, sexual
           function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness at four discrete measurement
           occasions.

        5. Examine the interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type
           (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of quality of
           life, sexual function, peripheral neuropathy, and demands of illness.

    <description>The European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C-30) and colon cancer specific module (QLQ-CR-29)will be utilized to measure changes in quality of life. The interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of quality of life will be examined.</description>

    <description>The Neurotoxicity Sub-scale (Ntx-13); a questionnaire about symptoms of nerve damage in persons receiving chemotherapy, will be utilized to assess symptoms of neurologic toxicities in persons receiving the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. The interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of peripheral neuropathy will be examined.</description>

    <description>The Changes in Sexual Function Questionnaire (CSFQ)will be used to describe the changes in sexual function reported by cancer survivors following surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values of changes in sexual function will be examined.</description>

    <description>The Demands of Illness Inventory (DOII); a questionnaire about the stressors experienced by cancer survivors will be utilized for this outcome measure. The interaction between time (four measurement occasions) and surgical type (open resection, laparoscopic resection, robotic resection) by mean values from the demands of illness inventory will be examined.</description>
