      INTRODUCTION Eight trials studying the effect of providing neonatal vitamin A supplementation
      (NVAS) have been reported, and another four are underway to test whether NVAS should become
      WHO policy. Three of the four African trials were conducted by the Bandim Health Project
      (BHP) in Guinea-Bissau. One of them was a two-by-two factorial trial among low-birth-weight
      children. From 2004-2008, the children were randomly allocated to 25,000 IU vitamin A or
      placebo at birth, and furthermore to BCG vaccination at birth or later as is local policy. In
      2011, the investigators conducted a follow-up study. A remarkably strong harmful effect of
      NVAS on atopy and wheezing was found (manuscript under review).

      Seen in the context that NVAS may soon become a WHO policy it is obviously worrying if NVAS
      is associated with a higher risk of atopy and wheezing. The investigators therefore aim to
      conduct a similar follow-up study of participants in the first NVAS trial conducted in
      Guinea-Bissau from 2002-2004, among normal-birth-weight infants, to test whether NVAS is
      associated with an increased risk of atopy and wheezing and other allergic symptoms as well
      as growth.

      METHODS

      Study population:

      From 2002-2004 BHP conducted a randomised trial of NVAS. The investigators recruited newborns
      when they came for BCG vaccination. Provided parental consent, they received an oral
      supplement of 50,000 IU vitamin A or placebo.

      Study design:

      This study will be a follow-up study of the cohort of children randomised to NVAS
      (intervention) or placebo (current policy) together with BCG vaccine at birth.

      Other exposures:

      The investigators will also investigate the effect of receiving an additional dose of measles
      vaccine and the timing of DTP vaccine on the development of atopy.

      Assessment of outcomes:

      The investigators will visit all children at the last known address. Height, weight and mid
      upper arm circumference will be measured. BCG scar will be examined and vaccination card
      details recorded by the field assistant. Children will be excluded from skin prick testing
      (SPT) if they have a history suggestive of anaphylaxis or are currently using anti-histamine
      medication. SPT will be performed using aero-allergens, food allergens and positive histamine
      and negative saline control. The mother or guardian will be interviewed by a local assistant.
      Symptoms of eczema and asthma as well as food allergy will be assessed.

      Statistical analysis:

      Effect of randomisation group and other factors on outcomes will be analysed in multivariable
      regression models. All analyses will be adjusted for skin prick tester. All analyses will be
      conducted stratified by sex.
