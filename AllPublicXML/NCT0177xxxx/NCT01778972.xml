  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fall-related injuries are a major health problem in the growing older population. Most older
      people are not aware of that physical training can decrease the risk of falling. The aim of
      tha study is to investigate the effect of the Otago home exercise programme with and without
      motivational interviewing in community-dwelling people 75 years or older on frequence of
      falls, fall-related injuries, physical capacity, fall-related self-efficacy, quality of life,
      mortality and health-related costs.

      Participants in the two intervention groups will exercise at home with supervision from
      physiotherapist week one, two, four and eight. They will then be contacted for telephone
      follow-up month five, seven and twelve after the start of training. The control group is
      encouraged to live as usual.

      All participants are assessed at baseline, after three, 12 and 24 months from inclusion in
      the study.
