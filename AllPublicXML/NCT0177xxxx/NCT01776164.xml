  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Friedreich's ataxia is characterized by progressive alterations in the function of the
      cerebellum accompanied by an atrophy of the spinal cord. Although the genetic defect
      responsible for the disease has been identified more than 15 years ago, objective markers of
      the pathologic process (i.e., biomarkers) that would allow measuring the effects of potential
      therapies are still lacking. Moreover, it is still unclear how the malfunction of the
      cerebellum affects the rest of the brain, and understanding the connectivity and
      neurochemistry of the central nervous system might yield new insights in the understanding of
      the disease, in addition to providing potential markers.

      To address these needs, the investigators aim at utilizing the capabilities of Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS). Using techniques called Diffusion Imaging,
      resting-state functional MRI, and Proton Spectroscopy (1H MRS), the investigators propose to
      determine the differences in the connectivity and neurochemistry of the spinal cord and the
      brain between patients affected by Friedreich's ataxia and healthy controls. The
      investigators plan on imaging both patients and control subjects using a 3T magnet, a system
      that although not yet available in all medical facilities, is becoming standard in most
      hospitals and clinics. The first aim is to scan patients already scanned last year (12-month
      follow-up). The second aim is to scan patients at an early stage of the disease.

    <description>The investigators will look at the differences between patients and controls. This is observational, not interventional.
The fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value. The apparent coefficient of diffusion, radial and axial diffusivity are measured in mm2/s. The metabolite concentrations in the brain are in the order of Âµg/ g wet tissue weight. Cortical thickness is measured in mm.</description>
