    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the effects a nasal provocation on the activation of different brain
      regions, the investigators want to set up a clinical trial investigating the short-term
      effects of a nasal histamine provocation in healthy volunteers and allergic patients while in
      supine position under the functional MRI device in order to visualize different brain
      regions.

    <description>Evaluation of nasal symptoms (runny nose, blocked nose, itchy nose and post-nasal drip) and conjunctival symptoms (lacrimation and itchy eyes) will be done with VAS scores and the Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF) will be measured before and after both functional MRI (fMRI) scans</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and with pollen allergic
             symptoms during the pollen season OR patients with a negative skin prick test and with
             no allergic symptoms during the pollen season.

          -  Age &gt; 18 and &lt; 50 years

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Willingness to adhere to visit schedules

          -  Adequate contraceptive precautions in female patients with childbearing potential

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Current or recent (finished less than 2 years) immunotherapy against grass pollen.

          -  Systemic steroid treatment less than 6 weeks before the inclusion in the study.

          -  Nasal steroid spray, oral leukotriene antagonists or long-acting antihistamines less
             than 4 weeks before the inclusion.

          -  Presence of purulent secretions in nasal cavity.

          -  Severe septal deviation (septum reaching concha inferior or lateral nasal wall).

          -  Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient has any disorder of which the investigators feel at the time of evaluation for
             participation in the study that this may compromise the ability to give truly informed
             consent for participation in this study.

          -  Patient is currently enrolled in other investigational drug trial(s) or is receiving
             other investigational agent(s) for any other medical condition.

          -  No independent medication management in daily life or disability to perform fine
             motoric handling of medication

          -  Patients with asthma will be excluded.

          -  Patients suffering from claustrophobia
