  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial (C-RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of a
      Community-Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (C-IMCI) training for community
      caregivers (CCGs), adapted to include HIV-related interventions, on the delivery of maternal,
      newborn and child health interventions within households in rural communities in Ugu
      District, KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Province, South Africa. The intervention includes two
      components: (1) a 2-week HIV/C-IMCI training for CCGs and their associated facilitators and
      supervisors, and (2) continuous support and supervision following the continuous quality
      improvement (CQI) framework, a low-technology approach to management and supervision of
      health programs. The primary objectives of the proposed evaluation are to measure the effect
      of the intervention on key outcomes, including early uptake of antenatal care, facility based
      delivery, postnatal visits, coverage of exclusive breastfeeding, and uptake of HIV PCR
      testing in infants at 6 weeks. We will also examine the effects of the intervention on
      immunization uptake up to 12 months and knowledge and practices of CCGs and mothers
      pertaining to maternal, newborn and child health.
