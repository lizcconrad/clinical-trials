  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cabazitaxel is a new taxoid which promotes the tubulin assembly in vitro and stabilizes
      microtubules against cold-induced depolymerization as efficiently as docetaxel and was
      selected for development based on a better antiproliferative activity on resistant cell lines
      than docetaxel. It has shown superior survival against mitoxantrone (MTX) plus prednisone in
      docetaxel pre-treated hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer patients leading to
      registration of the compound. It showed a favorable toxicity profile with an interestingly
      low rate of alopecia. In the Genevieve study it will be compared against weekly paclitaxel
      which is currently most widely used treatment of breast cancer patients. A head-to-head
      comparison in the neoadjuvant setting will allow a rapid and precise comparison of efficacy
      and tolerability of cabacitaxel versus paclitaxel to decide in how far further development of
      this taxoid in breast cancer is reasonable.

      Primary Objective To compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate in the breast
      (ypT0/is ypN0/+) in patients with operable Triple Negative or luminal B/HER2 normal breast
      cancer treated with either cabazitaxel or weekly paclitaxel.

      Secondary Objective To assess

        -  pCR rates per arm separately for the stratified subpopulations.

        -  Objective response rate (ORR) in the breast according to WHO criteria.

        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0 ypN0.

        -  pCR rate defined as ypT0/is ypN0.

        -  pCR rate in the axillary lymph nodes (ypN0).

        -  To determine the pCR rate and local recurrence free survival (LRFS) in patients with a
           clinical complete response (cCR) and a negative core biopsy before surgery.

        -  Breast conservation surgery rate.

        -  To assess the toxicity (NCI CTCAE V4.03) and compliance in both arms.

        -  Invasive loco-regional recurrence free survival (LRRFS), distant-disease-free survival
           (DDFS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), and overall survival (OS).

        -  To explore the biomarkers and profiles potentially predicting response to treatment.

          -  Unilateral or bilateral primary carcinoma of the breast, confirmed histologically by
             core biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration alone is not sufficient. Incisional biopsy is not
             allowed. In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively
             which side will be evaluated for the primary endpoint.

          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of &gt;= 2 cm or a sonographical size of
             &gt;= 1 cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions,
             preferably by sonography.

          -  Patients must be in the following stages of disease: cT3 or cT2 or cT1c and cN+ or
             cT1c and pNSLN+.

          -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should
             be evaluated.

          -  Centrally confirmed triple negative or luminal B/HER2-normal subtype. ER- and
             PgR-negative defined as &lt;1% stained cells. HER-2 negative defined as IHC 0+, 1+ or IHC
             2+ and FISH/SISH/CISH (ratio &lt;2.0) negative. Luminal B defined as ER and/or PgR + and
             &gt; 14% Ki-67 stained cells. The formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tissue
             block from the diagnostic core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the Dept. of
             Pathology at the Charité, Berlin prior to randomization.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status: 0 or 1 (see Appendix A).

             bilirubin &lt; 1.0 x ULN, Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN. If creatinine 1.0 - 1.5 x ULN,
             creatinine clearance will be calculated according to CKD-EPI formula and patients with
             creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min should be excluded (see Appendix 2 for formula).

          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for all
             women of childbearing potential.

          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization. All patients must
             have bilateral mammography, breast ultrasound (&lt;= 21 days), breast MRI (optional),
             chest X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan
             done. In case of positive bone scan, bone X-ray is mandatory. Other tests may be
             performed as clinically indicated.
