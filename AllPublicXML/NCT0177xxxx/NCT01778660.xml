    <textblock>
      This study compares standard versus mnemonic counseling for the treatment of fecal
      incontinence. A mnemonic is a word or rhyme used to aid memory. Our hypothesis is that women
      randomised to mnemonic counseling will higher recall of treatments, satisfaction with the
      physician visit and greater improvement in their quality of life when compared to women who
      received standard counseling.
