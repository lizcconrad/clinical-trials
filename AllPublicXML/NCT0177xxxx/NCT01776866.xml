  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that dual-axis rotational coronary angiography was
      non-inferior to standard coronary angiography with respect to diagnosis of coronary artery
      disease.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prior studies have demonstrated that dual-axis rotational coronary angiography (DARCA) is
      associated with lower contrast usage and radiation exposure compared with standard coronary
      angiography (SA). Single-axis rotational coronary angiography (RA) has been proved by
      previous studies without any reduction in diagnostic accuracy compared to SA. However, the
      rotational protocol is obvious different between DARCA and single-axis RA. A recent study has
      assessed the diagnostic accuracy of DARCA, but this study was not designed for image content
      analysis and the number of patients included did not provide sufficient statistical power to
      allow a valid comparison of DARCA with SA. The diagnostic accuracy of DARCA aroused our
      attention.

    <time_frame>After coronary angiography, an expected average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The number of patients diagnosed as coronary heart disease by either angiographic modality by two blinded independent reviewers are recorded. The single criterion for diagnosis of coronary heart disease is the presence of coronary artery stenoses greater than or equal to 50%.</description>

    <measure>Coronary Lesion Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>After coronary angiography, an expected average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The number of lesions greater than or equal to 50% detected by either angiographic modality by two blinded independent reviewers are recorded. In addition, they are asked to comment on the characteristics of the greater than or equal to 50% lesions (number of coronary lesions, number of bifurcation lesions, location of lesion, multivessel disease, American College of Cardiology (ACC) lesion classification and Medina classification for bifurcation lesions)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Coronary Angiography</measure>
    <time_frame>After coronary angiography, an expected average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The quantitative coronary angiography analysis of the more than or equal to 50% lesions detected by the lesion assessment of either reviewer one or reviewer two in both angiographic modalities (lesion length, minimum lumen diameter, diameter stenosis). Quantitative coronary angiography analysis will be performed by the third different blinded, independent, reviewer.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic Screening Adequacy</measure>
    <time_frame>After coronary angiography, an expected average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Two different experienced reviewers analyzed the angiographic sets based on a Likert Scale for each vessel segment, calcification, thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow, collaterals, displaying the lesions and bifurcations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Safety Analysis</measure>
    <time_frame>During coronary angiography</time_frame>
    <description>The time(seconds), contrast usage(ml) and radiation dose(Gycm2) are recorded from the point of selective catheter engagement in the coronary ostium to the completion of the diagnostic study. The time, contrast and radiation to perform isocentering are included during dura-axis rotational coronary angiography. The time, contrast and radiation to engage the coronary ostium, exchange catheters, and perform non-coronary angiography are excluded from the analysis. All adverse events observed by the operator or reported by the patient are recorded.</description>

    <description>Patient first undergo standard coronary angiography(SA) of either left or right coronary system followed by dual-axis rotational coronary angiography(DARCA). The SA protocol consist of six different projections (right anterior oblique (RAO)-caudal, RAO-cranial (CRA), left anterior oblique (LAO)-CRA, LAO-caudal (CAU), antero-posterior (AP)-CRA and AP-CAU) for left coronary artery (LCA) and two projections (LAO and AP-cranial) for right coronary artery (RCA).
The DARCA protocol consist of two coronary acquisitions specified by the protocol: one for LCA (Swing LCA CRA 35 5.8s), another for RCA (Swing RCA AP 4.0s).</description>
