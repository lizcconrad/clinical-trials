      Study part 1 and 2 Assessment of Zn absorption from regular and biofortified wheat: stable
      isotope absorption studies in women of childbearing age consuming test meals prepared from
      either the biofortified Zn wheat, regular wheat or post-harvest fortified wheat at two
      different extraction rates.

      Study part 3 Assessment of Zn absorption from intrinsically and extrinsically labeled wheat:
      stable isotope absorption studies in women of childbearing age, or men, consuming test meals
      prepared from either intrinsically labeled Zn biofortified wheat, regular wheat or
      post-harvest fortified wheat extrinsically labeled immediately before consumption.

      The overall goal of study part 1 and 2 is to evaluate and compare the fractional and absolute
      Zn absorption from biofortified wheat cultivar (60 ppm Zn) to regular wheat (28 ppm Zn) and
      to post harvest fortified wheat (60 ppm Zn) for a total of 3 test meals per study. The
      studies will be conducted with products based on wheat with high extraction rate (study part
      1) and medium extraction rate (study part 2) in two separate groups of women of childbearing
      age.

      The goal of study part 3 is to investigate the difference of absorption measurements between
      intrinsically and extrinsically labeled biofortified wheat. The label of the test meals will
      have the same nature as the fortificant itself (extrinsic vs intrinsic), for a total of 3
      test meals.
