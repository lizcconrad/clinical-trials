    <textblock>
      To validate the French version of the CAM, a multicenter diagnostic study will be conducted.
      The principle of this study is identical to the study of Inouye which initially validated the
      CAM in 1990. This is to verify the diagnostic properties of the CAM (French version) compared
      to the gold standard represented by the confused state of psychiatric diagnosis using the
      DSM.

      A representative sample of geriatric patients for whom a delirium is suspected, will be
      recruited in the various participating centers, patients will undergo two consecutive visits:

        -  A visit by a geriatrician, during which the confused state of the patient will be
           evaluated using the French version of the CAM.

        -  A visit by a psychiatrist during which the diagnosis of confusional state will be
           evaluated using the gold standard criteria of the DSM IV.

      These two evaluations will be conducted on the same day and blinded from each other.

      The order of these two procedures will be balanced within each center. This process will
      allow the calculation of diagnostic parameters of the CAM French version (validation
      competitive): sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values .
