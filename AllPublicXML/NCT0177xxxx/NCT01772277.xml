      To assess the efficacy and safety of local application of intraoperative mitomycin C (MMC) at
      osteotomy site in endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy(EN-DCR).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mitomycin C (MMC) is an antineoplastic agent that inhibits the synthesis of DNA, cellular
      RNA, and protein by inhibiting the synthesis of collagen by fibroblasts. MMC was originally
      used as a systemic chemotherapeutic agent, it has been widely used in ophthalmic practice
      both intraoperatively and postoperatively for prevention of pterygium recurrence, enhancing
      the success rate of glaucoma filtration surgery. Recently, use of MMC has been described in
      lacrimal drainage surgery. It is postulated that adjunctive use of MMC over the osteotomy
      site in endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy(EN-DCR)surgery could inhibit scarring and
      granulation tissue formation around the osteotomy site or common canaliculus and enhance the
      success of EN-DCR surgery.

      Many controlled trials have investigated adjunctive MMC for primary or revision EN-DCR to
      augment the surgical success rate, but the results are not completely consistent. To the best
      of our knowledge, there was no meta-analysis on comparison of success rate of EN-DCR with MMC
      (MMC group) and endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy without MMC (control group). Therefore, the
      aim of this study was to undertake systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the
      efficacy of intraoperative MMC application in EN-DCR surgery and help ophthalmologists to
      determine whether it is a useful adjuvant in EN-DCR surgery.
