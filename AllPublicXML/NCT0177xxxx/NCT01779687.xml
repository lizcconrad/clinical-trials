  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among patients with HIV infection and contributes to the
      increased cardiovascular disease risk in this patient population. Atorvastatin lowers plasma
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and is used for prevention of
      artherosclerotic disease. Raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, could be one of the
      preferred antiretroviral agents in HIV patients with dyslipidemia because it has a beneficial
      lipid profile.

      Theoretically, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected between atorvastatin and
      raltegravir. However, atorvastatin and raltegravir share similar metabolic pathways which
      could be relevant in the occurrence of pharmacokinetic interactions. In order to be able to
      recommend raltegravir and atorvastatin concomitant use, a pharmacokinetic study in healthy
      volunteers is proposed.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at least 18 and not older than 55 years at screening.

          -  Subject does not smoke more than 10 cigarettes, 2 cigars, or 2 pipes per day for at
             least 3 months prior to the first dosing

          -  Subject has a Quetelet Index (Body Mass Index) of 18 to 30 kg/m2, extremes included.

          -  Subject is able and willing to sign the Informed Consent Form prior to screening
             evaluations.

          -  Subject is in good age-appropriate health condition as established by medical history,
             physical examination, electrocardiography, results of biochemistry, haematology and
             urinalysis testing within 4 weeks prior to the first dose. Results of biochemistry,
             haematology and urinalysis testing should be within the laboratory's reference ranges.
             If laboratory results are not within the reference ranges, the subject is included on

             relevant. This should be clearly recorded.

             disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, renal and hepatic disorders, hormonal
             disorders (especially diabetes mellitus), coagulation disorders, musculoskeletal and
             connective tissue disorders.

          -  Relevant history or current condition that might interfere with drug absorption,
             distribution, metabolism or excretion.

          -  History of or current abuse of drugs, alcohol or solvents.

          -  Inability to understand the nature and extent of the study and the procedures
