  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fatigue is the most prevalent symptom in advanced cancer patients, interfering functional
      capacity, social relations, wellbeing, and quality of life. Methylphenidate is a central
      nervous system stimulant that has traditionally been used in cancer patients to manage
      depression, opioid‐induced sedation, hypoactive delirium due to multiorgan failure, and
      cognitive disorder associated with brain tumors. Although there is evidence from prospective
      studies of the efficacy of this drug in cancer‐related fatigue, the only one randomised
      clinical trials gave non-conclusive results. In order to define the real efficacy of
      methylphenidate in this setting, the investigators designed a new clinical trial comparing
      methylphenidate and placebo in cancer‐related fatigue, assessed both by the verbal numeric
      scale (VNS) included in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and the subscale for
      fatigue of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT‐F). The investigators will
      include 122 advanced cancer patients with fatigue ≥ 5/10 (VNS, from 0 to 10) and hemoglobin ≥
      9 g/dl. Patients will be randomized to methylphenidate or placebo. Doses will be adapted to
      response within a range from 10 mg at morning time and 5 at noon, to 25 mg/day. Assessment of
      response will be performed on day 3 and day 6 with ESAS and FACT‐F. Drug‐induced adverse
      events will be checked. The VNS of fatigue on day 6 will be consider the primary endpoint.
