  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of oral montelukast (Singulair)
      given with other standard asthma medications and treatments in the treatment of children with
      status asthmaticus. Status asthmaticus is an acute asthma attack that does not respond to
      standard intermittent treatments but requires a continuous medication to aid in breathing.
      While new medications have been used to better manage chronic asthma, acute asthma
      exacerbations continue to be a significant cause of hospitalization and even death in
      children. Oral montelukast is a very safe medication that is used to manage chronic asthma in
      children, but it has not been studied for use in status asthmaticus. If oral montelukast,
      given with other standard therapies, can reduce the treatment length associated with severe,
      acute asthma exacerbations in children, it could potentially improve both the morbidity and
      burden of pediatric asthma.

    <textblock>
      While new medications have been used to better manage chronic asthma, acute exacerbations
      continue to be a significant cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. Montelukast holds an
      established role in the pediatric outpatient management of asthma and while two promising
      studies in adults have demonstrated its potential use as an adjunctive therapy for acute
      exacerbations, its similar use in pediatrics has yet to be established. This pilot study is
      designed as a prospective, double blinded, randomized, controlled, clinical trial comparing
      the use of oral montelukast plus standard of care vs. standard of care alone in children
      admitted for status asthmaticus to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The primary
      outcome the investigators are interested in is the time to reach a Modified Pediatric Asthma
      Score (PAS) of &lt; 5, which, per the clinical protocol for the treatment of status asthmaticus,
      is the time when patients are able to come off continuous bronchodilator therapy. If oral
      montelukast, given with other standard therapies, can reduce the treatment, emotional, and
      financial burden (e.g., shortened intensive care stay) associated with severe, acute asthma
      exacerbations in children, it would provide a significant therapeutic advantage, potentially
      improving both the morbidity and burden of pediatric asthma.
