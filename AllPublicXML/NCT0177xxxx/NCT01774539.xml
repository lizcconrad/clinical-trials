  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who suffer fractures to the growth plates (physes) of their bones are at risk for
      premature growth arrest which can lead to long term complications. There is currently no
      technique to predict who is at risk of growth arrest following a physeal injury. The
      investigators aim to determine if diffusion MRI (an imaging method to analyze tissue
      properties) can effectively pick up differences between a healthy growth plate and an injured
      one. This would allow orthopaedics surgeons to predict which injuries are at a higher risk of
      growth arrest, so earlier interventions can be done in the orthopaedic clinic.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if diffusion MRI can be used for tissue
      characterization in childhood and adolescent growth plate injuries, and to get a better
      understanding of the physiologic disturbance of an injured physis
