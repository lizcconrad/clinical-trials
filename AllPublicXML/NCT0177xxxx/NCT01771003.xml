  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial Nephrectomy has become the standard treatment in patients with tumours &lt;7cm (T1).
      Even though this is a nephron sparing surgery, there is still potential for acute kidney
      injury, due to ischemia during the surgery. Remote Ischemia Preconditioning may prevent acute
      kidney injury and in turn chronic kidney disease. Remote Ischemia pre-conditioning involves
      applying a blood pressure cuff and inflating and deflating several times immediately prior to
      surgery.
