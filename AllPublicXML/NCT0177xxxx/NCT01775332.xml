  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine the utility of educational materials
      designed to inform patients of their pituitary condition, in an effort to assist the
      patients, families, and staff deal with pituitary tumours and related conditions in the best
      way possible. We have developed a website, informational videos, and a brochure for pituitary
      tumour patients and their families. The primary outcome measures will be 1) the level of
      knowledge that patients have of their condition before and after reviewing the materials
      provided; and 2) ease of use and user satisfaction of the materials. We hypothesize that our
      informative multimedia educational package will not only improve the health literacy and
      self-efficacy of patients and their families, but will also improve quality of care.

      This study involves a formative evaluation of the health literacy resources that we have
      already developed. We see approximately 60 new patients a year with pituitary disorders, plus
      the follow-up patients: all of these patients will be offered the opportunity to participate
      in the study. These materials include a website (containing videos, illustrations and written
      materials) and plain language educational brochures. The educational materials include
      information that patients will need throughout their experience with a pituitary tumour,
      ranging from the signs and symptoms of tumours, to long-term post-operative lifestyle
      changes. This evaluation will be a mixed-methods evaluation.

      Part A (Think aloud) will use &quot;think-aloud&quot; processes to evaluate the usefulness and ease of
      use of a website that we have developed with patients and their families.

      Part B (Resource assessment) will involve the use of questionnaires followed by
      semi-structured interviews with patients and families before and after using the resources.
