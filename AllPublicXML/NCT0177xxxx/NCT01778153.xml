    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the Equinox Personal Coaching exercise training
      method to self-directed exercise training in helping subjects become more fit. Men between 30
      and 44 years of age who exercise on a regular basis and are interested in receiving Equinox
      personal training will be invited to participate. The investigators will enroll 36 subjects
      at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the only site. The hypothesis of this study
      is that subjects randomized to the Personal Coaching Method will result in significantly
      greater lean mass accrual than those randomized to self-directed training over the 12 weeks
      of the study.

      Subjects will have 2 Baseline visits over 1 week, then be randomized to receive either
      Coached training or self-training, which they will do for 12 weeks, then complete two End of
      Study visits over the final week. Visits 1 and 3 include questionnaires, skinfold fat/lean
      body mass measurements, and strength and aerobic performance tests, and will take place at
      Equinox. Visits 2 and 4 include a DEXA scan and ECG, which will take place at UCLA.
