  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of simvastatin and zoledronic acid on
      M-protein and/or free light chains when added to conventional chemotherapy for the treatment
      of multiple myeloma patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and zoledronic acid to bortezomib,
      thalidomide, melphalan or dexamethasone based regimens will decrease drug resistance when
      treating refractory multiple myeloma. We hypothesize that the addition of simvastatin and
      zoledronic acid will not increase the chemotherapy toxicity significantly and will be
      tolerable for patients. We believe simvastatin and zoledronic acid have antitumor properties
      and will contribute to reversal of resistance. Treatment will be significantly enhanced when
      these agents are combined

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. have a definitive diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma (using the International Myeloma
             Working Group Guidelines).

          2. meet one of the following two requirements:

               -  Have achieved minimal response (MR) or stable disease (SD) in current treatment
                  regimen after a minimum of two cycles.

               -  Have partial response but show no further improvement in paraprotein levels in
                  the latest two measurements.

          3. must have measurable active or symptomatic disease. Measurable disease may be
             paraprotein or free light chains in serum or urine, or the presence of bone marrow
             plasma cells, defined by one or more of the following criteria:

               -  Presence of serum M-protein concentration &gt; 1g/dL.
