    <measure>Height Velocity (Ht-V)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Height velocity (Ht-V) (cm/year) is the change in height per year (after 6 months of treatment). Ht-V was calculated by Novo Nordisk.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Ht-SDS (Height Standard Deviation Score)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 months of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>Height standard deviation scores (HSDS) were calculated using Korean growth data (reported by the Korea Centre for Disease Control and Prevention). The mean normal range for HSDS is from -2 to +2. Negative scores below -2 indicate a height below normal range, whereas positive scores above +2 indicate a height above normal.</description>

    <measure>Change in IGF Related Factors: IGF-I (Insulin-like Growth Factor-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 months of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>IGF-I (insulin-like growth factor-1) was measured at Visit 1 (screening),Visit 3 (3 months ± 7 days ),Visit 4 (6 months ± 7 days),Visit 5 (9 months ± 7 days ) and Visit 6 (12 months ± 7 days ). Change of IGF-I from baseline to 6 months treatment was calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IGF Related Factors: IGFBP-3 (Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>After 6 months of treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>IGFBP-3 was measured at Visit 1(screening), Visit 3 (3 months ± 7 days ), Visit 4 (6 months ± 7 days), 5 (9 months ± 7 days ) and 6 ( 12 months ± 7 days). Change of IGFBP-3 from baseline to 6 months treatment were calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Bone Age</measure>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Ht-V (Height Velocity)</measure>
    <time_frame>At the first 6 months and the last 6 months in group A</time_frame>
    <description>Height velocity (Ht-V) (cm/year) is the change in height per year (after 6 months of treatment). Three sort of Ht-V was calculated from height data at Visit 2 (day 0), 4 (6 months ± 7 days) and 6 (12 months ± 7 days), as follows: Between Visits 2 and 4, between Visit 4 and 6 and between Visit 2 and 6. Ht-V was calculated by Novo Nordisk. It is the difference between Ht-V for the last 6 months and Ht-V for the first 6 months of treatment. This endpoint was only evaluated for Group A as per the trial protocol.</description>

        <title>Ht-V (Height Velocity)</title>
        <description>Height velocity (Ht-V) (cm/year) is the change in height per year (after 6 months of treatment). Three sort of Ht-V was calculated from height data at Visit 2 (day 0), 4 (6 months ± 7 days) and 6 (12 months ± 7 days), as follows: Between Visits 2 and 4, between Visit 4 and 6 and between Visit 2 and 6. Ht-V was calculated by Novo Nordisk. It is the difference between Ht-V for the last 6 months and Ht-V for the first 6 months of treatment. This endpoint was only evaluated for Group A as per the trial protocol.</description>
