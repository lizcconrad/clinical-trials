      Retrospective analysis of requests of emergency hormonal contraception using pharmacy
      protocols registered in 2003 and 2006.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2002, Levonorgestrel was introduced in Switzerland for emergency hormonal contraception
      (EC) without prescription ('pharmacist only'). In 2003, a first analysis of requests of EC
      showed that the dispensing of EC through pharmacies could successfully be implemented (Lemke
      et al 2004).

      This study was repeated three years later with the aim to explore whether the user's profile
      has changed after introduction of a low threshold access to EC.

        Pharmacies in Basle, Berne or Zurich, three major towns in the German speaking part of
        Switzerland, were purposively recruited if they had extended opening hours (emergency
        pharmacies) or if they were located downtown and open during traditional business hours
        (walk-in pharmacies).

        The pharmacists were asked if a pharmacy student could come to their place and photocopy
        the completed official one-page EHC written assessment forms.
