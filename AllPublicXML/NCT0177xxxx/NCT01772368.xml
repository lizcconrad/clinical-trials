    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the dose response, efficacy, and safety of
      4 different doses of salmeterol Spiromax (6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 mcg) each combined with a
      fixed dose of fluticasone propionate (100 mcg) delivered as Fluticasone/Salmeterol Spiromax®
      Inhalation Powder (FS Spiromax) when administered as a single dose in subjects 12 years of
      age and older with persistent asthma.

    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind and open-label active-controlled,
      single-dose, 6 period crossover, dose-ranging study conducted in male and female subjects
      ages 12 years and older with persistent asthma.

      Fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (Fp MDPI) 50 mcg was provided (to replace
      the subject's current inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)) throughout the 14 day run-in period and
      each of the washout periods between treatments. Subjects were instructed to administer 2
      inhalations of Fp MDPI 50 mcg (100 mcg total dose) twice daily during the run-in and washout
      periods. All other medications for the treatment of asthma were discontinued at or prior to
      the screening visit.

      A short-acting β2-adrenergic agonist (SABA), salbuterol HFA, MDI, was provided (to replace
      the subject's current rescue medication) for symptomatic relief of asthma symptoms in each
      the run-in, treatment, and washout periods.

      Treatment period lasted 5 weeks with a 5 to 7 day washout between each of the six single dose
      treatments:

        -  fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate multidose dry powder inhaler (FS MDPI) given
           in doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 mcg of salmeterol xinafoate in blinded fashion.

        -  fluticasone propionate multidose dry powder inhaler (Fp MDPI) 100 mcg in blinded fashion

        -  ADVAIR DISKUS, 100/50 mcg in open-label fashion

    <measure>Standardized Baseline-Adjusted Area Under the Curve For Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second Over 12 Hours Post-dose (FEV1 AUC0-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose: 30 minutes prior, within 5 minutes of dose. Post-dose: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Standardized baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUC0-12 was defined as the area under the curve for baseline-adjusted FEV1 measurements from the predose to 12 hours postdose time points using the trapezoidal rule based on actual (not scheduled) time of measurement and was standardized by dividing the actual time of last non-missing FEV1 measurement. Baseline-adjusted FEV1 was calculated as postdose FEV1 after subtracting period-specific baseline FEV1. The period-specific baseline FEV1 was measured at predose within 5 minutes of AM dose administration at each treatment visit. If that value was missing, then FEV1 measured at 30 minutes predose was used as the period-specific baseline.</description>

    <time_frame>Pre-dose: 30 minutes prior, within 5 minutes of dose. Post-dose: 12 hours</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy variable was the change from period-specific baseline in FEV1 at 12 hours, calculated as FEV1 measured at 12 hours postdose after subtracting period-specific baseline FEV1 at each treatment period.
The period-specific baseline FEV1 was measured at predose within 5 minutes of AM dose administration at each treatment visit. If that value was missing, then FEV1 measured at 30 minutes predose was used as the period-specific baseline.</description>

    <measure>Patients With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Experiences (TEAE) During the Treatment Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 up to Day 35</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs were recorded during each double-blind treatment. In addition, at the end of each treatment, patients continued to use 2 inhalations of Fp MDPI 50 mcg (100 mcg total dose) twice daily, so adverse events during this treatment were assigned to Fp MDPI 50 mcg.
An adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relationship of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical in</description>

        <title>Standardized Baseline-Adjusted Area Under the Curve For Forced Expiratory Volume In 1 Second Over 12 Hours Post-dose (FEV1 AUC0-12)</title>
        <description>Standardized baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUC0-12 was defined as the area under the curve for baseline-adjusted FEV1 measurements from the predose to 12 hours postdose time points using the trapezoidal rule based on actual (not scheduled) time of measurement and was standardized by dividing the actual time of last non-missing FEV1 measurement. Baseline-adjusted FEV1 was calculated as postdose FEV1 after subtracting period-specific baseline FEV1. The period-specific baseline FEV1 was measured at predose within 5 minutes of AM dose administration at each treatment visit. If that value was missing, then FEV1 measured at 30 minutes predose was used as the period-specific baseline.</description>
        <time_frame>Pre-dose: 30 minutes prior, within 5 minutes of dose. Post-dose: 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12 hours</time_frame>
        <population>The full analysis set (FAS) included all subjects in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 evaluable standardized baseline-adjusted FEV1 AUC0-12.</population>
