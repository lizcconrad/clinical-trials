  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled, cross over single meal study is to investigate
      the metabolic effects of a breakfast rich in dairy proteins and to determine biomarkers for
      their intake. The results from this project will increase our knowledge about nutritional
      value of dairy proteins, which is necessary to decide whether dairy products can be
      recommended for prevention of weight related bone loss.
