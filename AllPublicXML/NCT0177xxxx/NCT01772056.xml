  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relapsing nature of atopic dermatitis (AD) presents a challenge for its long-term
      treatment. Efficacy and safety of corticosteroids have been proven in the acute treatment of
      AD, but not its efficacy and security to reduce or prevent relapses.

      Objectives To investigate long-term management (16 weeks) of AD with fluticasone propionate
      (FP) 0,05% cream twice weekly in addition to an emollient (vehicle) after stabilization of an
      acute flare of AD with FP cream.

  <detailed_description>

      Patients 2-10 years of age with a history of mild to moderate AD will be eligible for this
      multicentre, randomized, double-blind, controlled study if they present an acute flare of AD
      (&lt;30% affected body surface area; no head). After successful treatment of the flare in an
      acute phase, patients will receive either, FP twice weekly plus vehicle or vehicle alone over
      a 16-week maintenance phase. The primary study end point will be probability of a relapse of
      AD occurring. We will conduct survivor analysis of results.
