  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RISE Pediatric Medication Study is a 2-arm, 4-center, clinical trial of children with
      prediabetes and early type 2 diabetes to address the hypothesis that aggressive glucose
      lowering will lead to recovery of beta-cell function that will be sustained after withdrawal
      of treatment. Pediatric participants (ages 10-19) will be randomized to one of the following
      treatment regimens: (1) metformin alone or (2) early intensive treatment with basal insulin
      glargine followed by metformin.

      The primary clinical question RISE will address is: Are improvements in ß-cell function
      following 12 months of active treatment maintained for 3 months following the withdrawal of
      therapy? Secondary outcomes will assess durability of glucose tolerance following withdrawal
      of therapy, and whether biomarkers obtained in the fasting state predict parameters of ß-cell
      function, insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance and the response to an intervention.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Fasting plasma glucose ≥90 mg/dl plus 2-hour glucose ≥140 mg/dl on 75 gm OGTT plus
             laboratory-based HbA1c ≤8.0% if treatment naïve. There is no upper limit for the
             2-hour glucose on OGTT. In those taking metformin laboratory-based HbA1c must be ≤7.5%
             if on metformin for &lt;3 months and ≤7.0% if on metformin for 3-6 months.
