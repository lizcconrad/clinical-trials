    <textblock>
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is most prevalent among women. SUI is characterized by loss
      of urine from increased abdominal pressures caused by coughing, laughing, sneezing, running,
      lifting or walking. SUI cause women to avoid routine physical activities, thus detracting
      significantly from their quality of life.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of new designs of the TIPI device, a
      conservative, disposable, treatment for temporary management of SUI.

    <measure>Mean Percentage of Pad Weight Gain (PWG) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 8 hours of use</time_frame>
    <description>All eligible subjects underwent a 3-day Pad period to establish baseline Average PWG. During this period, pre-weighed pads were worn for 8 hours a day and subjects were asked to perform predefined physical activities and drink a certain amount of liquid, daily. Pads were collected and weighed in the clinic to determine baseline urine leakage. Subjects then used SMDs or the cleared TIPI (G3) with pads for up to 8 hours. The average PWG tests results with the TIPI devices were compared to the average PWG 8 hrs test without the device and were presented as percentages.
The efficacy endpoint for the study was mean percent change of PWG using a certain device compared to the values obtained at the baseline period, as calculated by the following formula:
% Reduction = 1-(Device/Baseline )*100
Where, Device = the average pad weight gain (PWG) during device usage. Baseline = the average pad weight gain (PWG) during the days of baseline period.</description>
