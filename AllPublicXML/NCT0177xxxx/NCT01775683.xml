    <textblock>
      Homeless men and women suffer more illness and sooner death compared to housed people. Among
      the homeless, there is a group that suffers more illness than others. This group is usually
      homeless for several months, makes up a smaller proportion of homeless people and uses more
      resources from emergency shelters than other homeless people. Some have asked if a difference
      in thinking skills explains how people who are homeless for a long time need more help in
      getting and keeping housing compared to other homeless persons.

      In this study, thinking skills that help a person plan and make decisions will be screened
      among those who have been homeless for a long time and those who were homeless for a short
      time. If there is a difference, then screening may change how future homeless people get the
      help they need.
