      The purpose of this study is to test a new computerized training program as well as to find
      out whether the computer training might help people who have schizophrenia. The investigators
      will study the effects of the computer training on how people with schizophrenia think about
      social interaction and on their social skills. At completion of training, TARA subjects will
      show improvement on measures of social cognition compared to their baseline performance.

      This study employs two computerized programs: TARA (the treatment program), and a set of
      ordinary computer games (the active control program). Participants will be asked to use their
      assigned program (treatment or active control) for one hour per session, for four-five
      sessions per week, over 8-10 weeks (40 total sessions). Several elements of flexibility are
      allowed in the schedule to accommodate the challenges that people with ASD can face.

    <description>TARA is a computerized social cognitive (SC) remediation program consisting of a set of specific SC exercises. The program creates a game-like experience where the participant is encouraged to earn points and in-game rewards to further advance in each 'game'. Participants perform tens to hundred of trials over the course of their session, with each trial providing auditory and visual feedback and rewards to indicate if the trial was performed correctly or incorrectly. After each trial, the difficulty of the next trial is updated to ensure that within each session, the participant gets ~85% of trials correct. Summary screens including game metrics (points, levels) and exercise metrics (usage, progress) are shown to the participant at the end of each session.
Participants in the TARA computer-based exercises arm will complete baseline- assessments, 24 hours of TARA computer based-exercises, and repeat post-assessments.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The investigators will study outpatient volunteer subjects who have schizophrenia,
             schizophreniform disorder or schizoaffective disorder and have experienced their first
             psychotic episode within the past 5 years, who are clinically stable, and who are
             between the ages of 18 and 35 years. Approximately 35-40% of the subjects recruited
             will be female, approximately 50-60% of potential subjects will be Euro-American,
             10-20% will be Asian-American, 15-20% Latino, 15-20% African-American. The subject
             sample will reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of Northern California and the
             prevalence of schizophrenia across gender in this age period.

          -  The investigators will study volunteer subjects at high risk for psychosis who are
             clinically stable, and who are between the ages of 12-35. Approximately 35-40% of the
             subjects recruited will be female, approximately 50-60% of potential subjects will be
             Euro-American, 10-20% will be Asian-American, 15-20% Latino, 15-20% African-American.
             Our subject sample will reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of the San Francisco
             Bay Area.

          -  The study will have volunteer healthy controls matched by age and gender to our
             subjects at high risk for psychosis.

          -  The study subjects will not have their medications changed by the study researchers.
             If a subject's personal doctor changes a medication, the change will simply be
             documented by the study researchers.

          -  Investigators will recruit subjects with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia,
             schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder with first psychotic episode within the
             last 5 years, good general physical health; age between 12 and 35 years; Is fluent and
             proficient in the English language; no neurological disorder. In addition, all
             subjects must have achieved clinical stability, defined as outpatient status for at
             least 3 months prior to study participation, plus stable doses of psychiatric
             medications for at least one month prior to study participation using the following
             operationalized definition: stable low to moderate dose of antipsychotic medication
             (&lt;1000 mg. chlorpromazine equivalents) for at least 4 weeks prior to study, plus
             stable doses of all other psychotropic medications (anticholinergics, benzodiazepines)
             for at least 4 weeks prior to entry. However, subjects are not required to be on
             medications during participation. Minors must have parental/legal guardian consent to
             participate. Although investigators request that a family member also participate in
             the clinical assessments, this is not required for a participant to be eligible.

        This study will also recruit subjects who meet criteria for a Prodromal Syndrome as defined
        on the SIPS:

          -  Attenuated Positive Prodromal Syndrome: Ideas of reference, odd beliefs or magical
             thinking, paranoid ideation, odd thinking and speech, odd behavior and appearance that
             are at a prodromal level of intensity that is rated at the level of 3-5 on the Scale
             of Prodromal Symptoms (SOPS). Symptoms must occur at an average frequency of at least
             once per week in the past month.

          -  Brief Intermittent Psychotic Syndrome: Positive symptoms rated at psychotic intensity
             as a score of 6 on the SOPS that are not disorganizing or dangerous, do not last more
             than 1 hour per day at an average frequency of four days per week over one month, and
             have begun in the past three months, currently present at least several minutes a day
             at a frequency of at least once per month.

          -  Genetic Risk and Deterioration Syndrome: Schizotypal personality disorder OR first
             degree relative with a DSM-IV psychotic disorder, PLUS significant decrease in
             functioning defined as 30% or greater drop in GAF score during the last month compared
             to 12 months ago.

          -  High Risk Syndromes: Individuals who experience subthreshold psychotic symptoms
             without restrictions on frequency of onset, functional impairment, or family history
             of psychosis.

          -  Investigators will recruit age and gender matched healthy comparison subjects who do
             not meet criteria for any Axis I diagnosis on the SCID. They cannot meet prodromal
             criteria on the Prodromal Questionnaire administered during the screening.

          -  All subjects must be in good general physical health; Fluent and proficient in the
             English language.

          -  Minors must have parental/legal guardian consent to participate. Although
             investigators request that a family member also participate in the clinical
             assessments, this is not required for a proband to be eligible.

          -  Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia do not need to be within the 5 years of
             onset, as that might have passed while in the first part of the study. Also, they must
             be at least 18 years of age due to the developmental considerations for the social
             cognition software of someone who is under the age of 18. The 16 healthy controls also
             run in this part of the study will be age and gender matched to the individuals with a
             diagnosis of schizophrenia.
