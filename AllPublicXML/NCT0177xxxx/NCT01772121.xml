  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will define the substantial disease burden associated with viral hepatitis in
      India, and provide a foundation to understand the host and viral determinants of disease
      pathogenesis that may ultimately impact treatment decisions and outcome
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to correlate the host and viral genetics of patients
      infected with viral hepatitis with their clinical presentation. This study will provide the
      first nation-wide estimate of key host genetic polymorphisms associated with immune response,
      such as in the IL28B gene locus which has been associated with treatment outcomes in
      hepatitis C. Characterization of HCV and HBV viral genotypes and sub-types across different
      geographic regions will allow for an exploration of associations between host and viral
      genotypes. Another objective of this study is to identify co-morbid illness and metabolic
      factors that are associated with chronic liver disease due to viral hepatitis. Finally, this
      survey will explore patient awareness of their disease, risk factors for disease progression,
      and their treatment options

      A portion of the blood drawn at the study visits will be frozen and stored. Stored blood
      samples may be used by the Sponsor or its research partners for HCV/HBV
      genotyping/phenotyping assays (as applicable) or their development or for retesting the
      amount of HCV/HBV in the blood. At the conclusion of this study, these samples may be
      retained in storage by Gilead Sciences or a designee for a period up to 10 years
