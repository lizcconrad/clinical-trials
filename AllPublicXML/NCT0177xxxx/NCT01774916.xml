    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) rare congenital high-flow vascular
      malformations in which arteries and veins are directly connected through a complex web of
      abnormal arteries and veins instead of a normal capillary network. Arterial feeders and
      enlarged draining veins directly connect through arteriovenous fistulas that create the
      &quot;nidus&quot;. The natural history of AVMs is organized into a clinical staging system: during the
      first phase of quiescence, the arteriovenous malformation mimics a capillary malformation.
      After many years, the AVM may enlarge with loco-regional expansion and tissular destruction.
      At the ultimate stage, AVM may impact the heart function. They are considered non malignant
      but can expand and become a significant clinical risk when extensive. The management of these
      high flow AVM remains often problematic. Complete and large surgical excision of the nidus
      after hyperselective embolization is the only potential therapeutic solution but this, is
      often difficult if not impossible. There is no pathogenetic hypothesis for the development of
      these malformations. Histopathological examination (performed only on surgical resection
      specimen) is poor and does not provide sufficient evidence to assess the evolutivity or the
      severity of the MAV. Recent data hypothesize that these vascular malformations are associated
      with alterations of the vascular endothelium caused by genetic abnormalities involved in the
      control of angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. The detection of these anomalies allows the
      search for cellular and genetic markers that might be useful to optimize the clinical
      classification, staging, predicting the evolution of these defects and some understanding of
      its pathophysiological mechanisms. To our knowledge, no studies to identify cellular markers
      / genetic and endothelial associated with the development of cutaneous AVMs have been
      published to date.
