    <textblock>
      This trial will be test the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of GS-4774 (GI-13020) in
      various doses and dosing regimens in healthy adults at one center in the US. Subjects will be
      enrolled into 3 arms using a dose escalation scheme and randomized into one of two dosing
      regimen cohorts. There will be 10 subjects per arm/cohort (total of 60 subjects to achieve 48
      evaluable subjects enrolled), with study completion in 9-12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HBV specific T cell responses have been shown to have a positive association with infection
      status in patients with chronic HBV, with the weakest T cell responses in patients with
      untreated chronic active infection and the strongest T cell responses in patients who have
      achieved seroconversion or cure (4). We have generated a Tarmogen expressing well conserved
      regions of the HBV X, S, and core antigens (GS-4774). GS-4774 is immunogenic in murine models
      and has also been used to stimulate human immune cell samples ex vivo to elicit HBV specific
      T cell responses which could predict the immune responses in patients dosed with GS-4774.
      GS-4774 will be evaluated in this healthy volunteer study to assess its safety, tolerability,
      and ability to elicit HBV specific T cell responses. In the future GS-4774 could be used in
      combination with HBV antivirals, such as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, in an attempt to
      improve HBsAg seroconversion (cure) rates in patients with chronic HBV infection.
