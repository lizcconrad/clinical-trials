  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new diagnostic research agent named
      89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A can show prostate cancer tumors on a PET scan; as well as see how long
      89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A lasts in the blood when given in small amounts. DFO-MSTP2109A is an
      antibody that works against STEAP1 - found on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Attached
      to the DFO-MSTP2109A is a radioactive material called 89ZR, which allows it to be imaged by a
      PET scanner. The results of this study may help researchers know whether 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A
      can be used as a diagnostic agent for finding prostate cancer that have STEAP1 on its surface
      with a PET scanner. The reason why identifying STEAP1 on prostate cancer cells is that new
      therapies are being developed to target STEAP1 prostate cancer cells.

    <description>Antibody imaging will be considered feasible if 75% of the patients are antibody-imaging-positive. We will enroll 6 patients (cohort 1A) at the 10mg dose level for an initial decision on feasibility. If 4 or more of these patients have 20% or more of their active lesions detectable by 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A then we will consider the agent feasible for imaging, otherwise we will proceed to cohort 1B. If the true feasibility rate is 40%, this rule will affords more than 82% chance that cohort 1B will be opened for enrollment; this probability is less than 17% if the true feasibility is 75%.</description>

    <description>All adverse events will be graded for intensity on a scale of 0 to 5. Severity grades will be recorded and based on the CTCAE v4.0.Adverse events will be defined graded using CTCAE V4.0. The safety and tolerability of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A will be assessed using the following primary safety outcome measures: Incidence and nature of incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events; and change in vital signs and clinical laboratory results. Incidence and severity of adverse events will be summarized with descriptive statistics.</description>

    <description>The first group of participants will include 6 participants whom will receive 10mg of 89Zr-DFO-MSTP2109A. A second group of 6 participants may receive twice the amount of antibody to determine if this results in better pictures of your tumors. Once we determine whether 10 mg or the larger 20 mg dose of 89Zr-DFOMSTP2109A is best and well tolerated we will use that amount for future participants in Group 2.</description>

    <description>If you are enrolled onto Group 1:
Once you are given the diagnostic agent, the following procedures will be done:
PET scans at the approximate times:
1-4 hours after the injection
24 hours after the injection (the next day, Day 2)
48-120 hours after the injection (on either Day 3, 4, or 5)
144-168 hours after the injection (on either Day 6, 7, or 8) You will also have research bloods drawn on the following times and days,
Day 1: before the injection, approximately 5 minutes after, 30 minutes after, 1 hour after and 2-4 hours after the injection.
At each time of your scheduled PET scan.</description>
