      The investigators will compare with PEG+ascorbic acid and picosulfate+magnesium citrate about
      bowel preparation, patient's satisfaction, side effects to identify effectiveness of new

      The investigators can find easily colon cancer and poly by colonoscopy, but bowel preparation
      is very important to find the lesion. Desirable bowel preparation drug must be clearly
      removed stool, effective on colonoscopic finding and pathologic finding, quickly
      administrated agent and eliminated stool, comfort for patient, and less side effects.

      PEG is very safe osmotic laxative. New agent(coolprep) which add ascorbic acid is less salty
      and less volume. Picosulfate+magnesium citrate(picolyte) taste orange, can be easily prepared
      bowel for colonoscopy by good taste and small volume. Magnesium with citrate acts like
      osmotic agent, picosulfate acts irritant agent.

      The investigators will compare with PEG+ascorbic acid and picosulfate+magnesium citrate about
      bowel preparation, patient's satisfaction, side effects to identify effectiveness of new
      bowel preparation drug.

        This study will include a total of 250 patients. All patient randomized PEG+ascorbica
        acid(coolprep) and picosulfate magnesium citrate(picolyte), each group will include 125
        patients.

        The investigators decided sample size to 200 patients after comparing Ottawa scale. The
        investigators assumed there would be defference about 20 percent of bowel preparation
        between them. Recently, Ottawa scale of bowel preparation reported about 5 points. The
        investigators assumed that there could be differences between them about 1 point. The
        investigators decided each groups per 100 patients, if significance level was 0.05 and test
        power is 80 percent. The investigators start this study with a total of 220 patients
        because 10 percent of 200 patients could be drop out. The investigators readjust about 30
        patients after interim analysis.
