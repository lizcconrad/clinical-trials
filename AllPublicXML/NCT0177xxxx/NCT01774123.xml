      To evaluate the ability of different spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)
      devices, as well as different acquisition and analysis packages, to detect disease
      progression in patients with multiple sclerosis with and without a history of optic neuritis

      Optical coherence tomography imaging of the retina has been shown to be an effective non
      invasive method to study retinal changes associated with multiple sclerosis induced optic
      neuritis. The retina is a unique structure in that it is an unmyelinated part of the central
      nervous system (CNS). However, it is uncertain which layer of the retina provides the best
      correlation with MS disease. The investigators propose a prospective, case-control study to
      compare OCT measurements from different parts of the retina of MS patients with optic
      neuritis, those without optic neuritis, and healthy controls. The investigators will then
      correlate the OCT measurements to clinical measures of disease. This will allow future
      studies to use OCT technology as a primary outcome in studying MS axonal and cell body injury
      of the CNS, as well as evaluating strategies in treating MS.

        Prospective, case-control study of patients from the Mellen Center and Cole Eye Institute
        of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland Ohio. The study population will consist of MS patients
        with a prior history optic neuritis in one eye. The affected eye will serve as cases for
        the study. The contralateral, unaffected eye will be used as the control. Controls will
        also be recruited from MS patients without a history of optic neuritis and from healthy
        individuals from Cole Eye Institute.
