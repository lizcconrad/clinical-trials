  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The time window for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator treatment in
      ischemic stroke patients has been extended to 4.5h. Little is known about intravenous
      recombinant tissue plasminogen activator use in the 3-4.5 hour time window among Chinese
      stroke patients. This exploratory study was to describe the feasibility and outcome of
      treatment with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the expanded time
      window, and to offer suggestions for future clinical work in China.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Favorable clinical outcome of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was
      assessed by absolute changes in the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24
      hours and by the improvement of modified Rankin Scale score at discharge or 6-month
      follow-up. The safety of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was assessed by
      the rate of mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage and other common complications. Multivariate
      logistic regression models were used to evaluate factors associated with favorable clinical
      outcome.
