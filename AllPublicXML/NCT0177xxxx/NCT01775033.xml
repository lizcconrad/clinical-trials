      The OUTREACH project will develop, implement and evaluate an organized system of regional
      pediatric emergency care in rural western Pennsylvania. Toward that end the investigators
      have developed three broad goals: (1) to define the key barriers and potential solutions to
      regionalized pediatric emergency care through community stakeholder engagement; (2) to
      implement a regionalized system of pediatric emergency care using education, community
      outreach and telemedicine; and (3) evaluate the impact of the system on health care access
      and outcomes for rural children. The investigators will implement the intervention in a
      sample of rural hospitals in Pennsylvania using a staggered roll-out design, and compare
      outcomes of children seen in these hospitals to similar matched hospitals in the state, using
      Pennsylvania state Medicaid data to evaluate the impact of the intervention.
