    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety by defining the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) of Choloroquine when combined with Gemcitabine, and to evaluate preliminary efficacy of
      combined systemic Gemcitabine and Chloroquine. In addition, the influence of the treatment on
      the anti-cancer immunity and the value of GOLPH2 as serum marker for pancreatic cancer will
      be assessed within a translational objective.
