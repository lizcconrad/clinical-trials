    <textblock>
      The overarching aim of the proposed study is to assess whether omega-3 fatty acids
      supplementation can augment the effects of methylphenidate in children with ADHD. The
      investigators hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation will be associated with
      improved ADHD symptoms.
