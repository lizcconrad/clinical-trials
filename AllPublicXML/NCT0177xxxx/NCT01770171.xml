    <textblock>
      Wright et al (Anticancer Res, 2000) reported the results of a retrospective study on 11
      patients with advanced/recurrent endometrial cancers. All patients had multi-site disease and
      were heavily pretreated with a median of 3 prior chemotherapy regimens. All received
      bevacizumab combination therapy which was well-tolerated. Two patients had partial responses,
      3 had stable disease, while 5 patients progressed. One subject was not assessable for
      response. The median progression-free interval was 5.4 months for the entire cohort and 8.7
      months for those who achieved clinical benefit (PR or SD). The authors concluded that
      Bevacizumab was well-tolerated and displayed promising anti-neoplastic activity in patients
      with endometrial cancer.The rationale for combining anti-angiogenic agents, including
      anti-VEGF antibodies, with cytotoxic chemotherapy stems from a number of preclinical studies
      showing additive and synergistic anti-tumour activity in a number of solid tumour types. By
      combining VEGF-targeting agents such as bevacizumab with conventional chemotherapies, it is
      hoped that these agents will act synergistically, thereby enhancing their anti-tumour
      efficacy and controlling disease progression.

      The addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy has been shown to improve PFS and/or OS in a
      series of large, randomized Phase III clinical trials in a wide range of tumour types,
      including mCRC, non-squamous NSCLC, metastatic BC (mBC) and mRCC.
