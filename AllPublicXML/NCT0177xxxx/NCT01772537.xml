  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alzheimer's disease represents a growing public health problem in developed countries.
      Although the pathogenesis is not clearly defined, accumulation of extracellular amyloid,
      neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss are the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. The
      effect of anesthetic agents on changes in these proteins in humans is not well characterized,
      but in-vitro evidence suggests that anesthetic agents can accelerate potential pathogenic
      mechanisms, such as increasing amyloid formation or rates of apoptosis in cultured cells and
      increasing amyloid levels in mice. Human data on the effect of anesthetic agents on amyloid
      and tau proteins is limited to a small series of 11 patients and showed a significant
      increase in tau levels after exposure to anesthetics. In this study the investigators propose
      to measure CSF and serum biomarkers in a population of patients with normal CSF dynamics, who
      are undergoing surgery for repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The investigators will also
      obtain preliminary data on whether changes in CSF levels of these proteins are associated
      with postoperative delirium or cognitive change.

    <description>Delirium was measured using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Confusion Assessment Method- Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) based upon post-operative location of patient. The patients were divided into to two groups, patients that had an open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair versus patients that had stenting of their aneurysms. Patients that had stenting of their aneurysms were also randomized to receive either Propofol or Isoflurane as for their anesthetic.</description>

        <description>Delirium was measured using the Confusion Assessment Method and the Confusion Assessment Method- Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) based upon post-operative location of patient. The patients were divided into to two groups, patients that had an open thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair versus patients that had stenting of their aneurysms. Patients that had stenting of their aneurysms were also randomized to receive either Propofol or Isoflurane as for their anesthetic.</description>
