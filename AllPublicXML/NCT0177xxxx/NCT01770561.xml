  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect performance data on the integrated sensor and
      infusion set during 3 days of use and demonstrate performance adequacy of the Integrated
      sensor and infusion set with glucose sensing and insulin delivery functionalities. The
      hypothesis of this study is that having the infusion of insulin in close proximity to the
      sensor does not interfere with the sensor accuracy.

      Sensor clinical accuracy will be evaluated based on the following parameters: Mean ARD
      (absolute relative difference), median ARD, Clarke Grid Analysis. Meter BG values will be
      used as reference. Descriptive statistics will be used to assess non-inferiority of the
      Integrated sensor and infusion sets sensors compare to control Enlite sensors.

      Insulin delivery functionality will be evaluated based on BG profiles obtained during
      peri-prandial periods during which BG measurements will be performed at 15, 20, 30 min
      intervals according to a SMBG schedule. Post-prandial pharmacodynamic profiles will be
      analyzed to demonstrate the effect of insulin delivered using the Integrated sensor and
      infusion set. Specifically, rise in glucose levels followed by their fall will be used as an
      indication that insulin was delivered and absorbed. Post-prandial BG areas under the curve
      (AUC), Tmax (time to maximum rise of BG), and Cmax (maximum post-prandial BG) values will be
      calculated for each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) consumed during both inpatient days
      and compared. Intra - and inter-subject mean values and standard deviations will be
      calculated. Paired and unpaired T-tests will be used to evaluate statistical significance.

      Longevity of device performance will be assessed by comparing the listed parameters obtained
      during two inpatient days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 21-70 years of age at time of screening

          2. Subject has a clinical diagnose of type 1 diabetes, as determined by investigator

          3. Subject has one or more established insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios

          4. Subject has one or more established insulin correction ratios

          5. Subject is currently using a Medtronic insulin pump and has been so for a minimum of 3
             months at time of enrollment.

          6. Subject has been using insulin for more than one year.
