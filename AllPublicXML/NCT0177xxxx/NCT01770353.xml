      This study is conducted over two phases. The pilot phase of this trial is closed. The
      expansion phase of this trial has completed enrolment, patients are still ongoing.

      Pilot Phase: This study will enroll approximately 12 patients, up to 20 in total in the Pilot
      Phase and 30 patients in the Expansion Phase. The first three patients that are enrolled can
      have any solid tumor type; however subsequent patients must have Non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC), Colorectal cancer (CRC), Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), Estrogen
      Receptor/Progesterone Receptor (ER/PR) positive breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, ovarian
      cancer, gastric cancer, gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma or head and neck cancer.
      No more than three patients with ER/PR positive breast cancer can be enrolled in the Pilot
      Phase and similar restrictions may be placed on other tumor types to ensure a heterogeneous
      population.

      Expansion Phase: The expansion will enroll patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer
      into three cohorts of 10 patients each depending on sub-type of breast cancer:

      Cohort 1: ER and/or PR-positive breast cancer Cohort 2: TNBC Cohort 3: BC with active brain
      metastasis
