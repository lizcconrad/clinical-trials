        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients aged 18 years older.

          -  Present with histologically proven or cytological diagnosis of NSCLC Stage IIIA as
             defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Criteria for Lung Cancer,
             that is amenable to surgery.

          -  No prior systemic chemotherapy or targeted therapy for lung cancer before screening.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Life expectancy ≥12 weeks.

          -  Adequate hematological function:Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥1.5 x 109/L, and
             Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L, and Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL (may be transfused to maintain or
             exceed this level).

          -  Adequate liver function: Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN);Aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 x ULN in subjects without
             liver metastases; ≤ 5 x ULN in subjects with liver metastases.

          -  Adequate renal function:Serum creatinine ≤ 1.25 x ULN, and creatinine clearance ≥ 60
             ml/min.

          -  Female subjects should not be pregnant or breast-feeding.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior exposure to agents directed at the HER axis (e.g. erlotinib,
             gefitinib, cetuximab, trastuzumab).

          -  Patients with prior chemotherapy or therapy with systemic anti-tumour therapy (e.g.
             monoclonal antibody therapy).

          -  History of another malignancy in the last 5 years with the exception of the
             following:Other malignancies cured by surgery alone and having a continuous
             disease-free interval of 5 years are permitted; Cured basal cell carcinoma of the skin
             and cured in situ carcinoma of the uterine cervix are permitted.

          -  Any unstable systemic disease (including active infection, uncontrolled hypertension,
             unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the previous
             year, serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, hepatic, renal, or metabolic
             disease).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to Tarceva or gemcitabine or cisplatin.

          -  Eye inflammation or eye infection not fully treated or conditions predisposing the
             subject to this.

          -  Evidence of any other disease, neurological or metabolic dysfunction, physical
             examination or laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or
             condition that contraindicated the use of an investigational drug or puts the subject
             at high risk for treatment-related complications.
