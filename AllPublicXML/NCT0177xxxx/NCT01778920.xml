      The goal of this study is to perform imaging of patient's tumors while the chest is open and
      the tumor is being removed.

      According to the World Health Organization, lung cancer is the most common cause of
      cancer-related death in men and women, and is responsible for 1.3 million deaths worldwide
      annually as of 2004. Surgery remains the best option for patients presenting with operable
      Stage I or II cancers, however the five year survival rate for these candidates remains at a
      dismal 53% for Stage I and 32% for Stage II. The high rates of recurrence suggest that
      surgeons are unable to completely detect and remove primary tumor nodules in a satisfactory
      manner as well as lingering metastases in sentinel lymph nodes. By ensuring a negative margin
      through imaging during surgery it would be possible for us to improve the rates of recurrence
      free patients and thus overall survival.

      Thoracic malignancies are the ideal disease to investigate intra-operative imaging. Over 85%
      of lung and pleural malignancies express folate receptor alpha (FRA). It is important to note
      that FRA is expressed only in the proximal tubules of the kidneys, activated macrophages, and
      in the choroidal plexus. Thus, the false positive detection rate is expected to be extremely
      low. A group well known to us in the Netherlands has completed a pilot study utilizing a
      folate-fluorescein isothiocyanate (folate-FITC) conjugate in 12 patients with ovarian cancer.
      Another group of investigators in Mayo have subsequently performed this study on 20 more
      patients without any serious adverse events (personal communication). They report excellent
      sensitivity and specificity with this technique with only grade 1 side effects (allergic
      reaction). All side effects reversed when the injection was halted. Patients with a history
      of allergic reactions to insect bites should not participate (fluorescein is derived from the
      firefly insect, folate is an essential vitamin).
