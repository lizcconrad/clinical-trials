  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Experimental hyperglycemia (5 hours) will be induced via a constant- or fluctuating-rate
      glucose infusion to establish different patterns of glycemia in healthy individuals. The
      effects of these acute models of hyperglycemia on the adaptations to a single aerobic
      exercise bout will be tested. Changes in pancreatic endocrine function, insulin sensitivity,
      endothelial function, and oxidative stress will be measured.

    <description>At T = 0 h participants will undergo an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, 0.33 g/kg glucose) immediately followed by a 4-hour rest period. At T = 5 h, participants will undertake 45 minutes of moderate-intensity (70% VO2max) bicycle ergometry. Immediately following (T = 6 h) and 1- (T = 7 h), 3- (T = 9 h), and 18- hours (T = 24 h) after exercise, participants will undergo additional IVGTTs.</description>

    <description>At T = 0 h participants will undergo an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, 0.33 g/kg glucose) immediately followed by a 4-hour rest period. During this time, steady-state hyperglycemia (~10 mM) will be induced experimentally via a variable-rate intravenous infusion of 20% dextrose. At T = 5 h, participants will undertake 45 minutes of moderate-intensity (70% VO2max) bicycle ergometry. Immediately following (T = 6 h) and 1- (T = 7 h), 3- (T = 9 h), and 18- hours (T = 24 h) after exercise, participants will undergo additional IVGTTs.</description>

    <description>At T = 0 h participants will undergo an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT, 0.33 g/kg glucose) immediately followed by a 4-hour rest period. During this time, fluctuating hyperglycemia (~8-15 mM) will be induced by intravenously injecting 0.15 g/kg boluses of 20% dextrose every 30 minutes. At T = 5 h, participants will undertake 45 minutes of moderate-intensity (70% VO2max) bicycle ergometry. Immediately following (T = 6 h) and 1- (T = 7 h), 3- (T = 9 h), and 18- hours (T = 24 h) after exercise, participants will undergo additional IVGTTs.</description>
