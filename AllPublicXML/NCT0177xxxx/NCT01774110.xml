      A. Specific Aims:

      1. There is one specific aim of this study. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of early
      standardized task-specific training (ESTT) in persons with acute stroke.

      B. Hypothesis:

      1. It is our hypothesis that subjects who receive ESTT will walk faster and more
      symmetrically than published reports of gait outcomes in persons with stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is our contention that gait recovery after stroke is impacted by the interventions that
      are acutely utilized during training. There is not a consensus about how to most effectively
      train individuals after stroke. It is clear, however, that most persons are left with
      significant and often debilitating gait dysfunction after stroke so there is an urgent need
      to find more effective therapeutic methods.

    <measure>Change in Walking Velocity From Initial Assessment to Completion of Study at 6 Months Post Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be done at the time of discharge from inpatient rehabilitation (the initial assessment point of the study) and at 6-months post enrollment.</time_frame>
    <description>Computerized gait analysis is done by a mat system (GAITRite) that electronically calculates the velocity.</description>

    <time_frame>This test will be done at the initiation of the protocol (initial assessment) and at 6 months post enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM) is a test of motor recovery after stroke. There are 3 subsections of the test, an upper extremity section, a lower extremity section and a mobility section. Each section is scored independently and is normed to 100 points. Each of the 3 sections is then combined into a total overall function score which is also normed to 100. Therefore, a score of 100 represents full recovery whereas a score of 50 represents about 50% recovery from the stroke.</description>
