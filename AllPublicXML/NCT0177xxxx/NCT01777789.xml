      The purpose of the study is to use functional MRI (fMRI) to measure brain connectivity in
      middle-aged individuals with different levels of body fat. The ultimate goal of this research
      is to develop an early diagnostic tool for Alzheimer's disease.

        -  Body composition scan

        -  Cognitive screen

        -  Neurological exam

        -  MRI scan
