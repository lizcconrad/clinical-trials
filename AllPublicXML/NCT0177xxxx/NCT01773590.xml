  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of interplay between allergy (IgE and
      Th2 mediated inflammation) and virus infection in the development of asthma, as well as the
      risk and severity of acute exacerbations of asthma. Understanding these mechanisms should
      identify new approaches for novel therapies for the prevention of asthma development and for
      prevention/treatment of asthma exacerbations. Such treatment has potential to have a major
      impact on patient quality of life and to result in enormous reductions in health care costs.

      A human model will be used to identify dysregulated genes/proteins and determine
      relationships with disease outcomes. This study will compare lower airway responses between
      asthmatic and healthy control subjects undergoing rhinovirus (RV) experimental infection
      (subjects will be infected with rhinovirus as part of the study). This will have the dual
      advantage of investigating mechanisms in the most natural model possible, as well as
      developing a better model for testing novel therapeutic approaches. The investigators will
      analyse the samples from both subject groups, to determine their relevance to the human
      disease. Any genes/proteins shown to be dysregulated and related to disease outcomes in the
      human model will be very strong candidates for immediate translation into human intervention
      studies.

      Up to 12 asthmatic and/or healthy subjects will be recruited for a preliminary pilot study.
      These subjects will be ineligible to enter the main study due to the presence of neutralizing
      antibody to RV16 (~50% of subjects otherwise suitable for the study). These subjects will
      meet all other inclusion/exclusion criteria for the main study. The 12 participants will
      undergo tests including a single bronchoscopy, nasal sampling and blood tests allowing for
      optimisation of all sample processing techniques. They will not be infected with RV-16.

      In the main study the investigators will aim to study up to 15 healthy volunteers and 15
      volunteers with moderate asthma (all on inhaled steroid treatment). Subjects will undergo a
      single baseline bronchoscopy 2 weeks prior to inoculation with the RV16 virus. Following
      infection with the virus participants will be required to attend for regular sample
      collection including 2 further bronchoscopies post-infection. Patients will be followed until
      convalescence 6 weeks post infection.

    <description>The host response to RV challenge will be assessed daily for 8 days using methods including symptom diaries, lung function, detection of mediators in nasal and bronchial lining fluid, characterisation of different cell types in bronchoalveolar lavage as determined by flow cytometry. This will be compared with findings at baseline, day 11, 15 and up to 42 days post challenge.</description>
