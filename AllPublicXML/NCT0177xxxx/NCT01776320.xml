      Transdermal topical alprostadil has been approved for use in Canada as a treatment for
      erectile dysfunction. However, as this form of treatment is new, and Canada is the first
      country in the world to approve its use. There are very few published articles in literature
      to evaluate its clinical acceptance. By performing a Phase 4, Open-Label, Non-Randomized,
      Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy, Safety and Satisfaction of VITAROS (transdermal
      topical alprostadil) in Men with Erectile Dysfunction, this study can improve understanding
      of this method of treatment as compared to conventional treatment.
