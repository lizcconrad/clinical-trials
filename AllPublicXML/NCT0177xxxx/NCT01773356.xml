      The objective of this study is to test the effect of dihydrocapsiate on energy expenditure in
      women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Capsaicin, a substance found in chili pepper, is known to stimulate thermogenesis.
      Dihydrocapsiate, a capsinoid, found in the non-pungent CH-19 sweet pepper has similar
      thermogenic effects without the gastrointestinal side effects. The objective of this project
      is to test the effect of 12 weeks of daily consumption of 9 mg dihydrocapsiate on resting
      energy expenditure relative to baseline when compared to a control group consuming products
      without DCT.
