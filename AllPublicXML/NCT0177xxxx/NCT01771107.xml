      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab vedotin
      when given together with combination chemotherapy and to see how well they work in treating
      patients with stage II-IV human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma.
      Monoclonal antibodies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may block cancer growth in different ways
      by targeting certain cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer
      cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from
      spreading. Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy may kill more
      cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin
      when combined with the doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (AVD)
      chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma. (Phase
      I) II. Establish an estimate of the two-year progression-free survival (PFS) for participants
      with HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma when treated using brentuximab vedotin plus
      the AVD chemotherapy regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AVD and brentuximab vedotin with highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART).

      II. To estimate the partial response (PR) rate, complete response (CR) rate, overall survival
      (OS), and event free survival (EFS) at 2 and 5 years.

      III. To evaluate the effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on cluster of differentiation
      (CD)4 and CD8 counts after cycle 1, 4, at the end of therapy, and every 3 months after
      treatment completion for one year.

      IV. To investigate the prognostic value of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline, after cycle 2, and at treatment completion,
      with respect to 2-year progression free survival.

      V. To evaluate HAART status at baseline and to correlate this with tumor response to therapy
      and OS and PFS.

      VI. To characterize the histologic subtypes in HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the highly active
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era.

      VII. To assess the neurotoxicity of HAART in combination with AVD and brentuximab vedotin.

      VIII. To evaluate effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on viral load after cycles 1, 4, at
      the completion of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.

      IX. To perform pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies to determine drug levels during
      therapy.

      X. To perform micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profile analysis on the HIV-HL tumor specimens
      and to correlate miRNA expression with OS, PFS, tumor response to therapy, histologic subtype
      of HIV-HL, and HIV disease characteristics.

      XI. To perform tissue microarray analysis on HIV-HL tumor specimens and to correlate the
      markers studied with OS, PFS, and tumor response to therapy.

      XII. To identify Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor derived deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) in the plasma of study participants and to correlate these levels during therapy with
      disease response and OS. (Phase II) XIII. To identify cytokines in the plasma of participants
      during therapy that can be used as tumor and prognostic markers. (Phase II) XIV. To assess
      latent and expressed HIV reservoirs before, during, and post chemotherapy. To understand how
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents affect HIV expression.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), vinblastine sulfate IV, and
      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

             of the investigator and the use of investigational agents currently available on an
             expanded access basis is allowed; use of experimental antiretroviral agents or those
             containing zidovudine (including Combivir and Trizivir) or ritonavir (includes Norvir
             or Kaletra), cobicistat, didanosine (Videx or Videx EC), or similar potent cytochrome
             P450 (CYP)3 inhibitors are prohibited; in order to be eligible, participants taking
             zidovudine or ritonavir, or cobicistat, didanosine, or other CYP3 inhibitors must
             change to a different regimen 7 days prior to therapy initiation; changes to HAART
             therapy during the study may be made if medically necessary (toxicity, failure of
             regimen, etc.); participants must be on HAART at least 7 days prior to therapy

          -  Negative for hepatitis B, or if infected with hepatitis B, receiving anti-hepatitis B
             therapy; all participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis B; per
             Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) and Assistance for AIDS Specific Drugs
             (AASD) guidelines, those participants that show no immunity, defined by the lack of
             hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection (i.e.
             hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]+, hepatitis B core [HBcore]+, hepatitis B surface
             antibody [HBsAB]-) will be required to be on anti-hepatitis B therapy during the study
             in order to be eligible; patients will be permitted to enroll in the study provided
             normal liver function tests and no evidence of cirrhosis; the exact hepatitis B
             therapy will be at the discretion of the infection disease specialist or investigator;
             however all patients who present with acute hepatitis B or show normal transaminases
             and are hepatitis B virus HBsAg surface protein antigen (HBsAg) positive (+) and
             immunoglobulin M (IgM)+ for hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible for trial
             enrollment

          -  Patients diagnosed with hepatitis C who are hepatitis C antibody positive, whether
             hepatitis C RNA level is measurable or not, must have no evidence of cirrhosis and
             have liver function tests

          -  Participants must discontinue use of the following agents within 7 days prior to
             therapy

               -  Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors that treat HIV

               -  Other strong CYP3A inhibitors

               -  Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should be used with caution but are not excluded; if 2
                  moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are used concurrently, one must be discontinued at
                  least 7 days (1 week) prior to the initiation of chemotherapy

               -  P-glycoprotein inhibitors

               -  If patients are taking any of these excluded medications, they must be
                  discontinued at least 7 days (1 week) prior to the initiation of chemotherapy All
                  concomitant medications must be reviewed by the study chair or co-chair prior to
                  enrollment by email; because the lists of these agents are constantly changing,
                  it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a
                  list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior anthracycline therapy will be excluded

          -  Female participants who are pregnant or breast-feeding; confirmation that the subject
             is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta (b)-human chorionic
             gonadotropin (b-hCG) or urine pregnancy test result obtained during screening;
             pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women

          -  Medical illness unrelated to HL, which in the opinion of the study physician will
             preclude administration of chemotherapy safely; this includes patients with
             uncontrolled infection (including opportunistic), chronic renal failure, myocardial
             infarction (MI) within the past 6 months, unstable angina, or cardiac arrhythmias
             other than chronic atrial fibrillation, or second malignancy requiring active
             treatment

          -  Prior malignancy within 2 years before enrollment other than curatively treated
             cutaneous basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, anal
             intraepithelial neoplasia, or cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS); participants with prior
             malignancies must have completed all therapy at least 2 years before enrollment with
             no evidence of disease since therapy completion

          -  Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy

          -  Evidence of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) identified on the
             pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

          -  Central nervous system disease

          -  Patients with history of John Cunningham (JC) virus identified in the cerebrospinal
             fluid (CSF) or previous history of PML will be excluded from the study

          -  Cirrhosis secondary to any cause will be excluded
