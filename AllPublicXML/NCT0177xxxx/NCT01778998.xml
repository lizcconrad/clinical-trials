  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most recent advances in cataract surgery is microincisional phacoemulsification
      (MICS). Through small incisions of 2.0 mm and less the lens material is emulsified either
      bimanually or with a thin single coaxial hand-piece. The possible advantages are lower
      induced corneal astigmatism1, 2, possibly a lower incidence of infection due to higher
      resistance of the wound to deformation3 and a lower risk of complications such as iris
      prolapse during surgery in patients at risk such as with intraoperative floppy iris syndrome
      (IFIS). Additional factors that have to be taken into account are the construction and the
      position of the incision and the influence of the extraocular force on the wound morphology.4
      Another effect that may influence the wound architecture is stromal hydration at the end of
      surgery.5 Wound architecture has recently been assessed6-9 using optical coherence
      tomography. Elkady et al.10 observed the wound architecture in MICS cases focusing on corneal
      thickness and the incision angle. However, none of these studies observed the effect of the
      wound architecture on post-operative astigmatism. Furthermore, all observations in the past
      have been performed in the post-operative period only and information concerning the wound
      architecture intra-operatively is missing. A recently launched CE-marked intra-operative OCT
      allows observing the wound architecture intra-operatively.

      One aim of the study is to assess the influence of the intra-operative wound architecture
      using a similar grading system as used by Calladine and Packard (2007)7 on the resistance to
      deformation of the wound and the surgically induced astigmatism in MICS and small incision
      cataract surgery (SICS). In a second part of this exploratory study the effect of a hinged
      incision with a pre-cut should be assessed along the same line
