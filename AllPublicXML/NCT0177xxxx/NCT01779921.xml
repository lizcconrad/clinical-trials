  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted globally. The aim of this study is to describe the treatment
      modalities and outcomes of bleeding episodes, surgery and prophylaxis in patients with factor
      VII (FVII) deficiency in addition to evaluate the presence (in already treated patients)
      and/or the appearance of inhibiting antibodies to FVII and/or therapy-related thrombosis.

      Due to a Novo Nordisk commitment to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use
      (CHMP), Novo Nordisk receives data on treatment with activated recombinant human FVII
      (rFVIIa, NovoSevenÂ®) in patients with FVII deficiency from the Seven Treatment Evaluation
      Registry (STER, NCT01269138). These patients can also have been treated with other
      haemostatics for systemic administration.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent by the patient or next of kin or legally acceptable
             representative to collect data on treatment of a given bleeding episode, surgical
             event or prophylactic regimen as specified in the protocol. If informed consent is
             provided by the next of kin or legally acceptable representative, consent must also be
             obtained from the patient as soon as he/she is able to do so. Informed consent should
             preferentially be obtained before initiation of treatment or as a minimum before entry
             of data into the database

          -  Any patient with a FVII deficiency for whom treatment of bleeding episodes, prevention
             related to surgery and primary/secondary prophylaxis is considered necessary by the
             treating physician can be enrolled

          -  Patients with FVII deficiency without any immediate need for treatment will be entered
             as stand by registered patients with capture of baseline- and demographic data only.
             Admission data is entered once an event occurs
