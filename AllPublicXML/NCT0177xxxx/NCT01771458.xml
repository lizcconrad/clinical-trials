    <textblock>
      SHIVA is a proof of concept randomized phase II trial which compares two treatment strategies
      for patients with refractory cancer.

      From a tumor biopsy, a molecular profile of the disease is established (mutations,
      amplifications, hormone receptor status). If a molecular abnormality is identified for which
      an approved targeted agent is available, patients are randomized randomized between two arms:

        -  Targeted therapy based on the molecular profile

        -  Conventional therapy based on investigator's choice.

      A cross-over is proposed at disease progression.

             metastases), and bilirubin level &lt;1.5xUNL

          6. Adequate bone marrow function defined by platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dL,
             and neutrophils &gt;1,000/mm3
