    <textblock>
      First study to test the validity of the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which
      causes inflammation and fibrosis (scarring) of the lung tissue, with cotrimoxazole.

      Cotrimoxazole may improve the clinical course of the disease through eradication of
      Pneumocystis jiroveci colonization and other mechanisms as inhibiting the activation of
      alveolar macrophages and producing alterations in the surfactant system which favours the
      persistent activation of the inflammatory response and the development of pulmonary fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease that is clinically manifested
      by the appearance of effort dyspnea and impaired lung function.

      The natural history of the disease is poorly understood and there is no clear consensus as to
      the most appropriate markers for predicting patient outcome.

      This pilot controlled trial aims to test the efficacy and safety of cotrimoxazole in the
      treatment of IPF. This novel therapeutic strategy, with very encouraging preliminary data is
      based on its pathophysiological basis, primarily related to the elimination of Pneumocystis
      colonization. That elimination, could serve as a potent weapon for reducing morbidity and
      mortality and the cost associated with this devastating disease.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient, regardless of gender, aged 18 to 80 years.

             ATA/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011.

          -  Ability to obtain a sample of sputum or oropharyngeal washing.

          -  Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) above 50% from the theoretical value expected.

          -  Patient compliance or legal guardian to participate in this study by signing the
             informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             disease any disease or condition that, in the investigator's opinion, may jeopardize
             the patient's health participating in the study or influence the results of the study
             or the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          -  Pregnant or lactating or of childbearing potential not using medically approved
             contraceptive methods at least three months before or during trial.

          -  Participation in another trial with an investigational drug within 30 days or six
