      A follow-up study to assess resistance and durability of response to 3 experimental drugs
      ABT-450/r, ABT-267, and ABT-333 in participants who have participated in AbbVie Phase 2 or 3
      clinical studies with these agents for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV).
      Studies include: M11-646 (NCT01716585), M11-652 (NCT01464827), M12-746 (NCT01306617), M12-998

    <description>Relapse is defined as a confirmed HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) ≥ the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) at any time during the post-treatment period for a participant who had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment. Relapse12overall is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at any time after the sustained virologic response at Week 12 post-dosing (SVR12) assessment time point for a participant who achieved SVR12 and had post-SVR12 HCV RNA data available. SVR12 is defined as HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ in the SVR12 window (12 weeks after the last actual dose of study drug) without any confirmed quantifiable (≥ LLOQ) post-treatment value before or during that SVR window. New HCV infection is defined as re-infection with a different HCV isolate.</description>

    <description>The persistence of specific hepatitis C amino acid variants (treatment-emergent substitutions) associated with drug resistance in NS3, NS5A, or NS5B was evaluated in participants who had not achieved SVR12.

    <description>Relapse is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at any time during the post-treatment period for a participant who had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment. Relapse12 is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ between end of treatment and 12 weeks after last actual dose of study drug (up to and including the SVR12 assessment time point) for a participant with HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at Final Treatment Visit who completed treatment.</description>

    <description>Relapse is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ at any time during the post-treatment period for a participant who had HCV RNA &lt; LLOQ at the end of treatment. Relapse24 is defined as a confirmed HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ within the sustained virologic response at Week 24 post-dosing (SVR24) window for a participant who achieved SVR12 and had HCV RNA data available in the SVR24 window.</description>
