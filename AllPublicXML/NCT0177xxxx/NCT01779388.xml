  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to CT screening, a lot of peripheral nodule not accessible to conventional endoscopy will
      be found. Electromagnetic navigation directed bronchoscopy (ENB) is a new technique needing
      validation. the primary aim of the study is to compare ENB to radiologically guided
      bronchoscopy, considered the standard comparator.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence on a conventional or low dose chest CT at least one lung nodule 5-20 mm in
             its largest axis, of indeterminate nature; the nodule must be positive at PET-CT
             examination (in case of PET-CT negative, only follow-up is proposed)

          -  The pulmonary nodule(s) must be known for less than 6 months

          -  The nodule appearance can be solid, presents as a ground glass opacity with solid
             component or as pure ground glass opacity

          -  Availability for participating in the detailed follow-up of the protocol

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Age &gt; 18 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Nodules found in the context of an active infection or for whom, the clinical context
             and/or additional available investigations (serology, microbiological samplings,
             immune abnormalities) show that cancer diagnosis is unlikely

          -  Nodules found in the context of an active previously documented disease that can be
             associated with pulmonary nodules (anthracosilicosis, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis,
             autoimmune or rheumatoid diseases …)

          -  Calcified nodule

          -  Anticoagulation therapy of any type that cannot be suspended for the duration of the
             investigation

          -  Respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction (less than 3 months prior to the
             date of lung nodule screening), uncontrolled angina pectoris, congestive cardiac
             failure, cardiac arrhythmia, uncontrolled infectious disease or any other physical,
             biological or psychological factor which may prevent adherence to the study protocol
             or which may impair the patient's tolerance to the endoscopy and/or the general
             anaesthesia

          -  Presence of a implanted cardiac device (pace-maker, defibrillator, …)

          -  Pregnant women
