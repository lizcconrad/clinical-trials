      Efficacy and safety of Euminz® (10% ethanolic solution of peppermint oil for topical use)
      compared to placebo in patients with episodic tension-type headache (ETTH).

      Prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IV clinical trial; Parallel-groups
      design; Randomisation 1:1; First attack per patient will be evaluated for primary objectives,
      following attacks during study duration will be observed and documented.

      Study duration per patient: 10 weeks

      To demonstrate the efficacy of Euminz® to reduce the intensity of headache symptoms
      experienced by patients with episodic tension-type headache. The two primary objectives will
      be tested hierarchically (a-priory ordered) to avoid alpha-adjustment:

      First primary objective of the first headache episode is &quot;pain-free&quot; (0 or 1) after 2 hours
      measured on a six-step verbal pain rating scale (VPRS). Acute treatment (3 to 5 time topical
      use of Euminz®) will start immediately after assessment of a baseline pain intensity of at
      least moderate pain (3 on VPRS).

      Second primary objective of the first headache episode will be the decrease of intensity of
      pain measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). The difference from measure point 0 (before
      first application of Euminz®) on the VAS in comparison to 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes
      after start of treatment will be shown as area under the curve representing the pain
      intensity difference (PID).
