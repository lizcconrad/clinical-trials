  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      E5501 (5 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg) will be administered to healthy male adults in a
      single-center, randomized, open-label, cross-over manner. This study will consist of 2 phases
      including pre-randomization (before drug administration) and postrandomization (after drug
      administration).

    <description>The post-randomization phase consists of the Treatment Period 1 (Visits 2-8): participants received one 5 mg tablet under fed conditions on treatment morning for 28 days. Treatment Period II (visits 9-15): 20 mg (four 5 mg tablets) under fed conditions on treatment morning for 28 days. Treatment Period III (visits 16-22): 40 mg (eight 5 mg tablets) under fed conditions on treatment morning for 28 days.
Treatment Period IV (visits 23-29): 5 mg tablet on treatment morning under fasted conditions for 28 days.
The washout period of 27 days or longer was set between the administration of the study drug in Treatment Periods 1, 2 and 3 and that in Treatment Periods 2, 3 and 4 respectively.</description>
