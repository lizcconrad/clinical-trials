      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily alternating
      thalidomide and lenalidomide plus rituximab (ThRiL) in patients with previously treated
      Waldenstrom macroglobulunemia (WM). Thalidomide and lenalidomide are drugs that modulate the
      immune system and have been shown to bring about responses in subjects with WM. However,
      their use has been limited due to side effects. The investigators hypothesize that
      alternating doses of thalidomide and lenalidomide may alleviate the side effects while
      preserving the effectiveness of the therapies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) is an incurable B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder
      characterized by expansion of malignant B-lymphocytes and excessive production of monoclonal
      IgM. The survival and proliferation of the neoplastic WM cells is highly dependent on signals
      from the microenvironment. Thalidomide and lenalidomide are immunomodulatory agents with
      single agent activity in WM. Their use is limited by significant toxicities, including tumor
      flare (thalidomide and lenalidomide); sedation, constipation, and neuropathy (thalidomide);
      and cytopenias (lenalidomide). Alternating doses of thalidomide and lenalidomide may
      alleviate the toxicities, while preserving efficacy since the agents have non-overlapping
      toxicities and yet similar hypothesized mechanisms of action. Additionally, starting at a
      lower dose of lenalidomide than previously studied in WM may allow for improved tolerability.
      A pilot study of daily alternating therapy in subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      demonstrated that the two agents could be combined with non-overlapping toxicity. This phase
      II study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily alternating thalidomide and
      lenalidomide plus rituximab (ThRiL) in subjects with previously treated WM.

      Subjects will receive thalidomide 50 mg every other day (i.e., every odd day: days 1, 3, 5,
      7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 &amp; 27 of a 28 day cycle) alternating with lenalidomide on
      every other day (i.e., every even day: days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26 &amp;
      28 of a 28 day cycle), dosed based upon stepwise incremental dosing. Rituximab 375 mg/m2 will
      be administered on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 starting with Cycle 1 and then again on the same
      weekly x 4 schedule every 6th cycle thereafter (Cycles 7, 13, 19, etc).
