      This randomized phase II trial studies how well intravenous (IV) chemotherapy or oral
      chemotherapy works in treating patients with previously untreated stage III-IV human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy,
      such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone,
      lomustine, etoposide, and procarbazine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill more cancer cells

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the efficacy of standard cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      vincristine sulfate, and prednisone (CHOP) and an oral chemotherapy regimen for acquired
      immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related (AR)-non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in sub-Saharan
      Africa with respect to overall survival (OS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the objectives response rate (ORR) of persons randomized to CHOP and oral
      chemotherapy.

      II. To compare the progression free survival (PFS) of persons randomized to CHOP and oral
      chemotherapy.

      III. To compare the safety and tolerance of persons randomized to CHOP and oral chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the rates of completion of therapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral
      chemotherapy.

      II. To describe adherence to chemotherapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral
      chemotherapy.

      III. To describe adherence to antiretroviral therapy of persons randomized to CHOP and oral
      chemotherapy.

      IV. To describe the effects of therapy on HIV control, as measured by cluster of
      differentiation (CD)4 counts and HIV viral load.

      V. To investigate correlates of survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on
      day 1, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV on day 1, vincristine sulfate IV on day 1, and prednisone
      orally (PO) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive lomustine PO once daily (QD) on day 1 (courses 1 and 3 only),
      etoposide PO QD on days 1-3, cyclophosphamide PO QD on days 22-26, and procarbazine
      hydrochloride PO QD on days 22-26. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 3 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.

          -  Total bilirubin =&lt; 1.5 institutional upper limit of normal (ULN), unless elevated
             secondary to lymphomatous involvement of liver or biliary system, or due to other HIV
             medications (e.g., indinavir, tenofovir, or atazanavir); if secondary to lymphomatous
             involvement, an initial upper limit of total bilirubin 5 mg/dL (85.5 uM/L) should be

             antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen is available that includes at least two ART drugs
             that, in the opinion of the site investigator, are expected to have activity based on
             genotypic testing (if available) and treatment history; patients are not allowed to
             receive zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]) as part of concurrent chemotherapy and ART

             drug treatment provided the clinical status is judged to be stable and survival is
             estimated to be at least 6 weeks
