  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The success of the POEM procedure is measured by improved symptoms as compared to pre-op, including the ability to swallow with low incidence of GERD and significantly reduced resting LES pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Within the first 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Will assess the outcomes and efficacy of the endoscopic procedure, Per-oral Endoscopic Esophagomyotomy(POEM)in the treatment of achalasia. The patient will be assessed for improvement of their swallowing as assessed on the repeat time barium swallow and increase oral intake without nausea and vomiting.</description>

    <description>An endoscopic surgical procedure for achalasia; Per-oral Endoscopic Esophagomyotomy (POEM)will be performed. The POEM procedure will be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia and a scope will then be inserted into your mouth and down your throat and measurements will be taken. With the use of this lighted flexible scope the surgeon will make a small incision in the inner lining of your esophagus (throat), create a tunnel and then cut the muscle between the esophagus (throat) and the stomach. The initial little opening will be closed with a small clip. This procedure will allow easier passage of food into the stomach.</description>
